Hold on, man.<eos> Prisons don't censor with x-acto knives.<eos> "East, wall, cellar, noon, Monday."<eos> Now that's a poem I can understand.<eos> All right.<eos> Present from a piano teacher to young Ludwig...<eos> "a clock of most exquisite decor." Well, wait.<eos> Our clock doesn't have a bust.<eos> - Uh-huh, yeah.<eos> So that's why we couldn't neutralize it.
- Yes. No, I know. It's lovely.<eos> Well, now, I don't know if they told you last time, Philomena, but most of our records were destroyed in the big fire.<eos> - Oh?<eos> - Fire? Well, it was before my time.<eos> So I'm afraid I have no news of Anthony.<eos> I still go to Mass and I don't want to cause any fuss or point the finger at anybody, or blame the Church in any way.<eos> I only want to know if he's all right.<eos> I don't even need to see him.<eos> I have visions of him and he's homeless and nobody loves him.<eos> Philomena, we can't take away your pain, but we can walk through it with you, hand in hand.
Where you can change your flight if you change your plans?<eos> Yes, but...<eos> Supposing we didn't get on the aeroplane tonight?<eos> Because I've been sitting here waiting for a sign, and I haven't had one.<eos> And so I've made the decision myself and I'd like to stay a little longer.<eos> Well, if that's what you want to do?<eos> It is.<eos> I'd like to talk to someone who actually met him.<eos> All right, then we'll stay.<eos> I've been sent a picture of Anthony, if you want to see it. Oh.
Hey, both hands on the wheel.<eos> I can't see his hands, Coop.<eos> Keep your hands on the wheel.<eos> Hey! I said put your hand up!<eos> Put both hands on the wheel and keep them there!<eos> Do you hear me? ! Do you hear me?<eos> !<eos> I hear you!<eos> Great!<eos> Take your right hand, place it outside the window, and open the door -- slowly.
Hmm, yeah, but that feeling -- when I found out who I had and that he was wanted in Arizona, what he was wanted for...<eos> [ Chuckles ] That moment, that's when I knew I wanted to be a homicide detective.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Been chasing it ever since.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are you guys the police?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know if I'm in the right place.<eos> But I found this thing, and I'm pretty sure I should hand it over to you guys.
"Not only am I concerned for my safety, but the safety of our son and the citizens of Los Angeles."<eos> I got physical because I was attacked.<eos> In the moment, I relied on my training, followed protocol, and subdued Tammi with minimal, yet... necessary force.<eos> Did you or did you not choke Ms. Bryant and throw her head against a generator?<eos> I-I did not.<eos> Her boyfriend, Victor Sifuentes, is claiming there's a video of the incident, which shows you, in uniform, losing control.<eos> Says you seized his camcorder before departing.<eos> Is that true?<eos> No, I did not lose control.<eos> Mr. Sifuentes shoved a camera in my face, and, feeling threatened, I took it away from him.
Who found him?<eos> Ah, well, a jogger did.<eos> Looks like he was strangled.<eos> Did you do a work-up?<eos> Uh, no work-up.<eos> But I spoke to some of the other transients around here.<eos> No one's seen anything.<eos> How about I.D.?<eos> No wallet, but found this card lying right next to him.<eos> He was probably holding it in his hand.
I saw you take the camcorder.<eos> I saw you.<eos> Why the hell didn't you say anything?<eos> Whose side do you think I'm on?<eos> You're my partner.<eos> I got your back.<eos> There's a tape. So what?<eos> Get rid of it.<eos> Smash it with a -- smash it with a hammer.<eos> Yeah, I've been meaning to, except for I can't stop myself from watching it.
Come on, man!<eos> Get him through.<eos> Go. Come on. Go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Get up.<eos> Do I have a choice?<eos> Get up.<eos> Give him the shovel, man.<eos> You're gonna help us dig a hole.<eos> Now pick it up and dig.
Terry... I'm okay, all right?<eos> You know me.<eos> Just get me back out there.<eos> It's above my pay grade, John.<eos> You got them to sign off on you.<eos> I had a partner get killed.<eos> You had a son.<eos> A son, Terry, and somehow, you're not chained to your desk, and your holster's not empty.<eos> My situation is my situation.<eos> How I handled it is my business.
Plus, he did not flinch when they asked him about the green-and-red Civic.<eos> Oh, and I got the gang detectives running, uh, Chris through their system, every spelling, even with a "Q."<eos> I wouldn't put it past these fools.<eos> If, um, anything jumps out at them and they can't reach me while I'm in the air,<eos> I told them to give you a call.<eos> No worries.<eos> I got you.<eos> Keep a hard-on for that car.<eos> Yeah. You know what?<eos> I'm gonna find it, all right?
Oh, that is a nice suit.<eos> Are you a weather girl?<eos> I'm a lawyer.<eos> - Ooh. - A girl lawyer?<eos> Wow! That sounds like a TV show.<eos> We gotta shake up this case.<eos> Bring in girl lawyer.<eos> Yeah, baby! It's like "Matlock" with knockers.<eos> Hey. So we really love this house.<eos> Do you know who's selling it?
Tatyana, this is Megan.<eos> Megan, Tatyana.<eos> Hello. It's nice to meet you.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Tommy.<eos> Uh, we were hoping we could talk.<eos> With pleasure.<eos> Does this girl look familiar to you?<eos> I've never seen this girl, but this mark I have seen.<eos> I hope I never see it again.
What am I gonna do?<eos> Okay, I'm flattered that I'm your go-to guy for off-the-book advice, but do you realize you completely screwed us on a key piece of evidence?<eos> So much for a sympathetic ear.<eos> Megan, she went to the guy's room, took the shirt without a warrant.<eos> It's completely inadmissible.<eos> So she wasn't thinking clearly.<eos> Her job is to think clearly.<eos> Look, she should've come to us first.<eos> This is a piece of evidence we could've nailed this guy with, and now it's off the table.<eos> What if I just put it back?
You sad, silly girl.<eos> Your friends don't even know you're...<eos> Oh, and I left some not-so-friendlys outside.<eos> I've got a surprise for you...<eos> What is that smell?<eos> It smells like dirt or clay.<eos> Or coconut!<eos> Your favourite!<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> I'll leave it here for later.
Hey! Hurry up, I said!<eos> Jacket!<eos> Now!<eos> These are probably professional kidnappers.<eos> Knowing the level of Maxim's security, they'll expect a chip, too.<eos> They'll get rid of every shred of clothing, down to his skin.<eos> Then glasses, jewellery, piercings, prosthetics...<eos> Anything removable that could hide a device.<eos> Finally, when he's completely stripped, they'll scan him to check for any electronics.<eos> And they're going to find it.
Just... Smells of sort of murder-suicide, doesn't it?<eos> It does.<eos> But you're gonna have to drag little miss fortune teller over there to the gun, you have shown a lot of determination in the past.<eos> In fact...<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Little Anika, she told me about another one of your issues.<eos> Now, this could be stronger than you're used to, but maybe not.<eos> Either way, it's going to help take the edge off what you gotta do.<eos> You know, I thought about just killing you, but I kind of did that already, in New York, didn't I?<eos> I mean, what could be worse than leaving you to live your life the way you're living it now?
Why don't you start with Waymond?<eos> He looks a little stuffy.<eos> Come on, Bill.<eos> Put the gun down, Bill.<eos> Montez, save a life.<eos> Eat a booger.<eos> I'm sorry, Waymond.<eos> I can't... ugh.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, God, he's eating it.
Out the door and to the right.<eos> What?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> The hand looks like it's pointing left to me.<eos> Psst! Over here.<eos> Huh?<eos> Look over here.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Sure, if you hold it that way.
Here, give me your hand.<eos> What the... How can I ever repay you?<eos> Seal me in.<eos> Okay, here goes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> Don't tape it!<eos> I won't be able to get out!<eos> Just close the flaps and put that box on top.<eos> It'll keep it shut.
Also, I'm sick of that tune.<eos> It's gonna be hard to trick Artie.<eos> Please, I always got the lead at the psychodramas at the institution.<eos> Action.<eos> I'm telling you, it's a ping.<eos> And I'm telling you, it's a burglary.<eos> Classic cars are vanishing from locked garages without a trace.<eos> ♪ Burglary<eos> This one guy had a '52 Desoto on display in his living room like a trophy.<eos> Now, a burglar would have had to take it apart piece by piece to get it out.
I don't want Janet catching Anastasia in any sort of trouble.<eos> Imagine if she started smoking my cuban cigars!<eos> You have cubans?<eos> In my desk drawer.<eos> Now when you get to the condo, count how many I have.<eos> Make sure Ana doesn't touch any.<eos> How many do you think you have?<eos> Half a dozen?<eos> I promise that's how many you'll have when you get home.<eos> Oh, can you re-hide the key to the liquor cabinet, I think Ana may have seen Janet put it under the purple vase.
Yeah, yeah, the crack almonds.<eos> The crack almonds.<eos> And, well, then I got some heirloom tomatoes.<eos> Last of the season, you know?<eos> Super plump and ripe.<eos> Engorged almost.<eos> With some wet, juicy buffalo mozzarella.<eos> And some sweet, sweet-ass organic blueberries.<eos> My cock is hard.<eos> And I'm rubbing it against your ass.
-Bummer.<eos> You gotta try edging, man.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's where you jerk off, okay?<eos> Right to the point of orgasm and then stop.<eos> And you do this because...<eos> Because your jizz is your power, man.<eos> It's spiritual, it keeps your Chi inside.<eos> Especially if you got writer's block.<eos> You gotta walk right up to that line, bro, and not cross it.
(Mike) Evan moved all 75 keys.<eos> - Sink it.<eos> - What?<eos> Now!<eos> I found Schiller's cocaine.<eos> Are you kidding me? (Claps hands)<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Don't tell him.<eos> He'll sell it to line his own pockets.
I found Schiller's cocaine.<eos> Are you kidding me? (Claps hands)<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Don't tell him.<eos> He'll sell it to line his own pockets.<eos> Yeah, damn right.<eos> My pockets, Marta's pockets,<eos> - but not yours, dad, no.<eos> - I could give it back to Schiller.
Cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines.<eos> He's clean.<eos> Good.<eos> This is very good.<eos> The samples were collected here?<eos> No, he brought it in.<eos> I want you to bring him back.<eos> You want him to do the test again?<eos> No, this time I want a blood draw.<eos> And be sure you do it yourself.
You did a deal for me?<eos> Don't flatter yourself.<eos> And you think this copper will keep his word.<eos> If he does, you're safe.<eos> If he doesn't, Chapman will give you up, you'll still have to leave town.<eos> Same result.<eos> So neat(!<eos> ) So leave.<eos> Except there's one thing that you got wrong.<eos> Stanly won't be able to give up my address because he doesn't know it.
Been stuck in that little basement for weeks.<eos> What do we expect?<eos> She's going off like a firecracker.<eos> Oh, Christ, Tommy, please...<eos> Enough now.<eos> Come on. Enough.<eos> All right, Ada, come on, have a rest, sit down.<eos> Come and look, Esme.<eos> Come and look at the family you've joined.<eos> Come and look at the man who runs it.
Also, uh, Joss is throwing an impromptu party tomorrow, and I want you to come and officially meet my friends.<eos> - And you'll get to meet Janet, too.<eos> - Who's Janet?<eos> Savi and Joss' mom.<eos> She's great.<eos> Lucy thinks she hung the moon.<eos> Oh, and you should bring Madi with you.<eos> Are you trying to prove something here, April?<eos> I know I broke your trust.<eos> I want to earn it back.
'Who has been there for you?<eos> ' 'One man who has made it his mission' 'to improve the lives of people around him.'<eos> 'He has remodeled our buildings.'<eos> 'Helped keep our banks free of unnecessary clutter.'<eos> 'You have always shown your appreciation.'<eos> 'What you need? We'll do anything for you.'<eos> 'And why stop now?<eos> A standing ovation!<eos> Did not expect that.<eos> But I'll take it. And also, everything else.
Are we going upstairs?<eos> I'd love to see the rest of the place.<eos> Going down.<eos> We don't have a lot of time.<eos> Jump!<eos> Let him go, we have to find the vault.<eos> You're right.<eos> It's time to serve desert.<eos> Where does he keep the kryptonite?<eos> I just know he has it. Not where he hides it.
- Why?<eos> To see how he was.<eos> They took him out of ICU. But you need to stay calm.<eos> - Is that your daughter?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Damn Giampiero, I told you I'm in a jam.<eos> I don't have that money now anyway.<eos> I have bigger issues right now.<eos> You want to take my house?<eos> Take it then and fuck off!
Oh.<eos> This card?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She cried like a baby.<eos> "We're so proud of you."<eos> When did she get this?<eos> Three days ago.<eos> The day before she died.<eos> After she got the card, she started writing this letter in Spanish, but then she got frustrated and ripped it up.<eos> And then you promptly dug it out of the trash, didn't you?
Mr. Jane, thank you.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Oh.<eos> Much appreciated.<eos> It's my pleas--<eos> Um, alth--I-I was just heading--<eos> I'll leave you to it.<eos> I have something for you.<eos> Your necklace.<eos> Charlie was trying to get it back for you.
The sun's up?<eos> Has been for a while.<eos> - Oh, fuck.<eos> What time is it?<eos> - 7:15.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I have an interview in half an hour.<eos> - Skip it.<eos> - I can't.<eos> I gotta do it.
The remarks.<eos> - I wish to go first.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Of course.<eos> If you need to speak to me, I understand.<eos> Thank you for rescuing me.<eos> - From your admirers?<eos> - You look wonderful.<eos> I don't know if you remember, but I have her ring.<eos> I don't know if you want it back.
Sandy.<eos> Hey, anybody seen Sandy?<eos> Do you know how to make goulash?<eos> 'Cause I've got pork butt, two onions, and lentils which I think is what's in it.<eos> Hey, Moon, turn around.<eos> And paprika.<eos> I know that's in it.<eos> Well, for one thing, you'll need a pot.<eos> We got a pot.<eos> You'll have to wash it out.
It's a little beyond her means.<eos> Oh, interest rates are low.<eos> There are some attractive leases out there.<eos> Could be a stolen car wish list.<eos> Something under the gas pedal.<eos> It's all over the floor mat.<eos> Looks like a USB thumb drive.<eos> A very dead USB thumb drive.<eos> Bag that for Eric.<eos> Let's hope the boy wonder can bring it back to life.
Go ahead.<eos> Sketches of Spain.<eos> Vintage Miles.<eos> With Gil Evans.<eos> My mom's.<eos> She has good taste.<eos> I know that song.<eos> ♪ I can't give you anything but love ♪<eos> ♪ Baby<eos> She used to sing it to me when I was little for a lully.
Real fucking tough.<eos> Fucking cheese dicks.<eos> Enjoy your fucking game.<eos> See ya. Fuck you, mama boy.<eos> Hey, ladies, I wanna apologize for my bad language back there.<eos> How's the smoking?<eos> Fucking fine.<eos> Mmm. Can I try some of that fucking fine cigarette?<eos> That is fucking fine.<eos> You want it back?
She ain't got no coat, no shoes, no money.<eos> Then what?<eos> Just take care of it.<eos> Make sure people stay quiet here.<eos> That on you.<eos> Sweetback.<eos> Sweetback.<eos> The hell you leave the door open for?<eos> Letting all the cold in.<eos> - Don't slam it.

Why don't you get out of here, get some air.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've decided.<eos> The President has decided to go to his ranch in Nevada.<eos> He's taking a vacation?<eos> He is stepping outside of the bubble to focus on this major decision.<eos> So it is a vacation.<eos> Marshall:<eos> You know what, darling.<eos> This appointment is of monumental importance, and the President takes it very, very seriously.
Surgery is not an option.<eos> It's ridiculous I can't take four hours off at night when I need to?<eos> I can't hire you an additional attending.<eos> My budget's in the red this quarter.<eos> I work every day.<eos> I'm the only neurosurgeon on call at night.<eos> I'd take it up with the chief of my department, but, you know, he's the reason it's happening.<eos> You're coming up for a performance evaluation next month, and this is what I can do.<eos> I can see that you get the highest raise I'm authorized to allow.<eos> Well, you've certainly earned it.
Perry, right, proper chippy.<eos> He can't get any work cos the Poles'll build you a frigging house for the price of a cup of tea.<eos> Ain't worth his while getting out of bed.<eos> Artan's Albanian.<eos> You know what I'm taking about.<eos> I'm talking about the destruction of England.<eos> What did he get you?<eos> That ain't an engagement ring?<eos> Don't worry, you two have put me off marriage for life.<eos> Yeah, don't let your gob run away or I'll shut it for you!
Get your glad rags on, lady...<eos> London Town, here we come.<eos> You don't want me coming back with you.<eos> I just said I do.<eos> Yeah, but you don't, so...<eos> I wouldn't bullshit you.<eos> Dawes!<eos> How you getting on with your letter home?<eos> I'm about to go see them.<eos> Write it!
And turn people against the revolution.<eos> So what will you do?<eos> Well, I am going to keep exposing them.<eos> And they'll keep exposing themselves.<eos> Until<eos> The corrupt media falls.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Start a television station?<eos> Yes, hopefully I will.<eos> Well you'll have to put it in Cyprus or else they will destroy it.
Have fun.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Uh, how are you?<eos> Is that why you called?<eos> N-no.<eos> The, um, shower's doing that-- that plinking thing again.<eos> Well, did you tighten the handle?<eos> Uh, I did, yeah, but I don't know.<eos> I might not be strong enough.<eos> Are you asking me to fix it?
I think it's you that needs help.<eos> Really?<eos> How might that be?<eos> I'm Keith Summers.<eos> Summers!<eos> This is my family's property.<eos> My great-great-grandfather built this house in 1912, and my grandfather built that motel in the '50s.<eos> And that's my grandmother's rug!<eos> This property has been in my family for over a century.<eos> I'm sure it was very hard for you to lose it to the bank, and I'm very sorry, but, uh... well, it is ours now.
This was just an elaborate ruse to try to get me back because you're still in love with me?<eos> (Dalia) No.<eos> He just doesn't want daddy Altman to have you. A... and he wants to stay in your guest house, because his credit is iffy. (Chuckles)<eos> It is not my fault.<eos> I was living with this chick that I met at burning man. She was on ecstasy, and she got a hold of my P.I.N. number. Nobody cares, Yoni.<eos> It's time for you to go.<eos> Can I at least borrow 5 bucks for cigarettes?<eos> - No!<eos> - No.<eos> (Yakult barking) Come on, Yakult. Let's go play that game daddy Altman invented where I throw a ball and you bring it back. What's it called?

This isn't about you. This is about your creditors.<eos> - Yes, Your Honor.<eos> - "Ma'am." I'm not a judge.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> Our creditors are voting with their pocketbook by buying up our debt.<eos> - They are?<eos> - Yes. We recently got in touch with our creditors about this mediation, and they informed us that they no longer are our creditors.<eos> A consortium of financiers called Encinal Equity has purchased their debt.<eos> And people don't buy bad debt.<eos> Yes, but by that logic, your creditors are fleeing your debt by selling it.
Brother Sing!<eos> Please look out for us.<eos> Take good care of Brother Sing for me!<eos> Hi, Brother Sing! It's warm in here, take off your cap.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Cheers!<eos> Take it off!<eos> He's bald!<eos> He looks funny!<eos> Please give it back.
I remember this place.<eos> My father's church.<eos> My mother died in childbirth.<eos> My father always kept me so close.<eos> I can't remember a time I wasn't in his arms or by his side.<eos> He used to bring me here.<eos> I was just a toddler, but I remember.<eos> This church felt like a dream.<eos> Real, but not real.<eos> I knew it existed, but... but I could never find it.
- Oh... kidding.<eos> - Right.<eos> Kidding.<eos> - Don't stop. - Oh!<eos> Popcorn fight!<eos> It almost went down my throat.<eos> I'll get some water.<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah, just...<eos> And Tony had another opportunity to get at Gob's phone.<eos> And chose not to take it.
- Thank you.<eos> But the queen?<eos> She has to stay.<eos> Sam is right.<eos> People are dying.<eos> That can't happen on my watch.<eos> And you know what?<eos> I am tired of running.<eos> I like my life here.<eos> I'm gonna stay and fight for it.
Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Hey, I want...<eos> I want to be your friend.<eos> Hey.<eos> We are friends, right?<eos> I need to be super-careful about my image right now.<eos> I can't have anybody mess it up.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> I know that somebody leaked this video to you, but I'm begging you, please don't release it to your gossip blog.
[Indistinct chatter]<eos> I want those keys removed from the girl and implanted in one of our soldiers.<eos> - That may be difficult.<eos> - Why?<eos> You said both keys were inside her.<eos> We can't find them.<eos> What?<eos> They seem to have been completely absorbed into her cells.<eos> If you're playing us,<eos> I will scalp that golf ball head of yours and wear it for a hat.
Maybe she killed Markussen to silence him.<eos> If she killed him, why is the card still missing?<eos> Ok, well, your read of the widow, Paula...<eos> She overheard Nick on the phone demanding money for the return of something that he stole.<eos> So the wife killed Nick in order to take over the blackmail herself?<eos> She's still a suspect, but our search didn't turn up the SD card.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You remember how Toby said that Nick was a hider, right?<eos> So we went to the storage locker, we looked at all the items, we even looked inside the items to see if we could find it... maybe he'd hid it.
Possession of stolen property.<eos> We can start there.<eos> I found the watch.<eos> I had no idea it was stolen.<eos> Yeah, you found the watch in Nick Markussen's office.<eos> And when we asked you if you knew anything about stolen goods he might have had, you said no.<eos> He disappeared and left me doing double duty for weeks, ok?<eos> I figured he owed me a watch.<eos> You want the watch back?<eos> Take it.
Of course he's right.<eos> A nice diamond ring gives you something pretty to focus on when your fat, sweaty husband's wheezing on top of you like a dying walrus.<eos> Whoo!<eos> (chuckling)<eos> That never gets old.<eos> (snorts) I was telling Jimmy how hard I worked for your...<eos> Hey, where's your engagement ring?<eos> Oh, I always take it off when I wash the dishes.<eos> It's probably by the sink.<eos> You're gonna go get it, right?

Now, you know I can't tell you that.<eos> You may think I'm a son... of a bitch, but there's no way you can jimmy the information out of me.<eos> You see where I'm going with this?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm not dumb.<eos> You're not gonna help me.<eos> (sighs)<eos> VIRGINIA:<eos> I wouldn't risk someone else buying that ring.<eos> I had to do whatever it took to get it back.
I think I'm gonna go into the bathroom, say good-bye to them one more time.<eos> You know, wish them a safe trip in case I don't see them for a while.<eos> Godspeed, Heckle and Schmekel.<eos> Jimmy...<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> I want you to give my ring to Sabrina.<eos> Well, you can't do that.<eos> It's your ring.<eos> So, now it'll be a family ring.<eos> I want to pass it down to you.

"To tidy things up."<eos> You were the District Attorney.<eos> You didn't go after him.<eos> That.<eos> Oh, and also there was a crucial piece of evidence that was never found.<eos> What murder weapon?<eos> What murder weapon?<eos> How many times have we had this conversation?<eos> You've never said a word!<eos> He was supposed to destroy it.
Majid, you have to do something for me.<eos> You have to get something from my place.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's in a small silver tin in my desk.<eos> What's that all about?<eos> - About the house.<eos> Which house?<eos> - Our house in Morocco.<eos> What about it?<eos> - They want to sell it.
Where were you?<eos> Where?<eos> Ad-ad-admittedly, the, the subduing of the untreated PDS sufferers in the cities...<eos> A rotter's a rotter, mate.<eos> Tell it like it is.<eos> Took more time and manpower than we had expected.<eos> So you got it wrong!<eos> There were over 140,000 risen dead so, if I may I express my gratitude to the people of Roarton, er, for creating the very first Human Volunteer Force platoon and inspiring many other rural communities to do the same, er, and...<eos> We appreciate the platitudes, Minister.<eos> But the question remains - why put the people back in our community that wanted to destroy it in the first place?
It's all right, love, I won't bite.<eos> OK, now...<eos> Sue, Steve, come round here, and I'll show you how to administer the medicine.<eos> OK?<eos> Now, let's have a look.<eos> Right, see that hole there?<eos> Yeah. OK. Right in the middle between the first and second vertebrae?<eos> That's where the syringe goes.<eos> Oh, no - like that, that way.<eos> OK, so just pop it in the hole, like that.
Oh, God.<eos> Really?<eos> (sighs)<eos> Whoo... whoo.<eos> (gasps) Ladies and gentlemen, feast your eyes upon this historic portrait of George Wa... shington.<eos> Even better, feast your hands.<eos> Really get on up in here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Grope that ancient paint.<eos> Grope it.
I just feel bad for hank. I broke his heart.<eos> Laila galliston broke his heart.<eos> You were doing what you had to do...<eos> In service.<eos> Well, it's over now. We have the clocks.<eos> The cross is safe, right?<eos> What is it?<eos> The elders have spoken.<eos> They've decided it's time to complete the chain.<eos> Follow the clocks to the cross And move it.
You know what?<eos> You treat everybody here better than me.<eos> Even those witch ladies.<eos> Also not true.<eos> No, it is true. You let...<eos> You take them for walks and you...<eos> As I would take you if your faith required communion with nature.<eos> I don't want to walk! Okay?<eos> I'm gonna hang this damn cross!<eos> 'Cause it's my religious freedom and you're violating it!
- Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah, please. Get in on this.<eos> Shut the (Bleep) Up.<eos> Uh... oh. - Ah. - Con?<eos> - That's good, man. - Yeah.<eos> - That's good. That's really good.<eos> - That's good.<eos> - A little hostile. It's a little hostile, but it's good.<eos> Guys, I wrote a song for Alex because I'm gonna miss her so much this weekend, so let me know what you think.<eos> Oh, you're just gonna... you're just gonna play it
Come on!<eos> We need to go back to motel.<eos> Policeman should have told us she was inside.<eos> - You didn't have to kill her.<eos> - She was out of control.<eos> Now, we need to get back to motel to count it.<eos> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 11,12,13, 14, 15,16,17,18, 19,20 bundles including the one you're holding.<eos> All hundreds.<eos> Not enough for what just happened.<eos> You take the cop's gun and you put it where no one will ever find it.

Madam Chancellor...<eos> Oh, please, call me Bianca.<eos> I mean, did we not meet in Bonn?<eos> We certainly did, Bianca.<eos> Photographer: Mr. President, may we have a photo, please.<eos> Ah, absolutely.<eos> Herr, if you don't mind, here.<eos> I'm needed in a situation.<eos> Of course, Mr. President.<eos> First lady and I will take it from here.
Why?<eos> Sensorial reenactment.<eos> Maybe he can retrace his steps last night, remember some details, so that we can find the real killer.<eos> Megan's right.<eos> There are legitimate studies to support that.<eos> Regardless, I can't condone his release.<eos> Now if Detective Sullivan wants to make bail, of course, he can do this on his own.<eos> He can't make bail.<eos> Bail is set at $2 million.<eos> Could... could you ask the D.A. to reduce it?
Well, we've known each other a few years. - I don't like you, Jay.<eos> - Huh? Nah.<eos> We can act like everything is fine for the family, but, you know, I have never liked you.<eos> The way you take whatever looks good to you-- you know, like my daughter or the last piece of meat.<eos> You're always too busy to pick me up at the airport.<eos> You send a total stranger with a cardboard sign.<eos> - Hi, grandma. - Hey.<eos> Hey, buddy. Get over here.<eos> I sure do love the cross you got me.<eos> But do I have to wear it today?
You're always too busy to pick me up at the airport.<eos> You send a total stranger with a cardboard sign.<eos> - Hi, grandma. - Hey.<eos> Hey, buddy. Get over here.<eos> I sure do love the cross you got me.<eos> But do I have to wear it today?<eos> It's kinda hard to close my shirt over it.<eos> You do whatever you want, padrecito.<eos> I know that's the way in this house.<eos> But if you wear it, ooh, you'll make me proud.
Just hang in there.<eos> Just stay with me, all right?<eos> Come on, Heather!<eos> Here, here, here. Great.<eos> That's great.<eos> Well done. Okay...<eos> Okay, this is the compress.<eos> Give me your hand. Give it here. What?<eos> !<eos> Put pressure on it, and hold down.
is one of them.<eos> 171-foot vertical entry.<eos> That's gonna be your final resting place.<eos> Well, hold on, now!<eos> We can talk about this.<eos> Now, keep in mind, there's another Marshal at the bottom of this mountain.<eos> Yeah, he long-hair or the short-hair?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We'll take care of him if he come up here.<eos> Not that U.S. currency has any value up here, but if you'd be inclined to take it, I'd be more than happy to provide it ...
Echo confirmed a tumor in the left atrium of her heart.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> As the tumor broke apart, you threw emboli, and one went to your brain.<eos> That's what caused the lesion.<eos> And subsequently, the seizures.<eos> Lifesaving catch, Dr. Shepherd.<eos> You're in good hands.<eos> Dr. Bennett's gonna get the tumor. You're gonna be up and running in no time.<eos> Gonna be a hell of a story to tell at auditions.<eos> Save it for Kimmel.
I think you're ready to graduate.<eos> I think you can do this on your own.<eos> Great.<eos> Great.<eos> (Bell dings) Hey! (Chuckles)<eos> Right on time as usual, huh?<eos> Mm, punctuality's important...<eos> - Especially now.<eos> - Especially now. (Laughs)<eos> I knew you were gonna make a joke, but I-I wanted to beat you to it.
Awful kindly of him.<eos> Saved my life.<eos> Gave me more time with my girls.<eos> Gave you more time with your brother.<eos> Can't put a price on that.<eos> Can't put a price on anything anymore.<eos> I found this in one of the cells.<eos> Lost more than the Good Book there for a while.<eos> Lost my way.<eos> "And if your right hand offends you, cut it off, cast it from you.
- Hey!<eos> - They're not helping anyway.<eos> Come on.<eos> We did it?<eos> We did it.<eos> Come on down.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Drop the weapon, son.<eos> Sure.<eos> Here, take it.
No.<eos> Should I be, Professor Carroll?<eos> Smell it?<eos> What am I doing here?<eos> I'd like to teach you.<eos> Now first I like to gauge their fear.<eos> Listen to their breathing.<eos> You want to get in sync with it... make their breathing become yours.<eos> It's a way to connect to their heartbeat.<eos> Now first take the very tip of the blade, and you place it softly on their skin.
Since the accident, um... well, sometimes I need a little space to clear my head.<eos> Well, whatever you came back with, you saved Birk's legs.<eos> Yeah, he'll probably still sue me.<eos> Well, he can call me to testify.<eos> Whatever you pulled off in there, it was...<eos> We pulled that off, Joel.<eos> It was a team effort.<eos> Yeah, I'm glad we're on the same team.<eos> The disease has made your spine brittle.<eos> We had to fuse it and put in rods.
- you were gonna show.<eos> - Really?<eos> Mm.<eos> I guess this means you've reconsidered my reputation.<eos> No. No, I just figured mine's so dodgy, you know, what the hell?<eos> Cool.<eos> Then we should be dodgy together.<eos> Wow.<eos> Your approach, it's... it's improving.<eos> Help me work on it.
Lilly, there is no easy way to say this.<eos> You're having a miscarriage.<eos> You're in a prison.<eos> You're single, so there are no conjugal visits.<eos> You gotta help me out here, Lilly.<eos> How did you get pregnant?<eos> He's none of your business.<eos> I'm not asking for a name.<eos> 'Cause you won't get one.<eos> The only thing that I have left is my word, and I ain't breaking it.
Remember that?<eos> A little bit.<eos> Oh, you're really gonna do it?<eos> Mm, so...<eos> What's it like joining one of the biggest rock 'n' roll bands in the world?<eos> Loud.<eos> ♪You got the wrong song♪<eos> ♪Coming<eos> ♪This one's about touring isn't gonna save your career, you know.<eos> It's gonna kill it.
And are you?<eos> How are you?<eos> I've been better.<eos> How are you?<eos> Yeah. Oh, yeah.<eos> How you doing?<eos> I'm all right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You left your strap at the house.<eos> Oh. He probably didn't have the guts to bring it by himself after I went off on him.
Previously on Grimm.<eos> The Captain is the one who woke Juliette up, okay?<eos> Which means he's the one who saved her life.<eos> Just saw the Captain looking through your desk drawer.<eos> The Captain took something that belongs to me.<eos> If they have no control over what's going on, if it's all about this spell, there's no reason to do anything crazy.<eos> I brought the key.<eos> Here.<eos> I'm giving it back to you.
They're not the ones choking on bread rolls.<eos> They'll just have to put up with extra duties.<eos> You know, Erica, when you first took over, you didn't have a lot of support from the officers, so if you start making all these changes when they're stretched enough as it is, you're going to lose their support altogether.<eos> What would you do?<eos> I wouldn't push the officers so hard just yet.<eos> Settle in first, don't give them a reason to give you grief.<eos> If the press get wind of conditions in those cells, it's a public relations nightmare.<eos> OK, but you also have to know the officers have your back.<eos> It's not the media you have to worry about.<eos> If you keep serving up this sort of slop, I'm going to have to keep spitting it in the bin.
Don't be nervous, Bea.<eos> You're the one holding the scissors.<eos> They think it takes a strong woman to rise to the top in here but it doesn't.<eos> It takes a smart one.<eos> One who chooses their moment.<eos> And understands the repercussions if they get it wrong.<eos> One well-chosen moment can take you straight to the top.<eos> And one mistake can finish you.<eos> You see, Bea, anger is a healthy emotion on the outside.<eos> In here, unless you can follow through, best to keep it to yourself.
You're late.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> This is the first and last time, Jacs.<eos> I won't do it again.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> Every time I ask.<eos> This job is my life.<eos> Which is why you're in this position, Vera.<eos> I don't want to do this.<eos> When you ask a favour, there's a good chance you'll have to repay it.
Just open it.<eos> Who's it from?<eos> Steven Rae.<eos> "Remarkable work, enthusiastic response... reward our fans... with something completely original.<eos> Absolute secrecy.<eos> A live scene."<eos> What?<eos> The final episode of the season... the cliffhanger.<eos> "We're gonna present an extra last scene online, only it's gonna be live.<eos> No one's gonna see any of the script until moments before we do it, not even the actors...
I'm sorry, Claire.<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> I care about your mum. Mm.<eos> And you. Mm.<eos> Be sure she drinks enough water.<eos> I feel tired, Claire.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Lucy, your breakfast's ready!<eos> Eurgh. Your beard water's like soup.<eos> Shall we feed it to Emily?
You can just walk away?<eos> After everything you've learned?<eos> Your father was Quentin Yarrow?<eos> Why are you interested in him?<eos> He knew all about this place-- about Moon Hill, about Phillip Kellian, about all of it.<eos> It's all in there-- the answers to what Phillip Kellian discovered.<eos> Don't you want to know what your father was looking for?<eos> Damn it, Jeff, we're literally inches from knowing.<eos> Give me the ax, Nate.<eos> Nate, give it to me.
Some kind of accident.<eos> Looks like it was made centuries ago.<eos> You know what it kind of looks like?<eos> TV remote.<eos> No. I'm not playing your game.<eos> Do you remember, Kelly, how Henry cut your parents into pieces so small, they never found all of them?<eos> The pain of that, of witnessing that has never left you, and it never will until you kill it.<eos> Kill the pain.<eos> Pick it up!<eos> Use it!
I wondered if I could bring him here.<eos> Here?<eos> If you and I were to vouch for him to the authorities, I'm sure we could get him away from that place.<eos> But why here? Why not the Abbey?<eos> Isn't he Carson's responsibility?<eos> I'm sorry to say it, but, Mr Carson has turned his back on his old pal.<eos> I see.<eos> So you want to risk Carson's wrath by rescuing this Mr Grigg?<eos> He's a pitiful being, but he's not beyond work.<eos> He's not beyond a decent life, if he could find it.
Make sure your people know.<eos> We're going ahead with the mission?<eos> The tactical details are "need to know."<eos> Our target -- "need to know."<eos> The President does not need to know.<eos> That's how we play it.<eos> You sure?<eos> I'm sure.<eos> It's not enough to win this war, Pope.<eos> We got to be worthy of winning it.
You tried to kill her.<eos> It was never about her.<eos> It was always about the key.<eos> You took the key.<eos> You don't understand how important this is.<eos> - I have a pretty good idea.<eos> - Nick!<eos> I brought the key.<eos> Here.<eos> I'm giving it back to you.
Kiera didn't send me.<eos> You know I had a job like this once, way back... or is that way forward?<eos> Mopping floors and cleaning toilets.<eos> Good, honest work my father called it.<eos> I hated that job but I guess it did teach me something.<eos> And what's that?<eos> Well first off, money and power doesn't mean your shit doesn't stink.<eos> More importantly, the only thing separating me and the future I wanted was will.<eos> I had the talent and the ambition, all I needed was a chance.<eos> The problem is, of course, you're rarely given that chance, more often than not you've gotta take it.
Missed one.<eos> You gotta get your head in the game, Alec.<eos> You mean your game?<eos> Alec, track down the suit.<eos> Alec, find the bad guys.<eos> You know how powerful these suits are.<eos> I don't need you to tell me about something I invented.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Is there any way we could track the suit if the owner wasn't wearing it?
You sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What about your new boyfriend?<eos> I can handle him.<eos> Okay, here goes.<eos> I'm cycling all other CMRs.<eos> Elena?<eos> I forgot how it feels.<eos> It's so powerful.<eos> When I find the suit, I'll switch it off.
Where is she?<eos> Where is she?<eos> Escher?<eos> You're looking for Escher, the mystery man?<eos> You don't know anything.<eos> I'm here, she's not.<eos> You wanna roll the dice?<eos> Come on out, hero.<eos> Strip down now, I'll go easier on you.<eos> Pretty hand, shame to detach it.
Well, if it isn't, someone sure wanted it to look that way.<eos> Looks like they never saw it coming.<eos> So, on top of civil unrest and a drug epidemic, you're telling me I've got a gang war on my hands?<eos> I'm not sure we know enough to call it a gang war just yet.<eos> You must have a working theory?<eos> Well, the Kings have been trading hits with the Syndicate for the last 14 months.<eos> Wolford's out on bail, maybe he's trying to get payback for whoever set him up?<eos> Whatever these guys did, someone's trying to eradicate them for it.<eos> This city's teetering on the brink.<eos> This might just be enough to push it over the edge.
I assure you, if you elect me mayor, I will launch a full investigation into the clear, and obvious corruption of our court system.<eos> A dangerous individual like Julian Randol is free to roam the streets?<eos> It's time for a drastic change.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Carlos!<eos> - What the hell was that, Jim?<eos> - I intend to find out.<eos> Somebody got to that judge.<eos> Well, if that's true, there will be a trail.<eos> We just have to find it.
I had to put up with brutes like them when I served in the Emperor's army... fools who think we have no business holding a sword.<eos> I only wish there was someone there to stand up for me.<eos> You're, uh, you're bleeding.<eos> I'll survive.<eos> The sun should be setting soon.<eos> We need to move out.<eos> What... what... what do you mean, "we"?<eos> You tracked the yaoguai in a matter of hours.<eos> It took me weeks.<eos> You track the beast, and I'll kill it.
We'll get creative.<eos> Or... we could get our own place.<eos> You wanna do what?<eos> You wanna move out?<eos> Whoa!<eos> I... it's just a suggestion.<eos> After 28 years, isn't this what we've all been waiting for, to be together under the same roof?<eos> Yes. I just... imagined a bigger roof... with turrets.<eos> Being here in Storybrooke, we have a chance at a fresh start.<eos> Let's take it.
I have to protect my village.<eos> You can't even walk.<eos> How... how are you gonna kill the yaoguai?<eos> I'm not.<eos> You are.<eos> Me? I...<eos> I'm... I'm... I'm not a soldier.<eos> You have good instincts.<eos> You tracked down that beast faster than I ever could.<eos> Uh, tracking it and killing it are not the same thing.
Your figure is changing.<eos> I'm not pregnant<eos> Am I suppose to believe it's mine?<eos> I know I'm the father, Lorna.<eos> I couldn't tell you.<eos> I needed to keep a clear head.<eos> This is what girls do, they date boys.<eos> So don't go telling me where my heart is.<eos> I gave my daughter life, you will not destroy it.
Yeah, we can, but you're going home.<eos> What?<eos> You're taking the week.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> No debate about this, Raylan.<eos> Rachel, Tim, come in my office.<eos> Art, I brought you this case.<eos> Raylan, this is a U.S. Marshal service case.<eos> I pulled it out of the wall of my goddamn house.<eos> Well, nobody's taking it away from you.
I know it can be...<eos> confusing.<eos> But I also know that what happened between us was real.<eos> - Norman--<eos> - Just let me finish.<eos> There's no point hiding from it anymore.<eos> I know how we feel about each other.<eos> I know we're both just scared and confused.<eos> I know we have a connection.<eos> You know, 'cause I can feel it.
- Do you want one?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Just put the joint out, or I'm gonna lose my job, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> So this sentence here.<eos> "He felt like he was choking inside on some black smoke."<eos> That-- I love-- I love that image.<eos> But I think it would be better if you just moved it to the end of the paragraph.
Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Everything is just how he left it.<eos> I didn't think it would hit me like this.<eos> - You want a minute?<eos> - No.<eos> I like having you here.<eos> He had this old, beautiful, gold pocket watch.<eos> And when I was little, we would wind it up together.
Oh, shit.<eos> Matt... it's the end of the day.<eos> What are the details of the open house tomorrow? I was thinking I could bake some cookies, give the place that fresh-baked smell.<eos> What?<eos> Um-- There's not gonna be an open house.<eos> Why not?<eos> Look, Norma,<eos> I looked into it, and there's no market for your property, not with the new bypass road going in.<eos> I can't get you your money back.<eos> Well, how much can you sell it for?
Oh, when did that happen?<eos> Today.<eos> I hope that's okay.<eos> Yeah, no, I'm glad he is.<eos> I just didn't hear anything about it.<eos> Well, anyway, tell me if you like this dress.<eos> I love it.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Will you--will you hold it up to you?
Hank's phone just turned on.<eos> We got a solid signal.<eos> Where?<eos> Grand central.<eos> He knows we're tracking his phone.<eos> He's leading us right to her.<eos> You've got the fbi and the shepherds after you.<eos> You just gonna create another identity and disappear?<eos> No.<eos> I'm gonna go to strasbourg, And I am gonna find the true cross And I'm gonna destroy it.
I wanted you to know that we're in this together.<eos> I saw something.<eos> He looked exactly like me.<eos> Korbin sturm--He was conscripted into the nazi party<eos> For field research on zero hour.<eos> We need you to unlock this puzzle.<eos> Strasbourg--That's where the clocks lead.<eos> God forgive me.<eos> Stop!<eos> I'm gonna find the true cross and i'm gonna destroy it.
You're telling me we are going to bury it In the middle of nowhere?<eos> In a humble and anonymous place Where only the 12 will know to look.<eos> It's the true cross.<eos> It deserves grandeur.<eos> We can take it to america, build a basilica.<eos> The plan has been set.<eos> Apostles have been chosen.<eos> The clocks are sent out.<eos> Lives have been lost to build this chain.<eos> We cannot break it now.
Previously on "zero hour"...<eos> I am gonna find the true cross And I'm gonna destroy it.
Previously on "zero hour"...<eos> I am gonna find the true cross And I'm gonna destroy it.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I'm confident to have the cross in my possession Within the week.<eos> I've seen things, dad-<eos> A nazi officer with my face.<eos> He looked exactly like me.<eos> I dream about a man with a gun.<eos> The location of the cross must be secret.<eos> I will not put it in the mud.
Now sturm and that guy were at sea for a year Leading up to 1938, Supposedly doing some kind of naval surveys in the north<eos> And, get this, the faroe islands, Where they did extensive land surveys Of the northernmost tip of the main island.<eos> They were calling it scouts for locations To hide naval bases.<eos> Yeah. Probably hiding something else.<eos> Listen, e-mail me the surveys as soon as you can.<eos> I can't talk to you.<eos> I answered only to tell you to stop.<eos> We're going after the cross.<eos> I swear to you that the pyrates will never get it.<eos> Because you intend to destroy it?
There's nothing you coulda done, buddy.<eos> Marty is schvitzing in the big steam room in the sky now.<eos> (Tessa) George wasn't the only one who had blindsided.<eos> I can't believe Ryan lied... to me.<eos> And you're just as guilty.<eos> You let me believe that he was at an away game instead of... wherever he was.<eos> Tessa, when you first started dating my brother, you put me in a very awkward place.<eos> You think you know somebody.<eos> You wear their letterman jacket.<eos> You put your tongue on top of their tongue and you move it around, only to find out that they are a lying liar who lies their lies directly to your face.
He's all yours.<eos> I made you some food.<eos> It's important to keep up your strength.<eos> You should eat.<eos> Jake... where did you...?<eos> You took this from Guillermo...<eos> The man who tried to kill you.<eos> Jacob, my boy, this amulet... is a very important object.<eos> This symbol, the Tree of Life, represents how the universe came into being.<eos> The sacred and secret story of this amulet is that whosoever possesses it shall become the protector, the guardian of the Lamed Vav Zaddikim, the 36 righteous ones.
You mean your employee, who you were harboring in your office.<eos> We gave you a hell of a break on that one.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But the fact remains you have the wrong person in custody, and he will die at your hands rather than confess to a crime he didn't commit.<eos> And you and Sally can't get the media bump without the confession, so...<eos> Why on earth would I release him?<eos> On your say-so?<eos> Because this somehow feeds the charade that Fitzgerald Grant is awake?<eos> I wasn't elected yesterday, Olivia.<eos> I know political kabuki when I see it.
But when a left-handed person makes the "t"-cross, it goes from right to left.<eos> Now the President is left-handed, but his First Lady is not.<eos> Fitzgerald Thomas Grant.<eos> Three "t's" in all, as it happens,<eos> There's an old saying...<eos> An expert is someone who's read one book.<eos> I'm quite sure I could find an actually accredited graphologist who will swear that Fitz signed that piece of paper, particularly given that he's still recovering his full motor skills resulting from a gunshot wound to the head.<eos> And will you also find a doctor?<eos> Because I have a sworn affidavit from one of President Grant's physicians at James Madison hospital saying that your husband has failed to so much as open his eyes.<eos> Madam First Lady, you will withdraw this letter of reinstatement, or I will have no choice but to reveal it for the humiliating forgery it is.
We are the law.<eos> Besides, we're a team, right?<eos> All for one and one for all and whatever you said before.<eos> Hi.<eos> What you doing there?<eos> Me?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I was just... Got a box and I was keeping the open-plan workspace flow... I don't...<eos> He was clocking the return address.<eos> He was gonna Google it.
It's just that... we make a good team.<eos> We make an awesome team.<eos> But I don't know, what if I do?<eos> Do what?<eos> Leave Ops some day.<eos> It's not happening any time soon.<eos> I have a long way to go before I can keep up with guys like Callen and Sam, but it's...<eos> You're gonna get your chance.<eos> And when you do,<eos> I'll be the first one to tell you to take it.
Are we making a buy?<eos> No.<eos> Not with me, you're not.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Get out of the car.<eos> What's going on, Charlie?<eos> You like this place?<eos> It's okay.<eos> You know, this house can be yours.<eos> They're not gonna sell it to somebody like me.
Claudia's... she was all he had left.<eos> I'm going to do everything I can to find out who did this, all right?<eos> Check out these scuff marks.<eos> Ms. Weber struggled with her killer.<eos> (grunting)<eos> FINLAY:<eos> Got more blood drops.<eos> Some grass, little pieces of gravel.<eos> Could've come from the killer's shoes.<eos> All right, I'll collect this section of the clay, and then I'll bring it back to the lab.
Any time after nine.<eos> And give your name to the desk sergeant.<eos> - Excellent.<eos> OK, then. I'll see you in the morning. - All right.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> I'm staying here with you.<eos> How is he?<eos> He's going to lose his hand.<eos> And that fingerprint's no good without a finger to compare it to, is it?
Okay.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> You okay?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Do you believe him?<eos> Right now, I want to focus on taking Flynn down.<eos> This is Dennis Flynn Jr.<eos> Years ago, the Flynn crime family was dismantled.<eos> He's spent the last 10 years trying to rebuild it.
I guess they're right about that.<eos> Rumplestiltskin says that magic has a price, but from where I'm sitting, seems that science does, too.<eos> Every time I try to save a life, someone else dies.<eos> Look, you're Frankenstein, and I'm the werewolf.<eos> I ate my boyfriend.<eos> Regina thought she was punishing us by erasing who we were.<eos> But I think she underestimated how much crap we wanted to forget.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But... we can't let it stop us.<eos> She gave us a chance to start over, and I wanna take it.
It's a cup.<eos> You dropped it... in my castle.<eos> You were afraid that you had angered me. Here.<eos> You... you need to go and take your cup, okay?<eos> No, no, no, no. I... I charmed it.<eos> If you focus, it will work.<eos> It's magic.<eos> Okay, just go away.<eos> S... stop talking about magic and take your cup.<eos> Just look at it.
If you're here to talk me into coming to your party for Angelo's baby mama, the answer is "no."<eos> No, that's not why I'm here.<eos> But we're not happy about it, either.<eos> John and I only said yes to this dinner 'cause we figured that you'd kill it.<eos> We need to work on our good cop/bad cop.<eos> So what's up?<eos> I was wondering if maybe you wanted to get out of here, go have some fun.<eos> Would this involve heels?<eos> Could.<eos> So you have a Frida Kahlo letter and you want to sell it?
I just wanted you for myself for a while.<eos> Pinky Tuscadero?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, and The Fonz?<eos> I love her.<eos> You're The Fonz.<eos> Heyyy.<eos> I can get you a leather jacket.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Will you wear it?
The foxx trap?<eos> Isn't that a strip club?<eos> I can explain.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Cyrus lavinius<eos> Jeremiah Jones will now expound on the nature of life, wedlock and love.<eos> Give it up for the joneses!<eos> Relationships are hard.<eos> Especially when you are married to a man who doesn't shower and hangs out in horse stalls.<eos> A man who lets a raccoon eat your very, very, very expensive wooden shoes just to prove a point.<eos> A man who borrows things, like your... buggy, and then loses it after drinking too much...
I don't. Because the woman I married? Never existed.<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> Huh?<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> Aah!<eos> Uhh!<eos> The bird feeder's empty. I'm gonna make up the sugar water. It's delicate.<eos> Clever.<eos> The Shepherds... they're the ones who protect the cross, right?<eos> And the great Pyrates... They're hunting for it.
This is Laila's handwriting.<eos> That's it.<eos> She works with the Shepherds.<eos> "352 irrelevant"? What does that mean?<eos> 352?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It meant something to Laila.<eos> It means we're getting closer. We will find her.<eos> I need to know what this is all about, Father Mark.<eos> For thousands of years, Shepherds have struggled to protect the cross from those who covet it... A group known as the Pyrates. They've had many covers through the ages...
They said if it happened again, I'd get suspended. Hmm.<eos> (Singsongy) And it is definitely gonna happen again.<eos> (Grunts) (Knock on door) I'll get it.<eos> All right. Thanks, sweetie.<eos> Hey... hey, Mike.<eos> Ah... We'll just say it fell off the truck.<eos> Actually, it did fall off the truck.<eos> You might wanna open it in the sink.<eos> Brought your motorcycle?<eos> Yeah, you wanna check it out?
Well, then it's possible that's why your cricothyroidectomy was unsuccessful and possibly why you couldn't find the cartilage and why you were having trouble intubating, which deprived the patient of air for something like three minutes.<eos> - Did you ask for help?<eos> - Everyone was preoccupied.<eos> You didn't even call for help?<eos> You couldn't get the bloody tube in, you nicked a vein, your patient was circling the drain, and you couldn't even bother to ask for help.<eos> - I came over.<eos> - Yes, to her rescue.<eos> Are you coming to her rescue now, Gato?<eos> By the time you arrived, the patient was in full cardiac arrest.<eos> You saved the day, Dr. Robidaux, but not before very nearly losing it.
- Who are you?<eos> - I'm Bob Benson.<eos> We've met before.<eos> I'm part of the team.<eos> Doesn't the elevator go up to this floor?<eos> Herb.<eos> What brings you by?<eos> I had some thoughts, the complexity of which could not be expressed over a telephone.<eos> What is it you want?<eos> Well, you guys are gonna make some fancy-schmancy Michelangelo TV spot and the dealers are gonna foot most of the bill for running it.
It's my dress for the christening.<eos> It's the one the good wife wore to visit big in prison. No, that's the same dress that I ordered to wear to the christening.<eos> Oh, dear, what a dilemma.<eos> Whatever shall we do?<eos> Why don't you wear the dress this time, because I'm gonna be so thin, I won't be able to fit into mine after all that diet candy.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> You're the best!<eos> You're a good girl.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Maybe you could steam it for me too?
Melanie, what you did was wrong.<eos> You can make it up to Victoria by doing her bidding for a week.<eos> And listening to her endless Emmet Lawson stories.<eos> So a normal week.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now you.<eos> You turned St. John into a monkey.<eos> In my defense, the Bible never said what he looked like.<eos> It would have if he looked like a monkey.<eos> Now, rather than restore the painting, we're gonna go with the whole animal motif and turn it into a Noah's ark thing.
Look at him.<eos> He's a majestic Clydesdale.<eos> His eyes are like a blizzard I want to get lost in.<eos> - This is classic Wendy.<eos> - Oh, don't listen to her.<eos> I only slept with one of her boyfriends, and she was 16.<eos> I mean, how serious could that be?<eos> That takes me back.<eos> Just like the old days.<eos> I just never thought that you'd approve of my life enough to try and ruin it.
What cost would sober intent?<eos> Five thousand denarii would see me far from this city, and shores of fucking Republic.<eos> A bargain well struck.<eos> Call me Roman no more, then!<eos> How many more swords do you need?<eos> Those that join us are well armed.<eos> Join you?<eos> You move to take the fucking city?<eos> !<eos> We move to liberate it.
Father.<eos> All has been attended.<eos> Your army stands ready to march upon first light.<eos> News well received.<eos> I would have word.<eos> There yet lingers issue of what title I shall hold.<eos> I am possessed of leanings towards the matter.<eos> Morning sun shall see them fall to place.<eos> Have these returned from where they sprang.<eos> I would have house in order before we take leave from it.
I thought honored position all but mine.<eos> Now I fear he favors another.<eos> Then you stand as your mother, bound by blood and inconsiderate worth.<eos> It is a thing of rare beauty.<eos> Is it not?<eos> Yes, Dominus.<eos> You will carry it when you face Spartacus?<eos> I shall carry my father's sword.<eos> It is not as well bred or considered as this... yet it holds deeper meaning.<eos> Caesar will carry it then?
My people will turn from me, if I'm known to bed beneath your roof.<eos> My husband held stable at edge of city.<eos> I would take shelter within its walls.<eos> I sought only to provide comfort.<eos> Heracleo spoke the truth, at least upon one subject.<eos> You are not the man one expects.<eos> Apologies.<eos> Share drink, and see them accepted.<eos> My cup is spoken for.<eos> I seek not to claim it my own.
Well come.<eos> Break silence, and see more discerning mind gauge worth of it.<eos> Spartacus and his men move against Sicilia.<eos> What of the remainder?<eos> They have fractured from the man and yet hold the city.<eos> Now is our chance!<eos> Sinuessa stands but partially defended.<eos> So it would appear.<eos> Must brought great suffering, to witness the fall of your city?<eos> Beyond the telling of it.
Return to Rome. Speak of this, or any word against me... and I shall devote fortune towards your death in darkness of night.<eos> See him upon his horse. And second legion set to purpose towards Spartacus.<eos> Give word to stand ready to move upon a moments notice.<eos> We must not fall to sense of comfort.<eos> I do not favor fleeing like rabbits at imagined footfall of hunter.<eos> Nor I.<eos> Yet we must stay in advance of Crassus until numbers are replenished.<eos> A wise path.<eos> Though one paved with Roman heads fucking preferred.<eos> We shall find our own upon it, if we fall from caution.
Naevia!<eos> Take pause.<eos> Crassus offers trade!<eos> His son's life for five hundred captured in battle with Crixus!<eos> Another Roman lie!<eos> I do not believe it so.<eos> Yet I lay choice with the one most wronged by the boy.<eos> I held your life in my hands.<eos> Live each moment knowing that one day soon<eos> I shall reclaim it.
When we first lay together, she told of how the gods delivered oracle in her dreams.<eos> And foretold that I would never love another woman.<eos> Did prophecy hold true?<eos> I found comfort in others.<eos> Yet there's an emptiness that can never be filled.<eos> A void left where heart once beat, when Sura was taken from me.<eos> You once questioned how victory can be defined.<eos> I thought answer held in Roman deaths.<eos> A position no longer taken?<eos> Life is what defines it.
If you fall,<eos> Spartacus would gain advantage --<eos> I have longed to meet you in true contest.<eos> As I have longed to see your head parted from fucking neck.<eos> Saxa!<eos> I made promise.<eos> That time next we met...<eos> I would have your life.<eos> Come then.<eos> And attempt to take it.
- Seven of the nine witnesses...<eos> - I know.<eos> have recanted their testimony,<eos> - and of the two left, one of them...<eos> - Don.<eos> is the primary alternate suspect.<eos> I've been covering the story, just like you.<eos> - Not just like me.<eos> - You're right.<eos> I've been covering it for nine years.
Get someone on the record, get confirmation, and we'll--<eos> We'll keep trying, but in the meantime,<eos> - I want to break in.<eos> - Go with the story that--<eos> You don't have the story to break in with.<eos> - The clock is ticking.<eos> - Same rule.<eos> Call him.<eos> Say you've heard a report and you want confirmation.<eos> When he denies it, then I really won't be able to run it.
♪<eos> It's like it could crash right down on me, that's how big it is.<eos> After 30 days, time just didn't exist anymore. It didn't really matter, which I'd never felt before, and it was the best feeling.<eos> I didn't really care if there was a lot of fronts coming over, or no wind.<eos> I made peace with it.<eos> I was just there, I was with nature.<eos> From the starting of being the worst trip, it actually was the nicest trip ever, just mentally.<eos> ♪<eos> (heavy winds, rain)<eos> Hello, at the moment we're sailing towards Cape Town-.

Can I count on that?<eos> - Always.<eos> - Raymond Tusk.<eos> The President wants to tap him as the new V.P.<eos> - You and I cannot let that happen.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because a third of his fortune is tied up in nuclear energy.<eos> Sancorp does not want a pro-nuclear businessman in the White House.<eos> The market is shifting toward natural gas anyway.<eos> But Tusk wants to stall that shift or reverse it.
WHAT?<eos> I'M A MEDIC.<eos> YOU'RE A MEDIC WHO'S ABOUT TO DO A CRANIOTOMY.<eos> OKAY.<eos> GOT EVERYTHING. NOW WHAT?<eos> YOU NEED TO TRIM HIS HAIR.<eos> DO YOU HAVE SURGICAL CLIPPERS?<eos> I'M NOT EVEN SURE WE HAVE A RAZOR.<eos> WE DO.<eos> WOULD YOU GET IT, PLEASE?
Thank you.<eos> [Softly] Of course.<eos> You want a hand with those?<eos> No.<eos> I think I actually wanna be alone right now.<eos> I see they left you a plate.<eos> I thought there were no leftovers.<eos> Ah. Charlie likes you.<eos> Hey, Briggs.<eos> Why don't you eat it?
Okay.<eos> Huh?<eos> Um...<eos> I...<eos> I think there's something wrong with it.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> I followed the recipe exactly.<eos> You just don't know how to drink beer.<eos> You don't sip it like a latte.
I spoke to one of the contractors, and he gave me a wink and a nod that he was demanding kickbacks.<eos> Junior, wink and a nod, that's not gonna get the job done, not with Holbrook. Look, he's dirty.<eos> And he's going after my job, and he's going after Margot, so I'm gonna bury him.<eos> Hey, all right, Junior.<eos> Slow and steady.<eos> Keys.<eos> You recognize this?<eos> Yeah, it's Daryl's basketball ring.<eos> Well, bruising on your son indicates that his killer was wearing the exact same ring.<eos> Martin says he no longer has his ring, and we were unable to find even one recent photo with him wearing it.
Ah. My mistake.<eos> So, you are the chemist who tested Anna Buday's B-sample?<eos> I'm lead analyst at Edgar Labs.<eos> We test and interpret samples for all U.S. athletes.<eos> So that's a yes? - Yes.<eos> - And you are familiar with the booster scandal, docteur?<eos> Yes, I'm the one who discovered it.<eos> - And the new compound, dexitetrasolone.<eos> - Uh-huh. And after you discovered it, did you test this... substance?<eos> No. We're still waiting on subpoenas of private labs - in China who manufacture it.
And yet, it's the law.<eos> What is even more insane is this emergency hearing, which was just deployed to get the defendant here in the first place.<eos> Your Honor, all we are asking is that you allow my client to walk down the hall.<eos> Oh, my God. Stop it.<eos> Seriously, stop.<eos> Please, go find some criminals to prosecute and defend.<eos> Jim, please escort the defendant down to bond court so she can post bail.<eos> - Your Honor, that is not...<eos> - Come on, Ms. Pine.<eos> When the law is an ass, someone has to kick it.

Can I tell you something?<eos> Of course.<eos> Back when I was using, I was driving home from the club...<eos> Out of my mind.<eos> It was January 19th.<eos> It haunts me.<eos> Do you remember that night I came to see you at the hospital?<eos> It was dark.<eos> And I dropped my cigarette.<eos> And when I reached down for it...
Is Brian still upset?<eos> Brian thinks I'm a selfish bitch, so yeah.<eos> Well, I think he's just stressed about his play.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> His play.<eos> I took a peek at it, by the way.<eos> It's not that good.<eos> Not like his old stuff.<eos> I think it's great, actually.<eos> He asked you to read it?
No.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> We never had a burst pipe up there.<eos> When did you last clean up there?<eos> Ten days ago.<eos> There's been no-one in there since.<eos> Who else has keys to the hut?<eos> Me and the owners.<eos> That's it.<eos> We're treating it as a possible crime scene.
Mr. Reese, Emily Morton vowed to make Pierce launch her technology, a technology that would seriously compete with Friendczar.<eos> Pretty sure Pierce is the victim, not the perpetrator.<eos> Someone already made an attempt on his life.<eos> Someone with hacking skills.<eos> Someone like a missing software engineer.<eos> Why get the exact same car when your old one didn't even have a scratch?<eos> 'Cause it's unparalleled. I don't collect toys, just the best of what I need.<eos> One car.<eos> One watch.<eos> 2 mil, charts the phase and the orbit of the moon, tells time to the nanosecond, and I don't have to wind it.
There's just one problem.<eos> I processed Eddie's Chevy while he was in custody, and his car hasn't seen a carpet upgrade since 1956.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, that's not good.<eos> Of course, Eddie has a stable of classic cars.<eos> Could be one of them.<eos> Or the car, like our killer, could've been staring us in the face the whole time.<eos> I checked with Sunstar Auto Rental.<eos> They said they wrote a two-day contract on this '56 Chevy for Antonio for-for your photo shoot.<eos> But the kid behind the desk said that he was such a big fan, that when you came back to rent it for an extra day, he gave it to you for free.
She's really excited to go with Lucy.<eos> I know.<eos> Lucy feels the same way.<eos> She'll be crushed if we didn't go.<eos> We could just do it.<eos> Kids come first, right?<eos> Yeah, we... we can spend the day together and then, tell the girls about us some other time.<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> Anyway, you seem to like the candle.<eos> So you can just take it.
Like, yeah, I know this.<eos> I've seen it happen a million times.<eos> And then they can't deal with who I am.<eos> You know what?<eos> Honestly, maybe you should think about the fact that you could be fetishizing me.<eos> Because how many white women have you dated?<eos> Sounds like a lot from what you just said. What?<eos> Really?<eos> And maybe you think of us as just one big, white, blobby mass with stupid ideas that you can't deal with.<eos> So why don't you lay this thing down, flip it, and reverse it?
Previously on Do No Harm...<eos> Ruben, just give me the kill drug.<eos> I haven't tested it yet.<eos> There's no way of knowing what it'll do to you.<eos> It worked.<eos> My first night of freedom.<eos> I'm not not gonna spend it in a lab with you.

Mm-hmm.<eos> She just happens to love a lot of other folks, too.<eos> Why don't you give me that gun?<eos> I'll give it back to you, and I'll just keep it for about a week, until you have time to think about it, all right?

Fucking virgin.<eos> Saw a pussy, wouldn't know whether to fuck it or slide it a saucer of milk.

It takes about four days to make new blood cells.<eos> He may not have that much time.<eos> What would really help is a blood transfusion.<eos> No.<eos> No blood.<eos> If you're worried about disease transmission,<eos> I can assure you that all of our blood is meticulously screened.<eos> It's not that we don't trust your blood.<eos> We just...<eos> We believe that life is a gift from god and we don't try to sustain it by taking in blood.

Made me really nervous hearing about that pill.<eos> Really?<eos> The kid is barely in high school.<eos> At this rate, she's barely gonna make it out.<eos> I was talking about your pill.<eos> It's not a gun, Zoey.<eos> It is, kind of.<eos> You know what it is?<eos> It's a pill that I didn't take.<eos> And I keep it in a box to remind me of all the things in my life that I fucked up.
Don't you mean our kitchen?<eos> No, I mean yours.<eos> I'm only here for ten more days, remember?<eos> Nine days, 12 hours, 47 minutes, actually, but who's counting?<eos> I'm just saying, this is a problem.<eos> This is the sign of an active mind.<eos> Lincoln, Einstein, Freud.<eos> All geniuses who drew inspiration from chaos in their environs.<eos> Without Andrew Fleming's reluctance to wash petri dishes, the world wouldn't have penicillin, would it?<eos> Well, since the world does, do you have to grow it in your fridge?
There's a rope in my truck.<eos> Get it.<eos> Don't look down.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Stay still.<eos> I'm not going to let you fall.<eos> Here.<eos> I'm gonna toss you this rope.<eos> Put it around your body.
Come on, Chloe.<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> Well, maybe a little right.<eos> But mostly you're wrong.<eos> Hey, Henry.<eos> Hey.<eos> Did Lucinda see your dirty, perverted picture?<eos> First of all, it's a fun shot, okay?<eos> I'm holding a tennis racquet.<eos> And yes, she saw it.

And then we'd probably still be together to this day, just driving each other crazy.<eos> We'd be miserable, wouldn't we?<eos> Completely miserable. Well, it's a good thing I didn't say it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good thing.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> I'll delete the photo for real.<eos> Oh, you son of a bitch.<eos> You know what?<eos> You should keep it.
Periscope depth.<eos> All head one-third.<eos> Lieutenant Cahill, how much time?<eos> Patrick Lawrence will be in firing range in 30 seconds, Sir.<eos> I will carry out my orders, Captain.<eos> 20 seconds, Sir.<eos> Captain Thorn, this is my final warning.<eos> You want the world to think you're a madman, but I know you're not.<eos> Testing that theory would be a fatal mistake.<eos> I am testing it.
That's not gonna happen.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> But you gotta be honest with yourself.<eos> Marcus is different. I've known him for 20 years, and Marcus 2.0 is a guy I don't even recognize.<eos> Yeah, you're damn right he is.<eos> He's adapting.<eos> He's adapting to his environment.<eos> He's dealing with the situation.<eos> He's not adapting.<eos> He's shaping it.
If you take him to the hospital, they don't have it.<eos> The greatest doctor in the world can't make it.<eos> Only I can give it to him, and I will.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> If I give it to him, he will be fine.<eos> But if I don't, he'll die in 72 hours.<eos> That's exactly what'll happen if you don't do what I tell you to do.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I need something from you, and it's a little thing really.<eos> I need you to go to your boss's study tomorrow and take the little, electric clock from the bookshelf and bring it to me.

- This plane is filled with rats!<eos> - (WHISPERS) Okay.<eos> And we got to kill them all, starting with the queen!<eos> What's the deal with you and Detective Tommy Sullivan?<eos> Am I gonna have to fight a duel with that guy every time I want to ask you out, or what?<eos> (LAUGHS) Well, I would pay to see that, but I don't think so.<eos> - But there is a story there, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> A long one that I'm not telling.<eos> I don't want you to tell it, I just want to know it has an end.
- Lacey...<eos> - I overheard you.<eos> And she doesn't know that I know.<eos> I just had to ask...<eos> I don't want to talk about this.<eos> - But, Grandma, what if Mom's right?<eos> - Okay?<eos> Why wouldn't you want to know the truth?<eos> I said no.<eos> I didn't want to have this awful, morbid conversation with her, and I certainly don't want to have it with you.
- Aren't you here?<eos> - Really?<eos> - What?<eos> So you had to call?<eos> You were gonna see me<eos> - in three seconds.<eos> - I wanted to invite you to my housewarming party.<eos> But you already sent me an invitation.<eos> Yes, but you never check your mail, so who knows if you'd find it.<eos> You're calling to tell me to check my mail to find it, so chances are I'll find it.
No, I would never--<eos> But you know who did abuse Angelica.<eos> I'm bound by the seal of the confessional.<eos> I don't get that, Father.<eos> Look, you're a good man, and I know you have a duty to the church, but you still have a duty to get justice for Angelica.<eos> I made sure she was protected.<eos> Is that why you were sent away?<eos> Look, whoever did this, how do you know he's not still molesting little girls?<eos> Because he swore to me he wouldn't.<eos> Well, he broke the law, and if you don't tell me his name, you're breaking it too.
I apologize for acting in haste.<eos> Please show yourself.<eos> Please.<eos> I will burn the sight of you into my eyes and leave.<eos> How beautiful!<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I will withdraw.<eos> But I still believe your happiness lies in being mine.<eos> Beautiful!<eos> His Majesty returned to his palace. Now, every night that the moon was out the princess would gaze up at it.
I'm just, I'm just tired.<eos> I hear there was a problem in your shop.<eos> I hope you're staying clear of trouble.<eos> Of course, of course, of course. Yeah.<eos> I'm sure they'll find the culprit.<eos> That's great.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> Heard you were helping Tricia with a letter.<eos> Oh, I just said that I would look at it with her.
Heard you were helping Tricia with a letter.<eos> Oh, I just said that I would look at it with her.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't want any trouble.<eos> Neither do I. I just want you to help me with mine.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Yeah, same here.<eos> Well, I'm not a lawyer.<eos> You guys know that, right?<eos> I just said that I would look over it with her.
And this guy made it right for us?<eos> Yeah. And in return, Zeus decided to strap him to that mountain and make him relive death every day.<eos> Damn. Every day for how long?<eos> No wonder the guy's hard drive is fried.<eos> Did you figure out who, uh, Xena-wannabe was?<eos> I'm guessing Artemis, Zeus' daughter.<eos> She's been known to carry around weapons like that dagger.<eos> They're nasty. They'll kill Immortals dead.<eos> All right. Well, we've never battled a God curse before.<eos> Hope we can break it.
I was vetting Yates.<eos> - What did you do to him?<eos> - What are you going on about?<eos> He has a scar on his head exactly where your killer has been harvesting brain fragments.<eos> Is he another one of your little experiments?<eos> We can talk about this, but not here.<eos> Not with Debra in the other room.<eos> An X-ray revealed a lesion on Yates's brain.<eos> I suspected it was contributing to his violent behavior, so I...<eos> I suggested the new hospital remove it.
So does that mean you care about me?<eos> Only to the extent that you sign my paycheck.<eos> Touche.<eos> Okay, what are we going to read tonight?<eos> Let me guess.<eos> "Wee Monkeys."<eos> "Wee Monkeys."<eos> Before I read to you, I gotta talk to you about the TV remote.<eos> You said you didn't take it, but Jamie found it under your bed.<eos> I didn't mean to break it.
[Sighs] Dr. Vogel, uh...this is Hannah.<eos> - Hi, nice to meet you.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> Call me Evelyn.<eos> I trust there are no vegetarians here.<eos> Hand me your plate.<eos> It looks delicious.<eos> An old family recipe.<eos> Hope it holds out.<eos> I can pass it along to you if you'd like.
I like to hear directly from the owner.<eos> No sales pitch.<eos> Sure.<eos> I have a few phone calls to return.<eos> I'll be outside.<eos> I always did like this place.<eos> You have the same view of the water Cassie did.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I have a proposal.<eos> Figured the safest way to deliver it was to bring a referee.
Do you want me to send them to you?<eos> Leave them as evidence.<eos> Say you found them in the cabinet.<eos> People will think they're Saxon's.<eos> Let them.<eos> Give him even more credit than he deserves.<eos> But once I get settled,<eos> I'm gonna figure out a way to get in touch with you.<eos> Dexter--<eos> My car, I'll leave it at the airport.
No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> What are bees doing in here?<eos> Buzzing.<eos> I mean, why aren't they on the roof with the others?<eos> I'm seeing how the indoor temperature suits them.<eos> Our six weeks together are very nearly up, Watson.<eos> In a matter of days, your room will be vacant.<eos> I'm very seriously considering turning it into one large apiary.
I'm afraid I'm unable to help you if you're unwilling to help yourself.<eos> Feel free to show yourselves out.<eos> I knew this was a mistake.<eos> The only mistake being made here is yours.<eos> Father's friend or not, Matt Duncan is a murderer.<eos> If you don't call him out, Carl loses his dad, and I lose my husband...<eos> Assuming I even get to call you that before they lock you up.<eos> After the Northridge Quake, my father was inspired to use the profits from our military contracts to create a privatized disaster-relief firm.<eos> Stonehaven and its employees meant everything to my father.<eos> And I'm not interested in handing it over to someone with plans to break it up and sell it for parts.
My dad was a good man, and not just to his own kids, to any child, especially disaster victims.<eos> He'd see their faces and how terrified and innocent they were...<eos> I was living in Bushwick during the blackout of '77.<eos> I thought the world was ending.<eos> My father's camera store was looted, burned to the ground.<eos> Really?<eos> You know, my father helped to rehabilitate that whole borough.<eos> You were probably one of the kids who inspired him.<eos> Well, then I have a personal obligation to repay him.<eos> I'd like to raise my offer if you'll consider it.
Help!<eos> Help me push the door open.<eos> - Got it?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> They got the door open.<eos> Down to a minute.<eos> A minute!<eos> What happened?<eos> It's stuck on another crate!<eos> Okay, just move the crate back, slide it to the side.
I have the, uh, rental van on traffic cam footage from yesterday an hour after the shooting, turning east on Saticoy, 1400 block.<eos> That's about half a mile from the restaurant.<eos> Checking the first Saticoy cam and one on another street due west.<eos> If the van came out, it would have had to pass by one of them.<eos> Which it did not.<eos> I'm calling Callen.<eos> There.<eos> The van's in a parking lot.<eos> Copy that.<eos> We see it, too.
Bye, Louis.<eos> Wait, don't go.<eos> We're back!<eos> No, we're not.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I'm dropping the case.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I never should have taken it in the first place.
He ain't gonna take it.<eos> No doubt.<eos> He'll do it.<eos> He'll do it. Just let me do the talking.<eos> Heading in.<eos> - What's that?<eos> You jack that ring, too?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Lyric was telling me about this blue ring her grandmother used to have.<eos> She would always try to steal it, but...
What do you want, Holder?<eos> I was thinking I'd take a look at your old case file, just make sure there's no connection between your crack ho and mine.<eos> Good idea.<eos> Go for it.<eos> The thing is, the storage says the box is already checked out.<eos> And they don't know who took it.<eos> Yeah, but they're a bunch of idiots down there.<eos> They're always misplacing boxes.<eos> Just keep looking for it.<eos> You'll find it.
Mm-hmm, yep, sure.<eos> Looking good, Linden.<eos> Hey, Holder. Not every victim's worth it.<eos> You know, you start caring... you'll end up like me working minimum wage on a ferry.<eos> Never thought the day would come I'd hear that from you.<eos> Moving day, Seward.<eos> You're being transported to "C" block three miles down the road.<eos> Should we get stopped by somebody trying to remove you from state custody, we will shoot you first right where you sit.<eos> Better enjoy the view.<eos> Last time you'll see it.
Ray. Hey, man, everybody up in here got your name in their mouth.<eos> Man, I don't know who's trending more, you or Jesus.<eos> Look, I just need some advice.<eos> Know what I'm saying?<eos> I'm just trying to figure out how I can work these fools, you know?<eos> I got my Pardon Board coming up.<eos> I wrote my own motion of appeal.<eos> You want to hear it, man?<eos> I got it right here in my head.<eos> Let me give it to you.
People looking past their differences, discovering we're all human.<eos> We're all human.<eos> President Gilchrist, shake hands with America.<eos> Great.<eos> Well, thanks for coming, everybody.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> Thank you guys.<eos> Sir, I don't mean to alarm you, but word got out about this little caucus.<eos> - Marshall, it's not a caucus.<eos> - Whatever you want to call it, there are 10,000 people outside demanding a meeting with you.

The rules are easy.<eos> If you hit someone, they're out.<eos> But you can't hit them above the shoulders.<eos> So if someone throws a ball and it hits you in the face,<eos> I... Correct.<eos> That person, which in this case is me, would be out.<eos> Ha!<eos> Right in the puss!<eos> Ow!<eos> When you throw it, give it a little heat.
It is, Brick.<eos> Sorry, we're just beat.<eos> It's been a long weekend.<eos> I decided I don't wanna go to the library.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> - Oh.<eos> I mean, we don't have to go anywhere to have a special day.<eos> We can just watch TV all day.<eos> You always let me watch TV.<eos> Yes, but we'll let you watch it in bed with us.
- Okay.<eos> - Well, this has been fun.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Keep the party going.<eos> I'll be back as soon as I can.<eos> There it is. Now?<eos> No, I have something stuck in my throat.<eos> It's too bad Lily's not here to give you the heimlich.<eos> Did we ever tell you guys that story?<eos> Do you wanna tell it?
No more blind dates.<eos> You're mean.<eos> You know, she's right, Joyce.<eos> You are mean.<eos> I've been a gracious host while you've been rude, sullen, and dull.<eos> You'll forgive me if I choose not to start the new year on such a negative note.<eos> Oh, and if you're hungry for broccoli later, you'll find a piece in your teeth.<eos> Where is this stupid path?<eos> We've been walking forever.<eos> We'll find it.
You do this all the time.<eos> You just throw numbers at me to frighten and confuse me.<eos> And here I thought we were working so well together, and you're just being manipulative.<eos> What about you, Cam?<eos> Pitching these crazy, over-the-top ideas just so you can slip in what you really want.<eos> Oh, how dare you accuse me of Trojan horsing you.<eos> You have a name for it?<eos> No, I mean--<eos> You know what? I will not stand here and be accused by the likes of you.<eos> And if there was a door here, missy, I would slam it your face.
Can't go wrong with Wicked.<eos> Sure.<eos> Then again, Mamma Mia.<eos> Oh, I can never see that show enough.<eos> I own the movie on Blu-ray.<eos> Two words.<eos> Delightful romp.<eos> You do realize the whole point of this trip is to tell the woman I love that I'm actually someone else?<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> If that story was on Broadway, I'd see it in a heartbeat.
How can you say that, when you've never even been to their world?<eos> And you won't even let any of us go down there.<eos> Have you forgotten what the humans did?<eos> Why we no longer trade beans with them?<eos> They weren't content merely traveling between the realms.<eos> They had to conquer and pillage.<eos> Because a few humans did some bad stuff doesn't make them all evil.<eos> They don't abide by the same laws that we do, Anton.<eos> We giants foster life.<eos> They destroy it.
Where'd you go?<eos> Coffee run. Duh.<eos> Where else did you go?<eos> Americano, one pink.<eos> Dry soy cap.<eos> Super-sized drip, with three sugars.<eos> And a skinny vanilla for you.<eos> Did I get it right?<eos> I want the chip, Mona.<eos> And I want it now.
She's taking us to her lair.<eos> All this for a muddy cop car and a dead pig?<eos> It's Wilden.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> "You're mine now."<eos> I know what the text meant.<eos> "A" has a way to make it look like we killed him.<eos> ♪ oh ♪ If Red Coat's "A," why did she save us from the fire?<eos> So she could set us up to take the fall for Wilden's murder.<eos> Yeah, a cat plays with a mouse for hours before she actually eats it.
OK, young man.<eos> My name's Rosalie.<eos> Without my glasses, and you with no makeup?<eos> for the Internet, click the mouse twice.<eos> Where?<eos> On the fox.<eos> "Point the mouse on the fox"... on Radio London.<eos> What an idea, my dear.<eos> A computer at your age.<eos> Retirement is to enjoy life, not complicate it.
Come on. (Clears throat)<eos> It's kinda like prancing. Okay?<eos> Just kinda feel it.<eos> Get your feet out and...<eos> Uh, whoa.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why are your knees and feet pointing out?<eos> You've got, like, a dick Van Dyke "chim chim cher-ee" thing going on there. You know what?<eos> I'm gonna bring you a block of wood.<eos> Hold it between your thighs.
Then, up at first light and out on the hill.<eos> What did they talk about?<eos> Their dogs.<eos> Like all shepherds, they pretended not to care about them, but it's all they really talked about.<eos> Fed on porridge once a day and shot when their working days were over.<eos> They always had a dog inside on its last night.<eos> And there was a big crack of thunder...<eos> Go on.<eos> And the dog did nothing more than sit up a little.<eos> And my grandfather put his hand on her head and just rested it there.
In the name of Jesus Christ.<eos> Amen.<eos> Does God see everything?<eos> Yes.<eos> Does he decide everything?<eos> Yes.<eos> And the Bible says we are not to question him.<eos> So did God make Joe like this?<eos> We're asking God to heal him.<eos> So a prayer is to persuade God, who we must never question, to admit he's made a mistake and correct it.
Mm-hmm.<eos> Your life is about to change, my friend.<eos> Fresh air and sunshine, anytime you want it, for just pennies a day.<eos> It just seems that if there's an open roof...<eos> There is no ejector seat, Jimmy.<eos> Oh, I can't get enough of that.<eos> It's called "new car smell."<eos> How much do they charge for that?<eos> It's free.<eos> Oh, we'll take it!
(quietly): Not now, Burt.<eos> I'm doing something here.<eos> It does sound like you've learned your lesson.<eos> Yeah. I guess everybody makes mistakes when they're younger.<eos> I'm gonna help you folks out.<eos> Hey, Dennis, some idiot parked in my handicap spot.<eos> I'm gonna call a tow truck, but you might want to check it out.<eos> It's your dream car. (gasps)<eos> I wish I was rich enough to waste money on a sweet ride like this.<eos> I feel dirty just being next to it.
- That way!<eos> That's where!<eos> Here is your statement, Mrs. Gutorova.<eos> We forgot to have you sign it.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> - Can I use your pen?<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> And this is the driver's statement.<eos> Sobolev's.<eos> Read it.
Oh, my God.<eos> That makes me feel so old.<eos> And I can't believe you read my essay.<eos> Well, I read your essays.<eos> I read all of them and I loved them.<eos> They're very complex, very sweet.<eos> They're very naive, they're very infuriating.<eos> You know?<eos> You did something that writers find really hard to do, which is, you know, find a voice.<eos> And I hardly even had to look for it, so--
Oh, God.<eos> - Uh, who's, uh, Pete?<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> Don't you worry about it.<eos> I like this.<eos> - I like the mustache.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Oh... it's kind of fun.<eos> - That's great.<eos> Probably gonna want to shave it off before the start of next quarter.
I talked to Herbert, I told him everything about us, and it's over.<eos> Mm. I know it's scary.<eos> I just got out of a long relationship, too.<eos> But I'm here for you.<eos> And, girl, I ain't going nowhere.<eos> I need you to leave.<eos> Mm, so let's get it o... !<eos> Wait, what's happening?<eos> He wants to try to change.<eos> He wants a second chance, and I want to give it to him.
That's, uh, a lot to confide in me, Moira.<eos> Robert did.<eos> I know he reached out to you; whether I was supposed to know it or not.<eos> He had misgivings.<eos> He sought you out because he knew you did, too.<eos> But then he was murdered.<eos> And that should be a cautionary tale for both of us.<eos> And I've gone along with this for as long as I can stomach it.<eos> We started this to fix the Glades, Frank.<eos> To cure the city, not lay it to waste.
I'm sorry, that came out very wrong.<eos> Let's just keep our eyes open, Felicity.<eos> Hey, isn't that...<eos> You can just follow him over there, ok?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I would rather take my chances with a deadly jewel thief.<eos> Right.<eos> Hey!<eos> That broach was donated by the Queen family.<eos> If you want it, you're going to have to bid.
Yeah, right.<eos> (stomach growls) I can't do this.<eos> That was my stomach.<eos> Yeah, but it was talking to mine saying, "Stop this insanity."<eos> Please stop yelling... my head feels like it's splitting in half.<eos> This is nuts.<eos> Why don't we just order a pizza and adopt?<eos> There are a lot of children out there in need of a good home.<eos> No, no, we must remain strong.<eos> Just go downstairs, cut up an apple and we'll share it.
Sir, there's something you need to see.<eos> What was so important that you had to tell them, Alex?<eos> Was it that you've been trying to get your grubby hands on his money?<eos> You think he tried to write something in his own blood?<eos> I can't think of another reason for there to be blood on just the tip of one finger like that.<eos> And there's something else.<eos> I could be wrong, but a line?<eos> Was any of the area cleaned?<eos> No, no, I secured the scene when I got here.<eos> But the killer could have wiped it clean?
Anything to stop my hu...<eos> Roger from making a horrendous mistake.<eos> I knew it wasn't a real relationship, she was just stringing him along.<eos> And the only person who couldn't see it was Uncle Roger.<eos> So you thought you'd show him exactly what kind of woman you thought she was?<eos> Yes, and we were right.<eos> The detective we hired brought these, just before we went to the house.<eos> She met that man in secret.<eos> But it was in an alley behind one of the bars.<eos> The detective was moving to get a clear shot of his face, but he disappeared before he could get it.
Well, it doesn't look like he'll be bamboozaling tonight after all.<eos> Monty, if you knew Mr. Preston was trying to steal your trick, then why use him as a volunteer?<eos> Because he'll go nuts trying to figure it out.<eos> And you know why?<eos> It's not a trick.<eos> It's real magic.<eos> Well, look, that's kind of why we're here, Monty.<eos> We need you to hand over whatever it is you're using to levitate these people.<eos> You don't hand over magic.<eos> You earn it.
He's got a partner.<eos> And Myka doesn't know that.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Detective, I have the jawbone.<eos> Look, I don't want any trouble.<eos> Okay?<eos> I just want to take Adelaide home.<eos> Reach for your gun slowly.<eos> And slide it over to me.
Uh, for good reason.<eos> The bike messenger was a strangler.<eos> Even so, this is at least six cases that the creature's interfered with.<eos> Not that I have proof of all six, but...<eos> I think this is enough to go to Joe.<eos> Joe?<eos> Who's Joe?<eos> My boss.<eos> Without the samples that got stolen, I needed a few new matches before I could approach him about forming a task force to track down this thing.<eos> I thought you didn't want to catch it-- y-you wanted to understand it, cure it.
Oh, I know you are.<eos> I'm ignoring you.<eos> Look. We're at a bit of a disadvantage in this whole race for the cure.<eos> Team Klaus has Jeremy the hunter, team Shane has Bonnie the witch.<eos> If you're here to remind me of our last place status, I'm very well aware.<eos> Actually I have a plan.<eos> The cure is buried with Silas, that ancient evil guy my brother Kol is afraid of.<eos> Shane was so eager to prove his existence that he gave away that he has on of the keys to resurrecting him, his headstone.<eos> I see.<eos> You want to steal it.
You didn't dagger Kol.<eos> Well, the white oak stake pointed at my heart made things a little difficult.<eos> I do believe my brother Kol has finally lost his mind.<eos> Jeremy's still alive, and I took care of Damon.<eos> So where'd you put it?<eos> The headstone? Mm-hmm.<eos> Some place safe.<eos> Wasn't really our deal.<eos> Well, considering that you've betrayed me twice and I've betrayed you never,<eos> I think I'm acting brilliantly, especially since we have no idea why that guy was looking for it.
They adore Taillard.<eos> Stéphane, give us ideas for the Minister's reply, and Arthur you polish it all, on a single<eos> A5 card. The way he likes it.<eos> I'm due back at the bar.<eos> The House's hotspot.<eos> Duferrand agreed to ask the question, but wants it written out.<eos> Who's the lucky guy?<eos> Arthur!<eos> Since you're writing the answer, write the question.<eos> Punch it up a bit, so it rings true.
I mean, you make a connection with your therapist and you don't know if it's real or it's because you're slipping<eos> 200 bucks a session into their G-string.<eos> No, no. What we had was real.<eos> I remember that one time we bumped into each other in that bar.<eos> I wouldn't have sat there telling you about my divorce till 3:00 in the morning if we didn't have some kind of connection.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, you still single?<eos> So I've been told repeatedly.<eos> Well, I have a confession.<eos> I left my copy of "Eat Pray Love" at your house after my last session and I always sort of hoped you'd find it and give me a call.
And neither is marriage, but you can't just bolt when things get hard.<eos> - No. You're right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My place is in Jill Werner's bony, punishing arms.<eos> Besides, if Carmen felt the same, she would have reached out by now.<eos> Some small gesture, but she hasn't.<eos> Yeah.<eos> L... let's go home.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Let's take our sap, run it through the reverse osmosis filter, boil it, evaporate it, bottle it... and then go home.
Fists like hams.<eos> (Laughter) Frightening.<eos> Looks like a crack house.<eos> Max, we've looked at like a bajillion playhouses already, and you've hated all of them.<eos> One you even called "a blight on society."<eos> That's a little much.<eos> Or not.<eos> I don't know what "blight" means.<eos> Julian, a man's home represents who he is.<eos> Well, why don't we just build it ourselves?
Don't do it for me.<eos> You should do what feels right.<eos> My marriage doesn't feel right.<eos> Neither does an award for leadership or integrity.<eos> You know, Clinton was one of my favorite presidents.<eos> You are so not helping.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Tess and Heather gave me an ultimatum-- you or them.<eos> Catherine, the photograph...<eos> I got it, and if she notices it's missing, I'll just tell her that I wanted it.
Okay.<eos> Okay, so let's just take care of that.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> You got a minute?<eos> Um, uh, yeah, sure.<eos> I saw you posted those pictures online.<eos> Yeah, people might want copies.<eos> I looked for the flash drive everywhere.<eos> I couldn't find it.
I saw someone, some thing pull you out of that wreckage.<eos> Okay, I... I want to talk about this, I do, but it's not a good time.<eos> Look, I just...<eos> Look, just tell me why you won't pursue it.<eos> Because I'm not a scientist.<eos> No.<eos> You're a homicide detective, and this thing kills people.<eos> Criminals.<eos> It kills criminals.<eos> There you go again, protecting it.
How long have you been married?<eos> 10 years.<eos> I met him in Washington.<eos> Hoffmann was working in the French embassy.<eos> Do you live together or apart?<eos> I asked for a divorce and he refused.<eos> But you still wear your ring.<eos> One day he said if I took it off, he would cut my finger off.<eos> Nicolas doesn't joke, he has no humour.<eos> So I wear it.
There are rules.<eos> Your wife's arse is your territory?<eos> Don't play this game with me.<eos> I'm your only alibi and the gun that killed Véronique Parant has your prints on it.<eos> Do as I say.<eos> I will confirm your alibi and give back the gun.<eos> Otherwise?<eos> I want to hear your agreement.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> The decision is a difficult one. But you won't regret it.
'I'm sorry.' That's easy to say.<eos> Everyone can say that but I fear it's not enough.<eos> Do you know what you should do?<eos> Open your trousers, take your balls out, put them on the ground, then I'll kneel down and lick your balls. Is that alright?<eos> Now go to hell!<eos> - Pardon?<eos> He didn't say that.<eos> He didn't say that.<eos> This is about confidence, Kumberger.<eos> If I bring you my car, I expect to get it back in perfect working order.
I had a difficult time letting go, too, so I get it.<eos> Okay, this is not about control.<eos> Oh, it's a little bit about control.<eos> Well, can I take some time to think about it?<eos> Take all the time you need.<eos> You know change is tough for me, but letting you into my life was the best thing I've ever done.<eos> Go on.<eos> If my baby wants a band to play, then that's exactly what she'll get.<eos> So cheers to our new rock night.<eos> But we do it on Sunday night, all right?
What -- what do you mean she won't get up?<eos> Well, go and try again.<eos> I did.<eos> I'm really scared.<eos> I need my mommy.<eos> I need you now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, here's what I need you to do.<eos> Um, you know your Julia doll?<eos> Can you go get it and rock her to sleep until mommy gets home?
"What did yöu get by making me cry?"<eos> "Don't let my thought ever cross yöur mind."<eos> "Without me.."<eos> "Without me.."<eos> "Without me.."<eos> 1000 kilos of cocaine, will be delivered tomorrow afternoon<eos> ..to the special chamber of the Versova warehouse.<eos> The computerized lock will open..<eos> ..Only through the CD that I sent yöu.<eos> Collect the consignment and keep it in yöur warehouse.
- What?<eos> yöu already did?<eos> - I made them do it, sir.<eos> Very good, Vishwas.<eos> Very, very good.<eos> Very, very bad.<eos> Because I still have my weapon.<eos> Come on, Commissioner.<eos> Throw down yöur weapon.<eos> Throw it.
BSE was theirs.<eos> How do you know all this?<eos> I'm Philip Carvel's daughter.<eos> I was smuggled out with him when I was four.<eos> I've been on the run ever since.<eos> Did you pricks give me heroin?<eos> We had to, for the pain.<eos> Oh.<eos> Hope it wasn't Afghan.<eos> Taliban have been altering it for years to make us infertile.
We can sing ourselves a song, or tell ourselves a little story.<eos> A story of a bully-- a gray fox-- and a little brave man-- a rat-- that stood up for his chubby little buddy the toad and his friend egghead.<eos> The story of a man in a tuxedo who snaked his way through a crowd to meet a woman in a colorful dress.<eos> Penguin, cobra, three squirrels, and a parrot.<eos> The story of flight...<eos> An owl, a bat, a moth, all...<eos> Ah, I sense I made a mistake.<eos> No moth.<eos> Well, perhaps my prediction will explain my error.<eos> Uh, Jeanette, could you read it out, please?
Edward, you must attend to the peace treaty with France.<eos> I have kept it from your door this week as much as I could but, now that Charles of Burgundy has been befriended and France has been left out, it cannot wait.<eos> I will attend to it tomorrow.<eos> But now, cousin, feast with us, for we have won everything that we set out to and I wish to see you happy.<eos> How is it that I've allowed you to wear so many clothes?<eos> I cannot think.<eos> What's the point of being king if I cannot keep you naked all day long?<eos> We shall have to change this room, Edward.<eos> It's too odd to have Margaret of Anjou's things about us.<eos> Change it as you wish.
In the galley.<eos> And give her this.<eos> God knows she'll need it.<eos> Why have we stopped?<eos> We must make sure the castle isn't taken.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Hup!<eos> Hup!<eos> This is too much, Elizabeth.<eos> Once the magic is out, you cannot call it back, and it may turn round and drown us too.
I really never imagined you'd do that.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Me?<eos> Oh, I was just checking in on you.<eos> Wanted to say hi, see if you're, um, doing better or...<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm so glad. 'Cause, you know, life can be scary.<eos> Life has much intense and you kind of just have to, like, ride it like a pony or you'll get a haircut, so...
I don't think I can do this.<eos> You can.<eos> You know you can.<eos> I need to be lettin' you go.<eos> So you came to me to find your voice again?<eos> Sometimes you gotta blow up the box.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I came to pick up my big brother.<eos> Where's my guitar?<eos> I'm gonna get it back for you real soon, I promise.
They finish last and...<eos> Down a Gibson.<eos> Not if we keep writin' songs like that, you don't.<eos> Yeah, well, I just hope somebody... Will do more than just put a hold on it and cut the damn thing.<eos> Or we could perform it ourselves.<eos> Winter fest is coming up.<eos> Yeah, you... you don't want to be going to that.<eos> It's not your thing.<eos> Why is it not my scene?<eos> Avery's playing it.
Previously on "Once Upon A Time"...<eos> - Uhh! - What the hell is that?<eos> - It's poison.<eos> - We need to get him back.<eos> - The captain's ship.<eos> The "Jolly Roger" instead of a car?<eos> It's Regina.<eos> She's working with Cora to find Gold's dagger.<eos> The dagger controls him.<eos> If Cora gets it, she can force Gold and all his power to do her bidding.
It's just, uh...<eos> Sweetheart, I... I'm dying.<eos> I'm... I'm so sorry.<eos> I know that you're... you're confused about who you are.<eos> So I'm gonna tell ya.<eos> You are a hero who helped your people.<eos> You're a beautiful woman who loved an ugly man.<eos> Really, really loved me.<eos> You find goodness in others.<eos> And when it's not there, you create it.
Why should I let Victor ruin that too?<eos> You're saying you like that boy over there, and you wanna stay?<eos> What, Aidan?<eos> I mean, he's like my brother.<eos> It's nothing like that.<eos> - Well, you're all still minors.<eos> - Not for long.<eos> Josephine will be 18 in a few months, we're gonna have a life and each other here.<eos> - And hunting?<eos> - We won't go looking for it.
Call me old fashioned, but I simply have a healthy respect for scientific proof.<eos> Proof enough for you?<eos> I was diagnosed with cancer in 2010.<eos> I drank of the waters, I bathed in the waters.<eos> By last year I was cancer-free and have been ever since.<eos> Living proof, you might say.<eos> Might help that rash of yours.<eos> Father John said you tried to unlock Therese's door.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I think she must have locked it because she was smoking in there - she knew we'd disapprove.
Hmm.<eos> Did you look into Sister Marguerite's family's deaths?<eos> Yes.<eos> No suspicious circumstances.<eos> Also, the autopsy report is back.<eos> Sleeping pills were found in Therese's system, but no more than the prescribed dose.<eos> Sister Marguerite did not drug her.<eos> She's still first on the scene though.<eos> Could she have done something to the lock?<eos> Is there is a way to trip it, do you think?
It's ridiculous at my age, I know.<eos> How involved are you in his business dealings?<eos> Oh, very.<eos> We're a partnership.<eos> I'm very excited about the Holy Spring.<eos> You see, the pool might be in the convent, but I own the land where the spring finds its source.<eos> You own the land?<eos> Yes, it was left to me many years ago.<eos> Well, we thought it was worthless but then a nun gets cured, and then others.<eos> I'm hoping to sell it to the Vatican, once the waters have been sanctified.
Breathe.<eos> I hate surprises.<eos> All right.<eos> So here we go.<eos> Need a drink?<eos> Very quickly, very badly.<eos> She saved Harold's life.<eos> I could have lost him.<eos> She was counting the insurance money.<eos> Ooh, I wasn't counting it.
What are you talking about?<eos> We have a candle stand.<eos> We gotta do something.<eos> We gotta make money off this place.<eos> - By doing what?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's got grass and trees.<eos> What about picnics?<eos> Picnics?<eos> We should go into the lucrative business of people bringing their own food and eating it on our lawn?
Okay.<eos> What else?<eos> You'd have to be able to get in and out of her house, and her hotel room, while she was still in there.<eos> And... he would have to arrange for the victim to be at that hotel as well.<eos> All right, assuming that Basderic is the one who took those photos, he knew about their previous encounter.<eos> STOKES: I mean, it's been four months since Frank's Diner-- he's wanted to get back at her ever since.<eos> And who better than a crazed and obsessive sociopath to do it?<eos> He set her up.<eos> There's got to be evidence of it.<eos> Yeah, we just have to find it.
(Megan) Yeah. Like a... like a cold case?<eos> 'Cause I devour those shows.<eos> Um, I could really be helping you catch a killer right now.<eos> Could be.<eos> Wow. Oh, here it is.<eos> Box 5-0-9-6-5-4.<eos> Huh. It seems kinda light.<eos> (Rustles file folders) You're sure this is the right box?<eos> 1,000%.<eos> Could I see it?
A bird.<eos> (Laughs) What?<eos> (Laughs) You want to be a bird when you grow up?<eos> Yep, a red one, and I'm never gonna stop flying.<eos> I'm thirsty. I'm gonna get some water.<eos> No, no, wait, wait, honey, don't leave.<eos> So this was your father's study, huh?<eos> Yeah. It's also where he... where his body was found.<eos> So with everything in the house gone, what could that key possibly open?<eos> I don't know, but if he went to all the trouble to hide it, it must have been important.
Oh, yeah, like what?<eos> Oh, you know, it's like you can already hear them.<eos> You know?<eos> Like what? Like exactly what jokes do you hear?<eos> Tell me one of the jokes.<eos> Brian, all I have to do is start fake sneezing around you and you'Il spend the rest of your life outside.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, I can hear some of the jokes.<eos> Well, I guess you just never know what kind of rage some people have bottled up.<eos> Well, we all got anger, Chris.<eos> The important thing is finding a healthy way to channel it.
I know it will.<eos> I just know it will.<eos> Okay, Chris, I want to wear contacts, but I'm too squeamish to put them in myself, so you need to help me.<eos> Really? Is it that hard?<eos> My eyes are too sensitive.<eos> It's like they overreact or something.<eos> Ah, what happened to your eye? !<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Just put the lens in.<eos> But where do I put it?
Wh... who?<eos> Mr. Gold.<eos> I, uh, I don't know him.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> But you did.<eos> Shouldn't we be pillaging his shop or ransacking his home?<eos> That would be the obvious choice, yes, but Gold wouldn't risk crossing the town line and losing his memory<eos> - without entrusting the dagger's location to someone.<eos> - Belle.<eos> My guess is she hid it in one of her beloved books.
No, no, please.<eos> Please, just stay here.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> And you're sure this is where we're supposed to dig?<eos> Yes.<eos> Hook marked it clearly.<eos> Rumplestiltskin's dagger is here.<eos> Unless Hook lied to us.<eos> Well, then this map is useless.<eos> Gold is the only one who can translate it.
A waffle.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> That is a breakfast food.<eos> Oh, well, folks!<eos> Had one for dinner!<eos> It doesn't get much wackier than that.<eos> Actually, I think it gets much wackier.<eos> DJ Lance trance from France.<eos> His music will entrance you.<eos> If you let it.
There's also a minority-owned category.<eos> You don't know who your father is, and you do have an exotic look.<eos> Any chance he could be Native American?<eos> Yes, in fact, I think his name was Chief Running Away.<eos> Wait.<eos> Maybe we don't even need your father.<eos> We are white, which according to the last presidential election, is the new minority.<eos> So now all we need is a letter of recommendation from someone who owns another start-up business.<eos> I was thinking of a recommendation from Candy Andy's Sweets and Treats.<eos> I've already written it, so he just has to sign it.
We don't need it, but we could do a 3D ultrasound, get you a look at your baby.<eos> Yeah, maybe even print out some pictures for the president.<eos> - He's a busy man, isn't he?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He hasn't been able to make it here for any of your doctor's visits.<eos> Must be such a disappointment for him.<eos> Yes.<eos> But he will be here for the birth.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Secret service put a plan in place so he won't miss it.
If the DEA intercepts the submarine, they cut the torpedo loose.<eos> So, what, it's just sitting at the bottom of the ocean?<eos> The cartel will retrieve it once the coast is clear.<eos> So why were you so pissed?<eos> My show of anger got them to discount 15%.<eos> Business, Mike.<eos> Always business.<eos> I'm surprised they'd be so careless.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, I mean, a fishing boat could snag it, the feds could find it, or it could just disappear.
Sorry, man, I'm not risking my life for this.<eos> Ocean's too unforgiving.<eos> So am I.<eos> You think I haven't seen worse than you, bro?<eos> We are looking for a three-meter torpedo canister.<eos> It weighs at least a hundred kilos.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That's why I need you.<eos> Who else is looking for it?
The older girls will come to court.<eos> I want to keep Princess Elizabeth close to me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> They are witches!<eos> Henry must strengthen his claim, marry well.<eos> Princess Elizabeth.<eos> Lady Margaret says that such a marriage would unite the Houses of York and Lancaster and end these wars.<eos> Dear Henry and Jasper. We must make ready.<eos> I think this is our moment.<eos> He has his army and he will not waste it.
It's-<eos> - Just get a running start.<eos> I'm not jumping on that damn thing!<eos> Really?<eos> How about now?<eos> Son of a--<eos> Come on, run like you're younger.<eos> Okay, now give me your hand.<eos> Yes, you can!<eos> Come on, grab it!
- Just get a running start.<eos> I'm not jumping on that damn thing!<eos> Really?<eos> How about now?<eos> Son of a--<eos> Come on, run like you're younger.<eos> Okay, now give me your hand.<eos> Yes, you can!<eos> Come on, grab it!<eos> Grab it!
Not like this.<eos> Hey, Regina! Get away from my son!<eos> He's not yours. He's mine.<eos> And after I cast this, you'll never see him again.<eos> That's never gonna happen.<eos> You wanna kill Mary Margaret,<eos> Stop!<eos> Henry, get out of the way!<eos> Not until someone helps me destroy magic!<eos> There's no way to get rid of it. You can't just blow it up.
A wood pile of failure?<eos> Don't say that.<eos> You wanna help me?<eos> Leave.<eos> And don't tell anyone you saw me.<eos> So how'd you guys meet?<eos> Well, I was super late to work, rushing like crazy, guzzling my giant coffee, when this guy crashed into me.<eos> My coffee soaked my blouse.<eos> There was no time to change, so Neal gave me his scarf to hide the stains.<eos> And he said I could keep it or call him If I wanted to return it.
You know, she's not exactly cooperative, but that's all about to change.<eos> Right, Regina?<eos> You have no...<eos> idea who you're dealing with.<eos> Actually, no, you have no idea who you're dealing with.<eos> A couple of fools in over their heads who go around stealing magic.<eos> Stealing magic.<eos> That's what you think we're here to do?<eos> We're not here to steal magic.<eos> We're here to destroy it.
This is happening. (Fussing)<eos> Expect a subpoena today.<eos> (Presses button) (David) Okay, this is the memory card from Ohio.<eos> So he put it into the machine, and if it works the way James says it will, we can vote for Reston all night, and grant would still win in the final tally.<eos> (Tears paper)<eos> (Projector and camera shutter clicking)<eos> So this is what gave him Ohio.<eos> And Ohio gave him the presidency.<eos> - We need that memory card.<eos> - Maybe he keeps it at his house.
Come on, buddy.<eos> It doesn't have to end badly.<eos> Just trying to get you out safe.<eos> Are you still trying to catch that fly?<eos> Just kill it.<eos> Flies carry deadly diseases.<eos> Why do you think there's a "no-fly zone"<eos> over the White House?<eos> I can't kill it.
Look. If you care about me as a friend at all... $450! You won't do this.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I'll make you a deal.<eos> $475!<eos> You can keep the tape, but I would like to rent it on occasion.<eos> $480!<eos> Okay, but just once.<eos> $485!<eos> Go on.<eos> You have to watch it at our house, and you have to keep your pants on. $490!
Oh, no, it's just that we've seen your tape like, a thousand times.<eos> Yeah, you said that...<eos> like, 2,000 times.<eos> I remember the day we got it.<eos> We were getting ready to move into my brother-in-law's guest house and we bought a bunch of things at the church rummage sale, but we got more than we paid for.<eos> I wasn't really a sex tape kind of guy, but we'd been fighting and I thought, hey, this might shake us out of our rut.<eos> I've never seen anything like this.<eos> Why don't we ever role play as a maid and a yard guy doing it in an old haunted house?<eos> Your tape was heaven-sent.<eos> We watched it almost every night.

You gotta have someone who can keep the lights on.<eos> Dr. Shepherd was the chief of surgery.<eos> Yeah, for about ten minutes.<eos> Then you stepped down, own volition, no reason given.<eos> What my gut tells me is, you didn't like it.<eos> Surgeons like surgery. I know when I find something I don't like doing, I don't do it well.<eos> They're ready for you. Sorry.<eos> I have three meetings before I get on a plane.<eos> Thank you all so much for coming to me with this.<eos> I respect your passion. I share it. But I'm not feeling this.
Unless -- what kind of a sound did it make?<eos> Was it a cough or a wheeze?<eos> Like a [coughs]<eos> But did it also sputter?<eos> Like a ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka?<eos> No, it was more like kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh.<eos> Hello! Can you two please get a room -- preferably a soundproof one?<eos> Carburetor.<eos> Oh.<eos> If you get it over to my house, I'll help you fix it.
I did that to protect you.<eos> You used me as bait for the enemy!<eos> I did that to protect the organization.<eos> Why did you stand back and watch him die?<eos> I did that to protect myself.<eos> You stick with me, Kusanagi.<eos> I'll build a future for you.<eos> The pain is gone now.<eos> Section 9 and the review committee have formally cleared Lt. Col. Mamuro of suspicion.<eos> Thus, as his recommendation was renewed by a third party, we will implement it.
Dalia, this closet is bursting at the seams like a Christina Aguilera dress, which is not a comment on her weight, but rather on the tightness of her attire.<eos> I know.<eos> She really crams it in there.<eos> Just like me with my closet.<eos> I need a bigger one.<eos> We have enlarged the closets in your room four times already, and they were generous to begin with.<eos> Enough is enough.<eos> It's just my stuff, mommy.<eos> Dalia, this closet is an embarrassment.<eos> And you're gonna spend the rest of the day organizing it, do you hear me?
He therefore had no life to retire to.<eos> Happens to the best of us.<eos> So let me get this straight.<eos> You pay this guy to essentially raise your son, and you have no way of getting in touch with him?<eos> Yes, in case I was, say, tortured by my enemies in a secret underground bunker.<eos> Ever since I got into this business, I was a risk to my son.<eos> It was safer that I didn't know where he was and that Krieg checked in with me.<eos> So how did Amanda find him then?<eos> - Your gaming device.<eos> - What? Give it to me.
Bring me the briefcase and we'll talk, okay?<eos> Beckwith will have an exact time of death soon, but 'til then, I say we ballpark two, three days, see who's missing.<eos> And fingerprints, what, a couple days?<eos> Yeah, you know the lab.<eos> Hopefully, overnight.<eos> Look, Art, um, this shit with Paul is about to go sideways, okay?<eos> I need to get to the bank.<eos> Let me see your weapon.<eos> Huh?<eos> Come on, show it to me.
Oh, Michelle.<eos> Is everything okay? What can I help you with?<eos> It's Henry here.<eos> He hasn't done number two in five days.<eos> All right, you got this champ, come on.<eos> Mm, mm, mm.<eos> I'm going to tell you about the miracle that is the human digestive system.<eos> See now, great moments were born out of great opportunities.<eos> And this is your chance, Henry, to show everyone out there that you were born to do this.<eos> So, you know how when you have food, and you chew it up... num, num, num, num, num... the food's so good. Can you do this?
They kill my husband and took away my child.<eos> The police could never find him and they think I killed him.<eos> Did you bring the stuff?<eos> Did you drink the water?<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> One, two, Three!<eos> It is so little!<eos> Run!<eos> Take the base!<eos> Take it!
I'm not doing anything. God, Bullet.<eos> I wasn't gonna jump. Okay?<eos> I just wanted to look at the water.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> Look at it.<eos> Before the boats and garbage and people and stuff mess it up, it's so smooth and clean, you know?<eos> Like glass.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> I just wanted to look at it.
And I just walk right up to him.<eos> And he starts shaking, pissing himself.<eos> His nose broke real easy, but his eye-- the sucker was tough.<eos> Dug in tight and slippery.<eos> Six pounds of pressure, you can rip someone's ear off, but an eye... takes dedication.<eos> The whole time,<eos> Jimmy was squealing like a little stuck bitch.<eos> Prison's a disease.<eos> It gets in your blood.<eos> You pass it to your kids, and they pass it to their kids.
Did you order an airplane propeller?<eos> What?<eos> I'm looking at two guys holding an airplane propeller, and they say we ordered it.<eos> We did.<eos> We did?<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> I-I-I forgot to tell you.<eos> Um, I saw it on eBay.<eos> I thought it would make the air force guys feel more at home.<eos> Okay, so where do you want it?
Right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Can I get a check?<eos> Sure.<eos> Keep it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You want a slice of pie?<eos> Some girl just dropped it of.
Okay.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted. Seriously, I'm hungry.<eos> You want some lunch?<eos> I need chocolate.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We don't have anything sweet?<eos> What's that?<eos> Oh, a pie some girl brought in.<eos> She was trying to sell it.
Now eat that and shut up.<eos> Don't make me come back up here, you understand?<eos> Yes, Corporal.<eos> You want some?<eos> I'm working.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right. Now-- so the pie dough is about 2 to 3 inches bigger than the pie pan.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Now roll it around the rolling pin.
(Water running) What?<eos> General Holden, Denise Sherwood.<eos> So now if you don't go, I'm the bad guy.<eos> They're our friends. (Turns water off)<eos> (Dish clatters, silverware clinks) We're a family again.<eos> Why do you want to break us up?<eos> I don't.<eos> But for almost 20 years,<eos> I've gone wherever the army has sent you.<eos> Now I have a chance to do some groundbreaking work, for the army, by the way, and I want to take it.
My number, in case you change your mind.<eos> I won't.<eos> I'll call you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> I just met a guy.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Yeah, a real nice guy.<eos> At least, he seems really nice.<eos> Now I have a chance to do some groundbreaking work, for the army, by the way, and I want to take it.
A few days to a few weeks.<eos> Mm. He might not react at all.<eos> You hear that, David?<eos> I can drive you to the assembly point tomorrow.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Could we take my car?<eos> One last spin.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I won't let anybody touch your precious car while you're gone.<eos> Actually, it'd be great if you could drive it, like, uh, once a week, keep the oil circulating.
We will be legion.<eos> I was wondering when you'd make your entrance.<eos> The plan was to leverage Sir Clive's gambling debts against his interests, not his widow's.<eos> I saw an opportunity... and I seized it.<eos> It was impetuous and careless.<eos> It got the job done.<eos> How many times must I explain the difference between a vendetta and vengeance?<eos> This cannot become a war of attrition.<eos> The Order Draco is like the Hydra.<eos> Cut off a head, they grow two to replace it.
No, I don't want to be a dancer.<eos> I wanna be the foot ho.<eos> The what?<eos> The foot ho is the girl that sits at the host's feet, looks fabulous, gets all the camera time, and throws a ton of attitude.<eos> I'm gonna unseat that foot ho.<eos> Quiet! do you know what time it is?<eos> ! You better shut up, Doris!<eos> You better shut your face and shut the window, Doris!<eos> Shut the window, Doris!<eos> Shut it, bitch!
The one Bishop said he never met.<eos> Things just keep getting worse.<eos> Where'd you find it?<eos> One of the gym workers.<eos> They were having a celebration for the most membership sales.<eos> - He taped it.<eos> - Do the feds know about it?<eos> The tape?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> - We can't destroy it.

What about his friends and family?<eos> We did find an IP address in the database here.<eos> Came from a house in Maryland.<eos> Property records indicate that it's owned by a Gloria and Ronald Fowler.<eos> Yeah, and?<eos> Bryan Fowler.<eos> Their son, is a member of Freedom 13.<eos> We need to talk to him.<eos> No phone, but I do have an address.<eos> - Who wants it?
I'm an asshole!<eos> The asshole is the one that gave you a license!<eos> Hey wait!<eos> Who will pay for all this?<eos> Another woman who runs off... Story of my life.<eos> Dad, I'm hungry.<eos> Yes, Ksenia...<eos> Galina.. ... could you help me open my briefcase.<eos> - Press these buttons here. - These ones?<eos> Yes, open it, I have some sandwiches in here.
If we get the Pawnee Historical Society to declare your store as a historical landmark, then you might get enough of a tax break to keep your business afloat.<eos> That sounds like the government meddling in private enterprise.<eos> Well, Ron, we all know how much you love the free market.<eos> But the Pawnee Videodome is the only place in town where people gather to do something intellectual.<eos> That and the slam poetry nights at Beanie's Coffee.<eos> But I do not count those because those poems do not rhyme.<eos> Anything can be a slam poem if you say it like this.<eos> It's pointless. This man is a failure.<eos> He is not up to snuff.<eos> His business is failing, and you're bailing it out.
[ knock on door ] Sue Ellen.<eos> - El, your office is lovely.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So, what can I do for you?<eos> Please.<eos> I gave you a sizable loan to drill on Henderson land.<eos> - You stopped.<eos> - Because we hit a salt dome.<eos> Which I've heard is drillable.<eos> It is, but we have to sidetrack around it, which is gonna cost us more money than we have right now.
Caroline: I am so sorry. I wish I was there to help.<eos> Elena: Well, maybe there's something you can do from home.<eos> Anything.<eos> Tell me.<eos> So Shane's looking for the cure. We think we can find him.<eos> We have pictures of Jeremy's tattoo, but we just can't translate the map.<eos> Unless you get the hunter's sword from Klaus.<eos> Elena: Exactly.<eos> Rebekah: He'll never give up the sword.<eos> Yeah, but if anyone's gonna get him to give it up, it's Caroline.
No, it's ok.<eos> I just need a minute.<eos> I'm only gonna slow you down.<eos> Go.<eos> She only needs one of us.<eos> And what?<eos> You don't care to be that one anymore?<eos> You finally decided it was easier to just walk away?<eos> There's only one dose of the cure, Stefan.<eos> If she wants to take it, you want her to.
Thanks.<eos> So, what do we do now?<eos> Slap this baby up there?<eos> No, we're not going to slap anything.<eos> We're going to carefully apply the epoxied surface to the frame.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh.<eos> All right.<eos> How long's it take this glue to dry?<eos> We have to hold it in place for about ten minutes.
Hands at ten and two!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> It said turn left, not right.<eos> Hmm. What the...?<eos> Switching to male voice so you will obey.<eos> Finally!<eos> A supervisor!<eos> So the closest thing I had to an adult male role model were the schoolyard bullies.<eos> I dare you to stick this caterpillar down that girl's dress.<eos> Can't I just stick it in Skinner's sloppy joe?

Oh, my God!<eos> Do you know Billy-Bobaloo Skeeter-Rodriguez?<eos> Know him?<eos> Before he was famous, he kidnapped my mother!<eos> Mary, would you like to have dinner with me and my handsome, girl-crazy son tonight?<eos> I am the first boy to get my own liquor ad.<eos> Bart, you want to come with us?<eos> I need you.<eos> Mary, we've just been through three hours of music.<eos> Usually, I only have music one hour a week, and the teacher spends it reading real estate listings for Fire Island.
He looks like cobra commander.<eos> His touchdown dance is a little weak.<eos> What I would do, if I ever actually played football, is I'd do the dance before the play even started.<eos> Let 'em know what's up.<eos> - Right. - Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Very fun dance.<eos> - Timberlake.<eos> - I like it.<eos> Um, it's kind of stupid to do it before the play, 'cause then the opponent knows that you're gonna get the ball.
What up?<eos> What's up, man?<eos> What it is, what it is, what it should be.<eos> Did you bring some Jimmy hats, my main man?<eos> - Hell, no!<eos> - Oh, yes, nice.<eos> - Whoa. - No fear, I like that.<eos> I also like the clothing company.<eos> I have a shirt.<eos> I'll give it to you.
- It's stupid, okay?<eos> I went to the high school football game,<eos> I used the little kiddie urinal, 'cause no one else was using it, and now, all of a sudden, I have a little kiddie penis?<eos> - Come on, man, that's...<eos> - No, that makes sense.<eos> - Bathroom 101.<eos> - Yeah, everybody knows that.<eos> It's not true, okay?<eos> What, do you wanna see it?<eos> - You wanna see it? Huh? - Us?
Ma'am.<eos> So, you're buying cars...<eos> Hitting the cathouse.<eos> You just been enjoying your freedom, haven't you, Eddie?<eos> I didn't break any laws.<eos> Oh, you been in there a long time, so tell me, where'd you get all that money to have all that fun?<eos> Reynolds gave it to me.<eos> Now, why in the hell would he do that?<eos> All I know is, he showed up at my sister's place, a-and I thought he was gonna shake me down for some of my old contacts or something.<eos> Instead, he hands me a stack of cash, says all I got to do is buy a car and drop it off at his house.
Hey.<eos> Where to?<eos> Ellen once mentioned she liked to watch the tugboats from Brooklyn Bridge Park. Hmm, tugboats. Really?<eos> I know I'm grasping at straws.<eos> Moz, I'm not paying you for the ride.<eos> Oh, you are if we're going to Brooklyn.<eos> Honey, you know Neal doesn't want you looking into the key.<eos> Neal doesn't lie to me.<eos> He hides the truth.<eos> He withholds it, but he doesn't lie to me.
I was a stalker.<eos> It was back in Canada.<eos> I liked a guy and he didn't like me... and, well, I got a little obsessed.<eos> I'd fill up my journals all about him... and eventually, there may have been a teensy-weensy 50-meter restraining order.<eos> Fifty meters?<eos> That's like... four years.<eos> You must have been a total nut bag.<eos> I wasn't.<eos> Ted is right. There is a fine line.<eos> Anyone can cross it and get obsessed.
Who doesn't love the mall?<eos> Shopping with your friends and...<eos> I can't do this.<eos> Get this out of my face, please.<eos> Thank you. Pardon me. Thanks.<eos> Sorry. Even when Canadians are mean, they're polite.<eos> Her record producer, Chuck "Chuck" Gerussi.<eos> Robin Sparkles was big...<eos> Gino Vannelli big. Who I discovered by the way.<eos> Robin's next song, "P.S. I Love You'... was so dark, Dominant Records refused to release it.
Understood.<eos> Good.<eos> What do we do when the people start asking about the propane?<eos> Well, that has nothing to do with this.<eos> Oh, I know that, but some people might find it hard to swallow that we just happened to be stockpiling fuel right before a disaster.<eos> So, should we tell them the truth?<eos> That's your business.<eos> I have no idea what the hell you wanted with all that crap.<eos> You were more than happy to turn a blind eye, but... you're not dumb.<eos> I did what I had to do to keep this town from going broke, to keep it safe.
You handled things in the moment.<eos> That's good work.<eos> That means something to me.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Where's Ethan's truck?<eos> I have it.<eos> It's covered in blood.<eos> I'm gonna explain to you how you're gonna dump it.<eos> There's a gap in the fence about 3 miles up the mountain road.<eos> You're gonna drive it through there and into the woods.
I know, honey, and I will.<eos> I promise.<eos> Tomorrow, yeah?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> That was really good, how you were with her.<eos> There's no way in hell we're going to the police tomorrow... or any day, until we get that belt.<eos> Mom, don't do this.<eos> He's dangerous.<eos> I have to get back in that house.<eos> You know, I'll wait till he's asleep, and then I'll find it.
- This is a bad idea.<eos> - What?<eos> Letting him use you.<eos> I'm--I'm not gonna have this discussion with you.<eos> What if he wants more?<eos> What if he makes you do things, things you don't want to do?<eos> Well, what do you want me to say?<eos> Norman--<eos> Norman, why would you keep that thing, why?<eos> Why would you keep it, Norman?
You like fishing?<eos> Oh, um...<eos> Really?<eos> Well, then, I'm gonna teach you how.<eos> That's okay, I--<eos> I'll set the whole thing up with your mom.<eos> You're gonna love this, okay?<eos> Trust me.<eos> I have my own secret spot.<eos> Nobody knows about it.
I'm happy.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Alright.<eos> - You know what else my dad used to say?<eos> - What? You can be happy at home or work, but not both.<eos> Tough man, your dad.<eos> Highly pragmatic.<eos> Maybe he was wrong about that one.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But he told the truth as he saw it.
I think that you're working very well at your relation with me as your boss.<eos> And now you've got fantastic ratings. At any rate it makes me very happy.<eos> You know, I've thought of something.<eos> Something really exciting.<eos> Gender segmenting the news.<eos> Women look at 6 o'clock, men at 8:30<eos> Women are most interested in things close by.<eos> There has to be more of that at 6 o'clock, and international news at 8:30.<eos> What if there's important international news?<eos> Of course we'll report it then, but the in-depth analysis we keep for 8:30
Oh, no!<eos> Pawnee has been hit with...<eos> A tornado quake!<eos> This is Ron.<eos> Go ahead, caller.<eos> Hi.<eos> My Yorkshire Terrier has chewed up the legs on my kitchen table.<eos> Is there a cheap way to repair that?<eos> Great question.<eos> Take a walnut and rub it into the legs of your table.
Well, you'll see.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes, everything's fine.<eos> I saw the photo.<eos> I'm so happy for you.<eos> Have you seen what I found?<eos> Do you want it for the baby's room?<eos> Maman, you still haven't redecorated this room.<eos> But...<eos> I'd rather keep it as it is.
That's true.<eos> And I refused to compromise my art for fame and money.<eos> I'm like... like...<eos> Actually, I can't think of anyone who's ever done that.<eos> And although I'm not a real doctor,<eos> I did get to play one on TV.<eos> I had revenge sex with an old guy while Barney made out with a bearded woman.<eos> Barbara June!<eos> I got to second base with a bearded woman.<eos> If you're gonna tell a story, tell it right.
Does she need a signing person?<eos> I mean, I think we're supposed to provide one.<eos> No.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Okay, any distinguishing characteristics?<eos> Facial hair, scars, moles?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> He came up to order more tacos.<eos> And when I turned around, the second guy was taking the cash box,<eos> - and so I tried to grab it back from him...

- Let him sleep it off.<eos> - Ted, come on.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Drink that.<eos> - It's the pipes.<eos> The babysitter's agreed to stay... but no word from your mother, so I'm not leaving.<eos> She's probably still in the Catskills.<eos> Remember Rip Van Winkle?<eos> You like that story? I know it.<eos> I could tell it to you.
You say apartment, I say the brightest dot on the "Megan's law" website.<eos> Max, that is not charming.<eos> Stay on message.<eos> - We're charming, we're sorry...<eos> - We're drunk.<eos> Well, I am.<eos> How else do you think I'm gonna pull off charming?<eos> Let's just get in and out of there.<eos> That puppet creeped me out.<eos> I don't want to have to see it again.
Until she realized that forcing you to keep a secret from me wasn't gonna make the situation any safer.<eos> How long have you known?<eos> Since the accident.<eos> [ Chuckles ]<eos> I actually thought I was ahead of you this time.<eos> Getting that evidence isn't only about vindicating your father.<eos> It's about bringing Pratt to justice.<eos> He forced Hughes out of the FBI to keep that box hidden.<eos> I want to see what's inside it.<eos> And we're gonna find it.
Don't forget the extraordinary good looks.<eos> [ Both chuckle ] We're gonna find it.<eos> I know.<eos> So, everyone with a life has gone home.<eos> Everyone with a wife should have.<eos> She must be a very understanding woman.<eos> That's the understatement of the year.<eos> What can I do for you, Agent Callaway?<eos> Let's talk about Senator Pratt.<eos> I have this habit where I like to give every case a good once-over before putting it to bed.
[ Sighs ] Sorry. It's -- you know what?<eos> It's okay. I'm gonna go get adjusted to U.K. time.<eos> You want me to bring you some, uh --<eos> Can we get started?<eos> Listen, whatever plan you concocted to get the evidence box --<eos> We don't have a plan.<eos> Well, you better get one.<eos> Why?<eos> Two hours from now, an FBI team will be heading into the Empire State Building, and they won't leave until they find that evidence box.<eos> We need to find it first.
This operation will go 'round the clock.<eos> Also, I do not want any mistakes made with the chain of evidence.<eos> That's right. If you find the box, do not touch it or its contents.<eos> Notify me or Agent Callaway immediately. Understood?<eos> Yeah. Debrief your teams. We roll in 30.<eos> Peter, where's Caffrey? Home.<eos> I told him to sit this one out.<eos> How'd he take it? Not well.<eos> All right, our box is on 50.<eos> If we can get to it, how do we get it out of the building?
Quick, silent, efficient.<eos> What's your entry plan?<eos> Phase one -- caterers.<eos> Simple.<eos> White shirts, black pants.<eos> That'll get us straight through into the building's restaurant.<eos> Then phase two.<eos> I lifted these off the green peeps laundry truck. Fit right in with the FBI.<eos> Once the champagne stand is in place, we put on the greens, and we head upstairs.<eos> We get the box, and I deliver it to you. No.

Uh, this is Esther from the Rusty Egret.<eos> I thought we were confirmed you'd be here by noon, and it's almost 3:00.<eos> I'll try your cell again.<eos> Wait.<eos> The Suit actually gave you access to his house?<eos> Yes, Moz.<eos> Unwise.<eos> We should teach him a lesson.<eos> I'm thinking micro cam in a lampshade.<eos> He'll find it, of course, but that's the point.
You have to admit -- they are kind of sweet together.<eos> I hope that's the Stockholm syndrome talking.<eos> Burkes of Cobble Hill, keep up the good behavior, there might be some of my famous chow-hall casserole in it for you.<eos> Huh?<eos> - You sure they didn't give you trouble?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Hey, hon.<eos> - I see it.<eos> The second they realize they've kidnapped a federal agent, all bets are off.<eos> You packed your gun. Do you think you can get to it?
It was steak tartare.<eos> I wouldn't eat it.<eos> He didn't eat any either.<eos> 55 dollars for a sick hamburger!<eos> - You won't get that here.<eos> - Good!<eos> I've had it before, with game.<eos> If the meat's fresh, you don't have to worry.<eos> You eat raw meat?<eos> If you made it, maybe I'd eat it.
Albert Mabri Traoré.<eos> OK.<eos> Your pass.<eos> Hello.<eos> Why do engine problems always happen in shitty places?<eos> Why doesn't the engine break in Brazil?<eos> Or the Caribbean?<eos> For the cabin.<eos> Does it work?<eos> If they're selling it...
What?<eos> ! God, what kind of person do you think I am?<eos> I really think you might be insane.<eos> That was more of a rhetorical-- But I also think you make a big risk, to help some poor people who just want a better life for their family.<eos> And that, to me, is muy admirable.<eos> See?<eos> I knew you wanted to blow m -- Sorry, that was inappropriate.<eos> Although so was the response.<eos> Drop the weapon!<eos> Drop it!
The money I'd get wouldn't keep us in biscuits!<eos> It's Meadway, Meadway Animal Centre.<eos> Excellent. My best day.<eos> Oh, it's Meadway. They bring a few pooches and moggies for the residents to have a cuddle with.<eos> They're the local pet rescue centre.<eos> They get a bit of grant money for pet therapy so it's lovely, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we always enjoy it and they bring the older, more docile animals in for them and the pets get smothered with attention and the old folks get a furry companion for the afternoon.<eos> The problem is these, lot never want to let them go, so...<eos> I loves all animals, but Ivor's probably my favourite because he's always keen and he likes that ball, right, and he brings it back.
- Oh, for real?<eos> When I open my eyes a little and I see it's a white guy, eh, then I go with Johnny Depp.<eos> You appreciate the irony, right?<eos> Senseless arguments about who gets what bedroom, refusing to allow me to stay.<eos> - Now, nobody gets to stay.<eos> - Why is Frank here again?<eos> There's a small chance he'll be able to help since he's known Patrick longer than any of us.<eos> Patrick wants to steal our house?<eos> He's a contractor.<eos> He's gonna flip it.

Thanks.<eos> How are you this morning?<eos> Never better.<eos> Replacing the toilet with a low-flow model, much more efficient.<eos> I bet it lowers the water bill.<eos> Oh, without question.<eos> Patrick, we got off on the wrong foot.<eos> Sending Mickey Milkovich over with a baseball bat, hmm?<eos> Is that the foot you mean?<eos> If we let you take the house, will you rent it to us?
I don't want to be somewhere that I'm not wanted, so man up, tell me.<eos> I have a problem with you being here.<eos> You act like we had a conversation, never happened.<eos> That I said that it was okay for you to leave your stuff here and show up uninvited, do my laundry, and act like my wife.<eos> But we-- we never had that conversation, did we?<eos> I never asked you to be here.<eos> I don't fucking deserve this.<eos> You found a new house for rent?<eos> That's great.<eos> Landlord says it's ours if we want it.
For all of you who were too fucking busy, this is what happened last week on Shameless<eos> Why is that man driving your car?<eos> You let him steal it?
It's a mystery.<eos> What was all that about?<eos> You, Karen, the unfathomable male soul.<eos> Why aren't you in school?<eos> Skipping.<eos> Debs, we need at least one person in this family to not turn cynical, and my money's been on you.<eos> I made soup for Sheila.<eos> That's nice.<eos> I'm gonna drop by the hospital.<eos> I'll take it for you.
Look at that chip.<eos> That diamond-shaped scratch, I did that the night we had Jägerbombs.<eos> Hell, I still got the keys, man.<eos> - I found my stolen car, bitch.<eos> - What are you waiting for?<eos> Call the cops.<eos> I wouldn't do that.<eos> Sorry, passing by, couldn't help but overhear.<eos> I'd just take it home.<eos> Cops will keep it in evidence for a year.
Call the cops.<eos> I wouldn't do that.<eos> Sorry, passing by, couldn't help but overhear.<eos> I'd just take it home.<eos> Cops will keep it in evidence for a year.<eos> You're right.<eos> He's right, man.<eos> - Why is that man driving your car?<eos> - Because it's stolen.<eos> - You let him steal it?
I'm getting a little sick and tired...<eos> Watch this. (chittering) Go ahead.<eos> Go, go, go. (gasps) Oh.<eos> JEANNIE:<eos> Oh, this Marty does tricks.<eos> Good boy, Marty. Oh.<eos> (gasps)<eos> Oh.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Oh, Marty knows shit when he smells it.
Well, um, I know she loves playing the harp, so I found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favorite songs.<eos> Now, Amy already has a real harp.<eos> And it can play any song.<eos> What are you trying to pull here?<eos> No, I just thought it would be...<eos> Next.<eos> Okay. Um, I know she's a fan of The Canterbury Tales,<eos> Mmm.<eos> so I found... this cool map that illustrates the character's journey through England.<eos> I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.
And you picked me.<eos> It's like you said-- you're my girlfriend.<eos> Oh, Sheldon.<eos> Okay.<eos> Stop ruining Valentine's Day and order my pizza.<eos> Night.<eos> Yep.<eos> You know what?<eos> That was pretty crappy of you.<eos> I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and it's like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.
- I know that you had to make this choice, and you had to give something up for me.<eos> But I never want you to have to give up anything.<eos> I just thought if I could get us an offer, then there wouldn't be anything standing in our way, and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture... and show you all at once just how much I love you,<eos> and how much I really do believe in your future.<eos> Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?<eos> - About two months.<eos> - That's why it's so clean.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, you were gonna do this without me?<eos> Well, you-- you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.
Rex, it's who you are.<eos> No.<eos> It's part of me, but it doesn't define me.<eos> All I'm asking for, Jim, is a few years.<eos> After I retire.<eos> Somebody has to be the first professional football player to come out.<eos> Why not one of the best quarterbacks out there?<eos> Because I don't want to be known as "the gay football player."<eos> Jimmy, right now -- right now -- we have privacy.<eos> I come out, and I'd lose it.

Bye, Steve!<eos> Don't forget to crash and die!<eos> I won't Billy.<eos> Don't forget to have mom wash your balls for you!<eos> You're gonna burn.<eos> Stop it!<eos> This one's shorter.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Your jacket, sir.<eos> I'm gonna wear it on the plane, though.
Yeah, I, um...<eos> I know you think I have a problem with anger, Doc, and, uh...<eos> I guess you're right.<eos> Though I also have a problem with people not being angry... not being angry at senseless violence and our kids getting shot down in the street.<eos> Like that ten-year-old boy who got shot outside his home?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It got to you, didn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you do with all that anger?<eos> I just put it into catching the bad guys.
Dad, got the message.<eos> And apparently, so did Matty's parents.<eos> What do you have to say to Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton?<eos> I'm sorry I-I took your daughter's virginity.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Jenna?<eos> What?<eos> Apologize.<eos> For what?<eos> I am sorry for... letting him... take it?
- Yeah.<eos> What a bitch.<eos> Wait, was that the female inspector?<eos> Not in front of Toby.<eos> Hey, gluon line, we should probably get in it right now.<eos> Alternatively, someone might just happen to have a pair of tickets to the sold-out panel,<eos> "Which Inspector would win in a fight in space, and which Inspector would win in a fight in time?"<eos> We can get that photo later.<eos> Yeah, later.<eos> That was when I wanted to take it.
Joe leaves it behind for us to find, the girl quotes it.<eos> - We keep coming back to this story.<eos> Why? - It's about a plague on a city.<eos> I mean, people that feared death went to a palace for safety.<eos> Death found them anyway.<eos> So what are they planning... a group suicide, a mass murder, what?<eos> I mean, is that fitting for Joe's final chapter?<eos> Okay. So we're in metaphor land with Joe.<eos> If the cult is the plague...<eos> The red death... killed the people who feared it, who sought safety and refuge,
- Yeah, no, I know it was a joke.<eos> Spot.<eos> There's-There's a parking spot.<eos> I just finished rinsing out the Dumpster, and while I was buffing the backside, I found this--<eos> 4D.<eos> So, who gets the spot?<eos> - Me.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I never get anything.<eos> - I would like it.
Oh, really?<eos> And are you guys saying this because you don't want me to be with Jeanette, or because you want me to stay single so you guys can keep your clubhouse?<eos> J'accuse!<eos> I had a point, and they knew it.<eos> You see, in early 2013,<eos> I was the only single guy in the group.<eos> Which meant whenever Marshall or Barney bought something they weren't allowed to keep in their apartments... ♪<eos> You know what, Ted?<eos> That reminds me.<eos> I just bought this antique Swiss clock, but Robin won't let us put it in the apartment, so I was gonna leave it at your place.

Come on.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Yes, ed.<eos> I'll come up and see you guys tomorrow.<eos> Me, too.<eos> This... is 1948 dallanach.<eos> It was acquired in loch ness.<eos> I was up there looking for a very rare creature.<eos> All i found was a very rare bottle of scotch.<eos> I told myself that i would drink it If i ever found proof that...
Oh, shit.<eos> Good evening, Miss Burrell.<eos> Why don't you invite me in?<eos> Of course.<eos> Sookie Stackhouse, I'd like you to meet our faerie grandfather.<eos> He's gonna help us kill Warlow.<eos> - He said that when Warlow gets here-<eos> - He's here.<eos> We all want what's best for Emma.<eos> I gave Luna my word and I'm gonna keep it.
Enjoy your tea.<eos> She's got to get out of here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Miss Witham...<eos> Floyd Barker.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> The Dunns assured me you'd understand.<eos> Understand what?<eos> Their son's car.<eos> I'm here to fetch it.
Living.<eos> All the while, Europe's in shambles.<eos> It's a world away.<eos> Not if you got a telephone.<eos> Or a know-it-all husband.<eos> Listen, I was talking to Ellie upstairs while you were changing.<eos> She's going to take over the newsstand.<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> 'Cause I'm going to visit my brother in Perth County, help him with the harvest.<eos> You heard the radio, there's all this food but no men to bring it in.
I'm sorry, I don't have any juice, but I could get you some water.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I, er, I need you to tell me exactly when you last saw your sister alive.<eos> I told you yesterday, it would've been when I left for the spa, at about 1.45.<eos> And when you last saw June, she was wearing the zebra-print scarf?<eos> No.<eos> She thought she'd lost it.<eos> Lost it?<eos> Yes, it was new.<eos> Doug bought it for her. Duty free.

Duty free.<eos> Doug bought it?<eos> But when we, erm, started unloading the car at the villa, she couldn't find it.<eos> She must've found it again when we were out.
Uh, Toothless?<eos> Toothless!<eos> [owl hoots] How do we even know the Whispering Death made these holes?<eos> So you think it might be the other 2,500-pound rock-eating dragon we're following?<eos> I know what you're...<eos> Don't try to confuse me!<eos> Look at this.<eos> - He must have lost a Tooth.<eos> - Is it sharp?<eos> If it is, I want it.
My Stan gave me that.<eos> My dad.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> He sold his car to buy me that.<eos> Still, life goes on.<eos> DOUGIE: They're here for the ring, aren't they?<eos> It's so obvious. So obvious.<eos> They want that ring when she goes.<eos> Honestly, if I could, I'd have a word with Marge and say,<eos> "Look, why don't you sell it?
(mouth full): Two-zero, Jake.<eos> Face it, Dad, I'm not a kid anymore.<eos> Oh, baby, you got a milk moustache.<eos> (chuckles) You ready to go?<eos> Yep.<eos> Where you guys heading?<eos> Oh, we're gonna do a little shopping, pick up some souvenirs for my kids and pick up a new nipple gun.<eos> N-Nipple gun?<eos> Yeah, for piercing.<eos> You give me a body part, I can paint it, pierce it or plug it.
You know, it doesn't matter what you think of me.<eos> But why the hell do you have such a low opinion of your son?<eos> Because I know him!<eos> (sighs) Could be worse.<eos> He could be one of those showbiz kids who goes off the rails.<eos> All right, there's a 24-hour chapel in Vegas.<eos> If we hurry, we can get there before it closes.<eos> Yeah, I don't think we should go to Vegas.<eos> Why not?<eos> A wedding's supposed to be about bringing a family together, not breaking it apart.
Right.<eos> I just- - I want you to be happy.<eos> Thanks, and, you know, someday we are going to get married, maybe get a dog or a leopard, have a couple kids of our own-- maybe more than a couple, maybe, like, two or three.<eos> (mouthing)<eos> You're going to need a bigger house.<eos> ♪ Men. ♪<eos> ♪ Men. ♪<eos> You know, this place could really use a home gym.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> Where could we put it?
Manipulation.<eos> Arbitrariness.<eos> And the law was introduced, was fought for, to protect the citizens of a democracy from mala fide forces who benefit from arbitrariness and manipulation.<eos> That is the difference, the point where democracy becomes dictatorship.<eos> Which is why there are rules, procedures and laws that have to be adhered to.<eos> And not just if it happens to be convenient, but always.<eos> Kenny De Groot's basic rights were trampled on.<eos> It is not because his neighbours don't like him that he does not have the same rights as you and me and everyone else.<eos> Because the law guarantees equality.<eos> It must guarantee it.

- Who's Naomi?<eos> - What have I done to you?<eos> Do you have any idea what it's like out there?<eos> There's blood everywhere, and it's on your hands.<eos> After everything you did to us, to heaven.<eos> I fixed you, Castiel.<eos> I fixed you.<eos> Cass.<eos> I believe they're playing my song.<eos> You want it, take it.
But don't come running to me when your career suffers because your relationship with her makes you soft and complacent.<eos> Well, don't you come running back to me when you realize how difficult it is to live in a beek-Less world.<eos> This is serious.<eos> We should do something.<eos> They're breaking up!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I've got this.<eos> No! Too slow, ho.<eos> I stole spike Lee's baseball hat.<eos> I'm not wearing it.
Donnie just sent me an e-mail.<eos> He scheduled my audition for 9:00 a.m.<eos> 9:00 a.m.?<eos> that's way too early.<eos> You're puffy.<eos> You're sleepy.<eos> My instrument is cold.<eos> Which is the exact reason I knitted you that scarf.<eos> I'm not wearing a scarf to bed, Luther.<eos> Well, you're not wearing it outside, either, so why don't I just throw it in the trash?
She's gotta be around here somewhere?<eos> She was.<eos> Castle, there was a blood trail that led from the van, and it stopped.<eos> We think that the kidnappers changed cars.<eos> Whose van is it?<eos> It was stolen a week ago.<eos> Any fingerprints?<eos> CSU is looking.<eos> We've got uniforms canvassing the area.<eos> Castle, listen, if there is a lead, we are gonna find it.
Previously on "Castle"...<eos> That's Sara El-Masri.<eos> She was abducted.<eos> I will pay anything.<eos> She's my only child.<eos> They took Alexis, too.<eos> She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.<eos> If there is a lead, we are gonna find it.
But it's your box.<eos> And now it's yours.<eos> My-my box?<eos> Your box.<eos> So, if you could just take it off my desk, please.<eos> Just to clarify, you're giving me your box?<eos> Okay.<eos> What's in it?<eos> What's in the box?<eos> Open it and find out.
At the cost of many angels' lives.<eos> You screwed with his head and had him spy on us.<eos> Well, it is true that I have spoken with Castiel many times.<eos> Trying to reach out to him, trying to help him.<eos> Dean, you must have noticed how purgatory changed him.<eos> I mean, he's been unstable in the past but I was shocked at how damaged he is now.<eos> Stop, okay? Don't try to spin this.<eos> You think I don't know that you told him to try and kill me?<eos> Yeah, I suppose that is how he would hear it.<eos> When I learned of the angel tablet, I did tell Castiel to get it at any cost.
They didn't talk about the 'party soldier' for nothing.<eos> What makes you think they could find more?<eos> Photos from that time?<eos> Compromising information?<eos> I have no idea what lies ahead... but if they find something, I can assure you it's harmless.<eos> Thank you.<eos> -I'll go get a pack of cigarettes.<eos> Listen up.<eos> I believe I have a small red star lying around somewhere.<eos> Would it be compromising if I put it on every so often?
- Everything cool?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, there.<eos> You got a second?<eos> - Tell me!<eos> - It's just me, I swear!<eos> No one else knows ...<eos> I swear!<eos> Didn't you just detail it?<eos> The only time I wash my car is right before I sell it.
I love my life, and I love this farm.<eos> It's everything to me.<eos> Yet you filed for heritage landmark status.<eos> Because I thought that Chelsea was being impulsive in selling our family's plantation.<eos> I mean, our ancestors are buried on that land.<eos> I was just trying to buy enough time to convince her to embrace our past, but Chelsea was ashamed that our family used to own slaves.<eos> But you aren't?<eos> I'm not proud of it, but I'd be a hypocrite to deny where we came from.<eos> You know, my Nana always said that the past was far more complicated than we could ever possibly know.<eos> She believed that Martha's spirit is in that house, and so do I, and I'm not going to sell it until I figure it out.
Yeah, silica-based brick, common at the time because of its resistance to moisture, but the Bakers were broke.<eos> Why would they be looking to buy such an expensive watch?<eos> She wasn't looking to buy a watch.<eos> She was looking to sell, which means I think I know what Chelsea was doing right before she was murdered.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I still don't know why you needed a medical examiner.<eos> Everybody in this crypt has been dead for a long time, amigo.<eos> It's definitely the same substance we saw on the front of Chelsea's clothes, which puts her here, but why?<eos> Well, Chelsea was having a virtual fire sale of all of her family's heirlooms.<eos> Once she found out how much her great-great-grandfather's antique pocket watch was worth, she was down here in a flash to yank it off Yankee Dan.
What happened to privacy?<eos> Maybe if she didn't take such long showers, I wouldn't have time to go through her stuff.<eos> How are you ok with a third roommate?<eos> Because we're trying to be functional.<eos> And being functional means we need friends.<eos> We also need personal space.<eos> I mean, what if we suddenly get a craving and I want to eat her?<eos> Or our blood bags go bad because we can't store them in the mini-fridge?<eos> And what the hell is protein water?<eos> You know what? Maybe if I drink it all, she'll want to move out.
You remember me.<eos> Yeah. I remember you.<eos> You got Rebekah and me drunk and robbed us.<eos> But it was fun until then, no?<eos> How did you know how to find me?<eos> Let's skip the how and get to the why.<eos> This wasn't mine to take.<eos> You traveled 4,000 miles to give me back a ring?<eos> Hey, if you don't want it-- No.<eos> I want it.
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...<eos> He's dead.<eos> No, no!<eos> I can't, I can't!<eos> I can help you.<eos> Turn it off.<eos> We're gonna lose her, Damon.<eos> She's ruthless without her humanity.<eos> The cure's the fastest way to get it back.
Well, you said we could all be friends with you as long as we kept your secret.<eos> What secret?<eos> I don't know.<eos> If they so much as even scratch the paint on my car.<eos> Why don't you just be grateful sheriff Forbes was able to track down the car after you let them, uh...<eos> You know, steal it from you.<eos> Remind me to send her some mini-muffins.<eos> Do we really need 10 gallons of gas or are you making me just lug this around as punishment?<eos> Well, they ditched your car after it ran out of fuel.<eos> We got to fill it up.
You want to be friends?<eos> Friendship--stage one.<eos> Show me that I can trust you.<eos> I saved your life... twice.<eos> Because you put it in danger... twice.<eos> Why can't you just do something decent for once?<eos> Because Tyler Lockwood tried to kill me.<eos> We've all tried to kill you.<eos> And you've tried to kill most of us.<eos> How do you think that you deserve my friendship when you've done nothing to earn it?
That's a bit of a leap to bombing a reunion, isn't it?<eos> It really had nothing to do with the reunion.<eos> The school board just voted to eliminate gym class from the district junior highs.<eos> Sean got all bent out of shape, demanding that they rethink their decision.<eos> Of course they didn't, he's out of a job.<eos> Now, where do you think the school board is gonna meet next?<eos> Sagebrush High, school cafeteria.<eos> And the entire school board is gonna be sitting along that very same wall where we found that bomb.<eos> So the reunion was not the bomb's target.<eos> It was the opportunity to plant it.
When I was five, I dressed up my dad as Tinker Bell and we had a tea party and I recorded the whole thing.<eos> - Give me the Dreamcorder.<eos> - Run, Sam, hide it.<eos> I'll pay you 100 bucks if you show me later.<eos> 200 if you put it on YouTube.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't care what she does with it.<eos> I looked damn good in the wings and the blue eye shadow.<eos> Okay, so why did you turn Kate down for the study?<eos> Because there's no grant unless we both do it.
Especially being thrown off balance by the giant fairy wings.<eos> So whenever you feel the urge to steal, remember to take a deep breath and realize that this is all just part of your compulsive disorder.<eos> It will pass.<eos> Now give me back my fountain pen.<eos> And my stapler.<eos> And my phone.<eos> By the way, you're very good.<eos> Oh, Charlie, what are you doing here?<eos> Waiting for you to realize she just stole your watch.<eos> She'll bring it back.
I'm gonna die.<eos> Ma'am are you there?<eos> Hello.<eos> Ma'am are you there?<eos> Hello.<eos> You hear that?<eos> That call came in at 11:59 from our vic--Val Butler.<eos> She's an ad exec downtown.<eos> First responders came moments later.<eos> That door was locked and that couch was in front of it.
All right, see you later.<eos> We're going to Malibu.<eos> No school today.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, really.<eos> She was dead.<eos> Her eyes were open.<eos> But she was still there, man.<eos> Her soul was there.<eos> I could feel it.
- Look how handsome you are.<eos> - Who's Tommy?<eos> I just got a video.<eos> I think it's of me doing something I shouldn't have been doing.<eos> Like what?<eos> What are you doing in it, Tommy?<eos> I'm sucking dick, all right?<eos> I'm learning a lot about my addictions right now.<eos> Listen to me, Tommy.<eos> Send it to me right now and then delete it.
So, so he must have had some way of recording it?<eos> A camera. The camera!<eos> The camera was attached to the radiosonde, but the duck wasn't fixed properly.<eos> Maybe he didn't have a chance to secure it because he saw his attacker approaching.<eos> But Camille, what if the camera was recording?<eos> It might have caught something. Yeah.<eos> A glimpse of the killer.<eos> Their voice.<eos> The answer could be on that camera.<eos> Yes, but how are we going to find it?
Hey, look what I found.<eos> It says "Lucy loves Tom".<eos> It must be the same Tom, mustn't it?<eos> Yeah, I suppose so.<eos> And this must be Lucy's room.<eos> I wonder how she died?<eos> You... know.<eos> I found a letter for me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I want to read it!
Yeah, I see your point, Paul.<eos> But I was thinking maybe we could... compromise?<eos> That word again.<eos> I fucking hate it.<eos> So, that's a "no"?<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.<eos> So, you were saying that you've sold your estate agency.<eos> It's all part of it, Barry.<eos> Busting my guts trying to keep it going, you know.
I gotta go.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> Nice walk?<eos> Please, everyone.<eos> Help yourselves to more.<eos> Life goes on.<eos> Mr. Felwood and me would like to thank you all for your help with the harvest.<eos> - Harry. - Thank you.<eos> Still got that letter?<eos> Let's burn it now.
London.<eos> Where it's all happening.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're going to be hard to forget.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Nick!<eos> Are you free?<eos> I'm sorry I got so upset about the letter.<eos> I was confused.<eos> And you didn't want me to see it.
Oh, you want a split down the middle?<eos> Here you go.<eos> You can go.<eos> It's green.<eos> Is that really necessary?<eos> A honk's the angriest sound a car can make.<eos> You hate that song.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> It didn't feel that way.<eos> Yep, you hate it.
Er...<eos> Could you race a train if there...?<eos> Can you just let me get out the car park? Yeah.<eos> Could you race a train?<eos> If there was a motorway, right, and there was a train track, what would win if they was both straight, both going the same place?<eos> If it was a Lamborghini...<eos> What would win between a unicorn and a gerbil?<eos> It's stuff that wouldn't meet.<eos> If they did meet they wouldn't sort of have a disagreement.<eos> The unicorn's got a horn, but if the gerbil bit it, it had AIDS - not AIDS, rabies - it would kill it.
Why didn't I come up with that then?<eos> Ol' Brad was a bit of a theater guy, too.<eos> When I was a kid, I was in an all-white production of "The Wiz."<eos> No one really eased on down the road.<eos> It was more of a stiff, uncoordinated lumbering.<eos> Love-ing it!<eos> Really? !<eos> So you're gonna put the play on?<eos> No.<eos> I drove all the way here, didn't like what I had on, went home to change, stopped at the new whole foods so I could peep the crazy ripped Guatemalan stock boy, just so I could come here and tell you I won't put it on. (Chuckles) So does that mean you're putting it on or not?
Jun!<eos> You alright?<eos> I found it<eos> You must be hungry.<eos> Have some supper<eos> I told you not to touch the wound<eos> Come here<eos> Come on out<eos> It'll leave a scar<eos> Let's clean it before you eat
Which I did a short 18 months later.<eos> Goal number two:<eos> Create your own software company that revolutionizes the industry standard for information transferral at blinding speeds.<eos> (dial-up modem whirring)<eos> Hear that?<eos> 56k dial-up.<eos> In four hours,<eos> I will have downloaded the entire Spice Girls album.<eos> (laughing)<eos> After building your company from the ground up, you will sell it for... one million dollars.
I lost my other earring.<eos> Leave it to me.<eos> Earring. Oh.<eos> Thimble from Monopoly game.<eos> Wondered where that was.<eos> $25 casino chip. Oh.<eos> The smallest nesting doll.<eos> Can you find anything you like in this bed?<eos> Just my honey pie.<eos> Want to split it while we snuggle?
The media will have a field day if the room's empty.<eos> Ww have to rustle up some more people.<eos> - There's more.<eos> I haven't slept wink. I've been thinking things over.<eos> All the founders of the party have made a courageous choice.<eos> We can't just give up.<eos> If we don't do something drastic, we won't make it.<eos> I think I know what we have to do.<eos> You can read my statement before the others get it.<eos> Read it.
Sam!<eos> Last time you couldn't reach her was because of a Christmas play.<eos> Christmas is over.<eos> Sam!<eos> Hey!<eos> I'd still like to see another one.<eos> What do you suppose was in that letter?<eos> "Don't look behind you"?<eos> It was probably just a plant to lure him there and distract him.<eos> Well, whoever planted the letter must have called Varlamov to tell him to look for it.
No, no, no. No, you just put it in a lunar orbit and send some guys up there.<eos> I think it's really simple, actually.<eos> Is she looking at me like an angry schoolteacher?<eos> - Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> She does that a lot.<eos> - We're here to work.<eos> These bones have been heavily scavenged.<eos> The three-cornered puncture marks indicate coyotes.<eos> Oh, do you think they ran off with the head?<eos> We've got techs searching the area for it.
Boats!<eos> What's this a commercial for again?<eos> I can't quite...<eos> Boats, boats, boats!<eos> Oh, get a room, you two.<eos> You weren't there.<eos> I was, too.<eos> All right, you were there?<eos> Tell me the story.<eos> I like the way you tell it.
I can't quite...<eos> Boats, boats, boats!<eos> Oh, get a room, you two.<eos> You weren't there.<eos> I was, too.<eos> All right, you were there?<eos> Tell me the story.<eos> I like the way you tell it.<eos> Please, I insist.<eos> Okay, we'll tell it together.
I know-- me, too.<eos> Barney, you weren't there.<eos> Why is it so important that you be part of this story?<eos> Because crazy stories are my thing.<eos> You have architecture,<eos> Marshall has the law,<eos> Lily has art,<eos> Robin has pleasing me sexually.<eos> You all have a passion that drives you.<eos> Well, if I have a passion, it's taking life and turning it into a series of crazy stories.
What happened to her is a tragedy.<eos> That's a sentiment I intend to echo at the press conference you're about to arrange, unless of course this is your roundabout way of tendering your resignation.<eos> Ah.<eos> Didn't think so.<eos> How's Jack?<eos> Oh, the doctors say he could wake up at any time.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Not exactly.<eos> Your deadline is imminent, Ms. Lahari.<eos> Fail to meet it, there will be consequences.
It only clouded my judgment.<eos> So back to basics?<eos> No more distractions.<eos> Grace, can you come here?<eos> What time have you got?<eos> Uh, 7:40, why?<eos> This clock's running slow.<eos> You mind taking it to the shop?<eos> No problem.<eos> If you like it, you can keep it.
[Farts]<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> That's Andre's people.<eos> They're a bunch of characters.<eos> That's a good one, dad.<eos> - Oh, I brought something. - Oh.<eos> Dip.<eos> Oh, Abed, why is this seven layer dip so puffy?<eos> Oh, it's been in the fridge for two years.<eos> I was saving it for a special occasion.
Bart Crowley.<eos> Why?<eos> The case had gone cold and-and Crowley approached me about doing a news segment.<eos> He'd been on this story since the beginning.<eos> Hell, he's the one who coined the name the Dead Rose Slasher.<eos> I figured we'd get that sketch out there and reboot the investigation.<eos> You got a copy of what you gave him?<eos> Yeah... somewhere.<eos> Shard blacked-out 15 mentions of the wedding band, but... he missed one reference.<eos> Crowley could have found it.
This briefcase was stashed in his office.<eos> That's $50,000.<eos> Whoa.<eos> At $4 a pop, he would have to sell 12,500 cupcakes.<eos> That seems unlikely.<eos> Todd, what do you know about that money?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I swear.<eos> But he's real paranoid about that case.<eos> Twice a week, he'd take it out of the safe and take it with him down to Staten Island.
Look at you, telling the truth.<eos> The cop is right.<eos> I'm screwed six ways to Sunday here.<eos> Where does Bobby S keep the bible?<eos> In his bedroom safe.<eos> How was Jimmy gonna get it?<eos> Every Thursday, Bobby S has the guys over to bet on pool.<eos> Jimmy was supposed to do it then.<eos> What about the combination?<eos> Bobby changes it every Friday.

You know, where the sand hits the water and the water... there's girls there.<eos> Wait, you've never been to the beach?<eos> Nah. I never been to the beach.<eos> You live in L.A. and you've never been to the beach?<eos> No.<eos> Yo, I ain't riding in that.<eos> Yeah, I'm not going in that, either.<eos> Come on. My car's in the shop.<eos> Let's just take Todd's car.<eos> No, I'm only supposed to turn it over twice a week while he's on vacation.
- Okay.<eos> I think I got it put back in.<eos> I'm gonna splint it now.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> They're gonna be coming.<eos> Aaron, you need to leave.<eos> You need to get out now.<eos> - Rachel, no.<eos> - Look at my leg.<eos> Look at it.
We have the same expressions.<eos> Do I look like his dad?<eos> Not as much.<eos> Maybe the accent.<eos> Alright.<eos> Jack is in room 715, at the end.<eos> You are just before his, room 700.<eos> Call if you need anything.<eos> I parked the car by the entrance.<eos> Can I leave it?

Lovebirds!<eos> Hurry up, Alison.<eos> You'll be late.<eos> She's really not stressed before a race.<eos> She started competing when she was 5.<eos> Sorry, Mom.<eos> We have to clean the bathroom and vacuum.<eos> - Where does the quilt go?<eos> - We pack it, it's mine.<eos> - What do I put it in?
Just the regular?<eos> Please.<eos> Everything all right, Officer?<eos> He's not in any trouble, is he?<eos> Just a routine inquiry, Mr Clark.<eos> He's a good lad.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We've er... We've got the poster up.<eos> PC Nixon dropped it round.
It was... very nice. A...<eos> A colony... for... people like Pamela.<eos> An epileptic colony?<eos> Yes.<eos> Hello? Anyone in?<eos> Heavy, I'd imagine, lugging all that lot about.<eos> Meter.<eos> Can I see some identification if you don't mind?<eos> Wouldn't you know it?<eos> Must've left it in my other trousers.
We should hurry then.<eos> All right.<eos> "I, John Ross Ewing II of Dallas, "in the state of Texas, being of sound mind, "hereby declare that this is my last will and testament.<eos> "Revoke all other wills and codicils previously made by me.<eos> "I bequeath my entire collection of boots to my brother Bobby,<eos> "on the condition that he take better care of the damn things "than he takes care of his own.<eos> "To my brother Gary, I leave my prized bottle of scotch.<eos> "To my nephew Christopher,<eos> "I leave my copy of 'The Prince' by Machiavelli.<eos> "Use it because being smart and sneaky
- Oh, wow! You... you still do.<eos> - Yeah, do what you love,<eos> - you never work a day in your life, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> This is perfect.<eos> Some civilian just yakked in the rink.<eos> Can you take over for a minute?<eos> Um... no.<eos> Ah, it's kind of where I make most of my money.<eos> - You know, I hate to shut it down. - Mm.
Jake and I DTR'ed last night!<eos> Ricky is dead to me. Ricky Schwartzes muerto.<eos> ♪ To all the girls I've loved before... ♪<eos> Death.<eos> It was an inevitable part of life. And while it was a fate that awaited us all, the unexpected death of Ricky Schwartz was a shock to everyone's system.<eos> Not to mention, for a ritual called "Sitting Shiva,"<eos> we had been doing a lot of standing.<eos> Unfortunately, some peeps couldn't help but lock their knees, 'cause everyone processed loss in their own way.<eos> For some, sorrow was externalized openly.<eos> While others, surprisingly... kept it more in check.
So I know it was Dalia.<eos> Would you guys be interested in hearing someone meow<eos> Vanessa Williams' "Save the Best for Last"?<eos> No?<eos> 'Kay.<eos> What happened?<eos> I customized it.<eos> You mutilated it.<eos> Ryan gave me that jacket.<eos> And the only reason you're taking it back is because Dalia told you to, 'cause she knew it would hurt me!
Three years here, four back in England.<eos> And you arranged the meeting with Mr Powell and Jack Roberts?<eos> I did, yeah.<eos> What can you tell us about him?<eos> Er, well I've only spoken to him on the phone, until today.<eos> Um, I saw him arrive, and I went out to his car and um,<eos> I brought him back in the study to wait for Mr Powell.<eos> What was the nature of their business?<eos> Mr Powell didn't say, sorry.<eos> I do know that he was very uneasy about the meeting - um, like he didn't want to do it, but didn't have a choice.
I want a fingertip search of the area.<eos> Let's see if he's dumped the murder weapon.<eos> Chief.<eos> Sir!<eos> One set of footprints - and whoever it was, was dragging something.<eos> A small boat?<eos> A dinghy maybe?<eos> No, no, no, it'd be way too small.<eos> He couldn't get very far in that.<eos> Right, so he dumps the car, burns it to destroy any evidence and then, er, takes a small boat out to - what?
Malcolm Powell.<eos> Why would Malcolm Powell be giving 20,000 to his killer?<eos> Well, I did some company searches on his UK businesses last night, and it seems that Malcolm Powell isn't quite the man everyone's been telling us he is.<eos> Can I help you? Yes.<eos> You can talk to me about Lindman Investments.<eos> It was the main reason the Powells came here.<eos> You know, the economic situation in the UK was awful, everyone hating any kind of financial institution.<eos> Especially a corrupt one.<eos> The company ran into trouble.<eos> He did what he did to save it.
Left!<eos> I'm not sure it will ever be over.<eos> Attention!<eos> And to the right.<eos> I don't know... if the village would want me teaching its children.<eos> Martha.<eos> Our Mary says that you're a good teacher.<eos> Why are you stopping?<eos> You know why.<eos> I watched you living a life and filling it up with conviction and action and then you stopped.
You'll receive the rest when we dock.<eos> You know the most important thing I learned out here?<eos> We shouldn't be afraid of the sharks.<eos> They should be the ones to be afraid of us.<eos> Salud.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> They're called waves.<eos> They do that from time to time.<eos> The storm is too strong.<eos> We are going to have to go around it.
- We came in to get you.<eos> - There's sharks everywhere.<eos> Sharks?<eos> Is this the best shelter you got?<eos> Look, we don't exactly have a storm cellar.<eos> We better find something to protect ourselves and quick.<eos> From what?<eos> They couldn't possibly make it all the way out here.<eos> They can.<eos> A hurricane can pick up marine life out of the ocean and drop it hundreds of miles away.
How's the front end looking Bobby?<eos> I'm not a captain yet sir.<eos> Bobby look out!<eos> Get down!<eos> The tornado is coming this way.<eos> Baz!<eos> Second tornado!<eos> Second tornado!<eos> The tornado is headed towards the airport.<eos> We need to destroy it before it get to them.
Or he'll have them driven in a stretch limo with a pool.<eos> (sighs)<eos> MICHAELA: It's a routine check-up.<eos> I don't need a police escort.<eos> I have a doctor's appointment of my own.<eos> Plus, I need to get copies of your medical records for the new doctor in Washington, D.C.<eos> Dixon is the one tagging along for no reason.<eos> We need to talk about this.<eos> Yeah, like we talked about submitting Michaela's demo?<eos> Hey, maybe when I'm not looking, you can slip it to the guy who picks the elevator music.
If that's my present, I can't wait to unwrap it.<eos> Right now, let's just forget about the murder, go to dinner, celebrate your life, come back, and celebrate some more.<eos> Sounds perfect.<eos> Okay, so the car's gonna be here in 15 minutes.<eos> Would you like a drink from the fridge?<eos> The fridge.<eos> What?<eos> He just got a soda from the cabinet.<eos> So?<eos> So why get it from the cabinet?
Those were refrigerator shelves.<eos> Castle...<eos> I don't know who Gates was talking to on the phone, but that was not Emily.<eos> Emily is in that fridge.<eos> She's not in the apartment. She's not in the fridge.<eos> There is no body!<eos> Yes, there is.<eos> Castle, you just apologized to me.<eos> I rescind the apology.<eos> I take it back.
Awesome.<eos> We are awesome.<eos> Did you see our picture in this?<eos> - Ha ha ha ha ha ha.<eos> - I'm at 28 weeks and I am worried about Digeorge syndrome.<eos> Digeorge?<eos> There's, like, what, a 1 in 100,000?<eos> It's too rare.<eos> More likely it'll have a cleft palate or a heart defect.<eos> Wait, if your baby has a heart defect, I will fix it.
Patients will be afraid.<eos> Parents will be afraid.<eos> And the only way to get through it is for you to stay calm.<eos> The brain is swelling.<eos> What are we gonna do about that?<eos> We're gonna...<eos> We're gonna give her more mannitol.<eos> Good.<eos> That was amazing.<eos> The valve started operating before I fully released it.
_<eos> _ _ _<eos> Hi there.<eos> Not lost out here, are you?<eos> No. No, sir.<eos> Do you have a trail map?<eos> If not, I have extras.<eos> I do... in my bag.<eos> Okay, forgive me for saying, you don't look like a typical hiker.<eos> I understand, sir, but God sent me here for a reason, and I plan to fulfill it.
And I tried to get her to talk about it, but she said it was all in the past.<eos> She was like that-- she kept everything bottled up; private.<eos> So, when she didn't return my phone calls after Drew showed me the video, I wasn't surprised.<eos> After a few weeks, Rebecca went to the police.<eos> They tried to locate Callie via her cell phone, credit card, e-mail records, but they came up empty.<eos> She hadn't used any of them since before she disappeared.<eos> They questioned Drew, but he managed to convince them the video was authentic.<eos> Oh, you-you think it's a fake?<eos> I think things were bad between Drew and my sister.<eos> He could've forced her to make the video so that, after he killed her, he could show it to the police and convince them that she'd run away.
I'm pretty sure her husband killed her.<eos> ...but because I'm worried about her.<eos> I want to tell that it's okay, that I want her to be happy.<eos> Even if being happy means... being with somebody else.<eos> That was recorded by the police the first time they interviewed Drew Gardner five months ago.<eos> He said the same exact thing to me this morning.<eos> Verbatim.<eos> And because he repeated himself, you think he's a murderer.<eos> No, it's not because he repeated himself, it's just that what he said sounded rehearsed-- like... like he came up with his story and then stuck with it.<eos> Perhaps it's lodged in his brain because he's had to repeat it so often.
He knew it was worth several thousand dollars.<eos> Sold it to a client.<eos> He could have told Rebecca that months ago.<eos> Mm.<eos> Well, he was afraid.<eos> He knew what he'd done was wrong.<eos> The trunk was not his to sell.<eos> Apparently, your visit yesterday inspired him to come clean.<eos> The idea that Rebecca thought he'd used the trunk to dispose of Callie was more troubling to him than the idea of being punished for his actual transgression.<eos> So he reached out to the guy he sold it to and made an offer to buy it back.

Freshly opened can of whup-ass.<eos> Ed, it sounds to me like you have a man cave.<eos> What the hell is a man cave?<eos> It's a place where you keep all your favorite stuff.<eos> You can do whatever you want and nobody bothers you.<eos> Used to be called your life, but then you got married.<eos> So now it's just a room.<eos> Well, the problem is my wife is in there more than I am.<eos> She said I needed a plant in there, so now she's in there all the time taking care of the plant.<eos> You know, feeding it, watering it, talking to it.
Oh, please.<eos> That's your solution for everything.<eos> You got a quarter in your ass right now.<eos> Ain't no trial going on.<eos> No, it really works.<eos> Help you pass the lie detector test, too.<eos> I'll tell you this, if it weren't for the quarter,<eos> I'd have a lot more consecutive life terms.<eos> Ooh, and you don't put it inside.<eos> You just hold it there between the cheeks.

They are coming out hot.<eos> We've got to move, now.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Here they come.<eos> I think we've been made.<eos> How could they have made us, we just got here.<eos> I think we're good.<eos> Gun!<eos> Drop your weapon!<eos> Drop it!
When I was taking her to Liverpool she ran, escaped.<eos> I, I, I couldn't stop her.<eos> Turns out she's the pauper they found dead in that field. At Siddington?<eos> Well, why didn't you tell us?<eos> I took pity on her.<eos> I thought she'd survive!<eos> Siddington is the opposite direction to Liverpool.<eos> Well, she must have travelled some distance before she fell.<eos> And you must have kept the apprentice fee for yourself.<eos> I'll pay it back.
Mike... so I'm looking at Mandy's progress report.<eos> If she doesn't get at least a "B" on her term paper, she's gonna fail history.<eos> You know what they say.<eos> Those who can't pass history are doomed to repeat it.
Now you really got your work cut out for you.<eos> I tracked down the cab company that brought Meghan to the Captain's Bridge last night like you asked.<eos> The taxi picked her up at the Wyndermere Grand Resorts, but she doesn't have any credit-card charges at the hotel's restaurant or bar.<eos> And she wasn't registered there as a guest, but guess who was.<eos> Jojo's husband, Pruitt?<eos> Exactly, and not the first time, either.<eos> Apparently, it was a weekly thing.<eos> Sounds like an affair to me.<eos> Just got surveillance video from the bar that night.<eos> - I'm gonna run through it now.
I want you and me and Jim to be a family.<eos> Ashley's the new face of Velvet Cherry?<eos> Thought your focus group didn't like her.<eos> Screw my focus group.<eos> I'm divorcing the bastard and doing things my way.<eos> Wow.<eos> So much for the other cheek.<eos> Even for someone willing to sic her lawyers onto a dead woman.<eos> I've worked hard to build my brand, detective.<eos> And willing to do anything to protect it, would be my guess.
I'm a girl.<eos> - It's stupid. Whatever.<eos> - Oh, you're a girl, all right.<eos> Oh, that's nice.<eos> I could totally see you in that.<eos> I could totally see you out of it, as well.<eos> Well, for 2 grand, I'd better get that reaction.<eos> 2 grand for a dress you're only gonna wear once?<eos> That's the plan, I mean, assuming you don't screw this thing up.<eos> Let me buy it for you, then.
I just thought we'd have a little family time.<eos> Busy lives, busy schedules.<eos> Trust me, this is family time.<eos> Speaking of, I took the fellowship again.<eos> - With the wacko?<eos> - He's not a wacko.<eos> He's just dealing with not being who he was.<eos> Yeah, and taking it out on you.<eos> I can handle it, and I can get my wedding dress in six weeks when I've earned it.<eos> I told you, I'll pay for it.
Well, why don't you take me through what happened?<eos> That son of a bitch and I spent the last few days playing craps.<eos> He seemed like good company, I invited him up to my suite for a meal and a Scotch.<eos> And the next thing I know, a couple grand is missing.<eos> Well, I'm happy to draw a couple-of-grand worth of chips to cover your loss.<eos> No, whoa, whoa, wait a minute!<eos> It's not just the cash.<eos> My watch went missing.<eos> It was my great-grandfather's watch.<eos> There is no replacing it.
If only mine were attached to a surgeon's hands.<eos> Doctor, scientist, teacher.<eos> Admired by his peers.<eos> Seems unlikely he's a perpetrator.<eos> Which makes me wonder if his killer could be in this crowd.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Matteo, for those kind words.<eos> You left out "scratch golfer."<eos> I think it was Plato that said, "Knowledge is the food of the soul."<eos> In these trying times, we should heed the words of Plato:<eos> "He who commits injustice is ever made more wretched than he who suffers it."
Shania will be way too disappointed.<eos> And Rocky'll end up back in rehab.<eos> I don't want to be the cause of that.<eos> Again.<eos> Oh, my God, I know what we should do.<eos> Okay, we have the shower.<eos> People can't help themselves from bringing gifts.<eos> Smile, say thank you.<eos> And then we sneak out with all the presents and we donate them.<eos> David, you should grow a mustache and twirl it between your fingers.
Sure.<eos> What is it?<eos> I wanted to invite you to something.<eos> The Ring Pops.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm playing a gig with Dale on Sunday.<eos> Wow, really?<eos> I thought maybe I could get my guitar.<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> I'll get it for you.
Something's come up.<eos> (Gasps)<eos> Drop it!<eos> Drop it now!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Drop it... now!<eos> Drop the gun.<eos> All right.<eos> Put it on the floor, slide it over here and close that door.
Uh, what did the great spirit's sacred messenger ask for?<eos> Stories.<eos> He asked the people to tell him stories.<eos> I bet I know what the blessings were.<eos> I've been all over them.<eos> It's not there.<eos> Why?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Let us put the tablet back where it should be.<eos> I need to protect it.
Naomi, darling.<eos> Miss me?<eos> Get off!<eos> What the hell? !<eos> Take it easy, man.<eos> God!<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy. Take it --<eos> Found you on the floor, passed out.<eos> Your temperature was 107.<eos> I had to force it down or you were toast.
By the time we split, her salary was triple mine.<eos> You sound bitter.<eos> As long as I got my check every month, I was happy.<eos> Problem is, now she's gone, they're gonna stop.<eos> So from where I stand...<eos> Rebecca wasn't the only victim here.<eos> I'm mad!<eos> I had every right to burn his car!<eos> It seems like it to me.<eos> I would've liked to have burned it with him in it!
Okay? We're sorry... Okay, what you can't see is that he is actually the best of what this country has to offer.<eos> Did he kill bin Laden?<eos> Wow, you are a tough sell.<eos> Taste it.<eos> Relax, it's just a hot sauce we're talking about.<eos> No, it's not just a hot sauce.<eos> My granny made this sauce, and she took the recipe with her to her grave.<eos> Look me in the eye, kid.<eos> Look me in the eye and tell me that you think this is the most amazing hot sauce I'll ever taste and I should make an exception.<eos> Ma'am, I promise you... to my everlasting surprise that this sauce tastes every bit as good as when my grandmother made it for me.

Edward, what a surprise. Shut up.<eos> I don't like you.<eos> What's your opening offer going to be?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> When you make your bid for Bowers.<eos> What?<eos> Look, I don't know what you're doing, but I promise you, I'm going to find out.<eos> If Edward Bowers starts looking under rocks, will he find something that will affect the merger?<eos> Because that guy's smart.<eos> You sold me on this idea, Audrey, and so far, fantastic, but if you're about to spring a leak, you fix it.
How do you think Teddy'd feel if he knew it was you who leaked all those lies about Rayna and his divorce to the press?<eos> I can't imagine he'd take too kindly to it.<eos> I don't know what you're suggesting'.<eos> I'm suggesting that you cooperate.<eos> Thank you, Brooklyn!<eos> You guys are awesome.<eos> Thank you, everybody.<eos> My next song is my brand-new single.<eos> I'm really excited to perform in here tonight and... and for it to be on my new album, which you guys are all gonna go online and pre-order tonight, right?<eos> Okay. No, but the, uh, the best part about singin' this song tonight for y'all is, uh, I get to share it with somebody who means a lot to me, and who has been an amazing influence in my life recently.
We have to convince him.<eos> Hey.<eos> How was the session?<eos> To be honest, not that great.<eos> The meditation isn't really working.<eos> Here magic's too strong.<eos> You told me you could help her.<eos> Dad, it's...<eos> it's not his fault.<eos> He's the one who taught you this magic, and now he can't control it.
Me too.<eos> Agent Gaad wants to see you in the vault.<eos> Would you excuse me?<eos> - Anything on the ring?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Look, it wasn't on his body, and it wasn't in his apartment.<eos> He always wore the ring.<eos> We're on it.<eos> If it's out there, we'll find it.
Hold that smile, Beeman.<eos> - We got a hit on his ring.<eos> - How?<eos> J. Edgar's genius-- manpower.<eos> Put every available agent in the field, double up on local uniforms, soon enough you get a hit.<eos> Where did they find it?<eos> The owner of a salvage yard tried to fence it at a pawn shop in Kingman Park.<eos> Salvage yard?<eos> It must be where they dumped the car used to move Amador.<eos> But we got to it before they crushed it.
Tell me what?<eos> Well, apparently, your father thinks that I'm being unreasonable, and that you should have your party, and it doesn't seem to matter what I say.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yep.<eos> He said a girl's Sweet 16 is just too important to take away.<eos> - He did? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Personally, I think follow-through is more important, 'cause I'm all about the follow-through.<eos> But your dad's overruling me, I guess.<eos> Yep.<eos> When I see a wrong, I right it.
Aster Corps is gonna use that time and all of their resources to try and find you and your daughter.<eos> I want you to disappear.<eos> Give this to your dad.<eos> He'll know what to do.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Run!<eos> Run as fast as you can, okay? !<eos> Run!<eos> Where's the girl?<eos> Physicists will tell you that time does not exist, that it is a human construct used to organize experience and catalog existence so we can quantify it, confirm it, remember it.
- Do I need to call the police? - Oh.<eos> [Paper tears] Chintzy.<eos> Hey, man, what's going on?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Hi again. Um,<eos> I got you this bottle of wine to apologize...<eos> [Whispering] If I could just...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Not knowing that was against the rules.<eos> So I was taking it back, and I was hoping that you wouldn't even know about it.

I know the little cups make you feel big, but it's not worth it.<eos> It's this stupid letter.<eos> Did you read it?<eos> No.<eos> You must be curious.<eos> Of course I'm curious.<eos> I haven't seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid.<eos> And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday?<eos> What's that about?<eos> Why don't you read it?
Penny.<eos> It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn't who he said he was.<eos> Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.<eos> I would like to change mine.<eos> The pirate's name was Peg-Leg Antoine.<eos> Now it's completely different from Goonies.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Don't.<eos> Okay, my turn.<eos> Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.
Yes, yes.<eos> Just don't exhale your death breath directly on them.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I used to collect these bestapled fables.<eos> What are you reading?<eos> The adventures of The Good Shepherd and his sidekick, The Fleecy Kid.<eos> Bah! That's his battle cry.<eos> The sound which terrifies sheep rustlers the length and breadth of Michigan's untamed upper peninsula.<eos> You should be out in the fresh air, kicking dogs.<eos> I'm gonna buy this publishing company and burn it to the ground.
I have something to say.<eos> The dowager grandmum!<eos> I'm afraid you cannot marry... without a proper ring.<eos> Take mine-- the Star of Bombay.<eos> Once again, India is denuded of her treasure by the imperialist devils.<eos> Why do we watch this show?<eos> Because I like the costumes!<eos> I've never felt so flushed after watching public television.<eos> Maybe sometime we could...<eos> watch it in the same room.
'Cause I think we both know that dealing with emotional chaos is not one of your strong suits.<eos> Which is why we're not having an affair, we're just being human.<eos> And why you are planning a memorial for a girl that you barely knew.<eos> We talked.<eos> I did know her.<eos> Did you know her better than you knew my mom?<eos> That's not fair.<eos> None of it was fair.<eos> Look, life gets messy sometimes.<eos> You know, you gotta learn you can't always fix it.
Who the hell does he think he is?<eos> "'George Dennis' of 'Le Monde' called the vice president a typical American hick."<eos> I think it's pronounced Georges Denis.<eos> I'm not a hick.<eos> Screw you, Depardieu.<eos> I think it just got on Reddit and Tumblr and just exploded from there.<eos> Uh, those words sound mighty familiar.<eos> Jonah?<eos> I just liked the song so much.<eos> And I thought you wanted it out there, so I just put it out there.
What?<eos> What are you scared of, Erin?<eos> I'm scared of what this is turning into.<eos> So?<eos> So here's the thing.<eos> You come for me, I'm fine with that.<eos> I'll match you bite for bite and in the end, we'll see who's still standing, right?<eos> But you need to keep away from Mary.<eos> She's off limits.<eos> But what's the point of knowing your weak spot if I don't get a chance to... poke it a bit?
He visited the same floor twice a month for six months--<eos> Bellfar Systems.<eos> What does Bellfar do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can't find anything on them.<eos> You could be barking up the wrong tree.<eos> That's what I thought, until I found military-grade encryption on their servers.<eos> Well, what do you want to do?<eos> Walk up to their door, knock on it, and ask them for a new hand?<eos> More like knock it down and take what I want.
It was you?<eos> Cut my beard.<eos> Do you regret that you're not king?<eos> I was ready.<eos> Don't be in a hurry.<eos> There's much time ahead of you.<eos> Blood flows, that's its nature.<eos> Let it flow.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Your neck - I didn't want you to show it too often.
Remember what I'm telling you.<eos> To live, become like your enemy.<eos> Get inside him like a poison.<eos> Have the gods been generous?<eos> I can't complain today.<eos> Look.<eos> I know this ring.<eos> It's Leocritus's.<eos> I was with him enough to know.<eos> Where'd you get it?
Talk all night about the Savior's second coming.<eos> Was Barbosa a religious man?<eos> No.<eos> He just liked the drama of it.<eos> See, his enemies would think they killed him and sleep soundly that night.<eos> And come morning, all the world would know that Miguel Barbosa rose from the grave and brought hell along with him.<eos> Sounds like a song.<eos> It was.<eos> I called it "Resurrection."<eos> When Barbosa heard it, he told me never play it for anybody else, ever again.
Yeah, what changed your mind?<eos> Besides the fantasy of little Martys running to and fro.<eos> God...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just helping Javier... it felt different.<eos> Felt good. Wow.<eos> This... changes everything.<eos> Thank you, Kensi.<eos> I do have one condition, though.<eos> Name it.
To whom do you owe obedience and respect?<eos> To the country, and only the country, sir!<eos> Attention company, on my command!<eos> Company, attention!<eos> Fininha!<eos> Hey, what's wrong? What is it, man?<eos> I know you like it. Grab it.<eos> Give me your hand, put it here.<eos> What is it?<eos> Won't you grab it?
Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> We were supposed to pick you up years ago and take you to Heaven, but, uh, there was a mix-up.<eos> God sends his apologies.<eos> Angels have wings and halos, and-and their breath doesn't smell like beef jerky and kettle corn.<eos> ♪ Shine, little glowworm, glimmer, glimmer ♪<eos> ♪ Shine, little glowworm, glimmer, glimmer ♪ Ooh.<eos> I-I...<eos> I know that song.<eos> I think my husband used to sing it.
There is a letter for you from Matthew.<eos> What?<eos> Where was it?<eos> Hidden in a book in the office and so it was overlooked.<eos> They finally got round to packing up his things and brought them here this morning.<eos> Who opened it?<eos> It wasn't sealed.<eos> But you've read it before me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would have sent it to Murray to have it looked into but your grandmother insisted you should see it first.
I wrote to a great many theatres.<eos> But the manager at the Opera House wrote back.<eos> It seems they're in need of a stage door keeper.<eos> They'd chosen one but he dropped out.<eos> He asks Mr Grigg to consider it.<eos> I heard about Mr Matthew's letter.<eos> I hope it wasn't too upsetting.<eos> As a matter of fact, it was a relief.<eos> I felt so happy that he'd finally been heard but judging by tonight's dinner, it may prove a heavy mantle for Lady Mary.<eos> I shall keep it on my dressing table to remind me that Matthew is on my side.
I really ought to go and talk to her.<eos> Of course, Your Grace.<eos> Don't call her Your Grace.<eos> I thought it was correct.<eos> For a servant, or an official at a ceremony, but in a social situation, call her Duchess.<eos> But why?<eos> I don't call you Countess.<eos> Certainly not!<eos> There's no logic in it.<eos> Oh no, if I were to search for logic, I should not look for it among the English upper class.
It wasn't that so much.<eos> But he did behave in a way that I thought was really quite gentlemanly.<eos> Are you awake?<eos> What happened to you?<eos> I was drinking a powder when I suddenly felt dizzy and I...<eos> I must have fainted. I think I hit the edge of the sink as I went down.<eos> - Stupid.<eos> - You've changed your dress.<eos> Yes. It's badly marked.<eos> I've put it in to soak but I'm not sure I can save it.
You outed our suspect.<eos> I reported news as it came to me-- that's my job.<eos> The guy wasn't even in custody yet, Margot, I mean, you should've come to me first.<eos> I was actually trying to keep you out of it.<eos> To protect you. Right.<eos> So that big fat line between us and our jobs is only there when it works for you?<eos> Convenient.<eos> No, look, people are talking about us, and it looks like I fed you the information, and we both know I didn't, so...<eos> I want to know who did.<eos> I got an e-mail saying, uh, Neil Jacobs was a person of interest-- it came from an anonymous address and the paper's working to trace it.
If you do, can you let me know?<eos> I'll write them down for you.<eos> What?<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Your dog... Excuse...<eos> Your dog is hurt...<eos> What was that angry song about?<eos> That sounded so angry.<eos> The national anthem...<eos> Do you even know what it means for me to be memorizing it?
Love or friendship?<eos> This is gettin' too good.<eos> Dave...<eos> I'm on your team.<eos> Good, 'cause I need your help.<eos> Now tomorrow's the cubs' opening day.<eos> I wanna decorate my truck with ivy and a mini scoreboard, just like at Wrigley Field.<eos> But it will only work if I get my primo spot in front of the stadium.<eos> And I know the Brazilian's gonna try to take it.<eos> Dave, relaxi your taxi, 'cause I am gonna get you that spot if it's the last thing that I do... before getting myself a pizza and eating it in bed as a celebratory feast for getting you that spot.
I can't say.<eos> Further disinterested.<eos> Look, Rocky, sometimes you think the truth is going to hurt, but it ends up helping.<eos> Like how I encouraged David with the Boy Scouts the other day.<eos> The whole thing was a huge success, and now we're gonna have more Scouting events at the house.<eos> And that was supposed to encourage me?<eos> My point is, is that by being honest,<eos> David is able to be who he is in a group that he loves.<eos> To me, the truth is an obligation:<eos> You just have to say it out loud.
Supper finished, in the front room probably, listening to the radio.<eos> Or checkers, you think?<eos> Or maybe they're musical.<eos> Do they play at all?<eos> Most folks up that way do.<eos> I bet your mom chords on the piano, your dad on fiddle, and all the children they sing.<eos> That's what we'd be doing up at my place.<eos> It was rough times, but it wasn't always bad.<eos> I had my voice taken away from me once too.<eos> You can get it back.
Well, I'm curious to see them and I'll be out all day.<eos> Why don't we walk down after dinner?<eos> Lady Grantham?<eos> You two go.<eos> I'll take it on trust.<eos> Well, it's a nice evening.<eos> What about it?<eos> Well, it's quite a long walk, but I don't mind, if you really want to.<eos> Is this seat taken?<eos> I was keeping it for a friend.
Suit yourself.<eos> I'm off. Erm...<eos> Well done, for containing the Downton heart-breaker.<eos> Everyone's gone to bed, but Lady Mary's still out with Mr Blake.<eos> What should I do about locking up?<eos> I wonder what's taking the time.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Well, nothing like that.<eos> I should leave the front door open with the key in the lock.<eos> They can turn it when they come in.
So you figured you could gain additional access if he trusted you on a more intimate level.<eos> I was out of options.<eos> Unfortunately, all I learned is he's an abusive sadist.<eos> Do we have enough to arrest him?<eos> No.<eos> If we arrest him, we tip off those he's helping.<eos> The fear is there are others in addition to Iran.<eos> If we take him out, they'll find another supplier, and it may take us months to determine who they were and where they are in their nuclear development.<eos> So what's the goal?<eos> We want to know who he's supplying, and ideally allow him to continue to do so in a manner that lets us monitor his progress and delay it if necessary.
And the city will be a better place for it.<eos> Because...<eos> I care about our future.<eos> I want our children to be educated.<eos> To be the best in the world.<eos> How do we keep our kids safe and secure when the streets are filled with felons, drug pushers... and sexual deviants?<eos> That's your plan?<eos> Mass murder?<eos> Only because the government failed us, right?<eos> When your car's dirty, you wash it.
- Thanks, Pindy.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Hey, Jared. - Yeah?<eos> Want to see Rob Lowe doing pilates?<eos> No.<eos> So, we think we can get a dismissal.<eos> But you're gonna have to turn over your client list.<eos> Oh, no, I can't do that.<eos> Mom, you're looking at prison.<eos> I don't need your permission to turn it over. - I'm your lawyer.
Ask Swatello if she'll testify.<eos> She's low enough on the totem pole.<eos> She's not covered by executive privilege.<eos> Yeah, see, whenever we get together, um... hate sex breaks out.<eos> Please don't send me back in there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What is it?<eos> A court order.<eos> We have to turn the book over tomorrow.<eos> Which means if she doesn't turn it over, she's in contempt.
Nothing like a Russian massage.<eos> You were right. I...<eos> I know that now.<eos> I hope Ivan wasn't too rough. No.<eos> Ivan was awesome.<eos> I thought other people would be joining us.<eos> You want to succeed me when I retire, don't you?<eos> Very much so, sir.<eos> My recommendation would kind of cinch it.<eos> And I'm inclined to give it to you.
What's so funny?<eos> Ah, you'd have to meet Saynay to fully appreciate his quiet nature.<eos> Did he ever mention a plastic container to you?<eos> What plastic container?<eos> I guess he didn't trust him enough.<eos> No, clearly.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We're trying to locate an airtight plastic box.<eos> Your cellmate knew all about it.<eos> It was hidden in a safe for nine years, but a man was killed stealing it this morning.
You're looking at Bronson Springs' finest.<eos> It takes a special kind of integrity to earn your way in there.<eos> Tory, please.<eos> It turns out you were worse than any of them.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Please!<eos> Tory, please don't.<eos> Please don't! Please!<eos> Drop the weapon.<eos> Drop it now.
Tory, please.<eos> It turns out you were worse than any of them.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Please!<eos> Tory, please don't.<eos> Please don't! Please!<eos> Drop the weapon.<eos> Drop it now.<eos> Don't shoot.<eos> I'm putting it down right here.
He's turned Rossi against Morgan.<eos> Even if it was temporary, he wanted to show it could be done.<eos> But why?<eos> Strauss was dosed with a chemical cousin of Doctor Death.<eos> He altered it so her torture would be longer.<eos> A biochemist, computer hacker, and federal agent?<eos> Who the hell is this guy?<eos> Only half the cameras are working because the system is still rebooting itself, so the security guards have to go old school.<eos> That means everyone has to sign in.<eos> You can't take your I.D. And run it through-- well, you know what old school means.
And why would that be?<eos> How should I know?<eos> You'll have to ask her.<eos> You know why I became an exchange student?<eos> I have no idea what goes on in that brain of yours, Jim.<eos> Not the slightest idea.<eos> To get away from my family.<eos> If you are trying to make a point, then why don't you just say it already?<eos> My point is, we're gonna clean this place up, okay?<eos> And you're gonna keep it clean.
That's Detective 101!<eos> We got this, Arroyo.<eos> You got this?<eos> Yes.<eos> Come over here.<eos> Let me educate you.<eos> When I was a rookie in Brooklyn South,<eos> Novak was my rabbi.<eos> I'm running this one.<eos> I'm up to catch, so I'm running it.
The second you get something, call me.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> I won't be able to make it to the bar, but I wanted to express my condolences.<eos> Appreciated, but I'm guessing that you got more on your mind than condolences.<eos> Well, I haven't known Owen that long, but he seems to think there may be some validity to...<eos> To what this scum Portis Walker's saying?<eos> I'm not trying to get you upset.<eos> Owen was the standout loser in our squad.<eos> We used to call him Crockpot because he'd just stew on a case and never close it.
Besides, it's my fault for forgetting to sign the K-5s this morning.<eos> I hope you don't mind me asking, but is everything all right?<eos> Just, uh, taking care of some odds and ends.<eos> Well, if ever you need a friendly ear.<eos> You're a good man, Walter.<eos> I thought you'd left.<eos> I'm still waiting for your answer.<eos> How can you even think of doing this?<eos> That place took your soul, Robert.<eos> Doing this won't give it back.
It ends now.<eos> Oliver, the device...<eos> It's gone.<eos> Where's the device?<eos> Safe.<eos> I don't know how you got that trojan onto my system, but it prompted me to take precautions.<eos> There is nothing you can do to stop what is about to happen.<eos> And you shouldn't.<eos> This city needs what is about to happen in order to survive.<eos> The people who are destroying it from the inside need to be erased from the map.
Guido underestimated Serena's superpowers.<eos> Like in summer, when her family moved to the beach near Rome, he planned to drop us there and go work alone in his studio, at least for an afternoon.<eos> My mother had her way of getting him to stay.<eos> She wasn't particularly fond of art, but she was crazy about the artist.<eos> We were always there, too bad no one noticed.<eos> Come on!<eos> Okay, I'll have a bite and leave.<eos> Don't come at all with that long face.<eos> No, but I don't want them to notice my hard-on.<eos> - Can you see it?
(quietly): All right.<eos> The tire store security camera.<eos> This is the car the tire was purchased for, which is registered to you.<eos> And this is the guy who brought it in.<eos> Does he look familiar?<eos> What is this?<eos> This is my boyfriend Dominic Quinlan.<eos> Do you know Dominic drove your car last night, April?<eos> He borrows it all the time.<eos> I think he's driving it now.
Dominic left 50 grand hidden in April's apartment.<eos> OWEN:<eos> The plan is for her to meet him with it at a diner in Queens.<eos> Figure we set up on it and grab him.<eos> We sure April's on board?<eos> We'll get her through it.<eos> (Owen calls out)<eos> Clark tells me the gold chain came from you.<eos> That chain was found on the DOA's body.<eos> Dominic never had it.
- Come on in.<eos> - I'm good here.<eos> Don't you think she should put some clothes on?<eos> Oh, come on, we're werewolves.<eos> - Butch the fuck up. - ( laughs )<eos> You wanna talk, talk.<eos> We got ourselves a happy little coincidence.<eos> Your shifter's here.<eos> What room are they in?<eos> I don't think you oughta do anything about it, but I thought I'd give you the information so you wouldn't hold it against me if you found out I didn't.
Is she making you say that?<eos> How am I making her say that, with my mind?<eos> Get outta here.<eos> Go build that building.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll be over there, just in case.<eos> Thanks.<eos> The letter?<eos> Please?<eos> Okay, yeah, I'll take it.

I think they're betting on how long you'll last in Haiti.<eos> What?<eos> Tamra, one day?<eos> A single day you thought I would last in Haiti?<eos> I was just price-is-righting it.<eos> That's how my cousin sheena won her jet-ski.<eos> One time, she let me ride it in her driveway.<eos> That is enough.<eos> I would normally love that anecdote,<eos> - and now I hate it.
- Yeah. - And, uh, we'll come up, and we'll save you in a minute.<eos> - Okay. - Hur...hurry up!<eos> - Slow down, dude.<eos> - No. Blake and jillian won't survive much longer.<eos> They both use roll-on deodorant.<eos> That stuff is like wild animal nip.<eos> - What about our survival, ders, huh?<eos> I'm starving to death Ever since you ripped the beef jerky out of my hands.<eos> - You gave it to me.<eos> - Yeah. And then you handed it to a dog When you should've handed it to my belly 'cause dogs can't sniff through bellies.
What the hell do you want me to tell you?<eos> ! Tell me you stole the White House.<eos> I stole the White House!<eos> - So it's done?<eos> - It's done.<eos> And the police believe it's a suicide?<eos> And now everyone thinks that Osborne is the mole.<eos> Today I can confirm that former C.I.A. Director Grayden Osborne was responsible for a leak of confidential information to our foreign adversaries.<eos> We believe he was a mole working in the United States government.<eos> It's unfortunate for me to say that a man I appointed, a man I trusted, was secretly and actively working against this country in hopes of destroying it.
No, it is not Oprah.<eos> Oprah is more important.<eos> Would you like Oprah?<eos> Would Oprah be better?<eos> Because I can call Oprah.<eos> I'll call her now.<eos> Will that make the two of you say yes to this interview?<eos> The president is going to need to announce his re-election bid in less than six weeks.<eos> This interview is everything.<eos> We'll do it.

Archie, wake up!<eos> Chillax, bro.<eos> It's not even noon.<eos> I will neither chill nor relax.<eos> All this hoopla is not what Greendale really is.<eos> Greendale is a nice welcome banner.<eos> Greendale is a foamless cafeteria.<eos> And Greendale is Magnitude saying "pop pop."<eos> Now, I am a man of very little integrity, and I let students get away with practically anything on this campus, but I will not allow Greendale to lose the things that make it Greendale.<eos> Now, Archie, I would love for you to enroll in my school, but I will not change it for you.
Number 10 scalpel.<eos> Hi.<eos> I just checked in on Bill's surgery.<eos> It was supposed to be an hour.<eos> It's now going on four.<eos> I'm used to sharing Bill with half the expectant mothers in Missouri.<eos> You'll sit for a minute, won't you?<eos> Another 12 hours, then I'm on bed rest at home.<eos> There's a television in the doctors' lounge.<eos> I could hijack it and wheel it in before Nurse Pratt sees me.
It won't be possible for you to get pregnant.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It was an abuse of hospital resources, a waste of my time.<eos> You did everything you could to help her.<eos> I'm sure she knows that.<eos> All to gather skewed data from a house full of sexual invalids.<eos> What matters is you held up your end of the deal, and so did Betty.<eos> Tonight we have male subjects, and I think you'll be pleased.<eos> But I don't think measles will photograph too well.<eos> This picture's in technicolor, so I better change it to scarlet fever.
Hey! What did I say?<eos> My kid's got a smart mouth on him, Doctor.<eos> Maybe this one will be a little better behaved.<eos> And the next one, please, God, a girl.<eos> You hear that, honey?<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> Can you look after this for me?<eos> Do you have that letter of recommendation I promised Hellwarth?<eos> Bill, I've made a terrible mistake.<eos> Okay. Well, retype it, then.
He executed a child in front of my eyes.<eos> - Where there's jews, theres partisans.<eos> We are waging a war.<eos> That is no war.<eos> Yes it is.<eos> A new one.<eos> In the name of the Fuhrer.<eos> If we lose this war, not even god will save us.<eos> and most definitely not the Fuhrer.<eos> Then we must not under any circumstances lose it.
Uhp, rolled under the couch.<eos> Tie!<eos> Please forgive me, Cleveland.<eos> Dr. Fist, why didn't you just say you wanted to hang out with Cleveland instead of making him think he was dying?<eos> I couldn't ask a patient to hang out socially.<eos> It's unprofessional.<eos> I'm sorry, Cleveland.<eos> I just thought you were so much fun. You know, with that hilarious walrus impression?<eos> No!<eos> You don't deserve it.
Guy who did his voice died of a bacterial infection.<eos> Sore throat one day, next day, he croaked.<eos> Oh, and all those phones and tablets? Made in Chinese factories where conditions are so bad, the workers commit suicide.<eos> Can you hear me now?<eos> No? Oh, right!<eos> How's a man supposed to fling a bird at a pig after that?<eos> What?<eos> At least he's not the chump he used to be.<eos> Oh, yeah, he was a chump because while you were being too cool for life, he actually tried to see the best in people and was happy.<eos> And he walked through the world carrying the tiny candle of hope, shielding it against the bitter winds of negativity.
We got company.<eos> The construction company, specifically.<eos> Those big hairy brutes want to take my Cherry!<eos> Hold on, let's see if it's just two kids who stole a truck.<eos> Good afternoon, ma'am.<eos> I'm a construction worker, so first of all, nice cans, toots.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Second of all, are these your sons?<eos> Son and stepson, yes.<eos> Why? They stole a cherry picker from our site, and we need it back so we can junk it.
He has more merit than he will admit.<eos> Yes, he is really very modest.<eos> You're right. Your father is a man of virtue, who overcomes temptations in every meal.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Personally, the fact I'm eating with you won't... make me decide to become a vegetarian.<eos> This meat is succulent.<eos> The mustard, please.<eos> I have accredited suppliers.<eos> That's true.<eos> This meat is so tender you could cut it with a fork.
- Would you like a finger of port?<eos> - Of course.<eos> It's like in business. You must see people. It's not always nice.<eos> A tiny apartment like this one... where you can rest calmly is a very relaxing thing.<eos> We have the same convictions. We'll be very good friends.<eos> I think so...<eos> My God!<eos> How awful.<eos> This dressed cost me 700 francs.<eos> You should wash it with warm water.
Murphy's a fierce cop hater.<eos> Ah, Phinbar, you daft bastard.<eos> You men, go with Corcoran.<eos> Have a pleasant little chat with Mister Murphy.<eos> And the rest of you, what the hell are you doin'?<eos> I thought you might have worked up an appetite.<eos> Coppers are crawlin' all over the points.<eos> Let's tuck in, you can tell me about the departed Phinbar Byrnes.<eos> All the gorgeous and gory details. Or you could leave us men to drink in peace.<eos> You ever put your hands on me again, boy, I'll chop it off you.
You fixed yourself.<eos> If the great Sherlock Holmes can do it, then you give me hope.<eos> (horns honking in distance)<eos> (door opens)<eos> (door closes)<eos> (Irene screams)<eos> He was here.<eos> Mr. Stapleton was here.<eos> IRENE (recorded): Sherlock, it's ready.<eos> My original piece is finally ready, and you have an exclusive invitation to view it.
Meet me at my place by 5:00, or into the fireplace it goes.<eos> (click)<eos> Hello?<eos> I realize I'm late, but I have the most dazzling of excuses.<eos> I thought you were taking me someplace safe.<eos> This is an old garage.<eos> I assure you it's a good deal more than that.<eos> Come on.<eos> I received this property as... payment... for some work I did when I first arrived in New York.<eos> Had intended to sell it... but then I realized... it might make a passable safe house... in case of emergency.
- I know.<eos> Spooky. It's not me that's glowing.<eos> It's this.<eos> - Wow. - What is it?<eos> - It's a stone of Good fortune.<eos> My great uncle's wife's brother once told me of its powers.<eos> - I thought he was mute.<eos> - Until he found the stone.<eos> Then we couldn't shut him up.<eos> This stone brings good luck to whomever comes in contact with it.
I mean, you can't even enter the space program if don't have a college degree.<eos> I am chastened.<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> I know what I must do.<eos> No, I cannot pass a law eliminating the college requirement to become an astronaut.<eos> You disappoint me, father.<eos> If you just applied yourself a little bit, you could be a really great president.<eos> Damn it, I can't stay mad at you.<eos> Dad, that creep wrote on your Wikipedia page again.<eos> But don't worry, I'm editing it.
Hey, I found an opening.<eos> That Bork was a dweeb, but boy, he could climb like a mountain goat.<eos> Fishlegs, I thought we agreed to ease up on the dragon calls.<eos> Actually, that wasn't me.<eos> Mine's far more authentic.<eos> - You wanna tell that to him?<eos> - Head for the cave!<eos> - Wait.<eos> What cave?<eos> - We just saw it!
No.<eos> So I'm sure you can find your way to the right ones.<eos> You do it.<eos> Then you'd be doing the job of four for half my take, isn't that right?<eos> Even a dope like Donald earns twice your pay.<eos> The heaviest thing he lifts is the lead between his ears.<eos> Let's stop worrying about how the men have it better and get back to work.<eos> Lorna's right.<eos> You're still making good money.<eos> If you still want that house you should get it.
All right, we'll start with them.<eos> And we need to get into that game, find "nameless," and put him under surveillance.<eos> We're gonna stake out a character in a video game? Yeah, we find out when he plays and who he eliminates next... could tell us who he's going to kill next.<eos> Virtual stakeout.<eos> I had it in my attic, part of my great-grandfather's collection, and I just thought, you know, it looked like it belonged here.<eos> It's a Gustav Becker double weight vienna, around 1870.<eos> Case is superb walnut.<eos> You know, Becker got his big breakthrough in 1852, at the Silesian clock fair.<eos> He won the gold medal for best design.<eos> You sure you want to give it to me?
Yeah.<eos> Where's Charlie?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Pretty impressive, Aaron.<eos> Well, other kids played sports.<eos> Of course, I have no idea what I'm building.<eos> The capsule is first-generation nanotech.<eos> It kept Danny alive.<eos> Fixed his lung tissue.<eos> You can reprogram it to do almost anything... Stitch bone, heal skin...
My God.<eos> Dan.<eos> - They rescued me.<eos> - Who are they?<eos> We left them working at the tower the night of the blackout.<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> You fell off the face of the Earth.<eos> Not "off" it.<eos> Beneath it.<eos> We've been down here, guarding The Tower, and our children and our children's children will protect it when we're gone.
I didn't want to wake you.<eos> - What time is it?<eos> - Uh, 7:00.<eos> Oops, I have to pick up the boys from grandma's.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, the baking dish is still dirty, so I'm gonna wash it.<eos> - I'll clean it.<eos> - Matt.<eos> I saw this swing set fort type thing at True Value.<eos> I've been meaning to build it for Griffin and Ben.
- Here we go.<eos> - Get away from Walt's chain, man!<eos> I'm just saying... I... n-no! N-n-n-n-no!<eos> Please, no, no, no, no!<eos> No! - Desecration!<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Shut up.<eos> There's no desecration.<eos> Don't interrupt me.<eos> That's my dad's chain, and I'm taking it.
- All day, son. Come on, don't-don't put your head in there.<eos> - Don't put your head in there, all right?<eos> - All day. - Dude, that's my uncle.<eos> - Come get your chain, Boston!<eos> What?<eos> All day! All day!<eos> All day!<eos> - All day!<eos> - I don't need it.<eos> - I don't want it.
Yes.<eos> We certainly can't pick our fathers,<eos> Mr. Palmer.<eos> But the real tragedy occurs when our fathers do not pick us.<eos> Anything?<eos> Your timing is impeccable.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Something under the skin?<eos> Piece of a broken needle.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure they had no intention of leaving it behind.
I think we're already doing it, Admiral.<eos> I've got an appointment I can't be late for.<eos> Then I'll try to make it quick.<eos> I'm waiting.<eos> Where were you when Commander Brian... With my staff.<eos> From the moment that helo landed to when I stepped off the Borealis.<eos> Captain Vandevere also knew my whereabouts at all times.<eos> Are we done?<eos> You used a phony name to see the doctor.<eos> Like I said, you have a question, ask it.
Why avoid the truth?<eos> Why avoid your son?<eos> All right.<eos> Because I'm sick.<eos> No one could know.<eos> Stage four.<eos> I wasn't feeling well when we...<eos> showed up for the exercises.<eos> I knew Haber was top-notch, so I transferred to the Borealis.<eos> Haber gave me something for the pain, but he knew what was causing it.
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...<eos> He's dead.<eos> No, no! I can't. I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can help you turn it off.<eos> She's ruthless without her humanity.<eos> The cure is the fastest way to get it back.
Bonnie, wait. Get away from me, Silas.<eos> We can help each other.<eos> This is what you do.<eos> You wait until I lose control and then you want to swoop in and save me.<eos> You really think you have a choice?<eos> If you don't let me help you, your expression will consume you from the inside out.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> You didn't try to do that, did you?<eos> Your magic is taking on a life of its own.<eos> You need help controlling it.
You're right.<eos> Looks like he made the right choice.<eos> He certainly did.<eos> So, we agree.<eos> The best woman won.<eos> She certainly did.<eos> He's on two dates, isn't he?<eos> He certainly is.<eos> This is the most fun I've ever had on a work study gig.<eos> And I used to run the frozen yogurt machine before that old guy broke it.
I was looking for disgruntled bank customers like you asked, and there were a half dozen loans that had been approved by Randy and then killed by Diana "the Termi-gator" Cabrera.<eos> And I thought you might be interested to see the name of one of them.<eos> Do you have everything you need?<eos> Customer needs assistance in the pest-control aisle.<eos> Customer needs assistance in the pest-control aisle.<eos> Oh, it's okay.<eos> Found it.<eos> And, uh, so did you, apparently.<eos> So, here's my question.<eos> How long were your parents living in that home before the bank took it away?

I'll do the math.<eos> She met you in a bar, thought you were in the navy, got pregnant and had to put her entire life on hold.<eos> Now, surely you can understand why she wants to tap the brakes a little.<eos> Huh.<eos> I thought you were gonna say,<eos> "She'll come around, man" and give me one of these.<eos> This is good, too.<eos> Well, maybe I'll be carrying a bouquet of sawgrass and poison oak, but, man, I love this dress.<eos> Stunning.<eos> It's a shame you'll never wear it outside of this room.

Same threat, same demand.<eos> GREGSON:<eos> How did you find Charles Milverton?<eos> He e-mailed me again last week.<eos> Asked for more money.<eos> I wrote him back and said I had it, but it was in cash.<eos> Said I'd borrowed it from a friend who runs numbers.<eos> Couldn't deposit it in a bank without raising a red flag.<eos> I left an envelope under a park bench.<eos> When he came to pick it up, I followed him home.
Take your Juicy sweatpants and your dirty pillow from home, and your bucket of Coke, and get the hell out of my sight.<eos> What was her problem?<eos> You see that, Brian?<eos> That's going to be our penises later, right?<eos> Stewie, that teleportation machine is amazing.<eos> It's so great that we're already here.<eos> Yep, drink it in, Bri.<eos> Time to enjoy all the Bellagio has to offer. Classic architecture.<eos> Beautiful art.<eos> Plus, the air is clean because they suck up all the cigarette smoke and dump it in the bad hotels.
Also known as Gallifrey Falls.<eos> This painting doesn't belong here - not in this time or place.<eos> Obviously.<eos> It's the fall of Arcadia, Gallifrey's second city.<eos> But how is it doing that?<eos> How is that possible?<eos> It's an oil painting... ..in 3D.<eos> Time Lord art.<eos> A slice of real time... ..frozen.<eos> Elizabeth told us where to find it...and its significance.
You may kiss the bride.<eos> Is there a lot of this in the future?<eos> It does start to happen, yeah.<eos> God speed, my love.<eos> I will be right back.<eos> Whoo!<eos> Right, then, back to the future.<eos> You've let this place go a bit!<eos> Ah, it's his grunge phase.<eos> He grows out of it.
Clean up our mess.<eos> Dude, found a way out.<eos> Check it.<eos> You're such an idiot.<eos> It's Joe, right?<eos> Dude, this is the guy who saved my ass when that plane went down.<eos> He totally said it was raining arms and legs.<eos> Yeah, you could say that.<eos> What are you up to?<eos> So far, I marked these points, and by measuring the distance between them, I was able to come up with the Y coordinate, and then by multiplying it by its K integer...

Jackson, this...this juice.<eos> Is it really so simple to make?<eos> Even you might do so, Drake.<eos> Then make some more.<eos> DOOR HANDLE RATTLES<eos> Sergeant Linklater is to be left in peace, Mr Reid, as you well know.<eos> Do you know, Sergeant, when we first plucked you from that pike on Chicksand Street, I thought, above all, that the sanctity of this force must be protected.<eos> Because, to those who wish to live in peace hereabout, we must be their buttress to that aim.<eos> We found a powdered substance on the dressing table of a woman named Pang... ..discovered its nature and made our own, here.<eos> I beg you, sir, give it to me.

In the current mood?<eos> My mind advances, but my frame is frail.<eos> How would your newly sullied reputation cope with another interview concluding in a man's death?<eos> Gossip, Reid.<eos> It's a fact of prison life.<eos> Were I to tell you the life of an infant boy depended on your speaking, might that make impact?<eos> Not really.<eos> Then what, Doctor?<eos> There is a tale told, Inspector.<eos> The guards here tell it.
There you go.<eos> They're so beautiful.<eos> You're quiet today.<eos> Forgive me, my love.<eos> The Inspector was turning all philosophical on me.<eos> Gave me an 'eadache.<eos> We'll have words.<eos> Can't have him wearing out that noggin.<eos> The law's the law, right?<eos> And policemen serve it.
I killed them of my own full accord... ..for reasons spiteful and indecent.<eos> You are no less a messenger boy than Roberts and Featherwell.<eos> And did they ever question those by whom they were sent, or seek to comprehend the message they delivered?<eos> For whom do you kill?<eos> Why lay down your life?<eos> Do you see, I am all that stands between you and the rope?<eos> Tell me!<eos> On my death, all I have, plus a settlement of insurance, will be directed to my boy.<eos> Do you understand, law man?<eos> The one goodness I may achieve in this wretched life will be the timely leaving of it.
you stay out here.<eos> I'm told there will be scouts attending... from the West End playhouses.<eos> I worry, Bennet.<eos> I fear the song I am to perform is not...<eos> That I don't sing it very well.<eos> But it's fashionable...and comic.<eos> You must do what you think best, Rose.<eos> If I was to do what... you thought best?<eos> I know no songs.<eos> But if you ask me... ..you must use a song that speaks to your heart... ..and sing it from there, girl.
Well, it's not working at all.<eos> All I'm thinking about is what we could do with that butter.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Okay.<eos> You need to stand over there.<eos> Way out of grabbing range.<eos> This is about baking, nothing else.<eos> Got it, right.<eos> Well, the dough looks perfect.<eos> I think we're ready to put it in.

Consuela's gonna give us mani-pedis, but she only has energy for two, so, Tamara, feel free to wait outside... with my dog.<eos> Thanks for your lack of hospitality, but I think I'm gonna head out.<eos> Good!<eos> Now I won't feel bad talking shit about you<eos> - to your face.<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> - Don't hold back.<eos> - Really?<eos> Because I do have a question for you.<eos> Bring it.
Ugh--whoa!<eos> Jeez, where did you come from?<eos> The where is not as important as the who.<eos> Okay, then who?<eos> - Fred Wu.<eos> - Fred who?<eos> - Fred Wu.<eos> - Oh, Fred Wu.<eos> - Doesn't ring a bell.<eos> - Let me ring it for you.
I do.<eos> If the councilman only admired his precious collection, why is the bat now facing the opposite way?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Uh, sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> Is there a development?<eos> We need to take your father's autographed bat as evidence.<eos> What for?<eos> We suspect the wood resin found on the bat is gonna match the wood resin found on your father's head from the blow that killed him.<eos> So we're gonna take it down and print it and test it for DNA.<eos> You know, you can wipe a bat down, even wash it off, but it is very hard to get rid of the DNA.
- It's gonna be okay, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Those guys downstairs, they've done this thousands of times.<eos> Captain Mahoney.<eos> Tactical wants an update.<eos> Well, lack of access is limiting our options.<eos> What'd you find out about that handheld remote he had?<eos> It definitely activated the bomb.<eos> Good news?<eos> Tech thinks it could deactivate it as well.
We need to think bigger.<eos> You want bigger, well, listen up.<eos> I show Ocean's Eleven every Tuesday over at the senior center.<eos> They forget what happens.<eos> Oh. Oh.<eos> What do you got?<eos> You tell Mayor Gainey that you are reconsidering the mall project.<eos> You'd like to have lunch with him and his wife at Fancie's to talk it over.<eos> Tom Long will act as valet.<eos> He will find the barn key, give it to you and you head over to Gainey's and... voila.
Max, you are not doing that.<eos> The hell I'm not.<eos> This is my one chance to see a woman naked without having to spoon her after.<eos> Respect.<eos> Well, you've made a lot of strong choices here, but I'm not sure they're all working together.<eos> For example, that sex swing is fighting the goat.<eos> Now, why don't we start by you going and getting us some rubber gloves?<eos> Lots of them, and the strongest bleach and soap products you can find.<eos> Oh, and a Hazmat suit.<eos> Don't worry about the size. I can belt it.

She broke up with Mr. Pettigrove. So... they won't be needing my egg.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I'm sorry for the way I spoke to you.<eos> I was just excited about going to school and helping you.<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> Many years ago, Mrs. Delatour gave me a ring.<eos> It's sort of expensive.<eos> I've been saving it for...<eos> I don't know. Maybe I've been saving it for this.<eos> Anyway, I'm gonna sell it to pay for your tuition.
Kids, as you know, "The Bermuda Triangle" was the name we gave to the curb right outside our apartment, which possessed the magical ability to make any item disappear.<eos> Instantly.<eos> The biggest rule for de-cluttering is,<eos> "Have you used it in the last year?"<eos> If not...<eos> Triangle.<eos> Have you used this jump rope in the last year?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I hop threads every morning, son!<eos> Do three in a row and you can keep it.

The emotions are overwhelming you.<eos> You just have to focus on one thing, ok?<eos> [Sobbing] No, I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> You just find that one thing inside of you that makes you strong.<eos> It's in there.<eos> Just latch on to it.<eos> Channel everything you're feeling into that one emotion.<eos> Find the thing inside of you that makes you want to live.<eos> Elena, let it in.
Hey. I needed to see you.<eos> I need to close the veil, Jer.<eos> The hybrids and the hunters...<eos> I get it.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> I just wanted to be with you when it happened.<eos> - Did you and Elena... - I can't...<eos> I can't say good bye to her.<eos> We said no tears, and I left her a letter.<eos> She'll find it when all this is over.
You know that."<eos> "What if you tried playing an easy tune you know well?"<eos> Elisa said suddenly. "Maybe it'd work and you'd forget."<eos> I looked if there was something on the news.<eos> I listened to the radio, but there was nothing. Only an unknown woman who fell from a bridge.<eos> I don't think it was mom.<eos> I don't know why she'd have fallen from a bridge.<eos> I'll send the first letter tomorrow.<eos> It's already sealed and stamped, with the address.<eos> I just have to post it.
Me too. With some luck, the Canadians will answer.<eos> The young woman found unconscious still hasn't been identified.<eos> I'm sure she's the one I told you about.<eos> Should I tell the cops?<eos> You told her what you knew. You gave them the phone numbers.<eos> What more can you do?<eos> The less we see of the cops, the better.<eos> Ludo? I had to move out because my roommate has a boyfriend now.<eos> Could I leave my car in your yard for a few days?<eos> I don't want to leave it outside, with all my stuff in it.
Heck, i got a guppie multi-tool, I've got a solar-powered hand fan, got camo glasses, built-in compass, Snake bite kit--<eos> So nothing?<eos> Well, not nothing.<eos> I can build a fire.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> You know what, Castle?<eos> I can pull myself out if you could boost me up.<eos> Well, then how am I gonna get out?<eos> I have a rope in the car.<eos> I was gonna hike back to get it.
No, no, no, do not say it.<eos> "The Curse of Death Manor."<eos> So when The Blood Butcher flings open the door, Nikki, you're going crazy with fear.<eos> You know that you have this one last chance to survive.<eos> So you grab the jar of lye and you throw it in his face like this!<eos> And Rick, you start clawing at your face and your eyes, but nothing can stop you.<eos> You're The Blood Butcher.<eos> So you're already turning back towards her as...<eos> You rush past him, right out of frame, okay?<eos> Just remember to keep your injured hand by your side so that we don't pick it up on camera, okay?
- Wow.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We understand that you and Zack had an argument yesterday?<eos> We had a difference of opinion, yeah.<eos> Well, we heard it was a little more heated than that, Rick.<eos> What happened?<eos> Look, Vince counted on me to protect him, even from himself.<eos> I was just doin' my job.<eos> Did you think that this stunt was too dangerous for him to do?<eos> Maybe he could've handled it back in the day, but that was a long time ago.
Juliette?<eos> I'm making some eggs, you want some?<eos> I think we have a problem...<eos> Good eggs, too.<eos> The way you like them, and bacon.<eos> That was the best chicken tagine I have ever watched you make.<eos> With the ice.<eos> There isn't any.<eos> No, no, no, you relax.<eos> If you really want the car, we should just get it.
Divers, they * the bottom of the pool.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'm holding, but a better question is... what are you doing here?<eos> I thought you were going to Robinson's retirement dinner tonight.<eos> Yeah, Wes Robinson's gone.<eos> That makes me the last member of my academy class still on the job.<eos> So you collected, how much was in the trophy?<eos> - Maybe $4,000.<eos> - That's great!<eos> That's your reward for making history.<eos> Yeah, and reliving it over and over.
Hey, you are an asshole.<eos> Okay?<eos> And I am never talking to you again. Never.<eos> There's nothing in either LAPD rules or policy that says Rusty can't live with a police officer.<eos> Stroh's lawyers will claim you coached the child.<eos> I've never discussed the case with Rusty even once.<eos> No, you just put a roof over his head, fed him, and bought him his clothes.<eos> Are you paying for the Catholic school that goes with the uniform he's wearing?<eos> And were those keys to a vehicle he just grabbed off your desk?<eos> I keep a car for when my kids visit, and Rusty takes it to school.
Almost 49,000 hits already.<eos> It's going totally viral.<eos> Okay, how do you get it off of this thing?<eos> - I don't want people to see this.<eos> - It's funny, Ma.<eos> Aww. Isn't that nice?<eos> - Enjoying a video of your sweet daughter.<eos> - You saw it?<eos> Several times, along with everyone at headquarters.<eos> Let's see it again.
The only thing I know is... that she was with a man from Chaco, she got together with him and then she disappeared from town...<eos> She came back later to sell the house and... they left together:<eos> But she didn't leave a phone number, address, nothing...<eos> You came to visit her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's too bad, darling, she didn't leave a number... nothing.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Good morning, how are you?<eos> I'm looking for a job, for a short time... for the summer... cleaning the pool, mowing the lawn...<eos> The thing is that this is not my house, I'm watching it for my aunt and uncle and I think they take care of those things.
Two pineapples...<eos> Here it is...<eos> See?<eos> Here.<eos> Cool.<eos> Hey, why did you come from your aunt's house?<eos> Because... my grandmother passed away and...<eos> The one who raised you?<eos> Right...<eos> I lived with her ... and when she died, my uncle... said to me that I had to leave the room I was staying in ... because there were going to fix the house to sell it.
My friends, the fate of this man is in your hands.<eos> It's up to you to see that justice is done.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Eric, welcome back.<eos> You look fabulous.<eos> So do you.<eos> Which brings us to the key.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> Well, that's disappointing.<eos> I assume you told my brother what would happen if you didn't produce it.
Lawyers aren't worth a damn in here.<eos> He said he knew someone from Rhinebeck.<eos> I don't think I would have survived.<eos> Hey, I'm out of shaving cream.<eos> Did you remember to bring any home on the way?<eos> Never mind. I'll just use yours.<eos> Almost there.<eos> So I wrote you a song.<eos> And it is very bad.<eos> But I'm gonna play it anyway.
- Here!<eos> - Voice came from over there.<eos> Watch yourself.<eos> Water's moving fast.<eos> Chief, down there!<eos> I don't think I can hold on much longer!<eos> Hang on.<eos> We're gonna get you out.<eos> Get your webbing out.<eos> Secure it to this handle.
It feels a little outside the law, a little dangerous.<eos> I like to do what I want.<eos> Just trying to get that into my music.<eos> That must affect your romantic life.<eos> Do you wanna comment on that?<eos> Let's just say I do what I want there, too, if you get what I mean.<eos> Gunnar's gonna be performing tomorrow at the bar on 2nd.<eos> That's enough of that.<eos> We gotta get his demo to Marshall.<eos> - If I can find it.

All it would take is three or four well-placed RDX charges.<eos> And that'll make this facility completely inaccessible from the surface?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The only way to get in after that is to dig, and that would mean heavy equipment which would lead to a lot of questions from the locals.<eos> Right.<eos> The kind of questions the President doesn't want anyone asking.<eos> What about the questions the President will ask when she finds out Division blew itself up?<eos> Well, it'll look like an accident.<eos> An explosion caused by some leftover armament from when this was a missile site.<eos> The only way a cover story works is if there's someone left to tell it.
Just give us a minute, please.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm wonderful.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good, thank you.<eos> And thank you for seeing me.<eos> Vazquez updated me.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> The box is set to be auctioned to a rival nation.<eos> If you get me into the reception tonight, I'll recover it for you.
It's okay.<eos> You did good, baby.<eos> Chase can't hurt us anymore.<eos> Max, is that you?<eos> Chase?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> After we spoke on the street, I slipped on that slice of pizza you dropped and I hit my head.<eos> I've been unconscious for three days.<eos> Unconscious?<eos> So then it couldn't have been you building my life up only to knock it down.
Napkin dispensers, and soup, and all of that Parmesan cheese.<eos> And then you drew on the walls.<eos> It's called modern art.<eos> If I was a artist, people would pay millions for those drawings.<eos> You're not an artist.<eos> You know what rhymes with "liar"?<eos> "Lawyer."<eos> No, actually it doesn't.<eos> RUDY: I got an idea.<eos> Let's find Wade's car and push it in the lake.
Oh, we have to go and do homework before the prom.<eos> Bye.<eos> Well, you did say "totally different." Bye!<eos> Thanks for coming out so fast, man.<eos> All your online reviews say how in demand you are.<eos> Yeah, it's a good thing you got me between jobs.<eos> Your main support beam is near-about busted all the way through.<eos> No way.<eos> See there?<eos> Hell, I'm afraid to even let go of it long enough to get my jack and shore it up.
Sorry about that.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> Come on, Ezra, let's get in the car.<eos> No. Sit with me.<eos> Aren't you cold?<eos> There was a pet store here.<eos> I guess they closed it.
We talked on the phone, and I dropped the vial at a prearranged place.<eos> How did you get paid?<eos> He told me to set up an offshore account.<eos> The day after the drop, the money just appeared.<eos> Hey, guys, check it out.<eos> The money arrived via a wire transfer.<eos> With Cindy's cooperation, we were able to track it to a Mexican energy company called Mexisolar.<eos> I heard Eric talk about this.<eos> What does a Mexican solar company have to do with Eric Vaughn?<eos> He owns it.
I'm making you a cardinal, Jean-Marie. And I'm taking you as my adviser.<eos> Soon, I'll make you part of the Synod's General Council.<eos> You'll become papabile.<eos> Some day, perhaps, a Jew will act the clown in this silly car.<eos> You're an exceptionally free man, spiritually free.<eos> But you give me too much, Karol.<eos> I know that what I give you will be returned to the Church a hundredfold.<eos> This is just good politics, my brother.<eos> The Church proposes a realistic utopia.<eos> John Paul II calls it "Civilisation of Love".
Listen.<eos> The Communists passed a law to make Auschwitz the symbol of Poland's suffering.<eos> They made it the symbol of Polish patriotism. It is at the centre of their propaganda.<eos> They've been brainwashing children for 40 years, obliging schools to visit it.<eos> This camp is of huge strategic importance.<eos> Why do you think I celebrated Mass there the first time I returned to the country as Pope?<eos> The subtleties of Polish politics are lost on the rest of the world.<eos> Even other Christians are outraged by this convent.<eos> This issue is like a bomb.<eos> You must defuse it.
Good, thank you.<eos> Um, oh! Is there a problem?<eos> No, I...<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Er...<eos> Val Kilmer.<eos> Yes, sir, yeah.<eos> See this watch?<eos> It's worth thousands of dollars, as far as you know.<eos> What do you say we take it off my wrist and put it on your wrist, we tear up the bill?
I wonder if I might have a word?<eos> So, what can I help you with?<eos> Do you mind if I ask how it happened?<eos> How does anything happen?<eos> You dredged it all up.<eos> My mind was all over the place.<eos> I was at sixes and sevens.<eos> Did they tell you what happens to the hand after they...<eos> Cut it off?<eos> Burn it, presumably.
So, the year so far has been pretty awesome.<eos> Uh, what has been your highlights?<eos> Not getting kidnapped.<eos> Trying new things.<eos> For example, I ate papaya.<eos> Good one.<eos> We're basically riding the horse of life.<eos> We're, like, so much cooler than what we were a year ago.<eos> Now, this is really good for your tris, [Grunts] your delts, - your lats.<eos> Let's take a picture and send it to all our old high-school teachers.
When I pleaded her son's case to the King, her husband just sat there, beside me saying nothing.<eos> Naples is not Rome.<eos> No?<eos> And Naples may seem nor even be Naples.<eos> A French presence there, would see that they did our bidding. A French presence there, would end her marriage, for good.<eos> She hopes to wheel some influence, Cesare. On the next heir to the throne.<eos> - Just how will she manage that?<eos> - Through your father.<eos> Investiture of the crown still lies with the Pope, does it not?<eos> Not the choice of who wears it!
Thanks.<eos> It's the Church.<eos> The Church?<eos> Yeah, the Church owns the whole street.<eos> The agents are just the agents.<eos> Now, do you want anything?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Thanks. Thank you.<eos> We get a pizza, like, if get a margherita, yeah, we share it between all of us, innit?

I don't think so.<eos> They can get DNA, all kinds of shit, these days.<eos> Solicitor said they'll put it all to bed.<eos> Is he good, your solicitor?<eos> She.<eos> Yeah, and I reckon she's real good.<eos> All the same, I don't think you should come with me when I go to pick up the shipment.<eos> All right...<eos> I'll put your half somewhere safe.<eos> Listen, you make sure you put it somewhere really safe, you get me?
Then we're just gonna solve this without their help.<eos> Where are we on motive?<eos> Well, there's plenty of that to go around.<eos> Tanner wasn't afraid to take on the big boys-- banks, big oil, dirty politicians.<eos> In the past year, he posted highly damaging, and I might add, truthful information on 30 corporations, government agencies, and individuals.<eos> And that's just what I found before his site was taken off-line.<eos> With no solid information, it's hard to even know where to start.<eos> We start with manner of death.<eos> We know we're dealing with a bomb, a bomb that was already in Tanner's car.<eos> Right, because he stayed near the vehicle, no one could've tampered with it.
Because I like being alive, that's why.<eos> Somebody put a bomb in his car. I had people chasing me.<eos> You and I both know that there was no bomb.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You used the software hack to fire a missile from a drone.<eos> You're outta your mind.<eos> Wh-why is this happening to me? !<eos> Are you actually gonna sit there and tell me that you had no idea about the flash drive Warburg gave Tanner?<eos> I had an idea, sure.<eos> Tanner sent me to pick it up from the dead drop.
- And the written confession?<eos> - I want to avoid a scandal.<eos> A scandal would harm everyone, including your family. Your mother.<eos> Have you discussed this with your mother?<eos> No.<eos> Imagine her shame on seeing your photo on the front pages.<eos> The letter will leave today.<eos> I promise you.<eos> Here.<eos> I'll sign it.

I'll be sorry if he means to revive the ways of his grandpapa, winking at every beauty in an opera box.<eos> It must be a lonely job.<eos> All the public want is a happy marriage at the Palace.<eos> Is it so much to ask?<eos> And anyway, why did Mrs Dudley Ward have the letter in her handbag?<eos> I expect it was a love thing.<eos> It won't be much of a love thing when it's in the American papers.<eos> Do you think that's why he took it?<eos> Sampson took it to make money.<eos> The question is whether he means to blackmail Mrs Dudley Ward or sell it to the foreign press.
I told you never to speak her name.<eos> Yes, my liege.<eos> Prepare the armadas for surface invasion.<eos> The Amazons' judgment is at hand.<eos> Because of you, I'll be responsible for the deaths of millions.<eos> The odds against recreating exact variables in the original accident are...<eos> Then just try to douse the flames a little faster this time, okay?<eos> Told you I was fast.<eos> This is Lois Lane of The Daily Planet.<eos> My battery is about to die and I will likely be joining it soon.
Third-party IVF reproduction.<eos> I met with a counselor and gave blood, went through donor books prioritizing possible candidates.<eos> I was there until 10:00 that night, which you are free to call and confirm.<eos> Oh, believe me, I will.<eos> Daniel?<eos> I just spoke with a representative at Atlantic Coast Donor Clinic who confirmed that Cindy Pavlin was with a donor counselor<eos> - the night of the murder.<eos> - Thanks, Daniel.<eos> Oh, and tell Carlos I'm about to send him a photo.<eos> Tell him to look at it and get back to me?
- Do you mind if I sit down?<eos> No, of course, please.<eos> Gosh, how much do you just love Jeremiah's class?<eos> Yeah, he's great.<eos> I've seen you crying a couple times.<eos> I'm a life coach, so I'm really attuned to people's energies.<eos> That's interesting.<eos> Lena, Ezra had an accident last night.<eos> They towed his car off Mulholland.<eos> We need to find it.
You're a cop.<eos> Make something up.<eos> That's what I pay you for.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You took me off a real homicide for a fucking log?<eos> You don't pay me enough, Ray.<eos> Hey, what's happening?<eos> Get someone to pick up Ezra's car at the impound.<eos> Drop it by the body shop.<eos> I want it like new.
The water tower...<eos> Yeah, I know; it fell.<eos> We'll just have to get our water from Lake Eastpointe.<eos> Can't.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> This is the water from the lake.<eos> It's polluted with methane.<eos> Must've cut through an underground mineral pocket when the dome came down.<eos> So it's undrinkable.<eos> Yeah, until we figure out how to filter it.
She's dead.<eos> These two guys.<eos> One kept calling the other one...<eos> Waylon?<eos> Sounds like the Dundee brothers.<eos> Find them.<eos> Dome's still here. Outside it's totally dry.<eos> How is it only raining in here?<eos> The dome must have its own microclimate.<eos> The water from the lake evaporates, but the dome traps it inside.

Guess we're not gonna run out of water after all.
It won't happen again.<eos> I give you my word.<eos> Now, what can I do to make it up to you?<eos> Well, the diner needs food.<eos> I mean, there's a little, but it'll go fast.<eos> I think it'll be good to open this place up again.<eos> Rose would've wanted that.<eos> I'll talk to Ollie Densmore.<eos> We'll come to an arrangement.<eos> You know, the day's coming when, uh... the only way any of us are gonna get food is by taking it out of the ground.
Maybe we hallucinated it.<eos> No. I saw it and you saw it.<eos> - Things don't just disappear into thin air.<eos> - Really?<eos> Just like things don't just appear out of thin air and swallow towns whole.<eos> There is a rational explanation for this.<eos> Okay?<eos> For all of this.<eos> There has to be;<eos> we just have to find it.
I already took care of your little insurance policy.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> It's over.<eos> What the hell did you do?<eos> !<eos> As long as Max is breathing, she's a threat.<eos> Now she's not.<eos> And neither are you.<eos> Barbie, put that weapon down!<eos> Put it down now!
Stay away from the windows.<eos> Were those gallows going up next to Town Hall?<eos> This day just keeps getting awesomer.<eos> What do we do about the egg?<eos> We need to hide it someplace safe.<eos> We're all stuck in the same Podunk town.<eos> There's nowhere to stash anything.<eos> This is Big Jim Rennie with a message for Julia Shumway.<eos> We know you have a dangerous weapon in your possession.<eos> Bring it to us now, and we'll discuss a reduced sentence for your accomplice, Dale Barbara.
My people, they had a capacity for joy unmatched by any tribe to ever walk the earth.<eos> That's what Lilith took from me.<eos> It's what I took from them.<eos> I need to get back to the start.<eos> Do you see that?<eos> I can't give you back what you lost, even if I wanted to.<eos> You will fill this hole whether you like it or not.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> We both know you're not gonna use that on me.<eos> No, but I will take this stupid ball of light and throw it away.
How would you feel about me being there with you when you talk to the kids?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> That-- that might be good.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I guess I should've seen that one coming.<eos> What is the box she's talking about?<eos> I didn't know then, and after this telenovela,<eos> I sure as fuck don't wants to know now.<eos> But someone should see it before Arlene, though.
Should I accept Nolan's friend request?<eos> God, no.<eos> I'll go get my stuff, Mom.<eos> How you doing?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Still a little embarrassed about the Patrick thing.<eos> I'm really sorry, Charlie.<eos> I just thought I'd found my calling.<eos> Don't beat yourself up.<eos> You'll find it one day.
What the hell are you doing poking around in my life for?<eos> I was downloading Lacey's high school transcripts and I had some spare time.<eos> By the way, she got a D in Sex Ed.<eos> Wow, even with all that extra credit.<eos> - I know, I know, I'm late. - You're late, huh?<eos> Couldn't mean an egg has taken root in your uterus.<eos> Of course, you'd have known that if you hadn't slept through class. Not today, old man.<eos> - You okay, Lace?<eos> - No.<eos> My car was sticking out, like, an inch into your jerkwad neighbor's driveway, and the old dude said if I didn't move it, he would have me towed.
Yes, I noticed.<eos> So what's the plan with the Mini?<eos> I sold it.<eos> What?<eos> ! I told you if you ever wanted to get rid of it, that-that I would take it.<eos> Well, I didn't think you were serious.<eos> What part of "I'm totally serious"<eos> made you think that?<eos> I'm sorry, Tony.<eos> I know you wanted the car, but I just didn't think it was a good idea to sell it to you.
I can do what I want.<eos> Come here.<eos> Hey, that's mine!<eos> It's evidence!<eos> Sit down!<eos> And you're 17, Miss Patricia Edwards.<eos> And you have an I.D. from Nevada, saying that this motel is your home address.<eos> Yeah, it's my home.<eos> And you just kicked the door in.<eos> You're fixing it.
I've never seen him so happy.<eos> He's mellowing.<eos> Well, thanks for getting me my badge back.<eos> Hope it helped.<eos> Dawson was questioned but cleared of Perkins' murder seven years ago.<eos> But the FBI found physical evidence linking him to the crime, prompting today's shocking arrest.<eos> This is Lisa for Channel 8 News.<eos> Doyle wouldn't have anything to do with a murder.<eos> I agree.<eos> But one way or another, he got his hands on the murder weapon, and he found a way to monetize it.
- He doesn't have a plan.<eos> - So what are we supposed to do, just sit around and wait until he comes up with one?<eos> No.<eos> Sam and I are gonna head down to Waaldt's club and we're gonna find out who we're dealing with.<eos> Okay, what am I supposed to do?<eos> Back up your partner.<eos> Are there surveillance cameras at the cover house?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> But he's got an earwig.<eos> We can send him a message, tell him to put it in.
You're not helping.<eos> You are not helping.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> No.<eos> Keep eating your bonbons.<eos> No origami today?<eos> No.<eos> And stop littering my dash.<eos> You're hungry.<eos> I know hypoglycemic-induced hostility when I see it.
_<eos> You can imagine how deeply disturbed I was by that e-mail.<eos> Clearly, someone has managed to expose your forgery, which you led me to believe was next to impossible.<eos> Not next to impossible.<eos> Impossible.<eos> Oh, I suggest that you consult an online dictionary for the meaning of the word.<eos> Don't forget that while you may be able to disguise your voice with parlor room theatrics, I know your true identity.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - The source of the leak.<eos> Uncover it, seal it...
Don't fucking make it hard.<eos> This is happening whether you like it or not, bruv.<eos> It's ringing... do it.<eos> Yo, Rafe. 'Yo!<eos> Yo, what's happening?<eos> It's me, I need you to do me a favour still.<eos> 'Yeah, what's that? '<eos> Mmmm, yeah, I got a little debt I need to run back.<eos> I need you to sell my car, yeah?<eos> Yeah, I need to sell it quick though.
A HARD DAY<eos> I'm on my way asswipe!<eos> How did you get out of there?<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Forget it.<eos> If you tell me where the key is I can just hide it for you.
She's expecting you.<eos> Toby, I understand that you spent a number of years<eos> - as a paramedic.<eos> - Yeah, seven years.<eos> Sorry, can I move this over here?<eos> - Please, make yourself comfortable.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> So, you're no stranger to seeing death.<eos> No, unfortunately not.<eos> However, I'm learning that it's very different when you're the one who caused it.
Nora, get these people out of here.<eos> Put that down.<eos> So what did Zach see?<eos> Zach was early voting in the 43rd Ward, and he may have seen a stuffed ballot box<eos> - of Kresteva votes.<eos> - Why does he think it was stuffed?<eos> Because the ballot box had a ripped seal.<eos> He thinks it was a ripped seal or he knows it was a ripped seal?<eos> He took a picture.<eos> - I'm looking at it now.
Sorry.<eos> My sciatica is acting up.<eos> I have to walk every 20 minutes - or my doctor yells at me.<eos> - Would you like me to take a pause?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Keep going.<eos> - I can hear.<eos> - Just one more question,<eos> Mr. Buckley. Um... why was this ballot box unsealed at all?<eos> Well, I tried to lift it, and I accidentally... I-I ripped the seal.
With my eyes open, my mouth shut, and my claws behind my back.<eos> That's my elegant badass.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> I'm impressed with the food and the wine and this house...<eos> And the company.<eos> It's all been... perfect.<eos> I could take you on a tour later.<eos> Mm. I'd like that.<eos> I just had my bedroom redone.<eos> I've been dying to show it off.
What... Low-cost sunglasses.<eos> Red sneakers, rosary beads, red bandana here.<eos> Orlando?<eos> Santana's foot soldier?<eos> Orlando.<eos> Keep it moving.<eos> Got the warrant.<eos> Good. Keep an eye on the entrance, all right?<eos> There's been a lot of interest in this vehicle.<eos> Why don't we just flatbed it back back to the command?
It's not my story.<eos> It's what happened.<eos> The suspect emerged.<eos> He had a weapon.<eos> I fired on him with lethal force.<eos> I don't know what happened to the suspect's weapon.<eos> You're not helping yourself, Detective.<eos> We'll start again in 20 minutes.<eos> So Root wants access to this machine.<eos> She says she wants to set it free, but to do that, she has to find it first.
Staying with a guy named Leon.<eos> Didn't think you even liked the dog.<eos> Like him?<eos> He's the only reason I'm sticking around.<eos> Why are we here?<eos> Because the machine said this is where I'll find the answer.<eos> What was the question?<eos> Where the machine is located.<eos> Can't it just tell you?<eos> I think Finch programmed it not to, to protect it.
No one, Katie.<eos> No one.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> We were contracted to build a structure.<eos> It had to be hidden in plain sight and have power for 50,000 people.<eos> At first, you know, I said, "That's a joke.<eos> What about a nuclear reactor?"<eos> The next day, I was given specs for a nuclear reprocessing facility and the army corps of engineers as a work force.<eos> And then it started to arrive disguised as radioactive material to evade scrutiny.<eos> We were just told to-- to plug it in.
Time for us to face the music.<eos> Turn around, you get a bullet.<eos> You didn't do this yourself?<eos> I couldn't.<eos> I'd locked myself out.<eos> The machine was designed to accept alterations in its programming only as a response to an attack.<eos> I knew that sooner or later someone would try to take it over, but I didn't know who.<eos> So I made sure that when they did they'd do it with my code.<eos> You hid a virus within a virus?<eos> I realized that the people Nathan and I had entrusted the machine to were the wrong people and that the only way to protect it would be to teach it to protect itself.
I'm looking at here, but...<eos> I didn't think you'd turn traitor, Shaw.<eos> That's a strong word to be throwing around given where we're standing.<eos> What do you want?<eos> A word or two with your new friend.<eos> I always knew there was someone behind Ingram. Like a black hole.<eos> Invisible, but powerful.<eos> So tell me, where did you move the machine?<eos> It moved itself.<eos> But who controls it?
You got an update for me yet, Finch?<eos> This is becoming your version of "Are we there yet," Mr. Reese, and no, we are not.<eos> It's been ten days since we got a new number.<eos> I'm working as quickly as I can.<eos> Well, work faster.<eos> I don't wanna find out what happens when that clock hits zero, do you?<eos> Not particularly.<eos> Can you tell me if we're ever gonna get another number, or has that virus destroyed your machine for good?<eos> I believe that the machine is still active, it's just unable to make contact.<eos> If we knew where it was, maybe we could just... unplug it and then plug it back in.
I think Decima knows about it too.<eos> They're trying to crash it, Harold.<eos> Trigger a hard reset.<eos> When that happens, the machine will call a pay phone.<eos> That's what you coded it to do in the first place, didn't you, Harold?<eos> Whoever answers that call will have full administrative access.<eos> Ask any question, get any answer.<eos> The world's secrets laid bare.<eos> Decima doesn't want to destroy your machine.<eos> They want to control it.

I think she may have infiltrated the program back in DC, but she bugged out before I could catch her.<eos> I gotta warn Finch.<eos> Police!<eos> Hands on your head!<eos> Hands up.<eos> Nathan, it's me.<eos> I have some good news that I wanted to share with you.<eos> Try me later.<eos> What is this place?<eos> So if you're like me-- and we both know you are-- you designed the machine so that a catastrophic crash puts it into a remote debugging protocol-- a God mode that gives the admin full access to all of its data.
I've lost people before, so when I care about someone, I plant a tracking device on them.<eos> I can understand why you and Harold get along.<eos> Well, unless you've got some kind of plan to get me the hell out of here--<eos> This is the plan.<eos> - I'm this way.<eos> - I'm driving.<eos> No.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> _<eos> If the machine figured out that Decima was trying to hijack it, it must have created Thornhill as a defense mechanism.
It's that one.<eos> Looks like Decima got there first.<eos> Decima got the memo, but they'll never get the call.<eos> That's the junction box, Harold.<eos> I'll take it over there, please.<eos> Careful what you wish for, Ms. Groves.<eos> This communion that you're seeking, it may not be what you think.<eos> This isn't about me.<eos> It's about saving the machine, not just from Decima, but from what you did to it.<eos> When that phone rings, I'm going to answer it, and together, you and I are going to find the machine and finally set it free.
Nice to meet you, Professor Proton.<eos> Nice to meet you, Prof...<eos> Ow!<eos> Leonard?<eos> What?<eos> I still can't sleep.<eos> She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?<eos> Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.<eos> It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.<eos> And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn't wear out her tiny legs.
Yeah. That was also your dad's move.<eos> Yeah, when things get messy, you just run away.<eos> But, you know, there are other moves.<eos> Go.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Hey, bartender, can you call an ambulance?<eos> I'm about to bleed out.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Look, I know you think we should call it, but I don't want to give up on this, even if we don't know what this is.<eos> I want to un-call it.

♪ But you're running out of gas ♪<eos> ♪ Catch me if you can ♪<eos> ♪ Don't wait too long ♪<eos> ♪ Catch me if you can ♪<eos> ♪ I'm going, I'm going ♪<eos> ♪ I'm gone ♪<eos> ♪ Yeah ♪<eos> That's my bad, T.K. I'm sorry.<eos> Next group.<eos> The ball hits your mitts, you better bring it into your body.
But you never play the tape through to the end.<eos> Well... He could be a real jerk sometimes.<eos> And, um there were other women.<eos> I guess I just need to watch the whole movie instead of just the good parts.<eos> Mm-hmm. Maybe.<eos> And when one door closes, another one opens.<eos> Yeah?<eos> It's Lars.<eos> I've got your, uh, call sheet for Thursday.<eos> I'll leave it on the counter.
I'm gonna write this down.<eos> And remember, you're not alone.<eos> I know.<eos> I have my friends.<eos> No, I'm talking about the big B.F.F.<eos> He was always right there with you, and it's okay to let him take the wheel sometimes.<eos> Darn it. "Ridin' shotgun with the savior."<eos> It's the perfect song for this moment.<eos> Crackers and toast, where is that guitar?<eos> Would you hang out for just a sec till I find it?
So it's space-themed?<eos> I can't say.<eos> Well, it is.<eos> You just basically said it.<eos> - I'll never tell.<eos> - Plus, I didn't think your first table was good.<eos> I graciously disrespect your answer.<eos> Well, wait till you see what we got, okay?<eos> I'm busy then.<eos> Well, you're gonna have to look at it if you're here.
Go get 'em, Gene Bean.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Eh?<eos> Oh, good Lord.<eos> Welcome to my "Menstru-rant."<eos> I thought we decided on "Period Piece."<eos> Hope you brought your appetite, and your hot flashes.<eos> Okay, I think I've seen enough.<eos> As you'll see, beside the plate is a sanitary napkin.<eos> May I place it on your lap in case there's a big spill?
Give us longer breaks for snacks or we'll burn the artifacts!<eos> You're really good at this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - All right, good luck, got to go.<eos> - No, wait.<eos> We need you.<eos> Hmm?<eos> Remember, kids, smiling is the new touching.<eos> Nice.<eos> Also, if you ignore history, you're doomed to repeat it, and if you touch history, you will be suspended for six days.
With 50 of 62 counties reporting, we now project that independent challenger Conrad Grayson will defeat incumbent... Mark Stoddard for the governorship of New York.<eos> Emily, sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> - Where's Jack?<eos> - Still missing, last I heard.<eos> We're all quite worried about him.<eos> Don't play games with me. I know that you two are working together to stop Conrad.<eos> Declan's dead, Ashley, killed by an explosion that was meant for Jack.<eos> If you know where he is, you need to tell me now.<eos> There's a tape of Conrad and Nate conspiring together.<eos> I was going to play it during Conrad's acceptance speech.
Yaah!<eos> [Screaming]<eos> Aah!<eos> [Panting]<eos> Leo, this was a matter between me and my boy.<eos> [Moaning]<eos> A fucking barman?<eos> No.<eos> It's nothing!<eos> I see your face in here again, I'll cut it off.
Oh, I-I know a place.<eos> You built this, boss?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, most of it.<eos> You little doomsday prepper.<eos> Ooh. Very Abe Lincoln.<eos> Or very Gibbs.<eos> Has that road always been here?<eos> There was no road.<eos> Not until I cleared it.
Alfonso, I thank you with all my heart for the money you sent me.<eos> I'm sending you a picture of the house.<eos> Bye, Rosa.<eos> It's like with Bettencourt.<eos> I'll have to put him under supervision. What is this mess?<eos> Even in my grandfather's time, we were better equipped.<eos> We'll go give them a hand.<eos> A letter's arrived.<eos> It's from very far.<eos> Take it.
Of course not.<eos> Do you realize I had to be sent miles away from you to fall in love?<eos> I've always wanted you to get married.<eos> - It's no my fault if...<eos> - I know. - You don't do it on purpose.<eos> - Look at your brother. He didn't have to go that far to...<eos> That's true. It's different with him.<eos> You know she talked your grandpa into giving her a ring?<eos> My mother's ring. It should have stayed in the family.<eos> I gave it to her.
You're a good man, Pete Davenport.<eos> Why did you stop?<eos> Raquel, you are beautiful and stunning.<eos> Once upon a time I'd be gone all the way if I could ...<eos> I'll be a different man.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Yes ...<eos> - What's so important about the uniform?<eos> - It can give me my life back.<eos> - Maybe I should find it first.
I wish I had two moms throwing me a quinceanera.<eos> My parents refuse and we're Latino.<eos> I mean, so are you, but you know what I mean.<eos> Yeah, totally.<eos> I just want this to be like, the party that everybody talks about for the whole rest of high school.<eos> You know what you need...<eos> - Three hundred dollars?<eos> - Shh.<eos> For a dress she's only going to wear once?<eos> We'll cut it short and she can wear it to prom.
You dirty mare!<eos> No, I'm not like you, I'd never do that!<eos> I'll go somewhere else!<eos> You do the crime, I do the suffering.<eos> Where's the justice?<eos> Push it back and the fingers'll close. That's it!<eos> Now, you'll never thread shuttles, piece yarn, but at least you'll be able to do a basic grab.<eos> Let's try it! Yeah!<eos> Grab that pan.<eos> Bring it back to close.
Oh, there is no zipper.<eos> Um, I made this dress, and my mom sewed me in, so...<eos> Um, maybe I can try in the abdominal area here?<eos> - Is that okay?<eos> Do I have your permission?<eos> - Yes. You have my permission.<eos> - Unwind the...<eos> - Oh.<eos> Maybe if, um...<eos> You know, um, 'cause maybe you could just rip it.
- Bye.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So the doctor said he's supposed to wake up by day three, and it's day four.<eos> Is that... that's not weird, right?<eos> He had a craniotomy, Evan.<eos> Hank needs to recover, and we need to be patient.<eos> Right.<eos> Right.<eos> So what's with the scar?<eos> Are you worried about him having it or you having to look at it?
- No, I can move a chair, Evan.<eos> - Henry, let me...<eos> - The doctor said to relax.<eos> - Oh, fine.<eos> You move it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Gosh.<eos> Where were you going with it?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> 'Cause once you move out, I'm gonna put it where I want it and you won't be here to stop me.
Come on, boss.<eos> Lots of women wear lots of necklaces.<eos> This isn't necessarily...<eos> I know, but it would explain so much.<eos> Why else would Danny move the photo?<eos> Why did Karen react the way she did when I showed her the picture of the necklace?<eos> It was Tara's necklace.<eos> And without proof, it's just a theory.<eos> We have to see that photo of Tara.<eos> Unless you've conquered the space-time continuum, there's no way to see it anymore.
- Yeah. Wyoming native.<eos> Don't go much further south than the Bighorns.<eos> Come out to the pasture this time of year to eat the clover that grows in the sheep droppings.<eos> So, the picture could have been taken on Marko's land.<eos> [Walt] You get anything from the biker's video?<eos> [Ferg] Uh, no.<eos> Besides the crash, there's really nothing to see.<eos> It's about two hours long.<eos> I watched it in fast forward. You go too fast, you miss the little things.<eos> Slow it down, watch it again.
He tends to get aggressive around outsiders.<eos> Just stopped by Costa's house. Amaya told us we could find you two up here.<eos> Is Costa around?<eos> We need to speak to both of you.<eos> According to this Costa left a day ago for the north pasture.<eos> That's six miles that way.<eos> [Vic] What are all those markings?<eos> 70 years of my family's work is written on this land.<eos> Any of this land belong to Marko?<eos> When my father died he divided the land between the three of us but we work it together...
equally. We spoke to some people said Marko was planning to sell.<eos> Those people lied.<eos> [Walt] Oh, it's possible he didn't tell you.<eos> Seem to be a few things he's kept from you like the fact that he married that girl from Ecuador.<eos> It's strange that he never mentioned that.<eos> Maybe he was afraid of how you'd react. I told him that was a mistake.<eos> Little basati was foolish when it came to some things.<eos> But there are certain things even he was not foolish enough to do.<eos> He would never sell this land behind our backs.<eos> Too many have tried to steal it in the past.
And, ladies, drop in on a neighbor's open house just to see what they did with their sun room.<eos> Now, go on home.<eos> We're here every Sunday, just like Snoopy in color.<eos> Can you believe this guy, Helen?<eos> Hey...<eos> Helen?<eos> Tim.<eos> Yes, Helen?<eos> My wedding ring is creating a glare.<eos> Can you hold it?
No lecture.<eos> I just have one question.<eos> Do I get my own office?<eos> Harvey, if you want to be managing partner and Darby agreed to back you, then I'll follow you to the ends of the earth.<eos> But before we start, I want to make sure you're ready to do this to Jessica.<eos> I am.<eos> Then let's go beat the shit out of Cameron Dennis.<eos> I know you don't want to see me.<eos> And yet--<eos> I just wanted to let you know that I got a copy of the letter that Jessica blackmailed me with, and I made it clear to her that I would take it to the D.A. if she ever threatened me,
You just don't get it.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> What you're really pissed at is that he chose me over you.<eos> Not you.<eos> What you are.<eos> I put bad guys away.<eos> You try to figure out how to let them do whatever they want.<eos> So don't come in here telling me that I'm taking something out on Harvey's client, because I'll tell you something-- she did this.<eos> You made me a mixed tape.<eos> Watch it, and then make me an offer, which I'll reject because...
I've already divided it into four equal shares.<eos> - Right, Second Brother?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I don't need a share.<eos> Give mine to Mother.<eos> I bought ten packs of cigarettes. A good brand.<eos> There are nine left.<eos> So, that makes three each.<eos> As the oldest brother I have to be impartial.<eos> If you want your share to go to Mother, give it to her yourself.
Sir, there's a problem with your bag.<eos> Please come to have it checked.<eos> Open the bag.<eos> You can't take this on the train.<eos> - It's a fruit knife.<eos> - It's not permitted.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Regulations.<eos> What if I eat an apple?<eos> Eat it with the peel.
Previously on Touch...<eos> A cipher.<eos> An algorithmic tool for sending and interpreting messages.<eos> This amulet, whosoever possesses it shall become the protector of the 36 righteous ones.
It is not possible.<eos> - They were... - (Knocking)<eos> I'm sorry, this is all they were able to retrieve.<eos> Thank you.<eos> (Sobbing) It's hers.<eos> Oh, Clarence!<eos> Sir?<eos> The hatpin is still in place, sir.<eos> So?<eos> The force as she hit the water would have bent the pin, torn the straw weave or pulled it out altogether.
What?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You said I could sleep over.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> It was raining.<eos> You offered me a cup of tea.<eos> I'll make some breakfast.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I want your teddy!<eos> And I want your sword so give it to me.
Suze?<eos> There's a red Golf in the car park.<eos> Keys are in your bag.<eos> In the glove box... you'll find some money to keep you going.<eos> Why?<eos> What's happened?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Let me tell you about the pool again.<eos> Remember... we emptied it every winter?
And at least now I don't have to keep saying<eos> "Quit going through my things or trying on my stuff."<eos> Hey, have you seen my little pink jewelry box?<eos> It had Nana's good ring in it.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Sorry, haven't seen it.<eos> You have to help me get this off.<eos> Why are you wearing Nana's ring?<eos> I was going through her things and trying on her stuff.<eos> Hey, Riley, just let me know if you see it back at your place.
You have endured barbarian invasions, total financial collapse and a lesbian prime minister.<eos> You've managed to survive on a craphole island that looks like the moon and smells like rotten eggs.<eos> And to do that, you have to be stubborn.<eos> But I ask you to put aside your stubbornness while I tell you about Carl Carlson.<eos> Shame on Carl's family!<eos> The blood of 1,000 tiny horses is on their hands.<eos> Doesn't matter what happened 1,000 years ago, for Carl Carlson's honor has been redeemed by the deeds of Carl Carlson.<eos> Carl Carlson who helped me move, even though I moved the week before.<eos> Yeah, and when we were painting my house, Carl Carlson brought that blue tape, you know, that makes you really look like you know what you're doing.<eos> You peel it off, and you got that super straight line there.
I mean, I know it's an antique, but really, Karen...<eos> Vik, I am serious. This does not fit.<eos> At least it has a purpose:<eos> Slot for the remote, cup holder for my beer...<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> And space for two soccer fans.<eos> Right, Danny?<eos> Mother, please, you're blocking the Revs.<eos> If that chair bothers you,<eos> I can move it into the garage.
No need to feel embarrassed.<eos> It isn't just you.<eos> Thomas...<eos> You can't... everyone...<eos> I brought meat from the officers' storehouse.<eos> do you want to end up in jail? !<eos> You really are an idiot!<eos> Idiots are scary...<eos> Let's all split it...<eos> We can slice it and make sandwiches!

Amen to that.<eos> 'Cause I'll tell you one thing, the Russians didn't throw her in a black site for shoplifting.<eos> That's not how this works, Sam.<eos> My mission isn't to grab one person, it's to take down a terrorist network, and right, now she is the only link to that network.<eos> Now if you guys want out, I understand, but I have to see this through one way or another.<eos> No, we're in, but after this is over, Mike, I want a thank-you note from the CIA director.<eos> And a fruit basket.<eos> Ruben's still in business.<eos> He'll be here this afternoon.<eos> Sam, Jesse, switch out this car before the police find it.
Whoo!<eos> So, what do you want to do tonight-- drink ourselves blind, set a car on fire?<eos> Ooh, watch a movie that doesn't start with a desk lamp jumping on top of a capital "I"?<eos> I'm all yours, Teddy Westside.<eos> Actually, tonight it's Teddy Westchester.<eos> Got to head up to the house, take care of some stuff.<eos> Oh, yeah, how's the restoration going?<eos> Actually, done.<eos> You finished the house?<eos> Well, I want to see it.
Come here.<eos> This bed is so freaking small.<eos> I know.<eos> I thought it was just me.<eos> It is you.<eos> You're big.<eos> God, you got so big.<eos> You remember that song you used to sing to me when I was little?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Will you sing it with me?
Jenna, I need to use the bathroom.<eos> Okay.<eos> No, I need to use the bathroom, bathroom.<eos> So then use my parents' bathroom.<eos> No, I need to use the bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.<eos> I gotta make a call.<eos> So why are we in the bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom?<eos> Because you're ruining the BFGFBFF.<eos> I can't speak for Matty, but I can speak for myself.<eos> This thing with you and Jake-- you got to rein it in.
That pain isn't going away till you tell me what's up.<eos> - My parents are gone.<eos> - On vacation?<eos> From me.<eos> My mom's in rehab for exhaustion, and dear old dad fled the country 'cause of the money sitch.<eos> Wait, so you're all alone?<eos> Consuela's here, but she's in the doghouse.<eos> Why, what'd she do?<eos> Nothing.<eos> She's cleaning it.
Because it looks like pac-man.<eos> Now what do we need to watch out for?<eos> Mm. Dislodging the clot.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Jamming the stent, or...<eos> Oh, damn it.<eos> The basilar wall is dissecting.<eos> It's just too weak.<eos> If you don't place the stent, it could rupture, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> If we place it too fast...
In France, a simultaneous police raid is conducted at 2 independent Internet access providers, World-Net and France-Net.<eos> "Pornographic pictures of young children, National TV News bulletin 1996 The francenet case that's what the police found on the two incriminated networks.<eos> Both ISP managers have been indicted.<eos> We got them!<eos> The responsibles would then be those managing the pipes that transport the content.<eos> Just as if the postman was responsible for the mail he carries.<eos> Rafi Haladjian, founder of francenet, was one of the two CEOs arrested that morning.<eos> The issue with pedophilia is that it's an easy topic.<eos> Pedophilia is the only unambiguous topic...<eos> When you see a pedophile picture, you know it is pedophile and you can immediately decide to delete it.
And that's just your purchase habits.<eos> Now imagine what Google or Facebook would know about you.<eos> If you are diagnosed with a horrible disease. The first one to know is not your parents, your close friends, your children, your wife or husband.<eos> It's Google.<eos> We have built the net so that everybody's use of it is monitored, so that the web server has a log which tells who accesses what.<eos> And if that web server is Facebook and 800,000,000 people use it to communicate, then there is one guy who has the right to know what everybody is looking at.<eos> And that guy would be under pressure to sell or give to every government and evildoer on earth the crucial information:<eos> Social networks live on the thin red line of trust while trying to go as far as possible in terms of the use of personal data.<eos> And that's also what Google's CEO, Eric Schmidt, said:<eos> "Our policy is to keep driving along the yellow line and to try not to cross it."
Stay.<eos> Oh man, it's them.<eos> - What the hell happened?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I'm fine, I'm fine.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> What is this?<eos> - What's the box?<eos> - That was at the other house.<eos> I thought I saw Hugh put it down. Then he was running around the corner and...
Whoa, whoa, Mike.<eos> I'll go over there and I'll just kill 'em.<eos> - What?<eos> - Half-kidding.<eos> - Mike, let's just... - I love my fucking life.<eos> Let's be smart first before we do anything stupid, and let's stick with that we do know.<eos> And what's smart? Just sitting here?<eos> Doing nothing?<eos> What we do know is that we took this box. Right?<eos> So, our first act should be to return it.
- Jesus.<eos> - And our clues just left the house.<eos> No.<eos> Wait. The clues are still here.<eos> If they had the pictures, then...<eos> Mike, you took that picture of me and Kevin. Right?<eos> Do you have it here?<eos> I-I can't take this anymore. I can't take it.<eos> - Sweetheart...<eos> - Can you at least go look for it?
And there's a dead Miranda buried there too.<eos> There's no way either one of us is getting out of that little bus until we found out why<eos> Ravenswood has to be the only town in the country without a website.<eos> You know what?<eos> It's probably just a coincidence.<eos> I bet I have relatives here or something like that.<eos> Yeah, 'cause I'm sure that happens all the time.<eos> Seeing your name and your face on a gravestone.<eos> Miranda, I'm not saying it happens all the time, but it happened.<eos> There's an explanation, and we'll find it.
Or store it in a vault for rainy day.<eos> These are all hearts.<eos> My mother was a collector.<eos> And we see this season that it's not an easy skill.<eos> Take its heart.<eos> Regina struggled with it at first.<eos> She can't do it to a poor unicorn.<eos> Oh! And I had such high hopes.<eos> You're not hurting the beast.<eos> You're controlling it.
And when it does,<eos> Regina will truly have lost everything, and then she'll need me.<eos> That's when we'll go to this new land.<eos> Cora knows to reunite with her daughter, she's gotta get to Storybrooke.<eos> When Emma and Mary Margaret find their way into Fairytale Land,<eos> Cora discovers the remnants of the wardrobe that sent Emma to our world to begin with.<eos> And that becomes the key to her plan to find a way back to our world and to Regina.<eos> You're not going anywhere!<eos> The portal's taking us home.<eos> The compass, get it.
No.<eos> It's strength.<eos> Within Emma is magic...<eos> What was that?<eos> And the ability to wield magic, and that's not something just anyone can do.<eos> That... is a great subject for discussion... when we get home!<eos> But there was danger at the other end of the portal in Storybrooke, and Henry looked to Regina for help.<eos> You said you wanted to change, to be better.<eos> This is how.<eos> She was able to absorb that magic and diffuse it.
Fortunately for Cora,<eos> Hook stole the desiccated bean from the giant.<eos> And through that, they were cunning enough to get their way to Storybrooke.<eos> There it is.<eos> Storybrooke.<eos> This, gentlemen, is our mission.<eos> We must investigate the line.<eos> After the curse was broken, not all was perfect in Storybrooke.<eos> All magic comes with a price, and the price for bringing it is anyone who leaves Storybrooke will revert back to their curse memory.<eos> You know, what if we found a turtle and sorta nudged it over first?
I'll be right back.<eos> Will you watch this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He was so desperate that he was willing to steal from somebody who he thought at the time had cancer to get what he wanted.<eos> Stop!<eos> That's mine.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Whatever it is you have...<eos> You deserve your fate.<eos> In truth, Tamara had no need for the potion, but still, she was eager to possess it.
I'm on my way.<eos> - Quick, get in the car.<eos> - Come on!<eos> No, we're not leaving without Nick.<eos> I followed my brother to one of the containers, where I found Nick's cell phone.<eos> My brother's gonna try to get him out of the country.<eos> - What? - Let's go.<eos> We got to get to the airport.<eos> Come on!<eos> I saw them carry the box and load it in a van.
- It's your anger buddy, Nolan.<eos> You called me.<eos> I said I was coming over.<eos> I'm here. Just come on in.<eos> I never lock the door.<eos> I've got a gun.<eos> I got here as quick as I could.<eos> What are you so upset about?<eos> I finally get the house to myself and my damn neighbor decides to fix his damn motorcycle.<eos> He revs it up in his driveway.
Forget it.<eos> Look, I thought maybe we could help each other out,<eos> - but never mind.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> Help each other out?<eos> You know, with Zoe and Denise.<eos> What is wrong with Denise?<eos> All right.<eos> S... so Denise likes rug hooking, so I tried rug hooking.<eos> And she likes reality TV, so I watch it with her.
- I'm allergic.<eos> - Right.<eos> Gives you that... rash.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, if my goal this morning was to gross you out<eos> - and then disfigure you...<eos> - You are doing so good.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I invented this recipe undercover.<eos> I got kind of used to making it.
Jacob Blackstone.<eos> Look, Sam, he's familiar with cases like this.<eos> He's gonna run it.<eos> That gonna be a problem?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Not today.<eos> Good.<eos> So the Anthrax bacteria is getting into the heroin supplies by natural means.<eos> It's happening overseas at the point of production.<eos> Sometimes it's from bone meal used to cut the drugs, sometimes from animal hides used to transport it.
But we're looking at more.<eos> And users who have been exposed don't even know it yet.<eos> We gotta find them.<eos> We gotta get 'em into treatment.<eos> The disease can kill 'em in 48 hours flat.<eos> Shaw, you'll head that up.<eos> Work the streets.<eos> Yeah, we got that, sure.<eos> Second part of this thing... we need to find the source of the dirty drugs<eos> - and lock it down.
Mr. Draper?<eos> Yes, what is it?<eos> Do you need some water?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Bobby, go get your suitcase.<eos> - That's mine.<eos> - What about Gene's?<eos> I'm not going to pack his suitcase.<eos> I already did it.<eos> You just have to get it.

My, you have grown up big!<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - That's Grandma Ida.<eos> We don't have a grandma.<eos> You do now.<eos> And you're gonna get all the candy and toys and good stuff your grandma bought you when you wake up in the morning.<eos> But right now, you go back to sleep.<eos> I'm not tired.<eos> Now, Sally don't remember, but I gave your daddy a watch, gold watch.<eos> And I got a new band for it and I wanna fix it up before he come back.
- No, Emily, everything's not<eos> OK.<eos> It's not OK. You tell him to put down that gun.<eos> - You do not get to tell me what to do anymore, OK, Dad?<eos> You made that call a long time ago.<eos> We are not doing anything wrong.<eos> OK? All I want is Mom's ring.<eos> That's it.<eos> We're not stealing anything.<eos> She said it was mine, so it is, so if you could just give it to me then...
You did all this, right?<eos> But if you really care about Ella, you need to tell me where she is right now or she's gonna end up like Amanda.<eos> You understand?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Ray didn't tell you what he did to Amanda, did he?<eos> You're trying to trick me.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Hey. Look at the photograph.<eos> Look at it.
Please... I was scheduled to be slitting my wrists in front of Cook Me The Money.<eos> I'm way up on the deal.<eos> We sent a postman in with a package to sign for, but there was no response.<eos> So, he's either chilling or he's not there.<eos> I think it's unlikely he's just relaxing.<eos> What about alarms... cameras...<eos> booby traps?<eos> Well, there's no explosives detected by our dogs.<eos> The alarm and camera system is a Manifest C-16. It has a smartphone app alerting the owner remotely to an intrusion.<eos> - Can we disable it?
- What time is it?<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Why were you sleeping in your car?<eos> - Um... to be ready.<eos> We have leads on places he might use.<eos> My house...<eos> My house is near Bordeaux.<eos> There are fig trees in the garden and, um... hirondelle. Long tails... came back each spring, to make their nest.<eos> Swallows.<eos> I stand outside the house and look at it.
- 'Cause it's not what we do. - No...<eos> You just destroy other people's families.<eos> I didn't destroy your family, Kieran.<eos> They were fucking terrified of you.<eos> That's why they were driving to England.<eos> I heard her screaming for me from the car.<eos> How are you gonna make up for that?<eos> Well, kill me then.<eos> Take the gun.<eos> Take it. Kill me.
We can't hide a $40 billion loss in one quarter.<eos> And this gets out, our stock'll be worthless by close of bell Thursday.<eos> None of that is going to happen, because Calvin here is going to help us avoid all that.<eos> Now, thank you for coming.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> You have the updates from the sleep clinic?<eos> Yeah, we got another four digits last night, so the sequence is now 97 numbers long.<eos> How predictive is it?<eos> Uh, 40% one day, 70% the next.<eos> We won't really be able to apply it until it's completed.
They think I killed Victor Asanuma.<eos> Why do they think you're involved?<eos> 'Cause we found his remains in a barrel in a dockside warehouse.<eos> Single tap to the head.<eos> Crime Lab tested the bullet, and it was fired from my gun.<eos> What?<eos> How?<eos> Your brother.<eos> After he got out of prison, we were under the same roof for a couple of nights.<eos> He must have taken my gun and then returned it to my holster.
That's why you hacked the FBI?<eos> Yeah, I pulled a print from the break-in.<eos> I needed an ID, and I... I didn't want to get you involved.<eos> Okay, who's your suspect?<eos> Give me a name.<eos> I'll have 'em picked up in ten minutes.<eos> You can't.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because they still have the microfiche.<eos> You move in now, you'll blow any chance I have of stealing it back.
Because they still have the microfiche.<eos> You move in now, you'll blow any chance I have of stealing it back.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yeah. What happened to you, Mom?<eos> What happened to the woman who used to make fried baloney sandwiches and was on the PTA and who showed me how to paddle an outrigger, and used to teach me magic tricks?<eos> I mean, where'd you go?<eos> You think I want to be doing this?<eos> Honey, I'm trying to start over, but I can't until I know we're safe.<eos> You know without that microfiche we're vulnerable.<eos> I have to get it back.

Yeah, I was gonna call the police but I see they've already arrived.<eos> It's Commander McGarrett, isn't it?<eos> Head of Five-O?<eos> Put it down.<eos> Geez, Doris, you involved your son in this?<eos> It was my choice.<eos> He never listens to his mother.<eos> Oh. Well, I don't know what your game is here, kid, but you got three seconds to produce the microfiche.<eos> Open it.<eos> Unroll it, please.

Maura, I'm fine.<eos> "Fine" is an adverb.<eos> It means "pleasing or very well."<eos> So, you're very well?<eos> Yes.<eos> Ow!<eos> Stop it.<eos> I just want to examine it.<eos> Do not touch my ankle.<eos> You let me look at it or I speed-dial 911.
Are you kidding?<eos> More than okay.<eos> I knew from the moment I met you back at that first campaign party you had it.<eos> I was so nervous. I practically spilled an entire glass of Cabernet on Congressman Doherty.<eos> You know, in fact, I, uh... I gotta be honest with you. I've, uh... (Laughs)<eos> Good dreams.<eos> - You've got a dynamite figure. You know that.<eos> I've been staring at that dress for an hour, trying to see through it.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, behold.<eos> - I'll gain five pounds just looking at it, but hell, you only live once.
Wait, I got stood up by Munch?<eos> - What, is he feeling okay?<eos> - Oh, no, he's good.<eos> His date went a little over last night.<eos> It's noon.<eos> Never mind, come on.<eos> I don't want to miss batting practice.<eos> Remember, you have to always be ready, all right?<eos> - Keep your eye on the ball.<eos> - Hit it to me, dad.
Yeah, I mean, he wasn't lying about that.<eos> He did move around quite a bit.<eos> You mean he wore out his welcome.<eos> - Then, Alabama?<eos> - It gets worse.<eos> He was the suspect in a kidnap/rape/torture of a pair of roommates.<eos> He was charged, but the victims were too traumatized to testify, and his lawyer got him off.<eos> And paperwork completely misspelled his name as<eos> L-o-u-i-s Williams, so it didn't hit before.<eos> This guy--if there's a break, he catches it.
- You got it.<eos> I'm heading inside.<eos> Officer Rogers, I want another officer on that exit over there.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Thanks a lot, uh, Detectives, sir.<eos> Let me know if you need anything ... coffee, anything.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Man!<eos> I got to get over this.<eos> Pretend it's that bag of giblets you pull out of a turkey before you cook it.
Come on. Take a look at the body.<eos> Tell me what you think.<eos> Hey, Frost.<eos> Can you run a DMV search on Mary Bigsby?<eos> Is that Mary?<eos> - Think so.<eos> - Okay. Here we go.<eos> Mary Bigsby drives a blue minivan.<eos> I got the tags right here.<eos> We'll find it.
And we showed all the parents, employees, and coaches her photo.<eos> Kids remembered her handing out helmet pads.<eos> No one knew her name.<eos> Killer took everything that could identify her.<eos> Except her body.<eos> Maybe because he was interrupted.<eos> He pulls the car back, he stops here.<eos> Maybe he was about to dump her body in the trunk and that's when Mary came out to smoke.<eos> - That makes sense.<eos> - But if we can't I.D. her, we're screwed, unless she had a car and we can find it.
You're not responsible for your son's death, Mrs. Miles.<eos> All right, but you did put a knife to Phil Carlson's neck and threaten him, so...<eos> Then what?<eos> He told me he wouldn't blame me if I did kill him.<eos> I wouldn't blame you.<eos> I really wouldn't.<eos> But then, I wouldn't be able to get you any money.<eos> - What money?<eos> - It's... it's in the note.<eos> - Please, just... just read it.

I'll be more careful.<eos> Why would I remember that now?<eos> Information We Can Share So Far: capable of rending Titan flesh.<eos> Used to forge the single-edged swords widely known as anti-Titan weapons. Information We Can Share So Far:<eos> Ultra-Hard Steel (2) Ultra-hard steel can only be manufactured in the blast furnaces of factory cities.<eos> It's done!<eos> Mom!<eos> Mikasa. It's wonderful.<eos> This embroidery pattern has been passed down in our family for generations.<eos> teach it to them.
Are you okay?<eos> - I got to see Kate. - Right now?<eos> Why?<eos> Mai Quang's brothers didn't beat up Kurt Simpson.<eos> They beat up Jeremy Nordhoff.<eos> Daniel, it's impossible.<eos> Jeremy Nordhoff can't even leave his room, let alone drive to Fort Wayne, Indiana, to get beat up by the Quang brothers.<eos> Now, what am I missing here?<eos> Imagine somebody literally took your life away.<eos> What would you be willing to do to get it back?
Matty is not gonna leave you lacking.<eos> As outdated as the tradition was, there was something about being outed by your date that was...<eos> - Is Jenna Hamilton here?<eos> - Sweet.<eos> But in my excitement to be a have, I'd forgotten about the girls who were still have-nots, like Kiki Reynolds and Mia Brady and Kristy Patton.<eos> I knew what it was like to be bare-chested.<eos> Jenna Hamilton, will you be... [Laughs] Matty's girl?<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> I'm not so sold on the safety of this pin.<eos> I can show you how to stick it.

But, to my credit, not as obnoxious as Hillary Matthews'.<eos> [Cow bells jingling] Obnoxious.<eos> That was my word.<eos> But I hadn't shared it with Matty, which meant...<eos> - T, need a napkin?<eos> - I got one.<eos> Will you walk with me to get one?<eos> There's a whole stack right here.<eos> Those aren't substantial.<eos> I need a substantial napkin and your help in carrying it.
Opium smoke fills the air.<eos> Paper lanterns dance across a harvest moon.<eos> And tiny triangles of foil-wrapped chicken.<eos> [Cheers] Becca can suck my big fat--<eos> Woody.<eos> Woody Loveridge would be perfect for Kristy.<eos> [Soft rock music playing] [Squeals] Let me see your pin.<eos> Ah!<eos> Ooh, crafty.<eos> Why aren't you wearing it?

And Silkeborg sounds amazing, and Mongolia sounds amazing.<eos> Their mayor is a professional Wolverine Wrangler.<eos> Fine, Mongolia sounds terrifying, but the world is a very big place, and I've seen very little of it.<eos> Maybe we should travel more, expand our horizons.<eos> You know, I've had the same kinds of thoughts.<eos> We should keep that in mind, see where it leads us.<eos> Oh, there's one more thing I want to try.<eos> I got you something in London:<eos> a traditional barrister's wig.<eos> - Oh. - Wear it for me.
That's how you get the ladies?<eos> No.<eos> Sitting is the new smoking.<eos> That'll kill Hotch, and you know that.<eos> Well, it's the same as last time, except this woman has light-brown hair.<eos> Looks like she threw up.<eos> Maybe it was nerves.<eos> She knew she was going to die.<eos> She had on a wedding ring.<eos> It's right over there. He must have tossed it.
He is such a worthless dirtbag.<eos> Well, at least he's breaking the news to Buzz.<eos> Dad, did you see the rack on Mrs. Barnes?<eos> Yeah. - They're, like, perfect.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sometimes I worry I may never get my hands on anything that good.<eos> I know. I know it seems like that.<eos> Don't look again... not cool.<eos> Just keep the picture in your mind.<eos> Put it in the bank.
Plus, you don't smell like maple syrup from working in the kitchen.<eos> But let's be realistic, Kip.<eos> You can't swim.<eos> No, I'm a good swimmer.<eos> You know who is a better swimmer than you are?<eos> My neighbor's kid.<eos> She's five.<eos> She's got one arm.<eos> She's a better swimmer than you are.<eos> The slim noodle... Throw it to me.
So, that's it. Yeah. What do you think?<eos> I think I love my job.<eos> Hey, T.K. come join the party.<eos> What kind of party is this, exactly?<eos> Sheera was just telling me about the idea you guys had.<eos> Brickhouse Lingerie.<eos> Pause.<eos> ♪ That dude ♪<eos> I thought that we discussed pitching my idea to Connor when the time was appropriate?<eos> And I thought the appropriate time would be when I was actually here to pitch it?
All right, well, before they release him and he runs off again,<eos> I would really like to speak with him.<eos> Yeah, so would I.<eos> Well, would you mind if I talked to him first, alone?<eos> Jeff.<eos> I didn't set some house on fire.<eos> Okay, but it wasn't just some house.<eos> It's where you grew up, right?<eos> So what? !<eos> I wasn't trying to burn it down!
I don't really care.<eos> I'm just doing it so I don't have to see my mom cry again.<eos> I don't like people crying.<eos> Me neither.<eos> My mom totally lost it after karate yesterday.<eos> Just letting you know I'm going to meet Sean.<eos> First date...<eos> Ice skating and hot chocolate at Kafe Leopold.<eos> How did my relationship with Joan become a guessing game?<eos> Ah, so you'd characterize it as a relationship.
What else we got on this guy?<eos> He scored all fives on his evals last year, highest marks.<eos> Same on his physical readiness test.<eos> The Navy may have bigger plans for him.<eos> His contract's up in six months.<eos> He'll be free to go.<eos> Can you find out if he's taken any other tests?<eos> Academic or PST exams?<eos> I will, although it seems like getting into a barroom brawl on shore leave is not very prudent for someone with further military aspirations.<eos> Jack didn't start that fight, but he was willing to finish it.
It seems you've... miscarried.<eos> (Amplified voice) Thank you!<eos> Thank you all so, so much for coming out here to support my album.<eos> I hope you all buy it.<eos> Before I do this next song, I wanna take a moment to talk about somebody really important to me.<eos> That's right. Y'all, give it up for miss Rayna Jaymes.<eos> I never imagined that I would share the stage with my idol, let alone a mentor and friend, and now she is both.<eos> (Cheers and applause) And I know tonight might be about launching my album, but without her inspiration... (Camera shutters clicking) And her influence, I would never be here right now.<eos> I know we all want her to get better real quick, but until she does, I'd like to continue her tradition, so this next song's to Rayna.<eos> I only hope I do it half as well as she does.
Tell Emma I'm alive, and I love her.<eos> How long was he with you?<eos> Long enough for me to know that I miss him, too.<eos> What was that?<eos> What the hell are you two doing? !<eos> Trying to keep it steady!<eos> Hold on!<eos> Prepare for attack!<eos> Be more specific.<eos> If you've got a weapon, then grab it!
You couldn't be more right, Henry.<eos> How... how'd you know my name?<eos> I never told you.<eos> Let's make it a game, a puzzle to solve.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> You are a lost boy.<eos> You work for Pan.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> I am Peter Pan.<eos> But you told Greg and Tamara that magic was bad, that you'd help them destroy it.
- I know. Mitchell, okay.<eos> This is what you do. - Okay.<eos> - It really should be your own idea though. No, come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I need help.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Fine. Okay.<eos> Tonight you cook him his favorite meal.<eos> You open the best bottle of wine.<eos> And just as the two of you are sitting down to enjoy it... - you break up with him.
Good evening, countrymen.<eos> And women.<eos> Welcome to The Founding Father.<eos> Hey, little guy.<eos> You know, that's a real treasure map you've got there.<eos> Okay, well, I guess treasure hunting isn't for everyone.<eos> Treasure, you say?<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> You see, legend has it that Quahog founder Miles "Chatterbox" Musket hid his fortune in fear of it being taken by British soldiers during the Revolutionary War.<eos> He died before he could retrieve it, and left behind only this map.
You're in hypovolemic shock.<eos> We're going to try to repair the bleeds.<eos> This will help with the pain.<eos> Enough, enough.<eos> We don't want to stop his heart.<eos> Okay, Paco?<eos> I need you to hold something for me.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> And put it right here.
On his way here. Well, don't dismiss the possibility that he's leading security forces to your location right now.<eos> Is there even one person on the planet you trust, Saul?<eos> You are aware what happens if you're caught?<eos> - I'm aware. - We will be forced to deny all knowledge of you.<eos> There will be no negotiating your release.<eos> So be it.<eos> For Christ's sake, Carrie, even if you're right about Brody... he'll never make it out of Tehran.<eos> We might if we go now.<eos> We might if you authorize the extraction plan. You know I have to get confirmation of Akbari's death first.<eos> Then confirm it already.
Wow.<eos> Mum makes me learn important numbers.<eos> Hers: 06 07 82 97 95.<eos> The ambulance: 15.<eos> The hospital AE: 01 78 98...<eos> We get the message, Miss Numbers.<eos> Eat that banana now, please.<eos> Stick out your tongue.<eos> It's too long!<eos> We'll need to cut it.
What's going to happen to me?<eos> Uh, do you know where your mother is?<eos> No.<eos> We're gonna take you to the station.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're gonna be safer there.<eos> You should pack your bag.<eos> Made a mistake leaving that car at the scene.<eos> Is that a real police cruiser?<eos> No, guy must have bought an '02 Crown Vic at auction, tricked it up to look like one.
You took my whole life away.<eos> Then just drove on, like it didn't matter at all.<eos> Well, who knows?<eos> He's not hiding anymore.<eos> This is Captain Robles.<eos> Lieutenant Wade. It seems your serial killer crossed over into Mexico.<eos> would like very much to see that bead.<eos> - You have someone in custody, no?<eos> I guess everyone makes mistakes.<eos> I would like for my detectives to collect it please.
Yeah, I want to tell him I'm okay.<eos> Back up!<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I think so.<eos> Tango, tango, tango, respond!<eos> I can't see!<eos> I got blood in my...<eos> Get the girl!<eos> If you want to save the girl, do not fire your weapon.<eos> Take it.
You know, you say escape, George, but to me, this looks more like the scene of a violent abduction.<eos> By Marwood?<eos> - Presumably.<eos> - Why not pop him here?<eos> The way he did Ripley?<eos> Well, we won't know that until we ask him, will we?<eos> In the meantime, somewhere out there there is a police officer in the hands of a known police killer.<eos> Well, either way, Martin, we both want DCI Luther returned to us at the earliest opportunity.<eos> - A search is underway.<eos> - Then widen it.
Come on! - Shut up!<eos> Shut... just let her go!<eos> You being the defender of the innocent.<eos> - Tom, stop!<eos> - Turn it off!<eos> All right, whoever the hell you are, turn off that camera.<eos> Tell her to turn it off!<eos> Look, look, just put it down.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Put it down and turn it off.
- I'm your downstairs neighbor.<eos> - So first of all... welcome to the building.<eos> Lovely to have you.<eos> Second of all, and this is dumb and so stupid.<eos> I feel funny even mentioning it,<eos> - but your TV is just a skosh loud...<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna turn it down.
- I had to hydrate with mouthwash.<eos> - You're a badass!<eos> No, honey. I'm just a man.<eos> There's my photo.<eos> Wow, you look 20 years younger.<eos> - That's me.<eos> - Oh, that's more like it.<eos> Hey, I-I-I mean that's more...<eos> like it!<eos> Okay, just grab it, and let's go.
Sorry I'm late.<eos> I was talking about me, actually.<eos> Get out.<eos> Aren't you gonna say "please"?<eos> She usually says "please."<eos> She's not gonna say it again.<eos> All right, look, I changed my mind.<eos> Alex did me a solid back at the docks.<eos> She put a bullet in a guy before he put a bullet in me.<eos> So I'm guessing the plan is to raid the CIA safe house, if you ever find it.
But after you left me, this team you put together-- they followed you, they looked to you.<eos> Ryan gave his life for you.<eos> I had to claw my way to the top, past Percy, past Oversight, the Group.<eos> A long time ago, I gave you a choice-- brutality or deception.<eos> You should have listened to me and to Michael, to Alex.<eos> I'm going to leave you here...<eos> Where no one will ever see or hear from you again.<eos> But you can take comfort in knowing that you will never be forgotten.<eos> I have doctors who can take this scar away.<eos> But I'm going to leave it as a reminder.
And... done.<eos> So, in conclusion, my show-and-tell is... this!<eos> Excellent, Lisa.<eos> A-plus.<eos> Bart, your turn.<eos> Well, my show-and-tell is that I'm on Lisa's body.<eos> Derivative and repetitive!<eos> F-minus.<eos> Bart, I expected more from a fourth-grade head.<eos> You're rotating it in the wrong direction!
Da-da.<eos> The most beautiful words a father can hear.<eos> - Da-da.<eos> Da-da. - Oh.<eos> Hey, one day you'll have kids of your own.<eos> I do.<eos> Really?<eos> Then this is much creepier than I thought.<eos> Much.<eos> Shouldn't have bet his door if he didn't want to lose it.
What's wrong with that plan?<eos> It's not what I want.<eos> Yeah, well... it's what I want.<eos> It is!<eos> It's what I want!<eos> I don't think it's really what you want, you've got one foot in the relationship and one foot out, which leaves you in total conflict, so<eos> I'm going to ask you for the ring back and we can stay in touch with each other or we can take a break for a few months and see how we feel at the end of the summer.<eos> It belongs to my family.<eos> If I had bought it for you brand new, I'd just give it to you, but<eos> - I want it back.
I'm not worried about it, I think it's fine,<eos> I'm not concerned about you and Ben and it's a free apartment.<eos> It's a safe place for you and you'll have people you know nearby if you need help,<eos> Leo's got family right there.<eos> I don't know, there's got to be another way.<eos> I don't know another way, and you want to be there, so what the heck?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe Leo is just trying to break us up.<eos> I don't think Leo is that kind of guy.<eos> I think he's just offering you an opportunity and you should take it.
Happy to, unless it's hope or a reason to live.<eos> Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown.<eos> Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome-home gift for him.<eos> As he's been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.<eos> Okay, well, I don't know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.<eos> Aquaman?<eos> Oh, this isn't a gag gift, Stuart.<eos> Yeah, just as well.<eos> It's a pretty rare piece.<eos> I'd rather just sell it to a real collector.
They're pretty much worthless, but they make good coffee.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Now the good ones.<eos> Rosa Diaz.<eos> Tough, smart, hard to read, and really scary.<eos> Tell me who has me for secret santa. No!<eos> That takes all the fun out of it.<eos> It's Scully.<eos> He got you a scarf.<eos> - I'll make him return it. - Yes, you will.
What's that?<eos> It's the amount of money you are currently owed by Lexington.<eos> How does Lexington owe me anything?<eos> For work you've already done, in Colombia and here.<eos> In the private sector, no bad deed goes unrewarded.<eos> Shame about Seth Newman.<eos> Were you two close?<eos> Seth was a business associate of mine, part-time and off the books, just like you.<eos> I recently heard the FBI is in possession of a flash drive found on Seth's body.<eos> I want it.

Not me.<eos> Bugs.<eos> [Laughs]<eos> Dirt.<eos> [Laughs]<eos> But the smile on his face when we got out to Hillcrest...<eos> Some of my fondest memories together.<eos> Have you brought my flash drive?<eos> The FBI turned it over to Langley.<eos> Tech Ops is decrypting it now.
I'm good.<eos> This way.<eos> - Wait, how did you...<eos> - I teleported.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> So you've decided to come home.<eos> Did you think he was gonna help you find your promised land?<eos> Is that it?<eos> It doesn't exist.<eos> And even if it did, you're sure as hell never gonna see it.
It's, like, go back to the Val, kook!<eos> Wilfred, you don't even live here-- you're my guest.<eos> Anne has a right to have guests, too.<eos> What the hell are you doing? !<eos> Drawing a line in the sand.<eos> Phil can stay on his side, I'll stay on my side.<eos> Wilfred, stop! Fine.<eos> Then I suppose I'll have to resort to more drastic measures.<eos> Wait-- what are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna get my squeaky ball and leave it on the living room floor where Phil can see it.
This is important.<eos> Yeah. Sorry. (phone vibrates)<eos> WILFRED: Ryan, who is this imposter?<eos> And why aren't you walking...<eos> Ooh, Wilfred, look.<eos> Do you see the squirrel on the grass? Ooh.<eos> I see the squirrel, bitch!<eos> (sighs) Oh, Dad, um, told me about the job offer.<eos> It sounds tailor-made for you. Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna turn it down.
Thanks for coming.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> Of course, Ryan.<eos> I'm sorry we can't stay long.<eos> We've got Wilfred in the car.<eos> I understand.<eos> I feel horrible about this, mate.<eos> You don't have to keep apologizing.<eos> It was a total accident.<eos> I only left my tennis ball there in the hopes that someone would, like, kick it down the stairs and I'd chase it down and bring it back up to them and then repeat that, like,
Now I feel terrible.<eos> He wants $5.000.<eos> That's way over my budget.<eos> - Give me a number.<eos> 3.000?<eos> 3.200?<eos> - Done.<eos> He's competing with me right now.<eos> If I tell you not to buy the car,<eos> Roger's got to get you to buy it just to beat me.
Which way now?<eos> That car is from Black Bear.<eos> Heh!<eos> - Oh!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> We're almost out of fuel.<eos> Shit.<eos> You couldn't have picked a car with a full tank, could you?<eos> Yeah, sorry, I should have filled up with gas and checked the oil before I stole it.
All I'm saying is that when you take a creature into your home and you feed it and you clean up after it, you don't expect him to bark at you every time you walk in the door.
Killjoys, man.<eos> Jackin' it up for the whole world.<eos> I thought everybody was an asshole before this all went down.<eos> Now I love people.<eos> How did it happen?<eos> When they were coming in through the door,<eos> I tripped crawling out the other side.<eos> Pulled the glass out, but my shoulder... it still hurts like a bitch.<eos> It's dislocated.<eos> Can you fix it?
- Taking Highway 100.<eos> - I heard.<eos> You were right, what you said before.<eos> About the trail going cold.<eos> I don't need to go out anymore.<eos> Good.<eos> Take it.<eos> Ed gave this to me on our first anniversary.<eos> Please.<eos> I should have given it away a long time ago.
There are people I need to keep alive.<eos> You two are gonna help me take it.<eos> No one needs to die.<eos> I'm gonna kill you.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> - I'm gonna take my--<eos> - Stop it.<eos> You want the prison?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'll take it as peacefully as I can.
I'm not lying.<eos> I caused your family enough pain.<eos> - Ray. - Please.<eos> We gotta.<eos> All right.<eos> But I take him.<eos> Alone.<eos> You stay here, clean up, look after Bunch.<eos> That's the way it's gonna be, Ter, or it's not gonna be at all.<eos> Get my car, bring it around back.
You should see the way he looks at me with his... with his hungry eyes.<eos> Was he looking at you like this?<eos> Cos this is me thinking that you're a little twat.<eos> Am I?<eos> Well, he gave me a finger of his KitKat. Oh, dear God!<eos> Just snapped it off.<eos> Finn, it's the oldest trick in the book, you douche.<eos> You don't underst...<eos> Come on. Really?<eos> You just... You take the finger of the KitKat, you insert it up your anus, you give it to the unsuspecting victim, that's good times.
All right, stay off the pills, stick to the friggin' heroin, then!<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> Jess!<eos> Shit!<eos> Abby!<eos> Abby! Have you seen Jess?<eos> No.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Have you taken your pill?<eos> No, I was going to have it with a bit of cake later.
I feel a bit weird.<eos> Can you get me a glass of water?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, sure, yeah.<eos> Just wait here a minute.<eos> They've run out of spring rolls, in case you're wondering.<eos> I wasn't wondering, actually.<eos> Fucking hell, don't take your pill neither, dude.<eos> Dude, it reverses your power.<eos> Don't take it.
- Rest in peace.<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Let's get another round here.<eos> No, no. Not me.<eos> I got a drive to make.<eos> Serves you right abandoning this fine city.<eos> I didn't abandon it.<eos> I served my time and moved on.<eos> If you had some kids, you'd understand.<eos> Right, LC, I don't think you necessarily have to live in the city to protect it.
I didn't abandon it.<eos> I served my time and moved on.<eos> If you had some kids, you'd understand.<eos> Right, LC, I don't think you necessarily have to live in the city to protect it.<eos> - You never lived in it, John.<eos> - Hey, you know what?<eos> The way I look at it, my parents got me out, seems like disrespect to move back.<eos> You don't live in it, you don't know it.<eos> - You don't know it--<eos> - You can't protect it.
Good-bye, Horace Vanderlinden.<eos> Good-bye, Charles Ludlow-Strauss.<eos> Good-bye, Carter Covington.<eos> I think I'll miss you most of all. Okay, okay, you know, you can just stop with the martyr routine, because we all know that you copied that list from Southern Living.<eos> You know who's not on the list?<eos> Wade Kinsella. Right. Well, Wade and I are dating each other for very complicated reasons, so...<eos> Abs.<eos> But who knows if Wade and I will work out?<eos> So I will just take this list.<eos> Insurance. I mean, after all, you did go to all that trouble of copying it.
- I already know what you're gonna say.<eos> "Lemon, why are you humiliating yourself for such an archaic organization?"<eos> "Why do you even care what the Belles think?"<eos> "Friends who treat friends like that aren't even friends at all."<eos> Maybe.<eos> Or maybe I was just gonna say it's a shame<eos> I never see you sweep the Rammer Jammer.<eos> Also, you missed a spot.<eos> Before I finish, let's talk about that non-compete clause.<eos> You wrote it, so you must know a way around it.
We don't know what "A" can and cannot do.<eos> The sooner we accept that the better.<eos> Look, I'm not just here for fake homework.<eos> I want the dash cam footage that Mona gave you.<eos> The one from Wilden's car.<eos> No. Hell no.<eos> You don't even know what I want it for.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Emily, my mom is in that video hitting Wilden with a car, all right.<eos> I should have just listened to Mona and burned it the second that she gave it to me.
Let's find out.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hey.<eos> So, uh, the Camaro's ready to be autopsied?<eos> I hope it's not an inconvenience.<eos> You know, it just seemed easier to do it closer to the crime lab.<eos> Are you wearing his fingers?<eos> - Uh...<eos> - That's remarkable.<eos> I-I've heard of this technique, but I never thought I'd get to see it in action.
And why are you suddenly being so nice to me now?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - I only came by to give you these.<eos> - Now you're giving me my car back?<eos> - DCU doesn't need it anymore.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it got burned in an operation?<eos> What?<eos> You don't want it back?
- Yeah, it's gone. - What's gone? The artifact that makes this bronzer work.<eos> It's a bronze Mesopotamian stele from 1250 BC. And, no, we do not have another one.<eos> So then, how do we un-bronze Claudia?<eos> Artie!<eos> Judging from the smell, I'd say it was a chemical reaction triggered by light.<eos> When I opened this panel.<eos> What the hell?<eos> It's a message from Paracelsus.<eos> Sutton's involved. Why does it not surprise me?<eos> So, Paracelsus has the bronzer stele and he's holding it till he gets whatever it is that Sutton has.
Oh, as if you've ever paid a bill.<eos> - Touché!<eos> - So, you have the ring?<eos> No, they have the ring.<eos> They took it from me in Paris.<eos> No, Paracelsus has the ring.<eos> You have the Stone.<eos> Half the Stone.<eos> The Warehouse found the other half and lost it to pirates.<eos> Until I found it.
Find and protect. Never use.<eos> When I was a boy, my father repeated that oath over and over.<eos> We find and protect these items. He told me we never use them.<eos> He gave everything to the hunters.<eos> Everything.<eos> I know what happened to your father.<eos> Did you know what he was hunting on his last mission?<eos> The Grail Cup.<eos> A cup that heals.<eos> The very end when he was wounded and laying on the ground he was holding it in his hands.
So if our brains can have a second act...<eos> Why not our lives?<eos> Broken lives can be healed.<eos> Justice can finally prevail.<eos> Damaged relationships repaired.<eos> Sins can be forgiven.<eos> Wrongs can be righted.<eos> In our lives, as in our brains, we all deserve...<eos> A second chance.<eos> You just have to be brave enough to seize it.
Oh!<eos> Yo!<eos> Guys!<eos> Joe.<eos> You're here.<eos> Is this...<eos> I mean, what are the chances?<eos> What a small world, huh?<eos> You guys using this chair?<eos> I'm gonna take it anyway.
- Hey, hey, hey. - Put the guns on the table!<eos> - Baby, don't do this.<eos> - Back up!<eos> We got to get out of here.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> Darvy, put the gun down.<eos> Please, baby...<eos> Arcadio, please, you have to...<eos> No!<eos> Drop it, Jax!
They were trained brutally, so they became furious animals.<eos> Those who don't oblige, will be idiot hostage.<eos> Is tommorow the regular meeting?<eos> Because the party ordered to end the assignment, I have to go back.<eos> Good, you can finally meet your family.<eos> But I want to ask a favor.<eos> Yes?<eos> Please..<eos> Lend me your gun.<eos> Before I know the reason, I will not lend it.
It'll be the last time I see you.<eos> I think that's better.<eos> I really want to play see-saw with him once more.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You're eating late.<eos> I...<eos> I want to go back home.<eos> I'm going today.<eos> The soup is getting colder.<eos> Quickly finish it then go.
Or will he leave a crater the size of the one that destroyed the Yucatan?<eos> Find out in our next exciting installment:<eos> Fat Splat... or When You Squish Upon a Car.<eos> Mmm, it's amazing.<eos> Every day has the peace and serenity of a flu outbreak.<eos> Guess I'll be getting some extra credit for this.<eos> Lisa, I'm afraid you've gotten all the extra credit we can give out.<eos> So Willie has been growing you a nice pumpkin.<eos> Here it is, lass.<eos> You want me to carve it into a thank-o'-lantern?
I'd believe it, coming from you.<eos> Actually I wanted to talk to you about later on tonight.<eos> I'm thinking about throwing a party at my house with food and drinks and, you know...<eos> People.<eos> The lifeblood of any good party.<eos> Look, don't take this the wrong way, buddy, but these hypothetical "people" might be hypothetically freaked to go to a party at your house, you know, where stuff happened.<eos> Yeah, I know it's a bit of a tough sell.<eos> But that's where you come in.<eos> Everyone here loves you.<eos> And you were the one who told me to embrace the attention, spin it in my favor.
To reach 34°, the body would've had to have been propelled.<eos> Pushed.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Jack was right.<eos> Jason was murdered.<eos> This is great work, Edgar.<eos> Does this make up for the car mirror, Sean?<eos> No.<eos> Washington P.D. closed the case.<eos> We're gonna need more evidence if we want them to open it.
It's good to see you.<eos> Well, I must've really pissed somebody off very high up.<eos> Why is that, Rigby?<eos> Whenever you two turn up where you don't belong, I get a call.<eos> I don't like getting those calls.<eos> You mind telling me what you were doing here?<eos> A friend of mine was killed in that restaurant.<eos> I was on my way to meet him.<eos> That puts me in the middle of this case.<eos> Bombing puts it under Federal Jurisdiction.
We've gotta beat the bloody traffic, - so, we're out of your hair. - Yeah, okay.<eos> - Good to see ya. Good to see ya. - Yeah.<eos> Okay, I don't want to talk about this.<eos> Oh, I know you don't, and that's one of the problems, but I have to talk about how I feel or I'll go crazy.<eos> Just... what do you feel?<eos> What do you wanna say?<eos> Wade, sometimes I wonder what it would be like... if we'd never met.<eos> Marion, sorry.<eos> Your car's blocking me in.<eos> Any chance I could move it?
Good night, buddy.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.<eos> Be safe, all right?<eos> - After party! - ( laughing )<eos> Woman:<eos> St. Louis!<eos> St. Louis!<eos> Why do they have to have the party here?<eos> It's always so crowded.<eos> Yeah, they should've had it at Bootsy Bellows.
- Oh, I'm really good.<eos> Let's go.<eos> All the girls here are stuck up.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Margo...<eos> I love, love your skirt.<eos> - Is it one of yours?<eos> - I wish.<eos> Marc Jacobs loaned it to me.<eos> I never gave it back.
I should have been listening for it.<eos> I know what 911 calls sound like.<eos> I just-- I never remotely prepared for this scenario.<eos> - Look-- - The thing is, I'm afraid to sleep alone at night, so sometimes I go out.<eos> That's all.<eos> That's all it is. That's all.<eos> All right, you apologize, but make it brief.<eos> - Yeah. - A mea culpa isn't really right.<eos> - I agree.<eos> - The full audiotape is 4:07 and we're gonna play it right through and you should point out the specific mistake that was made.
Look...<eos> I am sorry, but we just... can't do this.<eos> This has something to do with Warren Saget, doesn't it?<eos> We just think there's too much risk for us to take on in this venture.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> "Litman vs. Bonner"?<eos> I thought I already ruled on this property line case?<eos> Apparently, there's still a tree on the Litmans' side with a rope swing hanging onto the Bonners' property.<eos> So the Bonners want them to get rid of the swing?<eos> They want to keep it, for themselves, and not allow the Litmans' kids to use it.
And a famous singer to boot.<eos> He was a genius when it came to art.<eos> But when it came to family...<eos> Not so bright.<eos> Maryellen.<eos> So, what do you say?<eos> Are you up for displaying his work at the gallery?<eos> Town council wants to shut down the library.<eos> What?<eos> I've only got 48 hours, so I'm gonna try to pull together a fundraiser tomorrow to raise the money to keep it open.
Michael's a smoke screen.<eos> We could get an indictment on Damon with what we have now.<eos> Michael took off after the murder and innocent people don't run, LT.<eos> This is not the debate club.<eos> We need a confession out of Damon, since he's the only suspect we actually have in custody.<eos> Work him together fast, before he figures out you lied about the wife calling him a lawyer.<eos> Mood's looking up around here.<eos> Heard you might have McCann's killer in there.<eos> We're gonna hand you a real solid case.<eos> Be great to close it today.
I know you're not here for the party.<eos> Which is a good thing 'cause we've already run out of burgers.<eos> Damn, those girls can eat.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Dad, I'm--<eos> Oh, hey, Mr. Agnew.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Visiting.<eos> Um, CC dropped her earring in the toilet.<eos> Then CC can fish it out, huh?
My nephew could hack into the government data base.<eos> He's 11.<eos> Oh, that's comforting, yeah.<eos> Right, well, do your stuff and let's piss him off.<eos> Nice.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> We had two lots of bailiffs turn up.<eos> Non-payment of parking fines.<eos> We've had the bank on too, they've been asked to release statements of all our accounts to the VAT.<eos> I've just paid it!
I give my driver a tip, and then he runs over someone.<eos> Doesn't mean I had anything to do with it.<eos> But if the person he hit was me, sure would look like that.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> All six people did whatever they could to stop your client from getting her pipeline.<eos> If that's all you got, you don't have shit.<eos> She did this, Harvey.<eos> You don't know her.<eos> Yeah, but I know you, and you don't give a damn about murder in some foreign country.<eos> You took this case to stick it to me.
- Yeah, I know.<eos> Donna walked in in the middle, and she took her to the woodshed.<eos> So you're okay with what I did?<eos> I'm more than okay.<eos> Not only did Katrina slink away, but she came back later with her tail between her legs, looking to be my friend.<eos> Well, she is not your friend.<eos> She's definitely not my friend.<eos> She most certainly isn't.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> After I told her that she could take her friendship and shove it up her ass, she said that this whole thing was about you and that I was just trying to protect my girlfriend.
Oh, perfect timing.<eos> Harvey, I was just gonna run something by you.<eos> I don't have time, Louis. I'm working on a murder case.<eos> I just dropped by to inform you Mike's coming with you to see Gianopolous.<eos> Like hell he is.<eos> - Excuse me? - I'm not taking anyone.<eos> - Louis--<eos> - And don't Louis me. This is my case, and you've been sticking your nose in it ever since I got it.<eos> Sticking my nose in?<eos> You only have this case 'cause I was kind enough to give it to you.
A record of the call from Ava's private, secure line.<eos> A call in which we discussed the impediments to the pipeline, the six leaders who stood in its way, and the cost for their removal.<eos> $3 million, which she admitted paying in the admission you had her sign.<eos> I don't need the tape because I have everything I need, including the fact that she lied about that phone call.<eos> What happened to you last night?<eos> I think you know what happened.<eos> I saw you two yelling at each other and I didn't want any part of it.<eos> Well, believe me, I didn't want any part of it either.<eos> Well, what did you think he was gonna do when he found out you screwed up his case?<eos> I think you know that I wasn't trying to screw it up.
Your real deal is a confessed murderer and a vindictive ex-employee.<eos> I've got one saying that Ava paid for it.<eos> And another saying she knew what she was paying for.<eos> Great, then get me a goddamn offer under nine, and I'll get you a deal.<eos> This negotiation is over, Junior.<eos> Take your ball and go home.<eos> You really are a dick.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> - I said you're a dick.<eos> And you can take your offer and shove it up your ass.
This is where I end up.<eos> This face, this version of me.<eos> We saw this planet in the future, remember?<eos> All those graves, one of them mine.<eos> - Change the future.<eos> - I can't. - You've got your Tardis back.<eos> - Ha! You think I'm just going to fly away, abandon everyone?<eos> Of course not.<eos> But you've been protecting this town for over 300 years, do you not think it's anybody else's go yet?<eos> There is no one else to protect it.
We're taking you in for infiltrating a data system, receiving stolen goods, theft, criminal damage and industrial espionage.<eos> You know, we deal with runaways, divorce, detective work in matters of the heart.<eos> That's right, isn't it?<eos> OK, let's go.<eos> My first sex tape.<eos> Is it legal to film the staff?<eos> If they're warned by their employers.<eos> That's the case here.<eos> My USB stick.<eos> I've been looking for it everywhere.
- We've committed them before.<eos> I know.<eos> I was there.<eos> - Just can you give us a second?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you believe this story?<eos> I mean, you can't possibly believe this story.<eos> No.<eos> But what if someone else confirms?<eos> At what point do we have to take it seriously?
- All right.<eos> - Have you commandeered the plane? - Yeah.<eos> - Is the virus on board?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Fuck! We lost comms to Hangar 5.<eos> Do you have CCTV?<eos> OK. Run it back.<eos> There.<eos> Hold the frame.<eos> Enhance it.
! Well, I don't!<eos> My back was in shreds, full of stresses and tensions, and I wonder who caused that(!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Any chance of a discount?<eos> I'm going to miss you guys.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit...!<eos> The air bag went off.<eos> OK, we tour the house, find the music box, grab it and run.
You can't possibly believe this story.<eos> At what point do we have to take it seriously?
Please.<eos> We'll need ropes, lanterns, blankets, a flask of brandy...<eos> Stoughton will help.<eos> Make sure Mr Darcy's horse is saddled and ready.<eos> Gather some men!<eos> Allow me to come too, sir.<eos> You're our guest, and it would assure me to know you're here with the our ladies.<eos> My trunk!<eos> What is it?<eos> Get it out of the carriage.
Gilmer's not a doctor.<eos> No, but he worked as an E.M.T. For two years before he went to jail.<eos> Doctor impersonators have been successful with less training than that.<eos> Yeah, hospital says he does some pretty amazing stuff.<eos> And now he lives the good life... wife, kids, and a home in the hills.<eos> If he's convinced his wife and a hospital that he's a doctor, he could end up convincing a jury that he's innocent.<eos> We're not going to trial on this.<eos> A man can change his face, he can change his name, but changing your nature is very hard.<eos> And changing your fingerprints is next to impossible.<eos> Don't waste our time and say that Rodney brought the gun or that there was a fight and you took it from him.
20 minutes till the arraignment.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I was trying to reach the Professor's girlfriend.<eos> Any luck?<eos> Well, she's registered at the hotel, but she hasn't checked in yet.<eos> Oh, and Teri is tracking down her modeling agency.<eos> Good.<eos> We're gonna be late.<eos> Uh, you know, I was thinking, if the teacher from "Breaking Bad" can cook up meth, then it'd be a snap for a college professor.<eos> Yeah, well, it's one thing to cook it up.

Oh, mate!<eos> Ready to order.<eos> This is going to be quick and it's not going to be repeated, so listen up.<eos> I'll have a bowl of won ton soup, the Singapore vermicelli noodles, half a Peking duck with pancakes har gow, char siu and the wasabi chicken dim sum.<eos> OK. And for you?<eos> She'll have soup, chicken stir-fry and grilled pork dumplings.<eos> OK. And to drink?<eos> Two Tsingtao.<eos> Now you know the drill so listen up.<eos> We don't want the food getting cold so as and when, bring it.
Uh, no. I'm gonna use the ladder.<eos> No no no no! Don't. That's actually more dangerous, okay?<eos> The rope, it can get caught in the rungs.<eos> You gotta jump.<eos> Uh, that is not gonna happen.<eos> You can't stay up there forever.<eos> Yeah, I can see that. Thanks.<eos> Okay, I'm... I'm gonna pull you down, all right?<eos> Wait. What do you mean by that?<eos> Take the rope and position it behind your head.
I mean, this job of his... it's to be expected, it's not exactly a 9-to-5 kind of life.<eos> I'm aware of that, mom.<eos> It's nothing against Seth.<eos> No!<eos> Just me dating Seth.<eos> Look, I know that you think that I might have rushed into this relationship, and maybe I did, but I can't...<eos> Can't what, sweetie?<eos> I can't help but think that maybe it's time that I stop thinking about what I should do, and start thinking about what it is that I want to do.<eos> I'm all for that, Justine.<eos> Whatever you want to do with your life, whoever you want to spend it with, I just want you to be happy.
Just the custard, mind, without the ice.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> Julia,<eos> I believe we may be looking at a descendent of the plesiosaur.<eos> - I believe you might be right.<eos> - It certainly looks like the creature that I saw, And at this point, it may be our most likely conclusion.<eos> William, this is so exciting.<eos> Shall I call the university?<eos> Before we make our findings public, I should very much like to see the creature again.<eos> I should very much like to see it as well.
- Okay, I get it.<eos> Do you hear that?<eos> I hear it-- oh, God, it's coming!<eos> It's coming to eat its cheese. You guys, help!<eos> Odd that it hasn't been repelled by your supersonic rat scarer, Dee.<eos> Guys!<eos> It's on me! It's on my hand!<eos> Oh, it's climbing up my hand to eat the cheese.<eos> Now, where this gets interesting is when the rat finishes the cheese.<eos> Ooh, yes, maybe it'll nibble her hand down to a tiny, bloody stump, - then she could just slide it right out. - Hey.
And how are you planning on getting one of those?<eos> I'm sure you can make arrangements.<eos> You'll have it by tomorrow.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> You said you had some news about my girlfriend.<eos> You recognize that car right there?<eos> That's Tricia's car!<eos> I bought her that car for her birthday last year!<eos> She loved that car.<eos> She never would have sold it.
Couldn't stop.<eos> You find anything?<eos> Kind of.<eos> I went to the house where Mike was held.<eos> Well, see for yourself.<eos> What am I looking at?<eos> The house is gone.<eos> - Gone?<eos> - What?<eos> They must have demolished it the minute they dumped Mike on the docks.
There's a Norwegian named oma at fatty's saloon on Mulberry.<eos> You'll recognize him.<eos> Say we need one large piece of pie and go grab me two steaks.<eos> You, go grab the rest of our boys and bring 'em to me, now.<eos> Go!<eos> All right, you just rest now.<eos> It was bad.<eos> Your face tells me that.<eos> I don't know why, Sara, but there are days when a shadow descends upon a place, a dark, bloody pall, same as on the battlefield, same as at the precinct today and, oh, yes,<eos> one can fight it with all his might, but it's almost as if the shadow needs to beat its own self down, eat its own self 'fore it fades away and...
I'm fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Guys?<eos> - Guys?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Where's the beacon?<eos> - What?<eos> Where's the beacon?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Do you see it?
- You see any keys?<eos> - No.<eos> There's some locked doors in there.<eos> - No.<eos> - Check out the other building, too. No?<eos> - No, we didn't find any keys. - Okay.<eos> - Got another flashlight.<eos> - What are you guys looking for still?<eos> (Johnny) A radio.<eos> We need to find it.
- What else is in there?<eos> - Let's just leave.<eos> Nothing.<eos> - What's in there?<eos> - Let's leave.<eos> - What else did you see?<eos> (Sabina) We have to try again.<eos> That's our only chance.<eos> If we don't find a gun, we have zero chances.<eos> Even if it's out there, how we gonna go find it in the woods now, huh?
- Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Miljan, thank you.<eos> You're a rock star.<eos> Good job, Miljan.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Sam...<eos> I'm trusting you with this key.<eos> Why don't you hold on to it?
Daniel!<eos> I wasn't even nervous till I stepped into the woods, away from safety, away from camp.<eos> And as I got further in, then... started to regret it.<eos> You know, for two people, this is gonna feed us for a long time.<eos> I thought we were gonna take it back to camp.<eos> We are gonna take it back to camp, but I'm just saying... no one else is really doing anything for this, and, uh, I feel like, uh, since, you know, me and you are doing the work,<eos> it could be ours.<eos> I think we should take it back, because we can't finish that whole thing by ourself anyway.<eos> Yeah, we can.<eos> We can salt and cure the meat, and we can keep it for a long time.
Yep. Pretty sneaky.<eos> What's this?<eos> The tape.<eos> I found a camera in the woods.<eos> I just took the tape.<eos> Why?<eos> They told me that the camera that was filming me and Johnny got lost in the woods.<eos> Do you know what's on it?<eos> - Where the hell is it?<eos> - I told you I will find it.

Look, I have a big bout coming up in three weeks -- a title shot -- and I need this.<eos> But I'm terrified.<eos> Do you think you can help me out?<eos> You've certainly come to the right place 'cause I do loves me a fight.<eos> I like you.<eos> You want me to wear a wire?<eos> It's 2013, Bruce.<eos> Nobody wears a wire anymore.<eos> This is an NSA-approved recording device.<eos> You let him tie his own noose and slip it around his neck.
I mean, they're freaks, the lot of them.<eos> Total...<eos> Do I have some sort of sign on my head saying "sucker" or something?<eos> No, honestly. Do I?<eos> No, you don't!<eos> No.<eos> The best one, the guy brought his pet spider in a jar with him.<eos> No!<eos> Yeah, I am serious!<eos> He said it was poorly and he couldn't leave it at home on its own.

And I asked around till I found Briana Mathis.<eos> Stand up.<eos> I took Briana out to the car, and we headed west on Mulholland Drive.<eos> As we neared Beverly Crest, I opened the door and forced her out.<eos> And this woman died?<eos> Yes.<eos> And what circumstances led you to commit this heinous act?<eos> Mr. Goss, you asked for a secure courtroom, and you have it.<eos> And now you must answer my question.<eos> I'll repeat it.
I hope you know when other people die, it won't be on me...<eos> And that Briana girl and who she turned out to be...<eos> Hey.<eos> Shut up.<eos> If there is another deal to be made, you better hurry.<eos> Oh, I'll keep that in mind, Mr. Page.<eos> And now the car's off the table?<eos> We only know about the Mercedes-S through the defendant's statement of facts, which was excluded when the judge rejected the deal.<eos> But that car is the best lead we have.<eos> And now we have to find out about it another way.
Any sign of Mr. Stark or our Mercedes yet, lieutenant?<eos> I can hear music coming from the inside, but can't tell if he's home.<eos> I could go knock on the door.<eos> If he is there, I could see if this Cory guy looks funny.<eos> No, the ground we're on is too shaky.<eos> Captain, if Cory was driving the car when Briana Mathis was pushed out of it, he gives you everything you need to make a deal.<eos> And not for manslaughter, but murder, which is what the judge would like... me, too.<eos> Can you truthfully say that we would have followed up on Cory Stark if we did not know about the Mercedes through Mr. Goss' statement of facts or through the classified information revealed to us by the FBI?<eos> We can work that out later!<eos> If we knock on Stark's door without probable cause and the Mercedes is not in the garage, we may never find it.
- Hugs are free. - Yeah, so are not hugs.<eos> This is my ex-husband Charlie.<eos> Charlie, this is Canvas.<eos> - Canvas.<eos> - I'm open to interpretation.<eos> Yeah, I get it.<eos> I know what a canvas is.<eos> Such a playful spirit he has.<eos> Ooh, I made some Superfood goji berry lemonade.<eos> - I'll go get it. - Okay.
Roger!<eos> Drive.<eos> Shit.<eos> You, Saito? !<eos> We're all pros here.<eos> No holding a grudge.<eos> It you're a pro, join the side that pays best.<eos> Home Attairs paid us.<eos> I'll give you a triple share.<eos> Take it trom my account!
Heard you got arrested.<eos> Bitches.<eos> Come on, they're just worried about you.<eos> And so am I. This isn't you.<eos> No, this is me.<eos> They should mind their own business, and frankly, so should you.<eos> So go back to slumming it with your rebound skank.<eos> Get your facts straight, Jenna.<eos> I was slumming it with you.<eos> ♪ Within your bowl of wisdom ♪ My life as I knew it was over.
What do you think it means, Nancy Drew?<eos> Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I just feel like there's something he's not telling me.<eos> It takes time for some people to open up.<eos> Just go slow with this guy and don't get too involved until you know who he really is.<eos> I just want to jump into one of his pictures and find out everything about him.<eos> And you say I'm weird?<eos> Seriously, Maryellen, just trust your instincts, but go slow.<eos> [Text alert chimes]<eos> [Grace chuckles]<eos> Might be faster if you just wrote a letter and mailed it.
Prove that Crowley's really gone, and then maybe this scheme of yours will work.<eos> Or not.<eos> Honestly, I always thought you Knights were overrated.<eos> You go to hell, and you tell them I'm coming.<eos> Yeah, Irv.<eos> Fallen Angels.<eos> Huh. That's a wrinkle.<eos> Well, trust me, they're just monsters with good P.R.<eos> So, if you run into one, torch his ass with holy oil.<eos> Oh, and if they drop, uh, like, a silver sword, grab it.
That's why I'm going back.<eos> Sir, you have to cancel.<eos> It isn't safe.<eos> I told you before, Sean, that I've heard all the conspiracy theories.<eos> It was a theory. Not anymore.<eos> King, I'm drafting a search warrant for your office.<eos> If I don't get that evidence box back, I'm gonna turn your life upside-down.<eos> If that's all true, then I'm even more determined to make that speech.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> If I start my campaign scared, that's how I'll finish it.
Trespassing, Cal.<eos> I've been promoted to Foreman.<eos> New job comes with the new house.<eos> You can call Louis Frier if you don't believe me.<eos> Louis Frier's no longer employed by Beltro.<eos> He got picked up by the Feds on a human-trafficking charge.<eos> Someone called in a tip.<eos> What's all that about?<eos> Consider it a welcome-home present.<eos> This was your home, right, till your family sold it?
Calder.<eos> We got something.<eos> Now, would you like to amend your answer, or do I gotta blast it open.<eos> It'd make a mess.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I recognize this flash drive from the water damage.<eos> What should I bet that it's the same one that's involved in the FBI investigation into Seth Newman's death?<eos> I'm not a betting man.<eos> But you are.<eos> You bet that you could steal evidence from the CIA, hide it in your personal safe, and suffer no consequences.
We can't even put pressure on them, because she's a Chinese diplomat.<eos> He wants them to disappear.<eos> If they're lucky, he'll actually let them escape to the Caymans.<eos> If they're not, we won't have this chance again.<eos> You want to try and turn her?<eos> Wendy is smart enough to be afraid of Henry, and fear is a wedge.<eos> And if you can't convince her, and she goes back to Henry and tells him about her new blonde neighbor from the CIA?<eos> We can't keep playing defense anymore.<eos> We have an opportunity.<eos> Either we take it or we lose it.
You have three minutes to let me try.<eos> Henry doesn't bargain.<eos> What we have is valuable to him.<eos> If what you have implicates him in the Solstar bombing, you are safer with me, but you have to decide now.<eos> Your lives will never be the same, whichever way you choose, but at least if you let me help, you can still be together.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Do you have it on you, the proof against Henry?<eos> We mailed it ahead to Miami, in case he was lying about letting us go.<eos> He was.<eos> I can get you to a safe house, and we'll have someone else pick it up, but right now, we have to get off the platform.
Some luck, if you please.<eos> Just a taste.<eos> Thank you my dear.<eos> I know you're in here.<eos> How?<eos> 'Cause your tie is so loud.<eos> And I know your brand by smell.<eos> You gonna share?<eos> I know it's a gift from the boss and all, but, really, that tie is an eyesore.<eos> Yeah, but I score points when I wear it.
Why not take it to Joe?<eos> He'd handle this off the books.<eos> And get him in deeper?<eos> He was dodging bullets last night.<eos> He's done enough.<eos> Too much.<eos> Good for you.<eos> I can't get in deeper, either... with Joe.<eos> Closed that door a long time ago.<eos> Thought of opening it again.
Intelligence?<eos> You can't fight crime with half the police on the mob's payroll.<eos> We have to get rid of that half...<eos> Keep the good guys, dump the bad, police the police.<eos> It's a new idea...<eos> never been done, not on the scale I'm thinking.<eos> That won't be very popular.<eos> Doing the right thing never is.<eos> And you want me to work for this new unit?<eos> I want you to run it.
I bet, because you were drinking, you probably somehow offended her and now she's trying to turn that shit against you. - Shit. - Isolate us out in the goddamn neighborhood and pull this.<eos> - I knew it. Fuck them?<eos> - Fuck them.<eos> - Look at all the wonderful things happening for us.<eos> We got a goddamn army of workers here.<eos> We're happier than we've ever been, right? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - You see this one right here?<eos> You see that little broach on TT's neck there?<eos> That used to belong to your great-grandmother.<eos> I used it as an incentive yesterday for the workers to see who could do the best work and he won.
It's against the law.<eos> But I only have a learner's permit.<eos> The best way to learn is to practice.<eos> We're here for you. Hear, hear.<eos> Hey, sorry we're late.<eos> We made a kale-dandelion salad. And I made the dressing from milk I got from my goat. Sounds great.<eos> I hope there's enough for just the two of ya.<eos> I'm sorry. Canvas, this is Ed.<eos> Where's this goat?<eos> If we're gonna eat it, I'd better get to the killin' and skinning'.
Yeah, you do. [Chuckles]<eos> So sounds like you're moving into a new place.<eos> Yeah, importer/exporters keep really weird hours.<eos> Sometimes they stay out until the middle of the night driving around in their fancy cars.<eos> Sometimes they even pick up sexy blind guys.<eos> I can keep playing this game of charades as long as we need to.<eos> [Mellow music playing]<eos> [Laughs]<eos> ♪<eos> [Whispering] The night I wore this dress to the opera, I was hoping I'd have another fancy occasion to put it on.
Thank you.<eos> Oh!<eos> Finally! You're home.<eos> Okay. Two quarts of fudge ripple.<eos> Honey, did you watch "Marley me" again?<eos> - No, I am freaking out! - Okay. Oh.<eos> Owen gave me this amendment to our sperm-donor agreement.<eos> He said I should show it to a lawyer.<eos> Owen doesn't want you to disclose his identity to your child until he or she turns 16.<eos> Yeah, and I'm okay with Owen not wanting any involvement, but if my child wants to know their father's identity, I want to be able to share it.
You know, I reviewed your trust expenditures, and recently, you spent $56,000 on a first-class family vacation to the Bahamas.<eos> Now, that sounds like "pissing" to me.<eos> I'm the trustee.<eos> I control the expenses... end of story.<eos> Bill, mom and dad wouldn't have given you all the control<eos> - if they could see me today.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Do you see, Jane?<eos> Every bit of my life is controlled by this trust, even this antique watch from our mother.<eos> It's worth $20,000, which could help pay for the work at shelter house, but I can't sell it because, under the trust, I am bound to pass it down to my firstborn daughter on her 18th birthday.
Right. That's right.<eos> In advocating for Violet, my former client, I believe that the malpractice case against me will be dismissed.<eos> - Do you know what this is about?<eos> - No, Your Honor.<eos> At this point, my client has gone rogue.<eos> And are you feeling okay, Ms. Bingum?<eos> Oh, never better.<eos> Violet, please tell the judge about your watch.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, my mother left this to me in the trust with instructions to pass it on to my firstborn daughter on her 18th birthday, and then to her daughter on her 18th birthday, and so on down the line.
Ah, sorry, I don't have the time.<eos> I'm getting married in three hours, so, uh, I got to make this quick.<eos> Hey, we got that surveillance footage of the robbery from your house.<eos> I've already seen it, genius.<eos> I gave the Star Island cops a DVD.<eos> Oh, well, then you must have seen what I saw...<eos> The thief wearing Austin's spikeless shoes, right?<eos> That's how you knew that Britta let him rob your house and steal her gun, which doesn't take a genius to figure out why.<eos> They were gonna shoot you, then run off together with your millions.<eos> So instead, you killed Austin first with Britta's gun, wiped it clean, threw it in the trap to frame your viperous wife.
You went to church with her Nana.<eos> Church?<eos> Nana? Hoo!<eos> I have fallen and I can't get up.<eos> Phil? I'm gonna need a minute.<eos> I think I know what's wrong.<eos> No, no, nothing's wrong.<eos> Please forgive me, Phil.<eos> I nearly corrupted you and took away your virginity.<eos> Take it!
But where are we going, though?<eos> Just...<eos> We're going to Ronnie's party, man.<eos> Fuck, yeah.<eos> You know what, lads?<eos> I've had a lovely night.<eos> But I think it's bedtime for me, so if you could just drop me at the train station, that'd be... that'd be super.<eos> No, you're coming for a drink, bitch.<eos> Lopez, Lopez, are you sat on my seat belt?<eos> - I can't seem to find it.
I would like a room, your largest suite.<eos> The suite's taken.<eos> - By whom?<eos> - Her.<eos> Miss Ellison.<eos> Miss Louise Ellison of the New York Tribune.<eos> Thomas C. Durant of Credit Mobilier.<eos> I know who you are, Mr. Durant.<eos> Oh, perhaps, um, I could compose a statement for you.<eos> I'd be happy to read it.
Our personal enmity aside, Bohannon, my offer of the reward is sincere.<eos> If the child is found, I will make good on the gold.<eos> Mr. Bohannon, come quick.<eos> It's, um... it's about the baby.<eos> This here's railroad property, Durant.<eos> You come back, I'll have you arrested for trespassing.<eos> Don't be surprised if someday soon, I return the favor.<eos> He... he knows. He as much as said so.<eos> Sean, if he knew, you would have a hole in your head right there.<eos> Find your manhood and embrace it.
Durant give you any?<eos> We're on our own.<eos> Look here.<eos> According to surveyors, this here might be a spring.<eos> That's 10 miles out.<eos> And it look like just a drop of ink.<eos> It's gotta be a spring.<eos> Hoping it's a spring don't make it a spring.<eos> And how a spring 10 miles out gonna give us water here?<eos> We'll pump it up with a windmill we'll build in pieces and then wagon train it out.
It's too hot for all that jawing, negro.<eos> Won't hear me complaining, though.<eos> Yeah, I was built for it.<eos> Thrive in it.<eos> Live for it, hear?<eos> Reckon I done felt every kind of heat there is.<eos> Dry heat, wet heat, windy heat, calm heat.<eos> Hell, I done even felt cold heat.<eos> What the hell is cold heat?<eos> Know it when you feel it.
Just disappeared into thin air.<eos> - Got any rooms?<eos> - Oh, I can give you his.<eos> I have no idea what happened to Metcalf.<eos> And that's the truth.<eos> We burned him with the cholera victims.<eos> I don't know that.<eos> Well, I'm telling you.<eos> Don't.<eos> I can't tell the truth if I don't know it.
I don't trust you farther than I can spit.<eos> If you do not believe that we can change, how can you yourself believe that you have changed?<eos> If I'm not Bishop Dutson, how can you be Brother Bohannon?<eos> New son to this family.<eos> Who did not take that knife and put it into my heart the moment I handed it to you.<eos> I made a promise.<eos> The old Bohannon wouldn't have cared.<eos> He would avenge the murder of Mrs. Lily Bell.<eos> Meat's cooling.<eos> Serve it.
I disagree.<eos> You're either gonna piss off big business or the Cheyenne.<eos> You can't afford to lose either group one week away from the election.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> I'm gonna need Ethan's list of job applicants. Especially ones that didn't make the cut.<eos> So you've dismissed the energy company already and wanna look for a killer among my hard-working employees?<eos> Why not look under the ground, man?<eos> That's where the stench is comin' from.<eos> You say you wanna help the Cheyenne.<eos> You get me that list or you give it to Mathias. I don't care.
They seem pretty upset.<eos> Why don't you go down there and ask 'em to leave?<eos> Introduce yourself. You haven't been around much.<eos> Don't you wanna know about the paint?<eos> Found the shade of red painted on Ethan Lone Elk.<eos> Tuscan red.<eos> None of the chain stores could recall any buyers.<eos> I did get about 20 names by hittin' the mom-and-pop stores in the county.<eos> Mancell's name on that list?<eos> Why don't you read it and find out?
Don't remember killing them?<eos> You know, despite his terrible jokes, Gene Lustig was one of the smartest men I ever met.<eos> And he said something to me once, and it helped me a lot.<eos> He said that people like us, sometimes we need a vacation.<eos> You know, from all the stuff in our heads.<eos> You more than anyone, because you were always the best of us.<eos> You admit it.<eos> So you want to know what the secret is?<eos> Adrenaline.<eos> We crave it.
When I saw that video... It hurt.<eos> And not just because you lied, again. But because...<eos> I have these feelings for you.<eos> - Jo, look, we don't have to...<eos> - I have to.<eos> I have to say it to you, Danny, to your face.<eos> I can't move on unless I know, unless I'm sure that you could never feel the same way.<eos> Jo, you are the most incredible person that I have ever met.<eos> - Please don't patronize me.<eos> Our friendship means so much to me and I don't wanna risk that, turning it into something else.
That bastard wants to dagger us again.<eos> He deserves everything he's gonna get.<eos> Relax.<eos> If he knew, he would've ripped out your spine through your nose by now.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Now I feel totally at ease.<eos> - What am I supposed to do?<eos> - You tell him you searched high and low but you couldn't find the dagger.<eos> Oh, God, I'm so dead.<eos> Then you tell him you saw I had it on me, that if he wants it, he'll have to come and get it, which won't be easy because I'm paranoid and I beefed up my posse.
I cannot be killed.<eos> Eternity is an awfully long time.<eos> How long do you think Marcel will stay in power?<eos> What if one of you lot were to release me, knowing I would be eternally in your debt?<eos> Oh, I would pity those of you who dared to cross me.<eos> I can assure you, your ends would be spectacular.<eos> To borrow a trick from an old friend...<eos> Whoever picks up this coin gets to live.<eos> Now, which of you magnificent bastards wants to join me?<eos> Anyone wants that coin, pledge allegiance to Klaus, take it now.
Whoa, those orphan Annie vampires are my family, and this city is my home.<eos> It was my home, too, once.<eos> I left. You ran.<eos> I stayed.<eos> This empire, it thrives because of me, and you want me to run.<eos> A man does not run from his home.<eos> I have lived a lot longer than you, marcellus.<eos> I have seen kings rise and fall.<eos> If there is one thing I know to be true, it is that no matter how big your empire becomes, it is nothing if you have no one to share it with.<eos> You want New Orleans, have it.
Walt!<eos> I found some information on elk velvetine.<eos> Check in with the other hunting outfitters in town, see if Chen booked any trips with them or if he's got any updated contact information.<eos> Also, question as many of the guides as you can.<eos> If Chen hired any of them to poach for him, that might be our killer.<eos> All right, Ruby. Shoot.<eos> Well, according to these articles, the nearest place you can buy velvetine is China.<eos> Now, you can get a little bit online from those shady Canadian pharmacies.<eos> But look -- a tiny little bottle is more expensive than my car payments.<eos> So, if Mr. Chen found a way to produce it in the U.S., he could make a lot of money.
You listen to her.<eos> Stop.<eos> Lee, what is going on here?<eos> Please tell me. He was trying to save you. What?<eos> I was just trying to get your medicine for you.<eos> The velvetine.<eos> Keith Dixon came by my shop with a sample of the velvetine, and it worked.<eos> I could see the change in you right away.<eos> But when we ran out, I... I couldn't afford it. I looked everywhere, tried everything.<eos> And you couldn't stand by, let that disease win -- you had to fight it.
Thank you.<eos> Actually I did do a small dramatic role in a Lifetime movie where I played the father of a bulemic teenager named Kaley.<eos> Here is my big scene.<eos> Kaley, listen to me.<eos> You don't have to barf to be beautiful<eos> Daddy loves you just the way you are, honey.<eos> Come here, baby.<eos> Come to Daddy.<eos> And scene.<eos> I have my reel on my phone if you'd like to watch it.
Agent Van Pelt.<eos> Grace, I need your help.<eos> It is imperative that our young lovers go ahead with the wedding as planned.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> You ruined a girl's wedding.<eos> Yes, and I lack the putty to spackle those emotional wounds.<eos> That's why I'm calling you.<eos> I have putty?<eos> No, you have life experience.<eos> Use it to convince the bride that her "happily ever after" begins tonight.
It's just... it's private.<eos> Girls.<eos> Okay, what's...<eos> What's this about?<eos> Someone has a video of you and Danny hooking up.<eos> Hold on, what?<eos> This mathlete, Doug, filmed you and Danny after that party at Danny's house through a window, like, being intimate...<eos> physically.<eos> - Yeah, okay, I get it.<eos> - Well, anyways, I told Doug to delete it, and he said he would, but clearly he didn't because a guy on the debate team just said Doug showed it to him a few hours ago.
She told me she loves him, like, a lot.<eos> Okay.<eos> But not anymore, right?<eos> - After Danny lied to us about...<eos> - No, she says she doesn't.<eos> I know Jo really well and I know she's lying.<eos> She's still in love with him.<eos> Lacey, if she found out about you and Danny...<eos> - If she sees that video...<eos> - She's not gonna see it.
How do you "just happen" to put on a mask and film two people hooking up?<eos> That's a really smart question. ( Clicking )<eos> - Doug, you said you'd get rid of it.<eos> - I know, but...<eos> Suddenly I had this thing that people wanted and it made me feel so, you know, awesome.<eos> Look, the Chess Club guys wanna hang out with me!<eos> They are, like, really choosy, socially.<eos> All right, Doug, let me explain exactly what's gonna happen here.<eos> You're gonna delete that video from your phone.<eos> And then you're gonna make a list of everyone that you sent it to and you're gonna delete it from their phones, and their desktops, and their laptops.
I'm going back in.<eos> Hey, I need two guys over here!<eos> It's to the left.<eos> Alex says it's this way.<eos> Yeah, he's right, but they're working on the gas all the way back to the main line.<eos> This is actually faster.<eos> We can't get to 'em.<eos> Room's flooded with sulfide gas.<eos> Okay, we've dug up more information on Marty.<eos> Turns out he's got a demolitions license, and two months ago, he signed for a shipment of RDX using a personal credit card to pay for it.
Ugh!<eos> Sorry, Steven.<eos> We'll get these centipeetles out of your room.<eos> We think they were trying to get into the temple.<eos> You don't have to get rid of them.<eos> They are really cool!<eos> Um, you guys?<eos> These things don't have gems.<eos> That means there must be a mother somewhere nearby.<eos> We should probably find it before anyone gets hurt.
They found him on the top floor, dead.<eos> He'd been knocking on doors, making sure everybody else got out.<eos> Is that a "Chris is innocent" story or a "Chris is guilty" story?<eos> 'Cause I could interpret it either way.<eos> Legal aide defended him for a reason.<eos> Might just be the right reason.<eos> Guy loves his job, protects the innocent.<eos> Think I'm wrong about one thing though.<eos> He's not running to the white picket fence.<eos> He's going to try and find it right here in the city.
Um... this part of his finger was missing.<eos> Well... if it isn't Rizzoli and Isles.<eos> Put your hands on the counter where I can see them.<eos> What, no joking today?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I thought I helped you guys. I gave you names.<eos> Put your hands on the counter now.<eos> Drop the knife, or I'm gonna shoot!<eos> See, my father was a driver.<eos> For 50 years, customers... they'd sit in the back of his town car, treating it like a garbage can.
- I'll do what little I can do to cooperate.<eos> - Itabashi-han. I'll do anything.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - We're heartened to hear that.<eos> Let's get started right away.<eos> Higashida bought an investment real estate somewhere abroad for 50 million.<eos> 50 million?<eos> ! Have you heard anything about it from Higashida?<eos> A vacation home abroad?<eos> that's news to me. we can seize it immediately. is he? That little shit Higashida! I won't let him.
Life is long and wonderful.<eos> It ebbs and flows like the perennials in my garden.<eos> Sometimes they're in bloom, sometimes they're not, but they're always alive.<eos> So I'm going through a dormant period.<eos> Exactly.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - Things change.<eos> Unexpected things happen.<eos> You make sure I know that information<eos> - when you get it, yes?
You know we're not actual high school students, right?<eos> We're here to eliminate a threat, not hold hands and pass notes in class.<eos> And now, we know he's harmless.<eos> Threat eliminated.<eos> You're starting to like him.<eos> So what?<eos> So if Deucalion asks you, would you kill him?<eos> If Deucalion asks you, would you kill me?<eos> Stop talking to Danny...<eos> Or I'm gonna rip the flesh off his face and eat it.
They bought it only to demolish it.<eos> They're horrible people!<eos> I hate them!<eos> Got it.<eos> We should stop the bulldozers.<eos> Please at least try.<eos> Honey, listen.<eos> We both loved that house.<eos> We're just gonna have to remember that... no, no.<eos> We have to save it.
Hey, so I'm sorry if it got a little loud last night, but when you keep knockin' it out the park, the crowd's gonna make some noise.<eos> Or the crowd is faking it 'cause it wants to roll over and go to sleep.<eos> Haskell, hush.<eos> He'll hear you.<eos> Well, maybe he deserves to.<eos> Maybe the champ is just in a slump.<eos> It would help if I could see the game films.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, you listen to me.<eos> We made a promise to Holly, and we're gonna keep it.
That doesn't necessarily prove they were sleeping together.<eos> Well they had to do it somewhere.<eos> They couldn't do it at his place he's too smart to risk Mary Ashley coming across a hotel credit card receipt.<eos> Wood, take a picture.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Not of us!<eos> Take a picture of the address, you numbskull!<eos> You don't work out enough that you would need a personal trainer.<eos> He doesn't need a personal trainer.<eos> He needs you to take a picture of the address so you can give it to the detectives so they can call him in for questioning you boob!
It seems a few of my more attractive male patients, twenty-six if you have to know...<eos> Let me guess.<eos> They're suing you for groping them while you had them under anesthesia.<eos> Oh, it's completely ridiculous.<eos> They were totally knocked out.<eos> How could they possibly remember anything?<eos> Don't worry, Nelson.<eos> I will bail you guys out.<eos> I just need your debit card and pin number because I'm broke.<eos> Great idea, Wood. I'll just get it from my wallet. Which was confiscated when we were arrested and it's in a drawer in the booking room!
Okay? Just not now.<eos> I can't be here, all right?<eos> Please.<eos> We got a warrant.<eos> We checked your phone, okay?<eos> It was your access code that shut down the light in the Rialto Room for the robbery.<eos> You were in on that heist.<eos> And... you shot Julian Reese so that you could have all the money to yourself.<eos> Fine, okay, don't talk.<eos> We're in your home right now, turning it upside down, and we're gonna find the proof that we need.
She's looking for a key.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Little birdie told us.<eos> Ring any bells, Dorothy?<eos> Unfortunately.<eos> It's the key to Oz.<eos> There are magical ways into Oz -- tornado, eye of a hurricane, whirlpool -- but this key will turn any locked door into a portal to Oz.<eos> Insert key, twist, and presto, you're in Oz.<eos> How did the Men of Letters get the key?<eos> I have no idea, but if she finds it, she'll go back and finish what she started.
"Aerodynamics are for people who can't build engines."<eos> From the mouth of Enzo Ferarri himself.<eos> Impressive.<eos> Oh, yes, very.<eos> You still can't drive my car.<eos> Sorry, big fella.<eos> Neither one of you can drive my car.<eos> But you could trailer it to the track.<eos> So we can tow the car to the track?<eos> And then not drive it around the track?
Yeah, Kensilina, how about it?<eos> I-I don't think I should.<eos> Not even a lap?<eos> You need to stop worrying about Hetty, 'cause if you don't drive this car, they're gonna think something's up.<eos> Is this really your car?<eos> Told ya.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Of course it's my car.<eos> It's my baby.<eos> If it's your baby, then drive it.
Don't worry ladies, I've been keeping excellent score all day.<eos> Hmm. move the decimal, carry the two, and ...<eos> Congratulations!<eos> You're tied!<eos> Tied?<eos> You can't be tied for the Most Daring Pony.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Numbers don't lie.<eos> I'd love to stay and keep keeping score, but I promised to help test the new school bell.<eos> I get to ring it all week non-stop.
Yeah. I think I can get the plate. Got her.<eos> It looks like she's getting off at Dixon.<eos> There's a camera at Dixon and Airport Road.<eos> OK, there she is.<eos> She's turning into the parking lot at the Ventura Hotel.<eos> - Let's pay her a visit.<eos> - She'll be watching the doors.<eos> So we get her outside.<eos> The manager said one of the valets dinged my car.<eos> Yeah, my partner's rolling it up right now.
Well, you and the lovely Rochelle here are high-end B E specialists.<eos> We approach Tarkanian's man Christian at his club tonight, and we show him this to prove we have the goods.<eos> Christian is an appraiser.<eos> He needs actual product to appraise.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Klein won't sign off on us using a bottle for a meet like this.<eos> IIB has a forensic lab, right?<eos> - Yeah. - We need them to mock up an empty bottle of the '47. Are they capable?<eos> - The best in the country. - Get them on it.<eos> Now I'm going to tell you the play, and I want you to listen carefully, because I'm only gonna tell you once. The mock-up bottle is called "the show". We're gonna fill it with store-bought McKinney, 25 year.
Hold on, some Barbie's begging for charity.<eos> You got 60 seconds.<eos> I'm about to close a deal to buy a shopping mall.<eos> Go!<eos> Hey, it may be a little late, but welcome to the neighborhood!<eos> I'm Mel Burke<eos> - from down the street.<eos> - 55 seconds.<eos> Okay, my nanny accidentally sold you a nightstand and it's extremely sentimental to me.<eos> I'd like to buy it back from you along with any contents therein.
You can sell the rest of the furniture and the house.<eos> I'll just...<eos> Live in a box behind the supermarket with the rest of the sex perverts.<eos> Relax, would you?<eos> Making a sex tape is hardly going to ruin your life.<eos> Heck, a lot of people use it as a springboard to move on to bigger and better things, like...<eos> Marrying rappers.<eos> Thanks for helping.<eos> Look, this Andrew guy is probably not gonna even watch that tape.<eos> First of all, he'd have to find a V.C.R. to watch it on...
I have to go tell your aunt!<eos> She's... Going to be so happy!<eos> Something's going on in this house.<eos> Hey, your problem is solved.<eos> Oh, good, did you bring vodka?<eos> Because this wine is wussing out on the job.<eos> No no, I know where the tape is.<eos> It's in the jerk's garage.<eos> And you know what?<eos> You and I are going to steal it.
It's like I always say.<eos> Friends don't let friends' sex tapes go viral.<eos> I hope you're going to destroy that thing.<eos> Mmm, no, I'm going to keep it.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> This is a part of my past.<eos> It's who I am.<eos> And if memory serves, I look pretty damn good in it.<eos> In fact, I was thinking about throwing myself a solo viewing party later.<eos> Yeah, all right, I guess I can see why you'd want to keep it.
- No man has a beautiful body.<eos> Not to you, maybe.<eos> No.<eos> Strictly from an aesthetic point of view.<eos> - You know why?<eos> - No.<eos> Because of the penis.<eos> Regardless of how well proportioned a man might be, the harmony is ruined by the penis.<eos> It's a mistake from an aesthetic point of view.<eos> If the scene isn't justified, I won't do it.
I'm drying myself with the towel.<eos> I'm drying myself.<eos> I'm taking the panties.<eos> Taking the bra.<eos> The tights are on the bed.<eos> I'm sitting down.<eos> I'm taking the tights, the dress is hung on the wardrobe.<eos> I'm dressing.<eos> While I'm dressing,<eos> I see the dress, I go over, I look at it.
- Most of all, how it tastes.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Most of all, how it tastes.<eos> But taste is also influenced by the means, right?<eos> How?<eos> In Chinese cooking, you cut everything up small, you cut the meat, then you add the diced vegetables, then you add the sauce, then you add another ingredient, then another, and another, and so on.<eos> You see? It's sophisticated, right?<eos> In European cooking, you have a piece of meat, and next to that some garnish, and maybe a salad.<eos> I prefer European cuisine, don't get me wrong.<eos> But when I look at Chinese cuisine sometimes I don't get it.

- Peter Pan.<eos> This Tinker Bell is not going to save us.<eos> - You know where Pan is.<eos> - Sure.<eos> The arrow barely nicked me.<eos> You know how long?<eos> Days.<eos> Weeks at most.<eos> I don't belong here.<eos> You were created for a reason, and I can help you find it.
Give me The Dark One dagger.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know you wouldn't come all the way to Neverland without it.<eos> It's the only thing that can control you.<eos> It's the only thing that could stop you.<eos> You wouldn't take any chances with it.<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> - Why you lying?<eos> I'm not lying to you, Bae.<eos> I hid it so Pan couldn't get it, so he couldn't stop me.
What you're looking at is the fruit of my labors.<eos> Then you can read it.<eos> Sadly, no.<eos> I thought you just said you taught him how.<eos> Yes, but I also taught Neal something else.<eos> The key to being a pirate... secrecy.<eos> The best captains conceal their maps in a code.<eos> He was an apt pupil.<eos> So you're saying the only person who can read this map is Neal?<eos> Which means the only person who can read it is dead.
- Nobody move!<eos> Yo, keep them up!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Who gave us this intel?<eos> Someone called in a tip.<eos> A Mr. Swan.<eos> 10-2, report back to base, now.<eos> Any idea how the police ended up on the wrong side of town?<eos> Ms. Morgan gave me a tip regarding an underground gambling ring.<eos> I just wanted to make sure the police discovered and stopped it.
'I love Martin. ' 'I want to have a baby with him. '<eos> 'Lf it's because you want' 'to make love, that's not the same. '<eos> Martin's not here?<eos> - Gab?<eos> - Blablabla.<eos> Careful with the mic.<eos> Lighten up. Otherwise you can't stay in the choir.<eos> Switch places with Marie.<eos> Sing your pain.<eos> Let it out.
Okay, throw me the tank.<eos> The tanks won't fit out the window.<eos> Well, tossing handfuls of coins at me isn't gonna do us much good.<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> That's what I get for hiring my sister's kid.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Jackpot.<eos> Well, hopefully for your second fire you won't start it yourself.<eos> Sorry about your jacket.<eos> We'll have to figure out a way to replace it.
freeze!<eos> hands in the air!<eos> ahh!<eos> we're cops.<eos> broad shoulders!<eos> stuck!<eos> told you-- broad shoulders.<eos> apparently, our detective squad has gotten drunk, and an officer has gotten stuck in a trash chute.<eos> i need you to lead this squad, terry.<eos> and i mean really lead it.
I don't think so.<eos> No, not yet.<eos> I just will request a 30-minute recess, and then I'd like to jump right to my closing.<eos> You're having a baby.<eos> I'm fine, really.<eos> 30 minutes... if you're available. - But right now you need to go. - Okay.<eos> My client did not intend to get into the wrong line.<eos> He was placed there by a well-meaning Mexican official.<eos> We never received this footage.<eos> Oh, well, that's 'cause you never asked for it.
You do realize that all the men of the Alamo died?<eos> They all died!<eos> Ruthie's older, so she thinks she's the boss.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - But for a little guy, Stu holds his own.<eos> They can be a handful.<eos> But, God, they make me laugh so hard, you know?<eos> Wow. I did not know you could even tell the gender of a turtle.<eos> Oh, yeah. It's called "sexing the turtle," and it's an eight-step process.<eos> Now, let's pretend your hand is a turtle.<eos> - Okay. - What you do is you flip it over.
Neighbor called in some suspicious activity.<eos> Saw Deputy Connally drivin' around the neighborhood, peeking' in windows. Seems a bit over-the-top to cuff him.<eos> Well, he didn't have permission to operate on the rez.<eos> Oh!<eos> And he'd just started usin' these on the back door when I pulled up.<eos> Let me have a few words with my deputy... alone.<eos> You can have him.<eos> But not his car.<eos> I towed it.<eos> He can retrieve it from impound later after he pays the fine.
I reckon it'll be fine.<eos> I reckon it will.<eos> Cheers to that.<eos> ♪ What if you wanted to feel alive?<eos> ♪ Make something of the time you're killing<eos> ♪ what if you wanted somebody to love you right?<eos> ♪ What if...<eos> What are you do...

They do that sometimes.<eos> - What are you doing in here?<eos> ! - Sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> - What...<eos> I thought if I recreated your dream, then inspiration would strike.<eos> Well... you scared the crap out of me.<eos> So, I made a list of your enemies, and the list is really, really long, and I still need your help to finish it.
- Thank you, Wendy.<eos> I, on the other hand, am the fun aunt, so I don't have to worry about that.<eos> - And here we go.<eos> - What?<eos> I missed these girls.<eos> I didn't get to see them grow up this time.<eos> So, to make up for lost years,<eos> I'm gonna give you today's lesson free of charge.<eos> Use your magic as much as you want. Just don't hurt anyone.<eos> Only use it in an emergency.
I know that when you left her, she went crazy and took a bunch of pills.<eos> I didn't go crazy.<eos> - Killian told you.<eos> - Why don't you stay out of this.<eos> - This has nothing to do with you.<eos> - I am so sorry.<eos> I-I didn't mean to keep this a secret from you.<eos> I just...<eos> I-I hate talking about her.<eos> Okay, that part of my life, I just want to put it behind me, put Elyse to rest.
We didn't know how to stop it back then.<eos> We do now.<eos> This drink is the cure.<eos> I'm gonna need you to make it.<eos> But why me?<eos> Honey, even with all your inexperience, you have a gift for potions.<eos> It's in your blood.<eos> I'm never gonna be able to make it as good as you.<eos> So this branch can kill regular people, too?<eos> Anybody who touches it.
That's why I haven't used the serpent.<eos> - Maybe you're wrong.<eos> - You know we didn't leave by choice.<eos> Our father banished us to this world when he came into power.<eos> - But... - No!<eos> He said if we ever returned to Asgard, he will kill us.<eos> But maybe he's changed.<eos> - He hasn't changed.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> I have one life left, Joanna, and I don't want to spend it here.
Me, too.<eos> I gave him some information yesterday.<eos> Did he say anything to you about who he was going to see?<eos> No.<eos> Should he have?<eos> Yes.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> I think I might have caused Jane to do something very dumb.<eos> Funny thing about the list.<eos> Uh, I'd... rather not share it with you.

Hey, Ed, that's our business.<eos> You stay away from him, you hear me?<eos> Oh. Of course.<eos> You protect him instead of me.<eos> How much is he paying you?<eos> Guy's paranoid.<eos> - Somewhat.<eos> - Is that a diagnosis?<eos> - Not even close. - Even so, he didn't blow up his own house.<eos> He's terrified of losing it.
Marry me!<eos> You're so silly.<eos> Your skin is coarse.<eos> Tin XingCai: hospitalized for 7 years.<eos> If I don't eat...<eos> I'll... starve.<eos> Did you write that on your legs?<eos> There a lot of writings.<eos> Look, my skin is so thin that I can scrap it away.<eos> Don't cover it!
Die, die!<eos> I'm ignoring you, as usual.<eos> As usual I'm ignoring you.<eos> - At least change you clothes.<eos> - I don't want to, I don't want to.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really.<eos> You're so stubborn!<eos> - Take this orange.<eos> - No, put it away, I don't want it!
They both will.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Holding at 110.<eos> 98%.<eos> - Suction.<eos> - Suction.<eos> Hold this.<eos> Suction.<eos> Suction.<eos> When you find the placenta, you're gonna wanna gently peel it away.
And they couldn't have fired her unless they already had some evidence that she lied on her résumé.<eos> Did they, Kristen?<eos> Have evidence I lied?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> The whole point of the polygraph was about this theft.<eos> Okay, um, why don't you give us the day to think about it?<eos> Actually, I don't have a day.<eos> Mr. Canning told me you'd be able to move faster than he could.<eos> - Louis Canning?<eos> - Yes. He already filed the suit, but he got busy with another case, and he thought you'd be good to take it over.
we're in the middle of a negotiation with Zyckner Williams.<eos> I gave one of their guys a gift to butter him up.<eos> A pricey new set of clubs.<eos> The deal we're hammering out-- it's big.<eos> Oh, it's quite massive, actually.<eos> That's one of the reasons your adversaries at Zyckner Williams were willing to assist us.<eos> Helping expose you gives them leverage over Dynastic Energies, so they gave us the golf bag without a warrant.<eos> It's been in the office of a vacationing partner all this time.<eos> The Nemesis rifle was way too big to fit in there with all the other clubs.<eos> Gagnier had to disassemble it to get it to fit.

I bet Walt and I could design a DFS that could sniff out the device used to send it.<eos> It's a digital fingerprint scanner.<eos> Each brand of electronics emits its own unique electromagnetic field.<eos> I can tell from the upload pattern that a Toshoki-brand device was used.<eos> Okay, so we build the DFSes.<eos> You give them to Homeland agents, who go undercover on campus.<eos> And they will get a ping when they get close to someone with a Toshoki product.<eos> And then we detain just that person and then confiscate that device.<eos> And if it's the device we're looking for, it'll have the original ransomware code on it.<eos> Walter will reverse-engineer it and shut it down.
Okay. I'll check it out.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Homeland just got another e-mail from Ryder.<eos> "You now have one hour."<eos> Now that he knows we're on to him, he's trying to shorten the time frame.<eos> Okay, so, Paige, you stay here with Dorie and Alberto.<eos> We're gonna go to the one place that we can stop this hack.<eos> Where's that?<eos> The quantum.<eos> Now, if I can upload my anti-code directly into the quantum, then it can run as fast as the ransomware itself and unravel it.
You're the reason Amy left you.<eos> You spent most nights at card tables.<eos> You missed her birthday 'cause you were at the track.<eos> You blew through both your savings.<eos> You're an egomaniac and a narcissist.<eos> And after all these years, the only person you blame is me.<eos> Keep your mouth shut about all this.<eos> The quantum computer.<eos> It's like meeting Elvis.<eos> If that's what sent the ransomware, let's just smash it and end this.

Look, my point is, if he's not safe, then neither are we.<eos> Now more than ever, we have to insulate ourselves.<eos> Your relationship with Nick makes you vulnerable.<eos> - That's dangerous.<eos> - To whom?<eos> Sure you're worried about me, or are you more worried about yourself?<eos> Look, if you really care for him, the choice is easy.<eos> I can make sure he's looked after if you end it.<eos> Now.<eos> I do my job, and I do it well.

It's the po-po, boys!<eos> Scatter!<eos> I am very disappointed in you two.<eos> We were only trying to make diapers available to everyone.<eos> We saw a need and tried to fill it.<eos> Well, you have to stop filling it!
But it doesn't prove anything!<eos> You cannot marry her, King Julien.<eos> -I know, right? -[gasps]<eos> I mean, don't tell me what to do, Clover!<eos> I'm trying to save you, Your Majesty, from making a horrible mistake.<eos> I can get married to who I want and when I want and to as many lemurs as I want!<eos> Actually, you can only marry one lemur.<eos> Holy cow! I seriously don't know anything about marriage, you guys.<eos> All the more proof that I am right and this wedding is an incredibly stupid idea!<eos> I cannot support it.
Wait! Are we...<eos> Maurice, look.<eos> We did it!<eos> We are on the moon!<eos> Let's explore.<eos> Don't open the hatch!<eos> We don't know if we can breathe out there.<eos> Eh, what's that, Maurice?<eos> I couldn't hear you over me opening the hatch.<eos> No, Your Majesty, close it!
His world overflows with adventure and daring deeds of derring-do."<eos> Ooh. That's like twice the daringness.<eos> "King Julien XIII came riding into this world fully formed with biceps rippling and bulging, well-oiled and ready for action poised atop a unicorn horn."<eos> A unicorn horn?<eos> Bulging biceps?<eos> Your Majesty, somebody's playing you.<eos> Such accuracy.<eos> What else does it say I did?<eos> "King Julien's ears were so manly and well-proportioned that they could hear the cries of his people... -[all crying] -...bewailing the grave misfortune... of a freezing water slide that gave out such cold booties.<eos> He put his hands together and created the sun and bounced it up into the sky to lovingly heat the booties of all his peoples."
- A flat head?<eos> - Why?<eos> Well, he's probably spending a little too much time laying flat on his back.<eos> Because babies need to sleep on their backs, we really need to be vigilant about tummy time.<eos> Look, it's largely cosmetic.<eos> But Mateo's condition is pronounced, so there could be some visual disturbances, dental problems...<eos> Which is why some parents choose a helmet.<eos> A helmet?<eos> To reshape the head.<eos> It has to be custom-fitted, so Mateo would wear it 23 hours a day for about three months.
After their father left, I didn't want my kids growing up thinking that they were a burden, so I made sure they knew that mom could do it all.<eos> Meals, coaching, homework, shopping.<eos> That's an awful lot to sustain.<eos> Why else am I here if not for them?<eos> Well, you've got to think about yourself, too.<eos> I mean, what you're doing for your kids is admirable, but, um, there's difficulties and complications.<eos> Mm, accidents.<eos> This is about my treehouse.<eos> You took on a five-person job all by yourself and you got five kids.<eos> I mean, why not do it together?
- I can't say that I have.<eos> Oh. Well, you're missing out.<eos> A true delicacy.<eos> A single dish starts over $200.<eos> You know what makes it so special?<eos> Poison.<eos> Worse than cyanide.<eos> And the most poisonous part... the ovaries.<eos> Got to love that.<eos> But people train for years to be trusted to serve this dish because one slip, and it will kill anybody who, uh, who eats it.
It's always the same setup, like, at 510th.<eos> A pricy... One of those high rises.<eos> One time we had to move out in a 24-hour turnaround, because the apartment we were in, sold.<eos> This can't be that impossible, to track down who owns the place.<eos> I'm telling you, I've tried all my tricks and zip, nada, nothing.<eos> God owns this penthouse.<eos> God doesn't need to hide assets to avoid taxes.<eos> Some regular old person owns this.<eos> Oh, one thing I do have.<eos> Downstate Equity, the corporation that held the original title, hasn't gotten around to transferring it to whoever does own it.
It's an impressive apartment.<eos> Yeah, there's an enormous walk-in closet in the master.<eos> You can move in as soon as the end of the month.<eos> Do you have anything higher up?<eos> With an even more impressive view?<eos> Not at the moment.<eos> If you did, we could guarantee you a sale.<eos> Did I mention we're paying all cash?<eos> There's the penthouse.<eos> How soon can we get in and see it?
I didn't... The street sweeper guy, he saw me there.<eos> - I didn't mean to do this.<eos> - "I didn't mean."<eos> "I didn't mean."<eos> You left DJ for dead.<eos> Around here, that's called homicide.<eos> Get her out of my face.<eos> I don't think it's a bad word.<eos> End of discussion.<eos> Daddy says it when we watch hockey.

Grown men are allowed to say it when they watch sports.
You said that I was a terrible person.<eos> But clearly now I'm not.<eos> You're... never mind.<eos> What do you mean, "never mind"?<eos> Son of a...<eos> Hey! My God, I don't understand you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You can't come in here.<eos> Oh, just listen to me...<eos> I'm out there trying to help somebody, and all I ask is for your forgiveness, and you won't even give it to me.
Your body...<eos> Yes, very good.<eos> Your hair...<eos> CLOCK CHIMES - Merry Christmas.<eos> - Merry Christmas, sir.<eos> Peter.<eos> I bought you a present.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> I'm n-not sure you could be any prettier but... Mother says, ribbon in a girl's hair is very fetching.<eos> Then I'll wear it, hope not to disappoint her.
She is my friend.<eos> And does she approve?<eos> True friends do not pass judgment on each other.<eos> And if he isn't promoted and remains penniless, will you desist in seeing him?<eos> He will get his promotion, then he will call on Father officially to ask for his blessing.<eos> Fortunately, I don't need yours.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You will do exactly as you wish, Honoria, as always.<eos> Since Mother died, I have been expected to take her place, running the house, while you seem to be left to do as you please without a care in the world.<eos> The role of mother is one you took upon yourself, ignoring the fact that you lack any of the qualities necessary to carry it out.
Yeah?<eos> Live long and suck it!<eos> Birthday girl.<eos> Birthday girl.<eos> Birthday girl.<eos> Come in!<eos> Hi, Sheldon.<eos> Hello.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.
So...<eos> What'd you have in mind for tonight?<eos> I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner.<eos> If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon.<eos> Um, that sounds nice, but...<eos> I'm not really hungry right now.<eos> I thought maybe... we could do presents first. Oh.<eos> All right.<eos> I should probably tell you something about this gift.<eos> You mean before you... give it to me?

- Good catch.<eos> I've waited my whole life to hear you say those words.<eos> - Want to help me out here?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I needed the distraction.<eos> I had spent enough of my day obsessing over Simon's job offer.<eos> Plus, I don't know...<eos> seing my big, strong dad reach out to me in a vulnerable way, it was -- It was kind of touching.<eos> The red button!<eos> How do you not see it?
But for what it's worth,<eos> Beth and I are not perfect.<eos> Things come up when you plan a wedding.<eos> Really?<eos> There's such a thing as Mormon drama?<eos> There was ‭when Beth's uncle found out we're serving coffee at the reception.<eos> Plus, she doesn't want me to have a bachelor party.<eos> At all?<eos> It is one night before the rest of your life.<eos> - You should do it up.
I'm going to get it out of you.<eos> - Juice him, baby, juice him good.<eos> - What are you going to do?<eos> Oh no, don't sing a song please.<eos> Oh, I won't, I won't But you know what I will do. I will sing everything I'm doing<eos> - like it's a Broadway musical.<eos> - No, You wouldn't dare.<eos> [Scoffs] ♪ Yes, I would ♪<eos> "Candace can you help me find my phone ♪<eos> ♪ Oh Justin, my dear here's your phone ♪ ♪ you leave it on the couch all the time ♪
Alright? I want you to control yourself because I know, I know you get very weird, very emotional when friends are in need.<eos> But he told me, and he made me promise never to tell anybody.<eos> So you do...<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> It's trouble for me. Okay?<eos> First off, what did I tell you about wearing your shoes on the counter?<eos> Second off, I'm a man.<eos> I can control my emotions.<eos> Okay well then why don't you tell me how you felt this morning when you heard Adele's new single?<eos> You don't hear it, you know, you feel it...
You made a deal with us, but you're still entitled to an attorney.<eos> Did you think Dad was acting strange last night?<eos> I... think he's a little suspicious about how you got here.<eos> Dad?<eos> It is dangerous if I tell you the truth.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I would die for you.<eos> There is a drug, and it's called NZT.<eos> __<eos> And when I take it, my brain is, like...

So you're saying that your arm... came to life on its own?<eos> I know it sounds insane.<eos> We-we were washing dishes.<eos> That's exactly what happened.<eos> And has anything like this ever happened before?<eos> I mean, not like this...<eos> Never, not so much a twitch.<eos> I would've told someone.<eos> I tried to pull the Jake arm off... that's what they call it...<eos> I tried to pull it off, but it was... locked onto Kristen's throat like a vice.
That's stopping this board from moving forward.<eos> - Imagine if the rest of the board was...<eos> - You're obsessed...<eos> Any other discussion?<eos> Mrs. Florrick, do you have any discussion about this very important issue?<eos> Would you like me to have some?<eos> I would like you to speak for yourself.<eos> I think that the two of you... have issues.<eos> That may be true, but you still have to vote on it.<eos> The election board either has to renew its license with KLT and its voting machines, or reject it and license with Swan.
Jade, I am well aware that you don't like Adam, but I would prefer it if you could keep your opinion to yourself and not, you know, influence Georgie.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> - What?<eos> - It's nothing.<eos> What's nothing?<eos> It's just that, you know, people talk and... some of the kids at school who have been tutored by Adam have mentioned that... well... Anyways, it doesn't matter.<eos> Is Georgie around?<eos> Uh, she's in the barn or out in the field.<eos> If um, if there's something about Adam I should know, I mean, you would tell me, right?<eos> Yeah. It's just my opinion and you're right, I should keep it to myself.
I'm so sorry.<eos> I know...<eos> Bye, Jade.<eos> I'm really glad you were here.<eos> Georgie and I have an appointment.<eos> Um, Adam, it's a...<eos> it's a bad time.<eos> I'm sorry, but I don't think that Georgie can do it today.<eos> Fine.<eos> But it's not a good plan to put it off.
Hassler's sharp, and Huang's a hired gun now.<eos> They'll find something.<eos> Anything?<eos> I've watched this whole confession three times, and this guy is crazy, but he's not, you know, crazy.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Carisi.<eos> Thinking of taking up medicine after you pass the bar?<eos> Not tonight.<eos> I'm gonna take this care package up to Rollins.<eos> She's still on bed rest and she's going shacky-wacky.<eos> You can drop it off on your way uptown.
What?<eos> The artery wall in this area appears very thin.<eos> I'm afraid I may rupture it if I move too quickly.<eos> We don't have time to wait.<eos> I think I can get past it without causing any damage.<eos> All right.<eos> We're through.<eos> Okay, there's the blockage.<eos> Now I just need to move the stent in place.<eos> And inflate it.
I mean, this is me on the table.<eos> Mario?<eos> - Adenosine.<eos> - That's right... a medication...<eos> That will literally stop your heart.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because it...<eos> Heather.<eos> Why would we want to stop his heart?<eos> To restart it like a computer.
I...<eos> But surely a tall, handsome officer like you could find a way to forgive a...<eos> A sweet, silly woman like me?<eos> Please, sir?<eos> Ma'am, I'm not a sir.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Now, how was I able to drink that so fast?<eos> Here's a secret big daiquiri doesn't want you to know.<eos> The fructose in the strawberry masks the taste of the alcohol.<eos> It masks it.
I asked you here because you're my brother and a doctor.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> You wish I was still a lost little 20-something living in a trailer in Santa Cruz, don't you?<eos> Of course not.<eos> You had lice.<eos> Then my Camry had lice for the next six months.<eos> You've always been the perfect one that Mom and Dad worshipped, and I've always been the one that did things with an asterisk next to them.<eos> Got a bachelor degree in six years.<eos> Went to medical school... on a boat.<eos> Finally, I have some success, and I wanted to show it off to you not because I think I'm better than you, but because I thought I owed it to you.
Are you trying to describe jealousy?<eos> (scoffs) Please.<eos> I don't get jealous.<eos> I just want to bring some joy into my family's day, that's all, by having my assistant go out and get some last-minute gifts.<eos> I'm on vacation.<eos> We need to have boundaries.<eos> I'll buy you whatever you want.<eos> A 70-inch curved TV with 4K UHD?<eos> Done.<eos> And a couch to watch it on?
Caroline, you broke up with me.<eos> She broke up with you?<eos> I hadn't heard that.<eos> See?<eos> All bitter... better.<eos> Max, do you want to try it on?<eos> Ahem, she doesn't need a hat.<eos> Romes said I could have the sweet hat!<eos> Oh, it looks adorable on her.<eos> You should have it.
Okay, Max, this time can you do the blow-it-up hand thing with him?<eos> I've tried it, but I'm just not good at hand stuff.<eos> Ask anyone at Yale PREP.<eos> Just give it a shot!<eos> You also thought you couldn't eat food that's been stepped on.<eos> Look at you now.<eos> Sup, ladies?<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> Some guy threw a cat at me.<eos> Who's gonna blow it up for me?
You tell her we gonna make a trade.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're gonna ruin everything.<eos> See, this is why I don't go to family reunions.<eos> Aunt Lucile is always arguing with Buddy,<eos> Uncle Scott is drunk by noon, and someone's hand is always in the wrong cookie jar.<eos> Well... you ain't got the stones to pull that trigger.<eos> - [ Gunshot ] - [ Screams ]<eos> Pick up the phone.<eos> Put it on speaker.
Mark, you're scaring me.<eos> Well, that's our future.<eos> My neighbor Don can't drive me to the DMV because of that "suspicious mole." Hope he's okay.<eos> A cab costs $137 one way.<eos> I guess we could call Booger Tom's mom.<eos> You think that car has boogers in it?<eos> Their everything has boogers in it.<eos> Unless you know a licensed driver who's willing to ride with us halfway across the state, no questions asked, I just don't know.<eos> Let go of the walker, Grandpa.<eos> I'll put it in the trunk.
Cheapest rates around.<eos> All right. We're on the goal line with two seconds left on the clock.<eos> We're unstoppable!<eos> We're going to strap your ride!<eos> Would you believe me if I told you he was the one with most potential.<eos> One car length. One car length!<eos> I mean, you guys are seeing this right?<eos> My last test. Young man... I may not have always shown it, but I admire your commitment to vehicular safety.<eos> Even when you try to be nice, you ruin things.<eos> Yo, tie this suit behind the seat, we'll swap it for cash at the Suit Palace later.
Which one?<eos> You've had a busy day.<eos> Maybe we should assign you a parking space.<eos> We've been over this from every angle, and we just can't figure out why Charlie Koslow would want to murder Victoria.<eos> What the hell is this about?<eos> You're in a lot of trouble, Counselor.<eos> It looks like you panicked a little bit when you found Victoria was pregnant.<eos> This one's my favorite.<eos> So, you paid her 20 grand of the boss's money just to make the problem go away.<eos> You didn't want to keep that baby, but Victoria wanted to keep it, so you brought her out to a remote location, told her you were going to Cabo.
We'll set you up with a desk at our place.<eos> Ten years ago, Lasalle and I worked our first case together.<eos> Started when three men stole a hundred grand from a Navy Exchange.<eos> Witness saw a man with a blue tattoo.<eos> Yeah, we think that man is Tagget.<eos> He killed Phil Hart, stole his car.<eos> And tried to use it to escape, but the storm stopped him.<eos> Found a few bills in the car.<eos> Believe he hid the rest somewhere in the city.<eos> Now he's back in town to get it.
Present day victim.<eos> Ford's current post was Algiers.<eos> But ten years ago, he worked out of Belle Chasse.<eos> Same place the heist happened.<eos> Same timeframe? Yep.<eos> Worked part-time with the janitorial service.<eos> Had keys to the Navy Exchange.<eos> So Ford may have been an inside man.<eos> Helps rob the place, Katrina hits, something goes wrong with the getaway-- he holds onto the money.<eos> Tagget comes back to look for it.
By the way, I'm Kai.<eos> Hello!<eos> Hi Kai. But don't get your hopes up:<eos> You're just a rebound and I'm gonna need some more.<eos> Huh?<eos> What are rebounds?<eos> Obedient men who I have sex with only once to forget my shitty ex-lover.<eos> Whaa?<eos> No, I wanted your number cause I wrecked your bike.<eos> If you like, I can fix it.
- Here, have one!<eos> - Bottoms up, then?<eos> - Bottoms up!<eos> Cheers!<eos> Come on Felix!<eos> What is it with you!<eos> ?<eos> He's no good at drinking any more, he'll even sip a shot, like, forever!<eos> What's your problem?<eos> This stuff is so delicious, you have to savour it.
No, I understand, and... again, I'm sorry, and I would feel exactly the same way if I were in your shoes.<eos> Unfortunately, we don't have a choice.<eos> Do you even know why that juror voted not guilty?<eos> I'm going to see him later on this afternoon.<eos> Give him this.<eos> And then you tell him that in my book, he is now an accomplice to my Victor's murder.<eos> Excuse me, sir, is this your car?<eos> Was my car.<eos> Did you see who did it?<eos> No, but I can tell you who did it, anyway.
Forget the slant.<eos> How many others have a whole previous career as an NYPD cop?<eos> That's something Dad brings that nobody else does.<eos> Jamie's got a point.<eos> But that isn't your point, is it?<eos> No.<eos> Look, it's true, Dad has been a cop for most of his life, so can you imagine how hard it's gonna be to walk away?<eos> I mean, for him, moving on's gonna be less like letting go and more like letting go of an arm or a leg.<eos> Yeah. If he needs our support, he's gonna need our support to let go.<eos> Support is only worth what it costs you to give it.
Her facial bones were shaved.<eos> I'm working on the muscle reattachment points now.<eos> Also, I found a callous fracture on her nasal bone.<eos> Oh. So she had a nose job, too.<eos> And I found sutures behind the hairline, collagen, and silicone oozing from the decomposing tissue of the face.<eos> Well, the golf clubs aren't our murder weapon.<eos> They were all graphite composites or steel shafts.<eos> It was very expensive, 95.5% silver.<eos> Wow, even murder doesn't come cheap these days.<eos> I also found traces of bleach on her clothes, so our killer doused the body before dumping it.
Hey. So it looks like Booth finally found Scott Larette.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Yeah, nah, it's not that awesome.<eos> According to my facial reconstruction, it's the man lying on this table.<eos> Wait, so if Larette wasn't a cop, then why was he found wearing a holster?<eos> The owner of the processing plant was having problems with scrap metal theft so he hired him on to work security.<eos> Well, what kind of security guard carries a gun?<eos> Uh, somebody who wants to become a cop, you know?<eos> Bottom line is they didn't find the gun in the holster.<eos> So the killer must have taken it.
I don't understand.<eos> I don't officially have one, but... there's this facility in Berlin that's been pretty aggressive in courting me.<eos> I would have my own lab and everything.<eos> That's incredible!<eos> Congratulations!<eos> I haven't decided if I'm gonna take the job.<eos> Why not?<eos> It sounds like an amazing opportunity.<eos> It's everything you ever wanted.<eos> Why wouldn't you take it?
There's an ax out there.<eos> You can grab it.<eos> No one's gonna hear you.<eos> Wow.<eos> You grabbed my keys.<eos> That's incredibly thoughtful of you.<eos> Listen, perchance, you didn't grab my wallet, did you?<eos> 'Cause I had, like, 600 bucks in there.<eos> Fat chance.<eos> Open it.
You had the heart, you had the tattoo design.<eos> We ran your credit card.<eos> You stayed in Quincy, Florida, at the time Johnny Lavin was killed in Tallahassee.<eos> That's a 35-minute drive.<eos> Last time I checked, two plus two equals murder.<eos> No I was just trying to figure out what the tattoo meant.<eos> I sketched it from memory.<eos> Why would I go to the YMCA and retrieve the heart if I was the one that hid it?<eos> Because you knew we were close to figuring it out.<eos> Move it before we find it, period.

March 15, 1989, he gives me his usual bear hug...<eos> Messes my hair...<eos> I had some at the time.<eos> Gets in his lemans, and a minute later, I just... I hear a honk.<eos> And...<eos> I look through the window... and I see his head laying on the horn.<eos> I knew he was gone.<eos> Just... six months away.<eos> I want this chief job for me.<eos> But I also want it for him.
- If you had a silver bullet on somebody, would you use it?<eos> - Patterson?<eos> - How silver are we talking?<eos> - There's some records on him.<eos> Got them from when he was 17, boosting cars, some things worse.<eos> Wouldn't be too flattering if it got out, especially since he's an officer.<eos> Would damn sure get him off our back at 51.<eos> - Listen, whatever you choose, I'll back you up.<eos> You know that.<eos> But in my experience, when you step down in the gutter, part of you never leaves it.
- I'm going to find out.<eos> - Okay.<eos> This nightmare just won't go away.<eos> I know this is painful, Mrs. Campbell,<eos> But whoever attacked Rachel online could also be behind John's murder.<eos> I'm sorry but I'd like you to go.<eos> - Mrs. Campbell, we just need Rachel...<eos> - Please understand, she's only just getting better.<eos> Rachel's put the past in the past.<eos> We intend to keep it there.
I mean, I wouldn't put it past her.<eos> Well, for Christ's sake, Jared, then you need to change the locks, get a security system installed.<eos> - Done.<eos> - No, like a really good security system, one that alerts the cops when there's a break-in.<eos> - Speaking of which.<eos> - No. Hey, no cops.<eos> Jared, it was a break-in, I have to call the cops.<eos> What am I gonna say?<eos> That the four grand in cash I made from illegal parties was stolen?<eos> I mean, it's not like they're ever gonna find it anyway.
Because it's humiliating telling your daughter that pretty much the whole world finds you unemployable.<eos> Oh, God, sometimes I feel like I screwed up my life so badly, it's never gonna get back on track.<eos> Okay, well, look.<eos> What if I pitched in and helped out with Olivia?<eos> I can't ask you to do that.<eos> No, you're not asking, I'm offering.<eos> Look, I'm making a lot of extra cash from these parties, and if Olivia slips up again, I'll be there to help, 24/7.<eos> You're not gonna have to do any of this alone.<eos> I don't know where you got such a big heart.<eos> Must have picked it up from somewhere.
- Shut up.<eos> Stupid dip.<eos> Unh. Come on, Axl. Get your head in the game.<eos> I just threw up 20 minutes ago.<eos> Well, don't throw up out here.<eos> It's supposed to freeze tonight.<eos> We'll have to look at it all winter.<eos> All I'm doing is picking up bags and carrying them to you.<eos> I'm basically doing the job of a dog.<eos> You want me to get Doris to do it?
Previously on iZombie.<eos> DEVORE:<eos> This is FBI agent Dale Bozzio.<eos> She'll be looking into a string of missing person cases.<eos> LIV: Seems someone istargetingrichguys inSeattle.<eos> Suzuki's widow gave you a brain?<eos> I can't ask our lab to test it without saying where it's from.
Okay. You're right.<eos> I don't even want to have this conversation.<eos> You're crossing lines.<eos> Just tell me you'll make an effort to get this report to the White House.<eos> How?<eos> Call the President.<eos> Demand to see him.<eos> Henry, you might be coming a little unglued.<eos> I know you're upset about Dmitri.<eos> At least get it into the hands of Ephraim Ware.
You're really gonna make me ask?<eos> I think it's the finest piece of writing<eos> - I've ever seen from you.<eos> - Really?<eos> No, I'm shining you on because I hate to disappoint.<eos> It is good, isn't it?<eos> It's brilliant.<eos> - She's never gonna use it, is she?<eos> - Matt... this speech was intended to rally the nations of the world into a potential war with Russia.<eos> If the secretary never reads it out loud, that would mean the best of all possible outcomes had been achieved.
I'm just happy.<eos> God, you're not gonna regret this, okay?<eos> You are not gonna regret this.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - About 37 grand, give or take.<eos> Like, I don't know what the percentages work out to, but...<eos> I don't want your money.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> What do you mean, you don't want it?<eos> Here, take it, take it, please.
I mean, I was mad about six hours ago.<eos> Now I'm just really tired.<eos> So what's going on, Alison?<eos> I bought this place.<eos> I heard.<eos> With Cole.<eos> Who told you?<eos> Look, anyway, I've decided this is what I want to do with the money from the house.<eos> Okay.<eos> And I couldn't afford it on my own, so Cole and I decided to go in together as business partners.
Do you want to come with me?<eos> You know, the ceremony doesn't start until five.<eos> No, no, I'll come with you.<eos> Maybe I can help... lifting things, whatever.<eos> Look, thank you for being here.<eos> I know it can't be easy on you.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> You are?<eos> Restaurant looks great.<eos> It's gonna be a big success, and you deserve it.
- Great.<eos> - Chili, what the hell?<eos> - I overslept.<eos> What, it happens.<eos> [sirens wailing] Relax, it all worked out.<eos> - Just one in the car.<eos> His leg's trapped.<eos> - Any injuries in the RV?<eos> - Nobody in the RV.<eos> I was tagging it for impound when this guy comes along and-- wham.
- One of these days, you'll get it right, Otis.<eos> I am confident.<eos> - Come on, it's not that crooked.<eos> - Yo, candidate, can't you tell the difference between the squad table and a bike rack?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, sorry about that.<eos> My car's in the shop.<eos> - Can't you lock it up?<eos> I swear, you truck guys think you can bring whatever you want into this house.<eos> - Okay, okay, the Animal Control facility says that they're over capacity, so they can't take the little guy right now.<eos> - Little-- that thing better be out of here by the end of shift, or I'm selling it to a Chinese restaurant.
In fact, I think it's a bunch of crap.<eos> All right? I worked with the guy for eight months seven years ago.<eos> He was a good cop.<eos> Yeah, well, we have reason to believe he planted blood evidence on the clothing of Marcus Donovan, which led to his conviction.<eos> What led to his conviction was the fact that he killed an elderly couple after they cashed their Social Security check.<eos> There were no witnesses.<eos> The gun was never recovered.<eos> There's no witnesses because everybody's scared to death of Marcus Donovan 'cause he's a maniac.<eos> The fact remains that Donovan was convicted because the victims' blood was found on his shirt, and Reid put it there.<eos> The question is, did you know about it?
- If you want it, I want it.<eos> - I want it.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Business lunch.<eos> Thank you for agreeing to meet.<eos> What do you need?<eos> I'm a fan.<eos> Uh, here, have some wine.<eos> I...<eos> I-I'd pour it, but it'd...
Max is gonna get back to us after the autopsy.<eos> All right, so shooter takes out Katie and her mark, doesn't find what he's looking for, goes over to Hank's other hotel room.<eos> Uh, strikes out there as well.<eos> Right. Somehow, he figures out that all roads led to the pawnshop.<eos> HANK:<eos> Oh, this piece here.<eos> We swiped using "oops, sorry" routine.<eos> The execution-- flawless.<eos> People work hard for this stuff.<eos> And you just take it?
You really never liked it?<eos> 'Cause every time you went out somewhere, you always said you would put on your purrisian nights.<eos> And you used to pet the velvet and say how you always wanted a cat.<eos> You guys! Oh, I was kidding!<eos> Oh, bad joke.<eos> I just said I didn't like it because I was worried that you got me something different, and I didn't want you to feel bad that you didn't get me the cat perfume that I love.<eos> But phew!<eos> You did, and I love it.<eos> I love it so much!<eos> Did you know she hated it?
What?<eos> ! No!<eos> They have to be there!<eos> Where are they?<eos> Where are they?<eos> Mom, you can't just hit random buttons.<eos> We already tried that.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> Our computer is old.<eos> We just have to unplug it, wait five seconds, then plug it back in.
No, I'm not taking my bra off.<eos> Would it help if I take mine off?<eos> For the third time, no, it will not help.<eos> CJ, can you check on that broccoli soufflé?<eos> I can.<eos> For Jerry Seinfeld.<eos> - Yeah, man, do it!<eos> - Do it, man!<eos> What's the deal with soufflé?<eos> Why do we have to order it a day in advance?
Then people just stopped coming.<eos> It's hard not to take it personally when it's your baby.<eos> And why is Chumhum responsible?<eos> Their maps program...<eos> Chummy Maps...<eos> It's supposed to help users stay safe by giving them directions to avoid the dangerous parts of the city.<eos> Green's safe, yellow's so-so, and red means "stay away."<eos> When the filter's on, driving directions avoid the red areas.<eos> The filter is always on by default.<eos> You have to manually turn it off.
- Yes, reverse racism... that dangerous<eos> - contagion that's taking hold of society.<eos> - It doesn't have to be a contagion to be true.<eos> - Because harm is necessary for racism to be... harmful.<eos> But you think they're idiots because they're big white guys?<eos> No, I think they're idiots because you hired them instead of me.<eos> (Monica laughs)<eos> Can I see your laptop?<eos> Why?<eos> Because I want to steal it.
Everything okay?<eos> No.<eos> Full discovery.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Well, maybe we're just on the wrong side of this one.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I'll see you.<eos> Canning:<eos> The judge has granted full discovery.<eos> Now, this complicates our job, but it doesn't alter it.
Mm-hmm.<eos> - Everything all right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Can I call you later?<eos> About the PAC?<eos> About the PAC.<eos> What's this?<eos> A file on Jason.<eos> Skeletons and such.<eos> - Show it to Alicia.
Where is he?<eos> I sent him away.<eos> There were tears.<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Mom, what are you doing?<eos> Wait.<eos> Your flight's not for another five hours.<eos> Where did you get this crystal rectal thermometer from again?<eos> Just give me the gift receipt, and I'll return it at home in New York.
or "worth a lot of money"?<eos> I'm-I'm asking because, in either case, he may have had some competition.<eos> Um, I'm-I'm sorry, he... he didn't say.<eos> What kind of equipment did you loan him?<eos> Um, stakes and buckets, a-a pickaxe, a shovel... my truck.<eos> Your truck?<eos> He didn't have a car.<eos> He needed something to carry all the gear, plus whatever... whatever it was he was digging for.<eos> Any idea where the truck is now?<eos> I think he just parked it on the street near his place.
He also ran into traffic and was hit by a truck.<eos> Sounds like a suicide to me.<eos> I can handle this one alone.<eos> Hobbs is not dangerous, and if it involves any North Korean spies, I'll call in for help.<eos> I'll go with Callen.<eos> It's a two-man job.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Uh, no, no.<eos> I mean, uh, one man and an equally-capable woman could also do the job, but I don't want<eos> Callen to do it alone, and you guys both have family obligations.
It doesn't matter.<eos> Even if it's something small, if you two wake up together on Christmas morning,<eos> I guarantee you she'll have bought you something.<eos> Why?<eos> Women are more thoughtful than men.<eos> It's Christmas, she cares about you.<eos> At the very least, you should have backup plan.<eos> Like what?<eos> The emergency gift.<eos> You don't need it, you don't use it, but it's there if you do.
They're very cute.<eos> Yeah, until they grow up to be a full-size tiger and maul you to death.<eos> No. I would raise this one from a cub.<eos> It would love me.<eos> Plus, Josephine Baker had a cheetah.<eos> Yeah, and Nigerian warlords have hyenas.<eos> Because they're Nigerian warlords.<eos> Okay.<eos> That would actually be pretty badass, too.<eos> But, you know what, I would prefer to have a tiger, and I would train it to work with me.
See, I lied to my wife, but then she found out, and Damona said you would never... you know what?<eos> I'm gonna do something for you.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Here.<eos> This is like a couple hundred bucks.<eos> And this is my saddle burger giddy up card.<eos> Seven barn burgers away from a free barn burger.<eos> No, I can't take your money.<eos> Oh, no, I insist.<eos> You take it 'cause you are a Saint.
No, that's not it.<eos> Me and Otis, we've been talking and we need some help over at Molly's, you know?<eos> Washing glasses, bussing tables.<eos> 8 bucks an hour.<eos> Job's yours if you want it, Freddie.<eos> Yeah, I mean, you're gonna have to shower a little more often 'cause we run a really classy joint.<eos> I'm busting your chops, all right?<eos> Go easy.<eos> The job is yours.<eos> You want to take it or not?
Nice and steady.<eos> Nice and steady.<eos> Slow.<eos> Here we go.<eos> All right! Tank's free!<eos> Here we go.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Everyone, let's slide the tank!<eos> That doesn't sound good.<eos> These should help keep it cool.
It's a brilliant idea.<eos> There is no Chuck Feeny.<eos> I made him up because of what happened to Don McSorley when he turned his company over to his son.<eos> Son only took the job because he felt obligated.<eos> One year later, business went bankrupt.<eos> Broke my heart to buy his entire inventory 8 cents on the dollar.<eos> [ Chuckles ]<eos> I'm doing this for Claire.<eos> She'd do anything to make me happy, and that's not why I want her to take the job.<eos> If she wants it, she'll fight for it.
Here we go.<eos> Oh, I can't.<eos> Just like we practiced, okay?<eos> Okay, hand me the clampy thing.<eos> No, no, the, the, bigger one. Okay.<eos> - I found it. - Found it?<eos> - I think I feel it. Okay.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> Hard to see.<eos> - We just got to cut it out. - Yeah.
All it took was one punch!<eos> One punch!<eos> Just one!<eos> Is he really Class C?<eos> He's too strong!<eos> Or maybe the monster wasn't really that tough?<eos> but so many heroes went down.<eos> That just means those heroes were weaklings.<eos> Maybe... I suppose the monster didn't look all that tough when he killed it.<eos> a Class C hero took it out with a single punch!
I'm speaking from experience.<eos> Figured if I came at him too hard, he'd shut me out.<eos> Yeah, but if you give him support without question...<eos> He'll talk.<eos> He's ready, Dwayne.<eos> But I need assurances.<eos> I got it.<eos> I wasn't completely straight with you guys about who I was with that night.<eos> Zo was in my car, and I was giving him a ride to a party.<eos> When we got there, he gave me his bag and asked me to put it on the seat.
Son of Heaven.<eos> Ordained by blood, there are those who would have been better suited to harvest cow dung than to rule the greatest empire on earth.<eos> There are those who were as silver, a lesser metal, but worthy of coinage.<eos> And then there are those... like cold stone, who force their strength and fury and win the title by fear and intimidation.<eos> Blood is nothing.<eos> Heart and spirit make the sage.<eos> And by this... I give this boy the name Jingim.<eos> "True gold."<eos> So be it.<eos> He will walk out of here with this name, and carry it as his own into a tomorrow only the oracles can see.
There's gonna be a little blood, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Damn!<eos> - That's a lot of blood.<eos> Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> Lily, hand me the pen.<eos> I see it, I see it!<eos> His chest is moving!<eos> Okay. Hand me the bag.<eos> Let's tape it up.
This is an extremely important decision that a 16-year-old's gonna have to make.<eos> I can give him advice, but ultimately it's his decision.<eos> Yep, thanks very much.<eos> It's not a real bombshell...<eos> There's two things I don't know:<eos> Are you sorry for what you did, and you promise not to do it again?<eos> I know everything else I need to know about this case, except for those two things.<eos> So what I want you to do is make a decision.<eos> I want you to read this form.<eos> And then we're gonna fill it out.
Just so you're perfectly clear...<eos> I want you to testify against Steven Avery and tell the truth.<eos> And this is how I can help you.<eos> But I can't help you with those words that you wrote down.<eos> Those words, I can't help you at all.<eos> Why don't you draw another picture over here of him stabbing her?<eos> Why don't you draw a picture down here... of you having sex with her there.<eos> OK, why don't you do this...<eos> Why don't you draw a picture of the bed and how she was tied down.<eos> But draw it big-sized so we can see it.
So when did you get put in?<eos> - Tuesday.<eos> - Tuesday.<eos> He had court. I had to come to town too - and we passed him.<eos> It's just contact, which you're not supposed to have.<eos> I'm trying not to. I don't want...<eos> I'm sick of this place.<eos> - I don't...<eos> - I got a good job<eos> - and I don't want to lose it.
[Buting] OK. But you didn't hear it hit the floor when it... whenever it got there, right?<eos> Correct.<eos> The floor's carpeted.<eos> Well, can I drop it on the floor here?<eos> [Kratz] What are we doing, Judge?<eos> Is this an experiment in front of the jury?<eos> If it is, then we need to replicate the conditions.<eos> [Buting] That's fine.<eos> We'll hold off on that.<eos> The bookcase hasn't come in so I don't know if they intend to introduce it or not, but it's not here.
- Can you talk to us?<eos> - Where am I gonna walk?<eos> I can't even see.<eos> How are his spirits?<eos> What did you guys talk about in this 20 minute period you were there for?<eos> - Anything you'd like to say?<eos> - Did he say anything about Brendan?<eos> Can you talk to us at all today?<eos> [Buting] When blood is taken for a blood sample or blood tests, it's put in a purple top tube.<eos> It has a preservative to keep it from spoiling, and that's a chemical called EDTA.
Take the treatise on billiards.<eos> It's meant to teach you how to play.<eos> Sir!<eos> - Your wife is asking for you.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Your wife is asking for you.<eos> - What's new.<eos> She's trying on clothes with her tailor and she wants your opinion.<eos> But she doesn't take my advice!<eos> She doesn't take it!
The story of Ernest Shackleton and his men is one of the greatest stories of endurance and survival ever told.<eos> [narrator] In 1914 British explorer Ernest Shackleton departed England and journeyed south attempting to lead the first crossing of continental Antarctica.<eos> Once in the Weddell Sea, worsening weather conditions saw their ship, the Endurance, become trapped in the encroaching pack ice.<eos> And so began their epic tale of survival at the end of the world.<eos> [Peter] I think the Shackleton story is all the more famous because of the films and photographs taken by Australian photographer Frank Hurley.<eos> Hurley's approach to photography was to push the boundaries, he took technology as far as it could go.<eos> For him, all that mattered was the final image, of what he could share with the public.<eos> And I like to think that that's my approach to photography as well.<eos> What I love about photography is the opportunity to express myself.<eos> To take a photograph of an object or a location and express it in a way that's my own, in a way that other people perhaps might not have thought about it.
A little bit frustrating because we were here less than five minutes ago and we've just discovered this very, very fresh sort of outline of the tiger whose laid down in the sand and you can see the flick of her tail, so she's here somewhere.<eos> We've been out in the park since six o'clock this morning and there's a couple hours of daylight left.<eos> We know that there is a tiger somewhere, we're still waiting.<eos> The anticipating is growing but ah, so much about great photography, great wildlife photography, is about waiting, being patient.<eos> This is very exciting, we've had our first tiger sighting.<eos> Female about three years old, came out of bushes, walked onto the road, we we're able to follow then she just sat down in the middle of the road and had a look around.<eos> We probably had about five minutes with her before she's now moved away.<eos> We've got some great photographs already but that's the problem with this game, if there's an opportunity to take another photo it could be the best one so here we are again in pursuit of another tiger.<eos> [park guide 2] Can you see there, tiger, tiger with the kill?<eos> Can you see it?
- They make a fine mutton.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Delicious.<eos> And your... Your rooms?<eos> Satisfactory?<eos> I want everything to be to your advantage so that we can be as productive as possible.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Very nice Paper-<eos> Well...<eos> Use it wisely.
- Junior.<eos> He's going down, man.<eos> Knockout. Third round.<eos> Walter, you are dumb, but at least you're pretty.<eos> Don't do it!<eos> Easy. Easy.<eos> Where's my tape, Harper?<eos> Right there, my friend.<eos> - Go get his gun. - Why do I have to get his gun?<eos> Go get it!
Good luck.<eos> And remember, making a purchase at Fonnesbech's is not merely shopping.<eos> It's an experience.<eos> You lived in Paris, yes?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let everyone know.<eos> The store is a stage.<eos> We're here to perform.<eos> In Paris, you see, a lady would never dream of spraying the scent directly onto herself.<eos> She would spray it in the air, and then she'd walk through it.
Tell me, what would you have done if she'd been thrown and broken her neck?<eos> I thought you knew her better.<eos> More likely I would break my neck.<eos> I saw more than hoof marks today.<eos> - Did you?<eos> - Watch yourself!<eos> I've known her just as long as you have, and with a more mature eye!<eos> I'm older than you, Alcides, and heir to the throne!<eos> Let's back away slowly. Don't turn your horse.<eos> No, let's escape. Your horse can outrun it.
You must accept who you are.<eos> Only then can you unlock the doors to your own potential.<eos> Embrace your father, and you will discover... powers that you never imagined.<eos> Where was this father when 80 good men perished next to me?<eos> Where was he when my mother was murdered?<eos> Your father has always been there, Hercules.<eos> You were just not ready for him.<eos> Zeus can't change the minds of mortals... but he has given you a gift.<eos> And be warned, abuse it and it will lead to your destruction.<eos> Respect it, and it will save you and those you love.
Maybe.<eos> Dude, it's okay to be gay. We understand. Just, you know, sleep over there.<eos> I'm not gay.<eos> Give it some time, man. You'll realize.<eos> Fuck y'all.<eos> See, that's exactly my point, man.<eos> Nah, but we don't have whores coming over.<eos> We were just fucking with you to see what you'd say.<eos> And you just earned your vag badge.<eos> Put it next to your bitch card.
You need this. You got life ahead of you.<eos> And the shirt is blue.<eos> You got dances and job interviews.<eos> Here, I'm going to get it all wrinkled here.<eos> Mason?<eos> Come here, son.<eos> Pull that off.<eos> There's a 20-gauge shotgun.<eos> Wow.<eos> My dad gave it to me when I was a little younger than you, and his dad gave it to him.

Mason, why are you such a stick-in-the-mud?<eos> What are you even talking about?<eos> You guys don't mind coming back here on the 20th, do you, for Cooper's baptism?<eos> No, that's fine.<eos> Sam?<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> It means a lot to Annie and her folks, you know.<eos> Were we baptized?<eos> I wasn't the least bit concerned with the state of your soul.<eos> We can do it now, though, if you want.
No, really. Looking at you, because you're actually looking at me this time.<eos> You have the most beautiful kids.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Sure.<eos> You're a great mom too.<eos> You're a pretty good mom yourself.<eos> I'll take that.<eos> Tyler has a playoff game on Saturday...<eos> Yeah?<eos> ...and I think that for the very first time, he won't actually be completely dreading it, thanks to you.
Come here.<eos> Brendan, don't forget that I'm picking you up for Scouts so don't take the bus home.<eos> Thanks for telling everyone I'm still in Scouts, Mom.<eos> You're a good boy. Be proud of who you are.<eos> Love you.<eos> Say one word and you're dead.<eos> You're driving a minivan.<eos> It's Dick's.<eos> I'm off to buy toilet paper for Team Theodopolis.<eos> When the team needs toilet paper, the Co-captain goes and gets it.
What are we going to do about your train set?<eos> My train set?<eos> Well, Mr. Beck spoke to you about this.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, I know he did.<eos> I know he did.<eos> You've never wanted to give it away, but...<eos> I don't care about my train set, Mother.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Well, I think we'll... We'll give it to the children's museum, if they have room.
If we release him, our jobs will be at stake.<eos> There's a lot of pressure on us.<eos> My advice is, find a good lawyer.<eos> And bail him out soon, otherwise he will have to stay here until Monday.<eos> Sorry, madam.<eos> So, it's you.<eos> Let him out.<eos> Sir, the FIR's been registered.<eos> Only the court can grant him bail.<eos> Tear it.
I'm having a little trouble accessing a group file code without a partner-level ABA dodge.<eos> Can you grab Rob for me?<eos> I know he's in a meeting right now.<eos> For you, the world.<eos> Jack!<eos> Hey, Rob.<eos> You find anything juicy over there?<eos> Oh, you know, accounts bullshit, hookers and hotels, same old, same old.<eos> Did Teddy tell you I need that dodge?<eos> I'll give it to you on one condition.
We clean the premises and get the hell out of there.<eos> I have max-level data coming in for analysis now.<eos> We are tracking them.<eos> The same old weaknesses, Viktor.<eos> Vodka, vanity,<eos> women.<eos> Your son would be ashamed.<eos> Ryan has it.<eos> The algorithm's uploading to Langley.<eos> Once we break it down...
Aleksandr Cherevin, age nine, and Aleksandr Borovsky, age nine.<eos> They're the same kid.<eos> He took a cash advance of $6,000.<eos> - And then he went black?<eos> By now, he could be anywhere.<eos> Hey, Al.<eos> Where you been?<eos> You in some kind of shit?<eos> FBI was crawling all over here yesterday looking for you.<eos> Wait. The guy knew that the FBI made his phone. He would dump it, right?
Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's all right.<eos> You? I'll-<eos> - I'll take it off.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I'll take it off.<eos> Shh, shh, shh.<eos> Here you go.<eos> There.<eos> The monster. The monster.<eos> You're feeding it, aren't you?
- They have been seen.<eos> COTYS:<eos> Come, Hercules.<eos> Let me show yöu what misery rhesus has brought us.<eos> Every week, more refugees arrive seeking my protection, most of them covered in blood, crippled or burnt by rhesus' men.<eos> I feared nothing could ever be good again, till yöu arrived.<eos> I'm just a mercenary fighting for gold.<eos> How we view ourselves is of little consequence.<eos> How others perceive us is important.<eos> And yöur name, like it or not, is a rallying cry.
Every last one of yöu!<eos> Because yöur shield wall was weak.<eos> Dead.<eos> Dead.<eos> Very dead.<eos> Soldier, many lives depend on yöu.<eos> When attacked, lock yöur feet in the ground.<eos> Yöu understand?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> When a shield wall is strong, nothing can ever defeat it!
The bessi are a fierce but primitive tribe.<eos> If we do not protect them, then there will be a bloodbath.<eos> Face rhesus with an untrained army and yöu risk losing far more than a single battle.<eos> My lord, rhesus is coming.<eos> I vouch my life on it.<eos> The longer rhesus lives, the more villages will be burnt and the more innocents will be killed.<eos> Assemble yöur men.<eos> We march tomorrow.<eos> Hercules, the gods have offered us a gift.<eos> We must not squander it.
- No, no, no, I'll be right back.<eos> Please don't go anywhere.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Come on, you're killing me.<eos> - I'm working.<eos> - That's a paying job?<eos> - Because we have an actual paying job.<eos> - No.<eos> Look, you don't think that every crime reporter in the city isn't trying to work this Foot Clan story?<eos> I know that, but there is a new angle on this, and I am this close to getting it.
But what makes money bad? Not the money.<eos> The people make it bad.<eos> What people do with it.<eos> Now, I'm not saying we do anything rash.<eos> All I'm saying is we just wait and see.<eos> He's been dead a week.<eos> The cops came, they didn't find anything.<eos> No one's come forward looking for the money. Okay?<eos> And if they do, this will look like Ben hid it.<eos> I say we just hide it and wait a week.

So, whose team are you on?<eos> Detective Halden, it's Tom Wright.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Babe, it's me. Can you give me...<eos> Where's my money?<eos> Where's my money?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Me and my brother's money.<eos> Are you an idiot, you fucking cunt?<eos> And he died getting it.

- Here we go.<eos> - I'll be in the waiting room.<eos> So.<eos> That should do it, right?<eos> I didn't sign, because I think my wife...<eos> Or the patient should sign right there.<eos> There you go.<eos> Is that where she should sign? I'll just leave that here.<eos> Don't be a goddamn baby, Judd.<eos> I extend an olive branch, and you're gonna pitch it in the trash?
When a demon is killed its spirit descends to hell, where it remains trapped for all eternity.<eos> How do you descend a gargoyle?<eos> We are sacramental beings of light and good.<eos> We ascend.<eos> And only at the hands of godless creatures that have no souls.<eos> You do not want those.<eos> They are blunt and crude, and far too heavy to wield.<eos> Adam, you have strength and speed and stamina far beyond that of any human.<eos> You would use those gifts. Take sides in a war that you are already a part of.<eos> I do not care how many demons it descended. You should've let me destroy it.
Gideon, no!<eos> This is the private scientific journal of Victor Frankenstein.<eos> We found it on Frankenstein's body the night we rescued the creature 200 years ago.<eos> It contains, in detail, how Victor Frankenstein conceived, and then constructed his unholy abomination.<eos> And I pray that it might save my Queen now.<eos> Gideon, I command you, take the journal from this place, and let me ascend.<eos> This one came in just this morning.<eos> Morgue sold him to us.<eos> The liver was ruined, but the other organs are healthy enough.<eos> Store it with the rest.
What's this got to do with me?<eos> What's in hell that's got to do with me?<eos> You have no soul, and a demon spirit can only possess a body that has no soul.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> You know what the best thing about having the journal is?<eos> I no longer need to bring you in alive.<eos> I need it alive!<eos> I need to study it!<eos> Bring it back to the lab and...
No.<eos> No.<eos> You know what the best thing about having the journal is?<eos> I no longer need to bring you in alive.<eos> I need it alive!<eos> I need to study it!<eos> Bring it back to the lab and...<eos> You can read the journal and study its corpse.<eos> Its corpse won't show me how its organs function, how they respond to tests.<eos> Let me bring it back to the lab where I can open it up, but keep it alive while I run my tests for Mr. Wessex.

Used to be that, by the time it got to the States there was only so much profit you can squeeze.<eos> And then, we got Brick Mansions.<eos> Our very own border and it's less than a mile away.<eos> I went to business school, the best business school in the world.<eos> 4 years, half a million bucks.<eos> You just have to remember one thing.<eos> People pay the most for what they cannot get.<eos> Can I have that GPS?<eos> The routes are pre programmed.<eos> Don't lose it.
What are they transporting?<eos> N.A.D, Neutron Assisted Device.<eos> A neutron bomb.<eos> We prefer the word device.<eos> Bomb has such negative connonations.<eos> The device was fitted with an anti theft mechanism.<eos> Which is triggered if the case should be open the wrong way.<eos> Device activated.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> We need you to infiltrate, locate the device, and contact us for the code to disarm it.
Watch my tone?<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Untie the girl!<eos> Maybe I should just kill you and do this myself.<eos> Who's the bitch now?<eos> Get away from her!<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> I'm so glad you boys came to save everyone, man. Not everyone.<eos> Hey, Lino.<eos> They're gonna text the code. You punch it in.
Let's go.<eos> - Bye!<eos> - Bye, Mother!<eos> Thank you!<eos> "Edward, please send me news of Roland Leighton.<eos> "Tell him how much I enjoyed meeting him, will you?<eos> "I think I offended him, Edward.<eos> "You know I can be my own worst enemy."<eos> "Edward assures me you won't mind me writing direct.<eos> "You set me a challenge, you see, and I've done my best to meet it.
And to the left.<eos> No, your left.<eos> More, more, more.<eos> Good.<eos> It is tall.<eos> Monuments are monuments for a reason.<eos> They inspire.<eos> Inspire what, in this case?<eos> In this, and in every case, power.<eos> Say it out loud, whatever it is.
Loose!<eos> Draw!<eos> Loose!<eos> Draw!<eos> Loose!<eos> Again!<eos> There are two kinds of warfare.<eos> Each is dictated by numbers.<eos> With greater numbers you attack the enemy head on!<eos> You stab it in the heart!
It's not because I don't care or because I don't respect you or because I don't love you.<eos> It's because I'm a big pussy.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm just a huge, pathetic pussy.<eos> I could never be you.<eos> You can crash on the couch, if you want.<eos> Did you, by chance, read my script?<eos> And?<eos> It's great.<eos> I'll definitely give it to my agent.
A sleep from which she will never awaken!<eos> Maleficent, please don't do this. I'm begging you.<eos> I like you begging.<eos> Do it again.<eos> I beg you.<eos> Alright.<eos> The princess can be woken from her death sleep.<eos> But only by... true love's kiss.<eos> This curse will last until the end of time!<eos> No power on earth can change it!
How you doing, Bobby?<eos> I'm not going to do it anymore.<eos> Do what?<eos> Play with all of these distractions.<eos> It's not what we agreed to.<eos> You know, they've been doing this to me for years.<eos> Making me all these promises, and they all turn out to be lies.<eos> They've been doing it to me since I was a kid.<eos> You know, I would get stuck in Europe with huge hotel room bills when I was 15 years old.<eos> The Federation would raise money off of my back and funnel it to Reshevsky.
You have a dog in your trash can.<eos> It's a boxer.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You have a dog here in your trash.<eos> This one's bleeding.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Bob Saginowski.<eos> Let me see your license.<eos> My wallet is in my pocket.<eos> You'll have to take it out.
I don't need to do anything.<eos> I'm just going to stand right here.<eos> I'm going to stand right the fuck here.<eos> You really should take a look at this.<eos> I don't need to see Europe. I don't need to see Dottie. And I don't need to see what's in that bag.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> We need to do something with it.<eos> - What, the money or the... thing? - I bet...<eos> Whatever's in here adds up to what we lost the other night.<eos> Why'd they give it back to us?
You can't walk into people's lives and expect them to...<eos> Listen, listen.<eos> Take it easy. Listen to me.<eos> That is life.<eos> That's what it is.<eos> People like me coming along when you're not looking.<eos> Just get my money, 10:00 a.m., your place, all right?<eos> And if you don't get it, I'll go to the cops and get my dog back.<eos> Simple.<eos> And then I'll forget to feed it for a while.
No more drinking.<eos> Just give me a pen and some paper.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Dear Kara, I think we both know that it's time for things to change.<eos> I know I'm not the man your father thought you deserved.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't... Your father's a fuckin' asshole.<eos> This will be hard on Ethan, and that breaks my heart, but in the long run, it's better to be raised by two happy parents apart than miserable ones together,<eos> but if he starts in with that shitting stuff again at school, you let me know.<eos> There's a whole world out there, Kara, and it's time for me to experience it.

- You wanna lie down?<eos> - No.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll fix your pillow for you.<eos> No, no. I'm okay.<eos> I'm going to go home now.<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> Did Fernando come?<eos> No.<eos> And he took bread in his hands blessed it
- No.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll fix your pillow for you.<eos> No, no. I'm okay.<eos> I'm going to go home now.<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> Did Fernando come?<eos> No.<eos> And he took bread in his hands blessed it<eos> and gave it to his disciples and said
What, now?<eos> God, no. In another $20 million.<eos> Mind you, I've been saying that for the last $100 million.<eos> Oh, you bust a gut, you earn enough money, you retire, you do something you like.<eos> Or nothing at all.<eos> And then you're happy?<eos> Yeah, we're addicted.<eos> Divorced or dead.<eos> What the hell?<eos> You pick a goal, you work towards it.
Ask yourselves, is this worth that?<eos> You first, Agnes.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no.<eos> - Oh, yes, we made a deal.<eos> Off you go into the isolation booth.<eos> Helmet on.<eos> I want you to imagine yourself in three situations.<eos> One that makes you very happy, one very sad, and one very scared.<eos> Recent memories can be useful.<eos> Do not tell me the order, I will guess it myself.
I need to take this call.<eos> Alright.<eos> Please, please.<eos> Uh, Clara, Clara, are you still there?<eos> - Yes, I'm here, yeah.<eos> - Thank, God!<eos> Clara, listen.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't give you any explanation for this insane journey, but the truth is,<eos> I didn't really have any reasons of my own.<eos> I didn't explain it to myself.
Never in the flesh.<eos> So this is all just some... theory.<eos> You don't know if this thing even exists.<eos> The visions showed me it was at Verdun. I could see it. I--<eos> I just... lost the power before I could get to it.<eos> And by the time we took...<eos> Verdun... the Omega was gone.<eos> Okay. So all I have to do is... wait to have these visions... and then tell you where this Omega thing is.<eos> No. Cage.<eos> You're gonna get me there. And I'm gonna kill it.
And the only means of finding it is in that safe right there.<eos> No matter how many times we have this conversation... you refuse to accept that the enemy breaks through to London tomorrow... and we lose. We lose everything.<eos> Let's say for one moment... that I can't rationally explain... your impressive parlor tricks.<eos> Dr. Carter told me... this device requires a live mimic to work.<eos> - That's my concern. - On the contrary.<eos> According to you, this concerns the whole world.<eos> Well, what would you do if you believed everything I just told you?<eos> I would locate this....<eos> Omega.<eos> Bomb it out of existence.
Must be a thousand mimics between us and the pyramid.<eos> What we gonna do? Walk up to the front door?<eos> - If we stay here, we die. - Yeah?<eos> We'll never get through.<eos> We could.<eos> In that.<eos> That ship will never fly.<eos> Doesn't need to fly.<eos> It just needs to get us across there with speed.<eos> If the engines are... still running, we could steer it with the power levers.
Christ,what?<eos> No, no, no, sorry, no, that's what I meant.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> Jesus,youscaredme!<eos> I mean, there was an accident, um, with the thingy with Greg, you know?<eos> Well,thathappens,Rosie!<eos> No, no, Alex.<eos> Something that I need to figure out right now, Alex.<eos> I need to get rid of it.<eos> It got lost and I can't find it and I don't know what to do.
All right.<eos> Thanks, everybody.<eos> I'm sorry about this traffic.<eos> There's nothing I could do about that.<eos> This is nothing.<eos> We're actually moving.<eos> And there's no honking. No honking.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm gonna have these two over to the house to watch some cricket.<eos> It'll be nice to watch it with somebody who appreciates it for once.
I've been one for a while now.<eos> Maybe my whole life.<eos> Um, yeah, I heard about today.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> How did you hear? SportsCenter?<eos> No.<eos> Rinku texted me.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - "We failed."<eos> I feel like I gave them this dream, and then just took it away from them.

SportsCenter?<eos> No.<eos> Rinku texted me.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - "We failed."<eos> I feel like I gave them this dream, and then just took it away from them.<eos> So give it back to them, you know.
- You're making a mistake.<eos> - Let her go.<eos> That gun's not loaded.<eos> But this one is.<eos> Don't you understand? This parasite's the original strain.<eos> It's the only way to make the retroviral.<eos> That's why it didn't work before. There's no other way.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - Please be reasonable.<eos> We only have to extract it.
I have to prove to them that they're wrong!<eos> - Please!<eos> But you bit him.<eos> I saw it on the camera.<eos> Trust me, Nick!<eos> We can get out of this together. But I need that code.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've got it.<eos> Guzman showed me how to get it from the camera above the door.
I didn't mean to burn you.<eos> Does that hurt?<eos> Practice a little self-control.<eos> Get a grip.<eos> We're 15 miles from town.<eos> Nobody gonna see us.<eos> Nice, well, let's just read each other's minds?<eos> It'd be pretty short for me to read yours.<eos> Money?<eos> You want it now, you got it.
Outside of the post office.<eos> Stopping the mail chases even the recluses out of the woodwork.<eos> And let's rustle up a list of the biggest men in the county.<eos> Get a chance and call Mrs. Margaret.<eos> She's been askin' on the progress of the case all day.<eos> And call Mrs. Margaret.<eos> Can't believe it happened in our spot.<eos> Not much of a spot.<eos> So, you're really getting all that money?<eos> Postal Inspector's coming from the nation's capital to give it to me.
And that scares me.<eos> Neddy, you scare me.<eos> You really think the president... that he wants this to happen?<eos> You really think the CIA has unleashed germ warfare to kill off all the queers that Jerry Falwell doesn't want?<eos> - Mick. Try to hold on.<eos> - To what?<eos> I used to love my country.<eos> The "Native" received an anonymous letter describing top-secret Defense Department experiments at Fort Detrick, Maryland... that have produced a virus that can destroy the immune system.<eos> Its codename was "Firm Hand."<eos> They started testing it in 1978 on a group of gays.
Back to your room!<eos> What?<eos> Lissa, what are you doing?<eos> - Rose?<eos> - Lissa's in trouble.<eos> I heard a noise.<eos> Lissa...<eos> There's so much blood.<eos> It's starting again, isn't it?<eos> I tried, Rose, I tried to bring it back, but... it was too late.
Thank you.<eos> OK, bye.<eos> - OK.<eos> - See ya.<eos> What were you doing with Rose?<eos> You were fornicating, weren't you?<eos> Fornicat...<eos> We were reading.<eos> We discovered a magic called Spirit.<eos> You have it.
Emily, are you okay?<eos> Mom!<eos> Positivism.<eos> Let's do this thing.<eos> Get in there, get in there.<eos> - Buckle, buckle!<eos> - Buckle, buckle!<eos> Go, go, go, go, go!<eos> It seems we may have accidentally given your tux away.<eos> Well, get it back.
Do I know that person?<eos> You do.<eos> And, does this person like you too?<eos> I don't know if in the same way I like them...<eos> Actually... I've even kissed this person...<eos> But it was just a peck. You know... quick...<eos> But then I got embarrased, didn't say anything. They didn't either.<eos> So I thought I should just give up...<eos> Leo...<eos> If you stole a kiss... how would you return it?
Who?<eos> Who tried to kill me?<eos> No one knows.<eos> - What?<eos> - No one but you.<eos> I don't think Ben should know about the camera.<eos> It's your diary.<eos> I think it's important you don't feel... constrained by the thought of Ben checking up on your innermost thoughts and feelings.<eos> If I don't tell Ben, how will I know the camera even exists?<eos> You could hide it at the bottom of your wardrobe. At the back.
It's about fucking time.<eos> Are our sessions cutting into your time at the track?<eos> - Let me tell you the problem.<eos> - Here's the problem: You said you'd record us. That was a year ago.<eos> When are you gonna record us?<eos> - Give me a hit.<eos> - I've given you 10 hits.<eos> They're all derivative.<eos> Find yourselves a name and a sound and then maybe we can make something happen.<eos> How do you know what's a hit until you get it out there?
I warned you.<eos> We fucked up.<eos> We fucked up, didn't we?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Can we talk?<eos> We stole the money.<eos> It was Breacher's idea.<eos> We thought it would make him happy.<eos> It was $10 million in cash.<eos> Went back for it that night, but when we got there, it was gone.
Drop the weapon, Lizzy!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Breach.<eos> You killed my team.<eos> Why, Lizzy?<eos> Because they stole my money! Huh!<eos> They fucking robbed me!<eos> After everything I put up with!<eos> It was my money and they took it, and I couldn't find it!
-I'll look into it.<eos> -Thank you. -My pleasure.<eos> Such a beautiful restaurant.<eos> -What's your problem?<eos> -Nothing, nothing...<eos> I was thirsty.<eos> What is it with you?<eos> I don't know what's the matter with me. I'm just very thirsty.<eos> Well, then pick up the glass!<eos> Stop pushing it off the table.
The poor child's heart gave out.<eos> Take the body upstairs, would you?<eos> No.<eos> Do not touch her.<eos> - She's gone to a better place.<eos> This was supposed to be a better place.<eos> It is nearly midnight.<eos> Someone.<eos> Fetch the champagne.<eos> Bring it here, quickly.
When a fighter steps between the ropes, he carries everything into the ring with him.<eos> And if his mind doesn't follow, neither does his heart.<eos> Marquez's corner thinks he's winning.<eos> Freddie Roach wants to see Pacquiao put this guy on his ass.<eos> And the crowd seems to think Marquez is winning.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, from the MGM Grand, we go to the scorecards after twelve World Championship rounds,<eos> the winner, by majority decision, and still WBO World Welterweight Champion of the World Manny "Pacman"<eos> Pacquiao!<eos> Be calm, because I promise you I'll bring the fight back in May... And we'll do it again.<eos> We'll do it again!
He saved your life today.<eos> Trust me. The maze is a dangerous place.<eos> We're trapped here, aren't we?<eos> For the moment.<eos> But... you see those guys?<eos> There, by the fire?<eos> Those are the runners.<eos> That guy in the middle there, that's Minho.<eos> He's the Keeper of the Runners.<eos> Every morning, when those doors open, they run the maze... mapping it, memorizing it, trying to find a way out.
- Yeah, I know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you mean, "you know"?<eos> Which part?<eos> About credit.<eos> My dad always said that about you. You don't collaborate well.<eos> He "always" said that?<eos> What's "always"?<eos> I don't know, twice.<eos> Remember that time I wanted to do that thing about the public school in the Bronx, and you were really excited about it until I suggested we do it together and then you... Then you just kind of dropped it.

I know. I was up all night.<eos> We'll be okay, Joshy. Don't you fret.<eos> Hey, well, maybe take a day or two, make sure you like it.<eos> Or I can take 10 years.<eos> I'm fucking with you, Joshy. Your thing is gonna be totally brilliant.<eos> I remember when this song was just considered bad.<eos> But it's working.<eos> Remember, he's lucky to have this opportunity.<eos> You're friggin' Josh Srebnick.<eos> My name sounds so much better when you say it.
And when I say awesome, I mean "hairs on my neck stand up" awesome.<eos> I wanted to say something to you earlier, but you look scary.<eos> - I'm glad that you liked it. - Yeah.<eos> I'm not blowing smoke.<eos> That song had something going on.<eos> I'm Quentin.<eos> Well, good to meet you, Quentin.<eos> Don't let the brain dead back there get to you.<eos> I mean, they... I'm here every week and they wouldn't know greatness if it...<eos> They just wouldn't know it. They wouldn't know it.
No, it's fine.<eos> Sam hates the name. - What?<eos> - No way.<eos> I don't hate the name.<eos> Man, I told you it was too artsy, bro.<eos> Don't blame me, I liked "The Old Man and the Three."<eos> Two, three, four...<eos> Let there be music and let there be thrills<eos> You don't like the silence and you never will<eos> So jump on the ride You can feel it inside
Guys, Ellie.<eos> Daniel is a manipulative idiot.<eos> - And Mikey has an orange dick.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Really, dude?<eos> That's really good to know.<eos> I brought scotch. I don't know if you guys drink scotch.<eos> She brought scotch?<eos> You should try it.<eos> Let's try it.
- Was it? - Glasses girl. - Was it?<eos> Wow. Mikey. It's the beginning of a beautiful roster, buddy.<eos> - Yeah, man. - I'm proud of you.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> - Thank you. - I'm also proud of you.<eos> Your phone is ringing.<eos> - Are you going to answer that?<eos> It might be a hot lonely girl looking to talk to me, but she has your number.<eos> - No. It's Ellie.<eos> - No, it's not. I can read it. It's right there on the bar.
Debbie, are you with us?<eos> - Did you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Where you going, Danny? Danny, what are you doing?<eos> Are you gonna go see your little fuck-buddy?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I'm serious, don't go. Okay?<eos> If you stay, I'll let you see the taint.<eos> - No.<eos> - I wanna show it to you.
Get the bag.<eos> - What's this?<eos> Listen to me. The food is vile.<eos> You hear me? The bitch cannot cook.<eos> Whatever you do, you do not swallow the fucking food.<eos> What you're gonna do is this.<eos> You wait till she not looking, spit it in the bag, get low.<eos> Put it in the fucking bag.<eos> After you do that, throw that shit in the trash.<eos> Do it fast, 'cause if the food eat through the bag, she'll smell it.
Hey up, cocker.<eos> Hey, I wanna buy that record.<eos> You know, the first one on Ray Henderson's tape.<eos> It says here, "Cover-Up".<eos> Is that the title?<eos> No, it's a cover-up.<eos> I'll come down.<eos> It's a cover-up, it's been covered up.<eos> Cover-up's where the DJ's hidden the title.<eos> He gets a piece of paper and it covers up the label, so no-one else can find it.
Who the fuck are you?<eos> You look nearly as good as me.<eos> Do I look all right?<eos> 50% Bruce Lee!<eos> Hey, I got this from Soul Bowl Records, Lou Pride.<eos> It's on the tape, from the all-nighter, Ray Henderson's set.<eos> I heard the first ten seconds or so of it.<eos> Now I've heard the whole thing.<eos> It's great!<eos> Do you want it?
I take it it wasn't for your singing.<eos> It's not working, is it?<eos> You're not getting any cooler.<eos> Here, let me try something.<eos> Come here.<eos> Actually, this isn't helping.<eos> Can you hear your heart?<eos> When the fever comes, it's about the only thing I can hear.<eos> When you crack your first safe, your heart beats so loud you can't hear the tumblers.<eos> You have to learn to quieten it, slow it down, so you can work between the beats.
She's not gonna knock me out of Dauntless.<eos> Look, she's gone from being the worst to one of the best.<eos> Somebody's gotta take her place at the bottom.<eos> Who's it gonna be?<eos> You.<eos> Do you ever stop talking?<eos> I just want to know how she does it.<eos> What's your trick?<eos> I don't have a trick.<eos> Nobody gets through it that fast.
You must miss the good old days, huh?<eos> Well, things aren't so bad.<eos> Food's a lot better.<eos> We used to boil everything.<eos> No polio is good.<eos> Internet, so helpful.<eos> I've been reading that a lot, trying to catch up.<eos> Marvin Gaye, 1972, Trouble Man soundtrack.<eos> Everything you missed jammed into one album.<eos> I'll put it on the list.
Zola's algorithm is a program for choosing<eos> You!<eos> A TV anchor in Cairo, the Under Secretary of Defence, a high school Valedictorian in Iowa City,<eos> Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange, anyone who's a threat to HYDRA.<eos> Now, or in the future.<eos> In the future?<eos> How could it know?<eos> How could it not?<eos> The 21st century is a digital book.<eos> Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.
People are gonna die, Buck.<eos> I can't let that happen.<eos> Please don't make me do this.<eos> Done.<eos> And it's trending.<eos> Unless you want a two-inch hole in your sternum,<eos> I'd put that gun down.<eos> That was armed the moment you pinned it on.<eos> Drop it!<eos> Drop it!
Many of which you seemed to have had a personal hand in telling.<eos> Agent, you should know that there are some on this committee who feel, given your service record, both for this country and against it, that you belong in a penitentiary.<eos> Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.<eos> You're not going to put me in a prison.<eos> You're not going to put any of us in a prison.<eos> You know why?<eos> Do enlighten us.<eos> Because you need us.<eos> Yes, the world is a vulnerable place, and yes, we help make it that way.<eos> But we're also the ones best qualified to defend it.
This is my choice, okay?<eos> - My choice... - Go! - Mine!<eos> Now how do we stop him?<eos> Okay, so he uses electric. He's like a battery.<eos> So what happens when you overcharge a battery?<eos> It explodes.<eos> - Right!<eos> So we use his power against him, perfect!<eos> Okay, I think I can reconnect the power line but what I need you to do, I need you to reset the system.<eos> Okay when I say you turn that power on, you turn it on. No matter what. Peter...
If I were to spare the life of this slave, what would it be worth to you?<eos> Senator?<eos> I believe you understand the question, my dear.<eos> I would be grateful for your mercy.<eos> Well...<eos> This is your lucky day, slave.<eos> The Lady Cassia has saved your life.<eos> Who owns this slave?<eos> I do, Senator.<eos> Then I suggest you punish it and then remove it.
Let me think about it.<eos> Seriously, let's get that reward.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Let's talk to the prisoner first.<eos> Not me.<eos> I'll go on my own then.<eos> Forget the guy in jail.<eos> We give Rat R$500... He'll take it.<eos> The game's not worth more.<eos> We rent it... 50 cents for 30 minutes.
How are you, Congressman?<eos> Good, everyone's here.<eos> Such generosity.<eos> Ok, let's make me Mayor.<eos> I love businessmen.<eos> They've covered all my election costs.<eos> Maybe I'll even throw the police a few bucks...<eos> No computer.<eos> Everything in my little book.<eos> Keep it safe.
You shouldn't have told him.<eos> Some cockroaches just don't give up.<eos> You crush them, crush them... and the bastard just won't die.<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> Raphael?<eos> Pull it out.<eos> Check it out.<eos> Go on.<eos> Here's your money.<eos> Put it back.
Now, a few weeks ago... I pitched you a game and you didn't listen.<eos> That really hurt my feelings.<eos> You were there.<eos> So were you.<eos> Now, I'm going to pitch my game again and you're going to hear me out... or I'm going to beat the shit out of everyone in this room.<eos> And I've fought women before.<eos> I didn't win... but I'm down to redeem myself.<eos> What if we made a game so visceral... that it made you feel like you were in real life danger?<eos> To feel like it's about to go down?<eos> Don't think of it as a game.

You're right. We didn't. We...<eos> We didn't know that she was a "she".<eos> - Are you okay, Mommy?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We lost a baby, sweetheart, just a few months before she was...<eos> Todd.<eos> That's our baby. That's our little girl.<eos> She's okay.<eos> I don't want to be late for school today and the phone's ringing!<eos> I'll get it.
- On the air?<eos> - Dad!<eos> Everybody here in Imperial followed the story of your son's sickness and people all over town were praying for his recovery.<eos> Now we're starting to hear of an amazing trip he took to heaven.<eos> Can you tell us about that?<eos> Come by Crossroads Wesleyan Church on Sunday.<eos> I'll tell you all about it.<eos> Here's my heart now<eos> Take and seal it<eos> Seal it for Thy courts above
Prosecutor "what happened next?" Masters "we locked target on the building..."<eos> "Warlord 2 instructed us to give an air-bust".<eos> "Then Lt. Craig's weapons jammed..."<eos> "and I delivered ordinance per order".<eos> You still focus on Warlord?<eos> No, the Air Burst.<eos> Why would you want bomb to explode before it hit the ground?<eos> To destroy the building.<eos> Exactly, but the bunker where we thought Rainmaker was hidden... would've been four stories down.<eos> Warlord didn't want to destroy it.
There.<eos> Command, we have visual on the Tribute Center.<eos> Initiating final approach.<eos> Masks on.<eos> See, I know all the depravity, the deceit and the cruelty of The Capitol's pampered elite.<eos> But the biggest secrets are about our good President, Coriolanus Snow.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Command, this is Team Leader. Prepare to deploy gas.<eos> We will confirm once inside.<eos> Such a young man when he rose to power. Such a clever one to keep it.
You made a sex tape and now you're tryin' to get it off my server.<eos> Daddy, can I pet the doggies?<eos> No, we can't pet these doggies.<eos> What are your freakin' names?<eos> - Annie and Jay?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> You the Annie that writes "Who's Yo Mommy?"<eos> - I love your blog.<eos> - You do?<eos> - I read it all the time. - That's so great.
Herr Mohr has compiled a report.<eos> Our investigations confirm that Issa Karpov is a member of a militant Salafi group of Chechen jihadists.<eos> Karpov was arrested soon after the capture of the group's leader earlier this year.<eos> Where did this information come from?<eos> We have excellent resources inside the Russian state security system.<eos> After 24 hours of questioning, Karpov confessed to taking part in attacks on gas pipelines, transport, infrastructure, police stations.<eos> After 24 hours of Russian questioning any one of us would admit to anything.<eos> Are you contesting this report?<eos> Maybe.<eos> We've not yet had the benefit of reading it.
Let me go!<eos> - Oh God!<eos> - No!<eos> Oh, No!<eos> "CABIN PRESSURE" "Oxygen Deployed..."<eos> Tom, put your mask on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on, Tom, breath!<eos> Tom, put it on!
"CABIN PRESSURE" "Oxygen Deployed..."<eos> Tom, put your mask on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on, Tom, breath!<eos> Tom, put it on!<eos> - Brad.<eos> - Grasp one.<eos> Here.<eos> Put it on for me.
Yet here I am again.<eos> Here's the deal.<eos> I could care less about your other investors.<eos> You reimburse my clients, I'll go back home to my family and leave you and your lovely wife alone.<eos> My wife has nothing to do with this.<eos> Look, why don't you and I go downstairs, have a drink, see if we can come to an arrangement?<eos> Unfortunately, I'm not authorised to negotiate with you.<eos> I'm just here for the money.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, well, let me go and get it.
- What the hell was that?<eos> - What was that?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Matt, hold on.<eos> Matt. Wait up.<eos> Don't go over there.<eos> Seriously, there's a fucking pig in your cabin?<eos> - Oh, hell, no, man.<eos> - We'll get it out and we'll just...
I'm trying, man.<eos> Move it!<eos> Fuck. Fuck.<eos> - Come on. Grab that shit.<eos> - Wait guys.<eos> Where is it?<eos> - I don't fucking know man.<eos> - That's Matt's bike.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - Do you see it?
- Come on. Grab that shit.<eos> - Wait guys.<eos> Where is it?<eos> - I don't fucking know man.<eos> - That's Matt's bike.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - Do you see it?<eos> - I can't see shit.<eos> - Check the other window.<eos> - Can you see it?
This is like Christmas.<eos> Hey, you know, I think the clay is stuck to my pubes.<eos> Why do you have pubes?<eos> Wait. You guys shaved?<eos> Dude, I texted you.<eos> I said, "Shave." I thought we were taking pictures.<eos> I cleaned up a little, but... Not your face.<eos> Shit. Don't worry about it.<eos> It's not gonna come off.<eos> I'm just gonna leave it on.
- Ex-fiancée.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It just happened.<eos> Sugar?<eos> Fresh lemon?<eos> She was cheating on me.<eos> That's got to hurt.<eos> The knowing is the tough part.<eos> The act itself, well, that's going to happen whether you know about it or not.
You've heard of this.<eos> You've seen this, right?<eos> - You know what that is. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Everyone knows.<eos> - No, no.<eos> What I'm saying is, you want to keep her alive.<eos> Don't do his work for him.<eos> I like your knife.<eos> I'm keeping it.
- Becca.<eos> Becca, I think Henry's a little scared.<eos> Maybe you can show him how it's done.<eos> Good girl.<eos> I'm sorry, am I in your way?<eos> Again?<eos> We are right up here.<eos> Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> As a reminder, all carry-on luggage must fit in the overhead bin or be safely stowed under the seat in front of you.<eos> If you're having trouble fitting your luggage, we'll be happy to check it for you.
Zack, this is Bill.<eos> Bill, Zack.<eos> We were just talking and Zack was telling me that he's a programmer for smart phones.<eos> Is that right?<eos> I'm interviewing at Paige in the morning for a software analytics position.<eos> Which, technically, isn't programming. But...<eos> Look, I'm sorry for being such an asshole earlier...<eos> Yeah, but you were a programmer, right?<eos> I was telling him that I keep losing my phone, and because I keep my ringer off...<eos> It'd be nice if there was a way to find it.
Did you try guessing?<eos> This is a transatlantic flight from New York to London, the airline now confirming this is, in fact, a hijacking in progress.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - I didn't do anything, I swear to God.<eos> I just was messing around with it.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> Open every bag in this cabin.<eos> And the horrific twist is that the hijacker is now believed to be the one person who was authorized to carry a gun onto the plane.<eos> You're looking for a package.<eos> You'll know if you find it.
And now, three people are dead.<eos> The bomb will explode in less than half an hour.<eos> Now, they want you to believe that I'm responsible.<eos> Everything you've heard about me is true.<eos> I've lost my family, my job.<eos> I'm an alcoholic.<eos> My daughter was diagnosed with acute leukemia at the age of five, and I spent my days at work instead of being at home, looking after her, because I was afraid of watching her die!<eos> I'm not a good father. I'm not a good man.<eos> I'm not hijacking this plane.<eos> I'm trying to save it!

You know, I was a daddy once to a little girl just like you, and when she was scared, you know what she'd do?<eos> She had a magic ribbon, very powerful.<eos> It'll protect you, just like your daddy.<eos> You wanna see it?<eos> I have it in my pocket.<eos> I carry it all the time.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Here.<eos> You wrap it around your hand, just like that.<eos> That's it, hold on to it now.
No!<eos> - Last one, grab your penis.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Turn them on like this.<eos> I love it.<eos> Hey, no, look, my balls won't light up.<eos> Oh, my God, that hat is too much.<eos> I mean it truly is the tiniest hat I've ever seen.<eos> It is, it's like suitable for a mouse.<eos> You need to wear it to your wedding.
I did some things.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> How do I know that you won't do something to me?<eos> Why would I do something to you?<eos> You're my family member, I'm yours. So.. One of us could still win, if we wanted to.<eos> Do you want to?<eos> Let's go.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Just getting my bag.<eos> - Mikey, just leave it.
Take a seat so that we may continue.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, as I was saying, you have six minutes to complete the task in front of you.<eos> Gentlemen and lady, begin.<eos> Six minutes.<eos> - Is that even possible?<eos> - No, it takes me eight.<eos> This isn't about crossword puzzles.<eos> It's about how one approaches solving an impossible problem.<eos> Do you tackle the whole thing at once or divide it into small...
And those of you who are married will know exactly what I mean.<eos> Maybe I'm naive but... I believe in fairy tales.<eos> I believe that they can exist if we really want them to, if we are prepared to work hard enough.<eos> I believe that the... that the world will not always be full of hatred and conflict if... if we're willing to sacrifice enough.<eos> And that is what... That is what Monaco means to me.<eos> And in a way that is why... That is why I am Monaco.<eos> I have no army, I... I wish ill on no one.<eos> I bear no resistance to aggression, I just... I'm here.<eos> I'm here doing what I do, trying to make a little difference in the world in the best way that I know how.<eos> But it wouldn't be real life, or it wouldn't be the fairy tale, if there wasn't someone trying to destroy it, or crush it, simply because it doesn't please them, or simply because they can.
Hey, all right.<eos> All right, that's good. Mmm...<eos> All right, all right, all right. Aw.<eos> Hey!<eos> Have you guys ever played "Funnel Nuts"?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You guys have had to play Funnel Nuts.<eos> This is the best game ever invented.<eos> Check it out, you take the funnel, you put it in the front of your pants like that, right?
So what does your cookie say?<eos> "You will have an amazing romance "with the person sitted across from you."<eos> It's a good thing I'm not your uncle.<eos> "And don't be concerned about the age difference.<eos> "Just shut up and make out.<eos> "It will all sort itself out later.<eos> You'll see!"<eos> That's ridiculously specific.<eos> Let me see that.<eos> If you don't eat it, it doesn't come true.
- Okay, let's just talk later.<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right<eos> - I'll see you around.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good talking to you.<eos> Hey, Eddie.<eos> Yeah!<eos> No, it's the best thing in the world, really.<eos> I only took the class because Dorothy was taking it.
- We just got along great, and...<eos> - What did you say?<eos> Nothing, I was... the phone.<eos> Did you figure it out?<eos> I wish I could describe it better.<eos> It was a chugging noise.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> What it is, is you got a crack in your manifold.<eos> They go on you.<eos> You need to replace it.
Hey, please.<eos> Porter.<eos> We may need your help.<eos> - Let's go, come on.<eos> You heard him, let's go.<eos> What can they do for us in the ER anyway?<eos> Dr Edwards has been working on a virus site.<eos> - A what?<eos> Virus killer.<eos> If we can make it to the CDC facility in time, they might be able to bind it.
Tammy, I'm terminating your employment at Topperjack's.<eos> You've gotta be shitting me.<eos> No, I'm terminating your employment.<eos> I need your badge.<eos> What ba...? You mean my name tag?<eos> - Yes, exactly. I need your badge back.<eos> - It's not a badge.<eos> It's a name tag, and you made me buy it with my own money.<eos> That's company policy.<eos> I need it back.
I didn't know how else to get that kind of money.<eos> And I was afraid if I didn't get you out of there something bad was gonna happen to you.<eos> And I just always screw stuff up, and I didn't wanna...<eos> - I didn't wanna screw that up.<eos> - Sweetie.<eos> My sweet, sweet, sweet girl.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Look at me.<eos> You have to take that money back.<eos> If you don't take it back, I'm gonna turn you in myself.
- You realize how much it clogs your veins...<eos> - Put it on.<eos> You're killing me.<eos> - All right.<eos> You have to argue about everything.<eos> That's kind of calming, actually.<eos> Just throw the money through the window and we'll get out of here.<eos> All right.<eos> Fine. Here we go.<eos> - God. No, I'm returning it.
Just throw the money through the window and we'll get out of here.<eos> All right.<eos> Fine. Here we go.<eos> - God. No, I'm returning it.<eos> - She's returning the money.<eos> - I'm returning the money to you.<eos> - I'm calling the police.<eos> No. We're gonna need more pies.<eos> I'm not robbing you.<eos> I'm giving it back.
- Shane, watch out! - Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> - Get cover!<eos> - Back up! Back!<eos> Back up!<eos> Autobots, fall back!<eos> - Come on, move!<eos> Out of my way! - Get out of the way! - Look out!<eos> - Just hit them! Just hit them!<eos> It's a big magnet!<eos> It's sucking up metal and dropping it!
- Any idea who may be?<eos> - To me, It's cops or soldiers.<eos> Veterans or still active.<eos> - How can you be sure?<eos> - Nine bodies, nine modified sockets.<eos> It's the sharp shot.<eos> These guys tended straight ambush.<eos> A assault tactic called "L formation".<eos> A group advance frontally on target<eos> And one walke by side to cover it. This rigor only learnt from the army.
Why not Eee Tee? You drink tea.<eos> Review Eee Tee.<eos> Are you on the Internet again?<eos> Eee Tee. Eee Tee.<eos> The game just goes on and on and on. I don't think there's an ending.<eos> The only objective I can think of is to rack the score up to 999,999.<eos> But no, it stops at 999,990.<eos> That is nine video game points you will never have.<eos> So, when does the game end?<eos> When you shut the fucker off and throw it out your window.
I'm sorry about that.<eos> Look, Herb, I, I just wanted to tell you there's gonna be a couple of changes. But my name is Nerd, Mr. Swann.<eos> My fucking father's name was Mr. Swann.<eos> Now one of the things we're gonna change is that you're gonna start wearing these.<eos> Yeah, let's see.<eos> Oh, that looks great.<eos> But more importantly, a shipment of War Duty 3000 came in today. And because you're the fucking expert, I was fucking wondering just off the top of my head, do you think we should put it in the front display?<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Bullshit!<eos> That's going in the front display, and it's your job to sell it.
Anyway, I was a rising star in their aerodynamics program, so they put me onto the ongoing top-secret Roswell project as their head reverse engineer.<eos> The UFO crashed there in 1947, right?<eos> When that sucker crashed in the desert, it broke up like one of those clay pigeons in Duck Hunt.<eos> There was metallic debris all over the desert. Or debriss.<eos> No, it's debris.<eos> Well, there's an s.<eos> Why isn't it pronounced debriss?<eos> A greater mystery than this.<eos> Anyway, the metal was like nothing on Earth.<eos> It was thin, almost identical to tinfoil, except that it reacted strangely when you played around with it, displaying strange magnetic properties.
Look what I found on the nightstand.<eos> These are phony prescription glasses with fake plastic lenses.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Okay, so why would she do this?<eos> To appear more nerdy.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> She's bait.<eos> I mean we'll all foolishly try to rescue her and get caught right in the trap.<eos> Oh, I feel like such a fool.<eos> The moment you share your joystick with a girl, they break it.
No! Bobby! Oh!<eos> Wait, but.<eos> Shoot these gamer geeks if they don't get out of your way.<eos> We might be too late.<eos> Alright, I'm going down there.<eos> Come on, Nintendo skills.<eos> Don't fail me now.<eos> Up, up, down, down, speed up, speed down.<eos> I'm gonna land the plane.<eos> I'm gonna land it.
I think I'm just in that limbo phase.<eos> It's not like your degree has instructions on it.<eos> Well... boom!<eos> Home run, twins win the world series!<eos> Well, your degree did say premed, so you would think something follows that.<eos> What was that?<eos> Hmm.<eos> So...<eos> Why did you major in premed if you didn't want to go into medicine?<eos> I always thought I'd change it, but then I graduated.
Okay, yeah, you do this thing where you stand up from the bed and you kind of turn halfway around and then you get undressed as fast as you can all at once and it's like you're getting ready for a physical or something.<eos> I have never had any complaints about how rapidly I undress.<eos> Most guys like naked me.<eos> I love naked you.<eos> Naked you is awesome to look at and touch.<eos> What I mean is that you could make the getting-naked-there part a little like...<eos> What's up?<eos> Boop.<eos> Then you take your bra off the side.<eos> You could even imaginary pole, just bring it, smack it.
Sorry I missed your band.<eos> Have you been working in a factory or what?<eos> No, I've been waitressing.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Come, come.<eos> What is this place?<eos> This is where I work sometimes.<eos> Wow, do you own this place?<eos> No, I don't own it, but I know where all the good stuff is.

Connor, you dozy little tit!<eos> - Wait, wait, wait.<eos> - Oh, man, my gums are numb.<eos> - This can't be right.<eos> - You flew, mate.<eos> You actually flew across the room.<eos> Sean...<eos> Look at his implant.<eos> - It's dead. - What?<eos> The shock must have turned it off.
You kids won't be so tough once you've had a few fingers broken.<eos> Moni, Moni, please, love. They're only kids.<eos> Oh!<eos> I'm looking for this man.<eos> It's my dad.<eos> Let's do a deal.<eos> You bloody geniuses.<eos> There is a God.<eos> We reckon it's something to do with the specific voltage created by the battery and the dodgy adapter.<eos> If only we had something to compare it with, - like a Taser or... - Oh!
Does anyone here know where he is?<eos> Sean's mother's very concerned.<eos> Sean!<eos> I've been so worried.<eos> I just wanna know you're okay.<eos> If you can hear me, Sean... Easy.<eos> Easy, now.<eos> Back off. He's mine.<eos> Hey, Mr. Smythe!<eos> Anyone says a word, I'll cut their liver out and feed it to the cats.
Why not kill myself?<eos> That's no way to go.<eos> For Ma Zouri, it's either kill or be killed.<eos> How can I shoot myself?<eos> Terrible aim!<eos> A breeze!<eos> I'm sorry, Wu-Six.<eos> And also Wu-Seven!<eos> He stole money from his father.<eos> Asked me to launder it.
- Let's roll.<eos> - We lost the wire. - Shit.<eos> Should we send in an unmarked?<eos> We can't risk it. We'll hold here.<eos> Howdy-do.<eos> - You go on this side. - Stop.<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> I do not need that sass-mouth. What I need is that sack of cash.<eos> Now, get it over here.<eos> Don't you throw it at me. You slide it.

- Vietnam.<eos> - You were there?<eos> - I think I'm imagining' it.<eos> All right, I'm gonna show you one thing, it's probably your best shot, if you do it right, ya can break the guy's nose.<eos> - Break his nose?<eos> - Relax, you're not gonna get it right.<eos> He's bigger than you, so you get down below him like this, you squat like this, this crouch, then you stand up really hard and you push all the way through your legs, all the way up, in your<eos> shoulders, your butt, everything pushes up, and you push all the way through that arm and you go WHACK right in the snoot.<eos> All right, try it on me.<eos> Okay, but ya gotta do it faster than that, right?
And the casting director not even calculates me.<eos> It goes without saying to me hello.<eos> And she told me that Garry didn apos; perhaps even expect it.<eos> C apos; Garry Marshall is not Bertolucci.<eos> His films are even more apos; silver.<eos> And I know Garry well.<eos> She told me that apos; they will shoot me.<eos> And I: "Sorry, but I need makeup."<eos> And she said:<eos> "Well, you do it or not?"
I just need to steam them, right?<eos> Don't forget to soak it in milk.<eos> Milk?<eos> Only if you plan to fry it.<eos> Haven't got that far.<eos> I like a man that doesn't pretend to know his way around the kitchen.<eos> Yeah, well, you're talking to the right guy.<eos> Yes...<eos> I think I am.<eos> Well, I'm soaking tuna in milk and thanks to you, frying it for my daughter.
And will you stop speaking in French? Or whatever language you are speaking.<eos> Well, if it weren't for us, you'd be speaking German.<eos> No.<eos> If it wasn't for you, I might be dead.<eos> But I would still be speaking French.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - So,<eos> - how can I help you steal our stolen art?<eos> - That's not why I'm here.<eos> - I'm here to help you get it back.
No, not these.<eos> This is all I have, James.<eos> This is my life.<eos> I understand.<eos> This is every piece of art that came through the Jeu de Paume.<eos> Now, I have kept train manifests, receipts, letters for every single piece.<eos> Who it belonged to, who took it, where they took it.<eos> I kept a colored mark here for every piece, to match this ledger.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> I'm giving it to you.
I know all about you guys.<eos> My sister was engaged to a SEAL.<eos> - Oh, was she? - Yeah. - Mm.<eos> Hold on, how you know all about us? What do you mean?<eos> What I mean is, you're a bunch of arrogant, self-centered pricks who think you can lie and cheat and do whatever the fuck you want.<eos> I'd never date a SEAL.<eos> Wait, why would you say I'm self-centered?<eos> I'd lay down my life for my country.<eos> Why?<eos> It's the greatest country on Earth. I'd do everything I can to protect it.
For Granny.<eos> Mother said not to stray Still, I suppose, a small delay<eos> Granny might like a fresh bouquet<eos> Goodbye, Mr. Wolf<eos> Goodbye, little girl<eos> And hello<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Get the cape!<eos> You frightened me!<eos> Get it, get it, get it, get it!
It takes two<eos> Stop m Stop my egg!<eos> Oh, brilliant!<eos> My Milky-White!<eos> I've missed you so much!<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> From the giant's hen.<eos> A golden egg!<eos> I've never seen a golden egg before.<eos> And you can have it, along with the five gold pieces.
Hey, uh, guys, I was just thinking, you know, I... haven't got to actually hold the, you know, the ship, before we did the thing, so can I do it?<eos> - You know, before it gets crazy?<eos> - Sure, but... it's not a ship. What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He told us it was a ship.<eos> It's a key to your ship, right?<eos> Well, if this is just the key, where's the spaceship?<eos> All right, Munch, put it down.<eos> Okay, dude, no, I got it, I got it.<eos> Okay, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you to put it down - before you hurt both of us.
I've written a blog on the varying tensile strengths of different natural fibres.<eos> I'm sure there's a crying need for that(!<eos> ) You said he was anxious?<eos> The bobble on the left side has been badly chewed, which shows he's a man of a nervous disposition, but...<eos> But also a creature of habit, because he hasn't chewed the bobble on the right.<eos> Precisely. A quick sniff of the offending bobble tells us all we need to know about the state of his breath.<eos> Brilliant!<eos> Elementary.<eos> But you've missed his isolation.<eos> I don't see it.
But if you want to talk, we can.<eos> Sure.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Or we can talk after.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on!<eos> No!<eos> Let me tag along for a drink.<eos> You said I'd like it.
Great.<eos> Pleasure to meet you...<eos> Zoe.<eos> Oh, can I call you "Zoe"?<eos> Call me Zoe.<eos> Okay.<eos> Meeting Quinton Canosa just made me realize how much I missed excitement in my life.<eos> And did you act out on that feeling?<eos> I sure did.<eos> I tried to relive it with Jason.
And it couldn't be more relevant than it is today.<eos> Intelligent machines will soon allow us... to conquer our most intractable challenges.<eos> Not merely to cure disease, but to end poverty and hunger.<eos> To heal the planet.<eos> And build a better future for all of us.<eos> I don't know anybody who is doing more to make that future a reality... than our next speaker.<eos> But then again, I'm probably biased.<eos> Please welcome my partner in science and in life... Dr. Will Caster.<eos> My wife has always been eager to change the world.<eos> But I'll just settle for understanding it first.
You want to save her or not?<eos> - We have her location: 4550 San Pablo.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Hey. Don't touch her.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Don't touch her!<eos> Shit.<eos> I have to get you online now.<eos> Can you see the satellite software?<eos> I see it.
I can heal her body, Max.<eos> Or I can upload the virus, but there's not enough time for both.<eos> There's not enough power.<eos> No, Will, please.<eos> Please, listen to me, Will.<eos> He can't die because of what we've done.<eos> I can see everything.<eos> Look at the sky.<eos> The clouds.<eos> We're healing the ecosystem, not harming it.
Kill him.<eos> Here, take this.<eos> Try and give the master of the game a better game, Jack.<eos> Jesus, Jack!<eos> You passed the Lizard and Sheriff tests, but I'm out of your league, Jack.<eos> I see you haven't read Sunzi'sArt of War.<eos> Shot ya.<eos> What's in the bag?<eos> It was a gift.<eos> You were just too blind to see it.
I see you haven't read Sunzi'sArt of War.<eos> Shot ya.<eos> What's in the bag?<eos> It was a gift.<eos> You were just too blind to see it.<eos> What's in the fucking bag?<eos> Oh, shut up.<eos> What's gonna happen now is you're gonna throw your gun over here.<eos> I'm gonna throw my gun over there?<eos> The motel, my motel, is rigged with enough C4 to wipe it off the face of the Earth.
- Because this is a sports town.<eos> - And I want Sonny Weaver to know...<eos> Sonny, I hope you're listening. You better be.<eos> Can you please do somethin' tonight to turn this thing around?<eos> Otherwise, you will be gone.<eos> Hello?<eos> Good morning, Mr. Sonny Weaver Jr.<eos> It's your number one fan, Vontae Mack.<eos> Vontae, how'd you get this number?<eos> You gave it to me. At the Combine.
Yeah, they do.<eos> They win. A lot.<eos> I had my choice of teams to coach, Sonny, and I chose this team, okay?<eos> I chose to coach this team.<eos> Not the team you're puttin' together in your head, on the fly 'cause your old man died last week and you're tapping one of your execs.<eos> What did you just say?<eos> I'm sorry. Is that supposed to be a secret?<eos> You know, around here, we called my "old man" Coach Weaver.<eos> And yes, my father died last week.<eos> So the next time you refer to his name, next time you say it, at least, in front of me, you say it with some goddamn reverence, because he earned it.
We need to update our file on the Pamona case.<eos> Per our conversation this morning, I finally convinced Munson to get off the dime.<eos> He's agreed to extend an offered settlement to the amount of 1.5, structured over three years.<eos> First payment due at signing.<eos> Tell him we'll agree to it.<eos> If he tries to counter, shut him down.<eos> I need the Amato file.<eos> Here.<eos> Give this to Murray and get it back to me.<eos> He's got to initial it by noon today.
Aphrodite!<eos> Another Dimension!<eos> Saori! Seiya is...<eos> - SaorN?<eos> - Miss!<eos> The time... has come.<eos> Aphrodite.-.!<eos> Look!<eos> That monster's going to wreck Sanctuary if we don't stop it!<eos> We must keep it away from Athena!
Now you're just pissing me off.<eos> Somebody been threatening you, Father?<eos> What have you been up to now?<eos> If not you, who else?<eos> - What did you say you wanted it for?<eos> - I didn't say.<eos> I'd say you wanted it for your dog.<eos> The dog's dying.<eos> It's in pain.<eos> You're worried you might have to put it out of its misery one of these days.

The silent projects were last semester.<eos> You were supposed to e-mail me your sound treatment over the summer.<eos> I have radio, BSU, now this Head of House thing.<eos> Okay, do you want this?<eos> Look, this thing might as well be my right hand.<eos> I was busy this summer.<eos> Your peers are out getting internships, making short films.<eos> My dad was sick.<eos> I had to go home.<eos> If you need time, take it.
By any means necessary?<eos> Someone once told me that<eos> Winchester was like jazz.<eos> Now I don't know much about jazz, but from what I can tell, when your solo is up, you better blow.<eos> You want to hear something strange?<eos> The Pastiche group page hadn't been used for months until the invite went out.<eos> Why am I even here?<eos> What's interesting is how easy it was to access the group page.<eos> The password was "pastiche" spelled with a dollar sign according to Kurt, but it seems it's recently been changed.<eos> I couldn't figure it out at first.
Then after all of that, your son throws a blackface party.<eos> Now if you thought you were having trouble finding money before, just wait until cable news gets their hands on this story.<eos> I mean, Bill Maher is going to fuck you up.<eos> You know, I've heard enough.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Look, the point is from where I'm sitting, this place is a gold mine.<eos> What?<eos> We still need the stuff that leads up to the party.<eos> That happened already.<eos> Well yeah, we can re-enact it.
Oh, yes, you are fine.<eos> I think she likes you.<eos> No, Dom, we can see when the wheels are turning, man.<eos> Come on, outwith it.<eos> Chef Cotillard offered me a job.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - The Chef offered him a gig.<eos> That's huge, Dom!<eos> - That's a celebration right there.<eos> - Especially if I take it.
Guys, the first three places add up to $50,000.<eos> - We can do this, guys.<eos> - We?<eos> Come on, Ced. That's all right.<eos> You've been drinking.<eos> No, Dom, I'm not tripping.<eos> This has got nothing to do with drinking.<eos> - You're fishing.<eos> - Zeke, you owe me!<eos> If I ask you to take your little black ass out there and shake it, you, out of all people here, are gonna shake it!
You score by understanding that you can't move forward until you both let go of the past.<eos> You hear that, Gail?<eos> Let the shit go!<eos> Michael?<eos> I am looking for my son.<eos> He's down at the concierge, still looking for venues.<eos> You know, Candace, maybe this is for the best.<eos> Sometimes we have to read the signs in our lives.<eos> Now if you really loved my son you'd go back there, finish packing and set him free.<eos> I am ending this conversation right now, Miss Loretta, because if I say another word, we will both regret it.
And I said, "Mike, after all these hours of sitting in that room "and concentrating, I just found out that I'm really a psychic!"<eos> I think I promptly threw him up against the wall at that point and wanted to know, and it turned out it was a very simple deception.<eos> Shortly after that hallway conversation, both of us could magically make the rotor move any direction that we wanted to, and the MacLab personnel never caught on.<eos> I don't believe they're tricking us, especially based on the research that we've done in the last year, where we have exerted as tight a control condition as we could think of, even in consultation with magicians,<eos> to see if the influence holds up.<eos> And we have found evidence that it does, not as strongly under these controlled conditions.<eos> It's as if somehow, the extra controls seem to inhibit it, but still an effect persists.<eos> Over the course of Alpha, the controls did get significantly tougher and the tighter the controls got, the lower the results got, but their faith in us never diminished.<eos> We do not claim that this tape provides incontrovertible evidence of PK.<eos> We regard it rather as a provisional tape, imperfect, but still with much to offer.
Who knows how to teach kids to become honorable, accountable men... with self-worth?<eos> Bob, you do it and I've watched you do it brilliantly since I was 23 years old.<eos> I wouldn't be helping anyone.<eos> I mean, shouldn't it be easier? Don't you deserve that?<eos> I've seen the schedule for college coaches.<eos> You think it'd be easier, less grueling? It would not.<eos> You don't know. How do you know?<eos> I just want you happy and healthy... and yeah, home every once in a while, just playing football with your own kids. Going for a stupid walk for hot chocolate... maybe more than, you know, twice a decade.<eos> You... You're gonna get your record, bro.<eos> Even if Mickey has to steal it.
- Laurie, stop.<eos> Forty-one blast. Run it, now.<eos> - Dad, it's midnight. I'm tired.<eos> - So am I.<eos> - Forty-one blast.<eos> Run it, now.<eos> - You run it.<eos> You listen close.<eos> I want that record.<eos> He's not gonna get it for you with a busted rib.
Long Beach Poly has pulled within four points of De La Salle, 21-17.<eos> You need water?<eos> Move.<eos> Open that window, man.<eos> Water!<eos> Where's that ice bucket?<eos> Here, give me that.<eos> Give it to him.<eos> All right.<eos> - Take it. Put it on the neck. - Yeah, yeah.
Is that where you live now?<eos> Yeah, for now.<eos> I'm staying with my girlfriend.<eos> - I got a girlfriend now. - Oh.<eos> I think you'd like her.<eos> I'd like you to meet her sometime. Hmm?<eos> - I had a scorpion in the house.<eos> - Did you?<eos> Yeah, but it was entirely my fault.<eos> I mean, I should've seen it sooner.
Which means we are on one of these two ridges or we'd be crushed, right?<eos> If we're on this ridge, we must be right next to the U-boat.<eos> Now, this submarine was based on the U-boat design.<eos> So we find the U-boat, we get in there and we take the drive shaft.<eos> Been in the water for 70 years.<eos> Useless now.<eos> No. No, the Black Sea's anoxic at depth.<eos> No oxygen. No decay.<eos> There's perfectly preserved Roman galleons out there.<eos> Look, when we get in there, we'll get the drive shaft, we'll machine it and then we'll put it into the engine.

We're heading right for that drop.<eos> - Fraser, we need to stop.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Robinson, get rid of the gold.<eos> Can you keep it coming, Fraser?<eos> Yes, we can.<eos> We need to keep moving or we'll never get it started again.<eos> We'd lose everything.<eos> Pull it round to the left.<eos> - Pull it.
Respect?<eos> That doesn't mean shit to them.<eos> That ain't new.<eos> We faced punks like that more times than I care to remember.<eos> Trust me, they don't last.<eos> And when it's your turn to take the reins, you'll see for yourself.<eos> They'll burn and fall in front of you just like they did for your father.<eos> That same fire is in you.<eos> I've seen it ever since you were a child.<eos> Don't ever lose it.

Mr. Collings.<eos> Fuck.<eos> The missing persons case of Amy Elliott Dunne.<eos> She is the beautiful blonde inspiration for the amazing Amy kids' book series.<eos> You're reading that diary again?<eos> You know how it ends.<eos> It interests me.<eos> Hey, Rhonda.<eos> "He's gonna kill me." The end.<eos> Why did he go to his dad's house to burn it?
How long do you think until it's done?<eos> Not long.<eos> Six months for the trial.<eos> Sentencing will be quick.<eos> He'll appeal.<eos> I can watch the rest overseas.<eos> Go slowly.<eos> But I want it.<eos> Don't rush.<eos> Just do it.
And then all we did was resent each other, and try to control each other.<eos> And cause each other pain.<eos> That's marriage.<eos> Now, I'm getting ready.<eos> I can't watch you play house with that thing for the next 18 years.<eos> I can't just walk away.<eos> You could get custody.<eos> No, I won't. And you know it.<eos> It's gonna be my child.<eos> I'm not gonna leave it.
But I can only do that if I can give my client what he wants.<eos> I'll put 300,000 euros in your name in an ING bank account.<eos> I don't want any money.<eos> Nevertheless, it'll be there for you. Always.<eos> What if I told you to go fuck yourself?<eos> Then I'd go ahead and break Isabelle's heart.<eos> I would.<eos> You know how much that place means to her?<eos> She said she wouldn't let anyone touch it for as long as she lives.<eos> And still you want to destroy it?
I have to.<eos> I want her to know who I really am.<eos> I want to make things right again.<eos> Then get my bird back.<eos> That's the one thing I can't do.<eos> I didn't touch the money, you know.<eos> I know.<eos> So what's the problem?<eos> Go and tell that Arabic bastard that he has no right to keep my bird.<eos> He forced me into selling it.
Where there's a lot of greed, there's plenty of mistakes.<eos> No!<eos> You see, I didn't know anything.<eos> They set me up.<eos> They ruined my plan.<eos> Plan?<eos> Your plan is going to end up the same way as Karl's.<eos> Where is the money?<eos> It was in here.<eos> I wanted to give it back to you.
My friends will be here soon!<eos> Now, lights out!<eos> Turn them back on!<eos> I can't see anything.<eos> You have to wait until I'm, like, out of the hallway.<eos> It's figure of speech.<eos> Okay.<eos> It seems that Blood's key is hidden in a marble bust of his accomplice, Godfrey the Unknown, which is kept in the Statue Room at the Prado Museum.<eos> Perfect.<eos> We break in, steal the bust, destroy it and grab key.
Finally!<eos> Do you have evidence to frame the bear?<eos> Excellent.<eos> Where are the guards?<eos> Stay here.<eos> I'm going to check on the vault.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Colonel Blood's locket.<eos> Of course.<eos> Now grab it.
Jordan, what the fuck is going on, man?<eos> Something's fucking up the camera.<eos> I can't see shit.<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Michael, are you okay?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> She's got a knife.<eos> Get that fucking knife off of him!<eos> Get it off of him!
- No!<eos> You can't. - I'm always there.<eos> - You can't have this body.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Kill me!<eos> Fuck.<eos> Here we go.<eos> These cameras, this film... it's proof.<eos> I hope someone finds it and uses it to show others.
We won't call it San Zhong Tian anymore, call it Qi Zhong Tian.<eos> Any objection?<eos> Any?<eos> You also don't object, do you?<eos> Jie Zhang Zi, why are you still here?<eos> Great, do me a favour!<eos> Inform this news.<eos> Shanghai, a half of it is mine the rest is you three.<eos> This street is our frontier, the area near the sea is mine.<eos> The rest belong to you three and share it yourself.
Sister Kut Er, let's see.<eos> This is fireworks that father bought for me.<eos> Sister Kut Er.<eos> Brother Ma, come here.<eos> Brother Ma, please sit down.<eos> - Brother Ma.<eos> - What is this?<eos> Brother Ma, I'm sure you don't know that, the Dong Yang tea pack in depot today, are actually opium.<eos> Brother Ma, this pack is cost 600-700 dollars.<eos> Give it back for them.
- Daddy.<eos> - Are you OK?<eos> Is this pack worth 1 human life.<eos> Of course, even killing all people in that fucking whole is still not enough.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What should we do, Captain Huang?<eos> Captain, let's see.<eos> Mr.Tang, please pass on Mr.Shinji. We can't give this lot of opium to you.<eos> Sorry, Mr.Shinji. Bureau of Investigation said they can't give the goods back to you.<eos> What if we keep on getting it back?
- Okay, sweetie?<eos> - Eww, no, no, no.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's a touching family reunion, but my life is at stake here!<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> Stop!<eos> Don't touch the body.<eos> You should be letting me touch it.
You say one more unkind word about my son and I'll make sure you can't say another.<eos> 50!<eos> 50 feet!<eos> If he comes within 50 feet of her, he's gonna be arrested, and I'll sue you for everything you've got.<eos> I've lost a child.<eos> I'm not losing another.<eos> Not for you or your lowlife son.<eos> You shouldn't be here, Jade.<eos> I know, but I just wanted to say goodbye and his cell phone isn't working.<eos> That's 'cause I took it away from him.
Sam's just like his dad was.<eos> Always speaks his mind.<eos> Well, parties are lots of fun, especially when they're yours.<eos> My cousin's not coming because I broke her nose in two places.<eos> I'll take that for you.<eos> Good shot.<eos> Look, there's another one!<eos> Where's your bowl?<eos> You've got a lot today.<eos> Am I ever gonna see it?
What's with the shrine here, man?<eos> It's just there's so many people from before.<eos> There's Jill from my soccer team.<eos> My best friend, Karen.<eos> Albert.<eos> And now that I can't see my mum anymore I need... new experiences.<eos> I need to feel inspired.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Do you remember that story I told you about the trophy?<eos> About the moment I skated over to my mother and handed it to her?
They're at a diner on Route 15.<eos> You been watching a lot of movies, lately, Matthew?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> These people have my daughter.<eos> I've seen her. I've been...<eos> I've been with her.<eos> She's alive.<eos> Hey. I need you to listen to me very carefully.<eos> I have a phone and the phone has GPS.<eos> I'm gonna plant it on their car.
Where's Nicole?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Where, where, where?<eos> A van.<eos> Where she had her fourteenth birthday<eos> Fourteenth birthday?<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Where's the van, man?<eos> Where is it?<eos> You know we're gonna find it, now tell us!
It'll mean so much.<eos> You know Jay's coming.<eos> He's supposed to be here for dinner but he's bringing a guest.<eos> I guess he needed a ride.<eos> You know Jay.<eos> At least he has a new girlfriend.<eos> He seems rather happy.<eos> The drink always goes on the right side.<eos> This is the incorrect side or the left side.<eos> Put it on the right side.
Do you think a kitty hurt it?<eos> Baby birds fall or... and sometimes they get pushed from their nest.<eos> Why?<eos> To learn to fly.<eos> That's mean.<eos> No, it's normal.<eos> And if it's feathered, it's a fledgling and has left the nest on its own.<eos> Then you leave it where you found it.<eos> If it's unfeathered, then you look for a nest.<eos> And if you find it, you can bring it home.
Of how may I be of service?<eos> Of no service.<eos> I... I hoped you might accompany me on a walk.<eos> A walk?<eos> It's a lovely day.<eos> I have a gift for you.<eos> - I can't accept.<eos> - It's a trifle.<eos> A relic from my days in Paris.<eos> Take it.
I imagined that this would be the happiest time in my life, but the calm here in which we live is not what I dreamt of.<eos> One after another, the days come, always the same, bringing nothing.<eos> Is this the will of God?<eos> Is my future just a dark corridor with a bolted door at the end?<eos> Always in a book, dear.<eos> You'll strain your eyes.<eos> This book is fascinating.<eos> It's about the Orient.<eos> Their manner of dress, the rituals, even their medicine.<eos> I could read it to you.
you get me my remote and then go to your family.<eos> Oh god save me.<eos> there is a God above you?<eos> Om namah shivaya where is he?<eos> Save me!<eos> Somebody help!<eos> I was in the himalaya..meditating ..then suddenly i see light, from this small object on the ground.<eos> I closed my eyes thought about God, and i got enlighted.<eos> this object was so hot even in a very cold weather.<eos> God confirmed its the broken piece of lord shiva's pellet drum. embrace it.

- No not mine.<eos> Pk. that's his.<eos> whatever you want to ask, ask him.<eos> come.<eos> what's this?<eos> its condom.<eos> what's it use?<eos> it controls world population.<eos> how?<eos> by putting it on. ..while having sex.

Daisy, it's me. It's Jay.<eos> - There's no flusher.<eos> - She's a first-time flyer.<eos> There is, honey.<eos> It's just a little different than usual. You see the button in the wall above the seat?<eos> It's actually a lever.<eos> - Yeah, push that.<eos> - It says "flush" right on it.<eos> But the letters are worn off.<eos> Anyway, just push it.
Which sometimes comes with age... but also can happen when yöu're yöung, like in yöur case.<eos> yöu could be wise and yöung, which is kind of a rare combination... but thrilling when it happens.<eos> - Be quiet. - Thank yöu, sir.<eos> It's time to shake that city off of yöu.<eos> yöu need to learn the basics of jungle survival.<eos> I thought we were going sightseeing.<eos> It's training day.<eos> The mud is yöur friend.<eos> This is yöur camouflage!<eos> Feel it. Taste it!
You'll go there every day after school, starting tomorrow.<eos> Keep up a passing grade average and you could walk outta here having earned a diploma.<eos> You have an opportunity here, Michael.<eos> And we are willing to help you.<eos> But only if you're willing to help yourself.<eos> No shoes on the floor.<eos> Michael, right?<eos> Yeah. Yeah. You look like him.<eos> This is the main Dojo floor.<eos> The only time you'll be on it is when you're cleaning it.
Yeah. Dinner's good.<eos> Good night.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Just thought I'd come a little bit early.<eos> You think I'm gonna let you teach the kids looking like that? I had an accident.<eos> Honor.<eos> Respect.<eos> That's what this is all about, right?<eos> Well, I thought forgiveness was a part of it, too.<eos> Not if you take advantage of it.
For what?<eos> Last night.<eos> I was out of order.<eos> You were.<eos> This girl, Christine Falls.<eos> I got her back from the morgue and I did a PM on her.<eos> You lied to me, Mal.<eos> Pulmonary embolism?<eos> You could've come up with something better than that.<eos> And you weren't looking up her file, you were signing her death certificate with your left hand, to disguise it.
-May I?<eos> -Please.<eos> So Christine, how do you like your new home?<eos> She says she likes it very much indeed!<eos> Well, ain't that fine and dandy!<eos> You know what, Mrs. Stafford?<eos> It's OK! Baby says she wants to go down for a little shut-eye.<eos> Know what I'm saying?<eos> Andy - not now.<eos> You want it as much as I do.
Go!<eos> I'm gonna get the monster, I promise.<eos> There we go.<eos> - You got it? - Yeah.
I'm just using you for grades!<eos> Oh, really...<eos> Well, use me properly!<eos> "My heart is at odds with my head"<eos> "How did love sneak in and catch us unawares?"<eos> "A little bit of a rascal"<eos> "But kind of helpless, too"<eos> "Love's a devil"<eos> "But a lovable devil, it is"<eos> Should I chase it away?"

They knew things they could not have known.<eos> So, tell me, who's Marvin?<eos> What?<eos> Marvin.<eos> The name Jane mentioned to you.<eos> Perhaps another time.<eos> You play pool?<eos> Sure.<eos> You know, I think it's no accident that you're the man who discovered these messages.<eos> You seem to either be attracting evil, or you're uniquely able to detect it.

Is it funny or more romantic?<eos> I'm not allowed to answer that kind of question, ma'am.<eos> You'll see.<eos> Can you move along, please. You're holding up the line.<eos> Excuse me. When does this movie come out?<eos> Waves?<eos> It's already out, sir.<eos> It's playing now.<eos> Can you move aside please, you're blocking the other customers.<eos> We're gonna change the tickets because we're going to watch it instead.
Yes.<eos> It's alright. It's good.<eos> Doesn't matter. Can we change the tickets?<eos> As you wish.<eos> Please move along.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry. Listen to me, you can't watch this.<eos> This film doesn't exist yet.<eos> I am the director, It's my film.<eos> I just finished the script and you can't watch it now.
Good.<eos> You're very kind to do this for me, William.<eos> I don't have the will to end it on my own.<eos> I know what it's like with kind men.<eos> You give, console and offer oceans of sympathy.<eos> And the girl soon finds she has this great debt of goodness that finally needs to be rewarded.<eos> And you get what you wanted all along.<eos> On the whole, women prefer to be seized and taken, not have their resistance worn dovm.<eos> Oh, William, I do like you.<eos> If I got my body back, I would probably give it to you.
Preparations continue and the Golden Coach has been put through its paces up and down The Mall.<eos> So, where did you get that beautiful sports car, Percy?<eos> - I stole it.<eos> But I'll return it before the owner gets back.<eos> Percy has no conscience.<eos> It's supposed to prick you, but it never does... - What? - But it never does.<eos> Don't you feel even a twinge of guilt about the owner?<eos> God, no.<eos> I rather resent him.<eos> The tank was nearly empty and I had to fill it up with my own money.
Not quite entirely resolved.<eos> A page was torn from the log with the Urca's course and schedule written on it.<eos> Now I could recreate it from what's left, but I'd need help.<eos> Someone with expert knowledge of Spanish operations.<eos> Your man in Havana.<eos> I need you to make an introduction.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Five million Spanish dollars.<eos> When I take that ship, you stand to gain...<eos> When you take it?
Well, you know if you don't move forward you fall backwards into a river of shit.<eos> So Anyway, rather than getting angry and pissing away my entire future<eos> I knew I just had to get on with my life.<eos> So I changed my name and came to New York.<eos> I got by as a fry cook but the hours were long and the money was horseshit.<eos> So I bought a typewriter and set myself up as a public stenographer.<eos> What a laugh.<eos> In four months I typed six letters and one manuscript.<eos> The manuscript was for Real Life Tales and a total waste of paper.<eos> But the jerk who wrote it, sold it.
Before I proposed to Tiffany, I wanted to run it by my buddies that I play ball with at the local playground.<eos> They always tell it like it is.<eos> Basketball, basketball, basketball...<eos> Hey, guys. Looks like our buddy Joel here is finally gettin' ready to pop the question.<eos> Pretty great, right? Hey, don't ask me. I can hardly commit to a second date half the time.<eos> If you know what I mean!<eos> Watch out!<eos> Swish!<eos> I think love is really abstract, you know?<eos> It's like a summer breeze. You can't see it, but you can feel it.
You know what, Jake?<eos> I've had it up to here with your little comments.<eos> You've got a bone to pick with me, then spit it out.<eos> What?<eos> Is this about rent, Joel?<eos> Because you can have your stupid money.<eos> No. It's not about money, Jake.<eos> It's never been about money!<eos> But you know what?<eos> If you have a little rent, then, sure, I'd gladly take it!
We're not at a gay parade!<eos> The butcher called.<eos> Why?<eos> He was wondering what you need all the meat for.<eos> It's part of my strategy.<eos> Be honest with me.<eos> Are you making friends with a wolf?<eos> Is that your strategy?<eos> I just keep it away from the houses.<eos> And what happens if you stop feeding it?
Silent.<eos> Did you forget who I am, huh?<eos> Mira!<eos> Mira don't!<eos> Don't do it!<eos> - I want him to die.<eos> - He will.<eos> But once he tells the world what he did.<eos> Where's your phone?<eos> Get it. Go get it, now!
Yeah. Just now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I clicked record before I had a chance to position the camera.<eos> - Oh, that's OK.<eos> - And I mixed two questions into one.<eos> That's OK.<eos> By the way, where are you right now?<eos> I'm here, at the hotel.<eos> But the convention is happening right now.<eos> - I know. I'm watching it.

I'm watching it.<eos> - Aren't you at your hotel?<eos> I'm watching it on my laptop.
What?<eos> No, I thought I was supposed to wait here.<eos> - Cancelled?<eos> - One second.<eos> I think we have another question.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Back there?<eos> OK, so, hi, Jill.<eos> Just wanted to say this latest part of the saga looks great.<eos> Can't wait to see it.
Now.<eos> All this stuff...<eos> you put it here. Why?<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Grab your laptop and get out of there.<eos> What about my stuff?<eos> Come on, Nick, grab your laptop and get out of there.<eos> Don't shut it, you idiot!<eos> I need to guide you so nobody will see you.<eos> Keep it on.
Can I ask you for something?<eos> We're doing an equipment check.<eos> Would you mind turning up the volume on your television?<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Leave the room.<eos> Now.<eos> Great.<eos> The elevator's right there.<eos> Take it to the garage.
Remember the trick I played on Jill's cell phone?<eos> Well, it's even easier to do it with her computer.<eos> She's in the apartment they rent for her.<eos> She has no idea her webcam is on.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Her computer.<eos> From inside.<eos> I uploaded a file to your desktop.<eos> The red rectangle...<eos> I want you to drag it to her windows.
Good.<eos> That wasn't so hard now, was it?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> No.<eos> Chord!<eos> Jesus, Chord!<eos> If she puts down the phone, I'll turn off the juice.<eos> Tell her.<eos> Write it in the text window.<eos> If she picks it up, Tony's mouth will never be the same again.
Who the fuck did?<eos> One second.<eos> Assault team, we've got all the exits covered.<eos> Green light.<eos> Green light.<eos> It doesn't seem like the subjects can hear us.<eos> What is he doing?<eos> Hold on. Wait!<eos> What looks like a hunting knife.<eos> He's holding it up at eye level.
Turn in.<eos> Stop!<eos> We lost him?<eos> We lost Chord?<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> We don't have a chance unless he keeps flipping trucks over.<eos> We can't trace him and we don't know what kind of hardware he's carrying.<eos> What's that?<eos> My website.<eos> Chord is controlling it. I'll do anything you say, OK?
- What are you doing?<eos> The feed from all the cameras, they can be generated as one signal if we cross the frequency.<eos> OK, you can see it, right?<eos> When the ping-pongs are closed together, they can build a real-time 3D model like this.<eos> It's a bag.<eos> All the cameras are inside of the bag.<eos> From the shape of the bag, it could be lying inside a trunk.<eos> - Hold on!<eos> - What?<eos> Put it back like it was before, when you could see the bottom.
- How?<eos> - Just keep your voice down.<eos> - I'm in the trunk. My hands are tied.<eos> - We're following your car.<eos> - Where is he taking me?<eos> Jill, listen to me.<eos> There's a knife in the bag.<eos> What?<eos> There's a knife in the bag.<eos> You can reach your hand in there and take it out.
I've been watching you for a long time.<eos> I know you better than anyone.<eos> And I know what everybody was doing to you.<eos> When people see this, I don't want them to see me tied up like this.<eos> I want them to see me walk out of here on my own two feet.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Listen to me, please!<eos> Point the gun at me!<eos> Point it... point it at me as I go in!
- I'm Emma.<eos> - And I'm Gloria!<eos> - I'm Clarissa.<eos> - Ambrose McKinley.<eos> Mr. McKinley, is there anything we can do to help?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> - Did you bring cake?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes we did!<eos> And where would you like us to put it?
What you want a gun for, old man?<eos> Guns I got.<eos> I need ammo.<eos> I know a guy.<eos> Uptown.<eos> Westmark.<eos> That's the name of the shop.<eos> Can you write it down for me?<eos> Will, he still has all that cash with him.<eos> What if he loses it?
Pops!<eos> Hold on!<eos> What?<eos> - Pops.<eos> - What?<eos> Hey.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I need to get that cash from you.<eos> What for?<eos> I want to deposit it in a bank, okay?
Kim's always pointing out how predictable I am.<eos> That's funny coming from her.<eos> You wanna talk about predictable?<eos> - I'm not predictable! - Oh, come on.<eos> Every single day... she goes to the same exact store, right off campus, every morning before class... and gets the same peach yogurt drink.<eos> Stop.<eos> The fourth one from the back.<eos> Not the fifth one, not the third one.<eos> The fourth one will stay cold, but not too cold.<eos> That way, when she's drinking it, uh, as a snack in between classes--
- A puppy? - Yeah.<eos> I was thinking about getting a puppy.<eos> From where?<eos> My friend found one behind her building... and we were trying to find it a home... we put it on Facebook, but nobody claimed it yet, so...<eos> You wanna know what I think?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, it's a lot of work.<eos> It's a lot of responsibility.<eos> With your lifestyle the way it is at the moment, with college.<eos> With a puppy you have to be there all the time and feed it, walk it.
- You're a lying piece of shit.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> You killed her!<eos> I know--<eos> You shut up!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Brooks.<eos> I want the full work-up on a black Porsche, license plate number 6-8-9-M-J-C-6.<eos> Okay.<eos> Connect me to the Porsche phone and trace it.
How much am I worth, huh?<eos> What is it, 2,000?<eos> Well, that's... like $100 a day. No, no, no.<eos> It's not like that. It's not like that!<eos> OK, it's too dangerous for you here.<eos> Meet me on the Central Coast after we've done the job.<eos> - Sure! Like he told you to.<eos> - I need to see this through.<eos> Tasha, we need the money from this next job.<eos> And you think he's gonna give it to you?
- No. Fuck off.<eos> - Go on.<eos> - No! Fuck off! Don't!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> How long does it take for hypothermia to kick in?<eos> Alright, let him out.<eos> Let's try this again.<eos> Where is my gold, Josh?<eos> I can't straighten my legs.<eos> Shall I get Wayne to straighten it with a hammer?
Alright, let him out.<eos> Let's try this again.<eos> Where is my gold, Josh?<eos> I can't straighten my legs.<eos> Shall I get Wayne to straighten it with a hammer?<eos> Where's my fucking gold, Josh?<eos> Get fucked.<eos> No, please, don't. Please don't, don't.<eos> We're not home yet.<eos> Still got to get it out of the country.
All you had to do was ask, yes, I accepted a job in Tokyo.<eos> A pharmaceutical lab.<eos> I think it'll be much more interesting than the work I'm doing here.<eos> More interesting than what you're doing here?<eos> Haven't I given in to every demand you've made?<eos> No other company would have given you that kind of responsibility, and power!<eos> Exactly... it's weighing on me.<eos> I know this place in and out.<eos> The world moves...<eos> I want to feel that, I want to be part of it.
So what?<eos> When I played Sigrid, I I held it longer, I thought it was more powerful.<eos> I mean, it really played well.<eos> Well, no one really gives a fuck about Helena at that point, do they?<eos> I'm sorry, but, I mean, it's pretty clear to me, this poor woman's all washed up.<eos> I mean your character, right, not you?<eos> When Sigrid leaves Helena's office,<eos> Helena's a wreck, and we get it, ya know, it time to move on.<eos> I think they want what comes next.<eos> If you just held it, a few seconds longer.
Its past my dinner time, my sugar levels are dropping!<eos> I swear on my mom I didn't take your mother's...<eos> You are talking about my mother again!<eos> Rascal You ate my banana?<eos> This is the only place you found in the whole damn street?<eos> Go there and fall!<eos> Shut up!<eos> See this.<eos> - Awesome what is this network?<eos> Will tell you later, first tell me, can you hack it?
*AO/O$##***AAA<eos> MAATAJllll!<eos> What did he say?<eos> Damn he abused your mom in Chinese!<eos> MAATAJllll!<eos> This is a really dangerous place.<eos> A person can't even eat in peace.<eos> What's there what's there what's there?<eos> Ahhhhh Pineapple cake!<eos> I am gonna have my cake and eat it too.
It's impossible.<eos> I think it's...it's a setup man!<eos> And a very clever one at that!<eos> Only you and your son can enter this place.<eos> You told us so yourself!<eos> What's behind this? What's behind this?<eos> Sir, some old AIC ducts"<eos> ...but these are shut since years!<eos> Open it.<eos> Open it!
- Shut the hell up.<eos> What's wrong, sweetheart?<eos> I don't know anybody's number.<eos> They were all in my phone.<eos> I use the voice dialing in my car, and everyone's on speed dial.<eos> That's some modern-day, fucked-up shit, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I only know, like, three numbers.<eos> My parents in Texas, and I am not calling them.<eos> I know my own number so I could give it out to people.
Thank you.<eos> Okay, you be good.<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> What?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> No, I...<eos> No. Take this.<eos> Pookie, I can't take your crack.<eos> It's worth about $10 on the street.<eos> But don't smoke it.
Hi.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, I don't wanna waste anyone's time.<eos> I'm gonna assume that you're a crack dealer.<eos> And, um, I was wondering if you wanted a little more.<eos> A little more what?<eos> A little more crack.<eos> You know, like, maybe I could cash it in for some money.<eos> You wanna sell me crack?<eos> Well, I technically don't wanna sell it because I think that that's wrong.
Yeah.<eos> You got the receipt?<eos> The... Uh...<eos> Or maybe the box it came in?<eos> Oh, come on, man, I just have the crack.<eos> Oh, you just got the crack?<eos> Yeah, that's all I have.<eos> And I just thought, you know, you could add it to your stash,<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Give me, like, 10 bucks, and then you can sell it for more, and that's good business.
- Lady, what are you doing with my bike?<eos> I'm really, really sorry.<eos> But I'm gonna need to borrow your bike.<eos> I got to get to my car.<eos> I got to get my life back.<eos> Have you ever had one of those days... where everything you do just goes wrong?<eos> And no matter how hard you try or how good your intentions, life just keeps beating, beating you down, huh?<eos> Well, I could really use a friend right now.<eos> So if you just let me borrow your bike,<eos> I'll have it back to you in no time.
Fannie Lou, you need to stomp out that cigarette and go in there and change them sheets.<eos> And I mean change them.<eos> Don't just flip them over.<eos> These men ain't stupid.<eos> Lucille, come wash this dog.<eos> He getting gamey.<eos> Aunt Honey?<eos> Now, Joe, you ain't say nothing about no donkey.<eos> What the hell am I supposed to do with that?<eos> Oh, I thought you could sell it.
Knock yourself out.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> You boys from out of town?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We musicians.<eos> We the Famous Flames.<eos> More like a flicker.<eos> Baby, all we need is a spark to keep the lamp down low till the sun rise up on us in the morning.<eos> Y'all's broke asses splitting that donut, ain't you?<eos> Let me go cut it up for you.
- It's so quiet.<eos> - Let's do it right here.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna put this down.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> No.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> You're tripping.<eos> So what are we supposed to do?<eos> Make a triangle.<eos> I'm gonna make it right here.
Now, is there anything else I can provide for you?<eos> A small bowl of water, madam, if you'd be so kind.<eos> - Might that be a glass of water?<eos> - No, a bowl.<eos> Very well, sir.<eos> I shall bring that up for you.<eos> I found you a small bowl, sir.<eos> I hope this do suit your requirements.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Where would you like I should put it for you?
Blasphemy!<eos> You faring well, Mr Haydon?<eos> - This will be the finish of me!<eos> Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir, for your charity.<eos> - Haydon?<eos> - You have been most kind.<eos> Most kind in your placement.<eos> You have finished me.<eos> You might as well have taken my painting and put it in the outhouse.<eos> Better yet, taken it out of this building and thrown it in the Fleet.
Now, Mrs Booth, if you would be so good as to come up to the house after four, I shall have the balsam prepared.<eos> - Indeed I shall, sir.<eos> - Good day, Mr Mallard.<eos> Rest the body, sir, and the soul shall find solace.<eos> I do thank ye, Doctor.<eos> Let me show ye out.<eos> - Good day to you, Mrs Booth. - Good day to you, sir.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> My father and I are marvelling at this glorious work.<eos> Er... might I be correct in remembering that we had the good fortune of viewing it at the Academy last summer?
It's my fucking club!<eos> That's whose club it is. My club.<eos> My club today!<eos> You're making a big fucking mistake here, I'll tell you that.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Shit.<eos> You think I'm fucking around?<eos> Is that a fucking machine gun?<eos> Yo, goomba, grab that spaghetti bowl.<eos> Grab it!

But what if...<eos> No ifs.<eos> I'm telling you as your brother, leave it alone.<eos> Oh, you're up.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> Right.<eos> Our little secret.<eos> You want your medicine?<eos> No, Grandma.<eos> Grandma, I can't throw it out.
Here it is.<eos> That is called "take-charge shit," son!<eos> "That is called 'take-charge shit, ' son!<eos> "Yes, indeed.<eos> Yes, indeed.<eos> "Hi, my name is Stretch,<eos> "aka Billy Big Balls With Bad Ideas."<eos> Karl would appear to me occasionally when I was exhausted or otherwise beat.<eos> I thought you hated this job?<eos> Doesn't mean I can afford to lose it.
And now, you're going down with him.<eos> Gun.<eos> Gun!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> You have to do something.<eos> Your whole life has led to this night, this very moment.<eos> Do something.<eos> You have got to do something.<eos> Own the space.<eos> Own it!
When I decided at the last minute to take a year off before college,<eos> I told my mom it was because I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life.<eos> She pretended she didn't want to strangle me.<eos> Sweetie, that's the whole point of college:<eos> is to figure out what you want to do, to find out what you're good at, to discover your bliss.<eos> But what if I don't discover it until junior year, and it has nothing to do with the classes I've already taken?
Wrong number.<eos> - Okay, what did you just say?<eos> - "Where's the clog that we ate yesterday at the beauty parlour train station bathroom?"<eos> - Genius.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Wrong numbers always come in twos, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> - I have one more chance. Maybe he'll answer.<eos> - Why does he let her answer the phone?<eos> She grabs it.
Yeah.<eos> You... you know about snakes?<eos> I got an amazonian boa that's the ruler of my house.<eos> Okay, well, let's just call animal control and get them to come down here and take it away, the sooner, the better, okay?<eos> Why?<eos> Are you scared?<eos> Possibly.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Hey, hey. Jackson, don't...<eos> They're probably just gonna kill it, right?
If it gets to two minutes, we have to intervene.<eos> Aaaaaaah!<eos> Something's happening.<eos> Something good?<eos> I'm alive.<eos> Aaaaaaah!<eos> Aaaaaaah!<eos> Do we have any guesses what the toy inside will be?<eos> I read a case study of a teratoma patient with a perfectly formed foot in their brain.<eos> The question is, who gets to keep it?
Mother...<eos> So, I will be harvesting your wife's omentum.<eos> Harvesting?<eos> The omentum is a sheet of fatty tissue that covers your abdomen and your organs.<eos> It's rich with neurotransmitters, so...<eos> Dr. Reid is going to stretch it and plant it on your brain.<eos> What on earth for?<eos> Well, with any luck, it will grow new blood vessels and help oxygenate your brain.<eos> What's left of it.<eos> The omentum could actually help regrow it, improve your memory.
You should be up and walking.<eos> You removed my pants during the most complex brain surgery I've ever performed.<eos> Is that a thank-you?<eos> It is.<eos> So, how's our patient?<eos> She's comfortable.<eos> Too soon to tell if the omentum... she woke up and asked for Malcolm.<eos> You know, I've spent my entire life studying the brain, Alex.<eos> But the heart is still mysterious to me.<eos> Tell me about it.
It's bananas around here this morning.<eos> Really?<eos> Let's just catch up a little bit later on.<eos> Sure.<eos> Here.<eos> - You got me a present?<eos> - Yeah, I did.<eos> Joel, you've never gotten me a present in your entire life.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I've definitely... you know, you don't deserve it.
Really?<eos> Let's just catch up a little bit later on.<eos> Sure.<eos> Here.<eos> - You got me a present?<eos> - Yeah, I did.<eos> Joel, you've never gotten me a present in your entire life.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I've definitely... you know, you don't deserve it.<eos> I know I don't, but I want it anyway.
With gratitude.<eos> Take care of my patients, please.<eos> I will do that.<eos> Are we done here?<eos> Sit still.<eos> Between rounds and all this extra call, I'm working full time, I'm studying full time.<eos> I don't know how anybody manages this schedule.<eos> You want a practice question?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Well, if you don't have time, don't waste it.
I can't promise you that.<eos> Do you have a pen?<eos> What?<eos> I need you to do something for me.<eos> Where's your... your pen and that little pad thing you write on?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> I need it. I have an idea.<eos> So, the heart rate monitor will say if he's in trouble, right?<eos> Yeah, and Dr. Katz is watching it very carefully.
And even leaving God out of the equation,<eos> I then have a right to turn Mr. Dawkins's own question back around on him and ask,<eos> "If the universe created you, then who created the universe? ."<eos> You see, both the theist and the atheist are both burdened with answering this same question of how did things start.<eos> What I'm hoping you'll pick up from all this is that you don't have to commit intellectual suicide to believe in a Creator behind the creation.<eos> And to the extent that you don't allow for God, you'd be pretty hard-pressed to find an incredible alternative explanation for how things came to be.<eos> Well, I imagine you're quite pleased with yourself.<eos> I see you've carefully avoided the fact that Stephen Hawking, the world's most famous scientist, and who is not a theist, has recently come out in favor of a self-designing universe.<eos> I haven't avoided it, I just didn't--<eos> You just didn't know about it.
Looks like it's Greek to her.<eos> Oh, it's "Know thyself," darling, know thyself.<eos> Which I suggest means knowing your own limitations.<eos> You know, if you'll all excuse me, it's time for the help to depart.<eos> Sweetheart--<eos> No pacemaker?<eos> No other piercings, right?<eos> No.<eos> I know it sounds crazy, but I have to ask.<eos> If there's any ferrous metal anywhere inside your body, the magnetic field will put it out, and forcibly.
Letting you speak in front of my classroom and spew your propaganda.<eos> But today, we're gonna change things up a bit.<eos> Evil.<eos> Now, it's been said that evil is atheism's most potent weapon against the Christian faith, and it is. After all, the very existence of evil begs the question,<eos> "If God is all-good and God is all-powerful, why does he allow evil to exist?<eos> ."<eos> The answer at its core is remarkably simple: free will.<eos> God allows evil to exist because of free will.<eos> From the Christian standpoint, God tolerates evil in this world on a temporary basis so that one day, those who choose to love him freely will dwell with him in heaven, free from the influence of evil, but with their free will in tact.<eos> In other words, God's intention concerning evil is to one day destroy it.
So finally a boyfriend shows up.<eos> Shouji Itakura, you liked him too, a triangle relationship.<eos> Then with the draft came the sad parting.<eos> Smart as you are, your imagination is poor.<eos> Right.<eos> It's a mistake to link imagination to intelligence.<eos> If you saw the politician on TV.<eos> They may be top university graduate. But this bunch have no imagination.<eos> The kerosene stove is repaired yet.<eos> Time to replace it with an electric heaters.
It's over in the truck.<eos> - Go and get it now.<eos> - Hey, Benny.<eos> You got those matches on you mate?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Gimme 'em, ay?<eos> - Why?<eos> - I'm gonna take us all out. - Ay?<eos> - See that compressor up there?<eos> I'm gonna blow it up.
Yeah... I got a vibrator and a dildo.<eos> A dildo?<eos> Yeah, a dildo.<eos> How do you use them?<eos> It's no great mystery.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> No, it really is.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I hold the vibrator against the shaft and then I slowly rotate it against the balls.
Louise, it's been a year and a half!<eos> Look, I know I'm just a sheep farmer, but I'm saving money...<eos> Yeah, but you're not even a good sheep farmer, Albert.<eos> Your sheep are everywhere.<eos> The one thing a sheep farmer has to do is keep all of his sheep in one place, all right.<eos> I went to your farm the other day, and I saw one in the backyard, three way up on the ridge, two in the pond, and one on the roof.<eos> Okay, that's Bridget, all right?<eos> She has a problem with retardation, but she's full of love.<eos> Look, we're getting off track here, all right?<eos> Why don't you just tell me what the problem is and then maybe I can fix it?
Listen, if there's anything we can do, just please, please let us know.<eos> We could send a card or something.<eos> If it were me, you know, I think... I mean, I would love something I could use.<eos> You know, like...<eos> Like milk.<eos> I mean, yeah, that's...<eos> Sure. We can send milk.<eos> Oh, milk would be so nice.<eos> We'll send milk.<eos> Okay, so you're gonna take your right thumb, put it all the way to the left.

You've made something of yourself out here.<eos> You know, a lot of people can't say that.<eos> You're a good sheep farmer.<eos> Oh, my God, please.<eos> I suck at sheep.<eos> Louise was right. I can't keep track of them.<eos> There was a sheep in the whorehouse last week.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wandered in there, and then when I went to pick it up, somehow, it had made $20.
- I don't hum.<eos> - Go on, there's no one listening. - No.<eos> - I'll ask Junn about it, then.<eos> Don't ask Junn about it.<eos> I want it to be a surprise.<eos> We'll go to a music shop in Chinatown.<eos> I'll recognise it when I see the cover.<eos> We can ask for a greatest hits album.<eos> - I'm sure the song will be on it. - I can't remember her name.<eos> Well, whistle it, then.
Hey, knock when you come back.<eos> So I know it's you.<eos> Help me! Help!<eos> Help!<eos> Hello?<eos> I'm going to do it again and again until you make them remember.<eos> I think I need to tell someone.<eos> Well, you just did. Me.<eos> I mean, like a reporter at the news or something.<eos> He said he was gonna do it again, and if he has a message and he's using me to get it out, I have to say something. It's...
So, I'm not sure if anyone told you, but my grandma and I are gonna take off for a little while.<eos> Yeah, she mentioned that.<eos> Can I show you something?<eos> It could be nothing, but I just think it should be investigated by someone.<eos> - Who's he?<eos> - His name's Hank McCreedy.<eos> He was the original Phantom's last victim but he's sort of forgotten about.<eos> I heard a story about him, so I did some research, and he's got a grandson somewhere.<eos> I've been writing an article.<eos> I'm gonna try and finish it when I get to California.
Stop them!<eos> Uncle, we killed the moron<eos> - Who?<eos> The moustache man<eos> - Gone!<eos> Shot him<eos> He was an army officer.<eos> They won't spare you<eos> A refugee train is leaving for Calcutta.<eos> Take it
I'll find you the city's best<eos> Brother, the best hilsa for madam it's fresh<eos> How much?<eos> Just a thank you<eos> Meaning?<eos> I mean the fish is a gift from me<eos> You're gifting me a fish?<eos> A hilsa at that?<eos> In Calcutta it comes in a bride's dowry<eos> So accept it as dowry
Excellent, give me five<eos> -Alright, great seeing you.<eos> -Great seeing you.<eos> See you after the show. Alright cheers.<eos> Listen up cocksuckers!<eos> Hurry the fuck up.<eos> Get your music.<eos> Rhythm Section out first<eos> Tanner, the kit is a fucking tonal catastrohpy<eos> Get it in tone alright?
Tanner!<eos> Jesus fucking Christ, where have you been?<eos> We have an issue..<eos> Ok, now is not the time.<eos> I gave...<eos> Neyman the folder and Neyman lost it.<eos> Neyman lost it?<eos> Yes.<eos> The folder is your fucking responsibility, Tanner<eos> Why would you give it to Neymon, right?
Fuck<eos> Hey, Sorry I'm late.<eos> Glad you finished on your busy schedule, darling.<eos> I know.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, but I'm here man, ready to go.<eos> Connelly's playing the part.<eos> Like fucking hell he's playing my part.<eos> What the fuck did you just say to me?<eos> It's my part.<eos> It's my part, and I decide who to lend it to.
Specifically the following.<eos> Does Anna's mom marry the Dutch Tulip Man?<eos> And is the Dutch Tulip Man up to something... or is he just completely misunderstood?<eos> Lastly, I was hoping you could shed some light on Sisyphus the Hamster.<eos> These questions have haunted me for years... and I don't know how long I have left to get answers to them.<eos> I know that these are not important literary questions...<eos> "and that your book is full of important literary questions...<eos> "but I would just really like to know.<eos> "And, of course, if you ever do decide to write anything else...<eos> "I would love to read it.
- Well...<eos> - It's Amsterdam!<eos> He just met you...<eos> - I know!<eos> - ...and he's giving you his wish.<eos> Well, we're sharing the wish.<eos> We're...<eos> I mean, he... He...<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're sharing it.
- Ooh! - I think that's ours.<eos> Dragon carrot risotto for the lady.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And for the gentleman.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Enjoy.<eos> I want this dragon carrot risotto to become a person... so that I can take it to Vegas and marry it.<eos> I like your suit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's the first time I've ever worn it.
I can see his abs through his T-shirt.<eos> Didn't we agree you weren't gonna go there?<eos> Hey! You weren't sleeping with merc for the last five years.<eos> We're talking too fast, too damp... often farty.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I miss good sex.<eos> I deserve good sex, don't I?<eos> No one more than you.<eos> Oh. Sorry.<eos> You deserve it, too.
I don't remember ever wanting a part this bad.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It sucks.<eos> I could have been so good.<eos> Well, I know it doesn't help, but there will be other parts.<eos> Not like this.<eos> You know the shit that's out there?<eos> CBS is offering me a show called "Fucked at Forty."<eos> They can say "fucked"?<eos> Well, it's got hash symbols and asterisks and stuff, although, if I take it, they'll probably change the title to "Matt," 'cause everyone knows "Matt"
You remember the title?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I can still quote lines from it.<eos> Please do.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Whatever happened with that?<eos> Mm. Nothing.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Oh, we have idiots on our side of the pond, too.<eos> God. I'd love to read it again.
You know, not everything has to be an ingredient.<eos> Uh, anyway...<eos> Eileen loved the script so much...<eos> Mm?<eos> ...she sent it to a friend of hers who's a big deal at Fox who apparently also loved, loved, loved it.<eos> Huh. Three "loves."<eos> That's almost too many. Mm. Hm.<eos> According to Eileen, this woman, Kim something, was so knocked out...<eos> Oh, dear God.<eos> ...she wants to make it.
You show him some respect.<eos> Use a spoon!<eos> What are you... an animal?<eos> Relax.<eos> It's fruit.<eos> You know, you just waltz in here with your $60 million.<eos> It's not 60.<eos> You think I like taking money from you?<eos> You don't think it's embarrassing for me?<eos> Well, not too embarrassing to take it.
He hates everything.<eos> Your thing?<eos> He doesn't even want to shoot a pilot.<eos> He wants to go straight to series.<eos> I like the sound of that.<eos> I don't.<eos> That just means we get to skip limbo and go straight to hell.<eos> Okay. How about this?<eos> What if we just buy the show from you?<eos> We'll hire someone else to run it.

How about this?<eos> What if we just buy the show from you?<eos> We'll hire someone else to run it.<eos> You won't even have to be here.<eos> No. No, no. It's our show.<eos> If anyone's gonna run it, it'll be us.
So, do we know who the other guy is who's getting the part?<eos> Nah. They were just using that to get me to read.<eos> There probably isn't even another guy.<eos> Really?<eos> Here's what's gonna happen.<eos> Right now, they're telling each other they didn't want me in the first place.<eos> Then they'll offer it to some big movie guy like Nicolas cage, who you know isn't gonna do TV, but he'll jerk them around for a while, then come back and say he won't do TV.<eos> Then they'll go to, like, some big Broadway star who nobody's fucking heard of, and he won't want to leave New York, which only makes them want him more.<eos> So they'll offer to shoot it in New York, but then the Broadway guy will decide he doesn't want to do TV.<eos> Then they'll just give it to Dylan mcdermott.
Mind the steps.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> - Yes?<eos> Do you know if there's a pharmacy nearby?<eos> Sure, there's one...<eos> If you go down there to the left...<eos> I mean...<eos> In the direction you were heading.<eos> There's a curb along there.<eos> Just follow it down the footpath.
What is going on here?<eos> Get me off this thing!<eos> All right, hang on, hang on.<eos> Somebody get her a ladder.<eos> We'll get you down.<eos> Oh, my God, the couture!<eos> What is this?<eos> Clean up this mess or you're fired.<eos> Fired!<eos> Clean it up yourselves.
If I did not obey I'd...<eos> Tell me, who's the leader!<eos> I really don't know!<eos> I know of absolutely nothing!<eos> What will you do?<eos> In case there's a chance that my goal cannot be fulfilled,<eos> I'll let this woman live.<eos> There are but two serves of antidote.<eos> I know, but there's no other way.<eos> Take it.
The orchestra will be up here.<eos> Orchestra?<eos> A ballroom.<eos> It's an outdoor ballroom.<eos> There is a pool of builders.<eos> Select whatever supplies you care to.<eos> Commission whatever embellishments you think appropriate.<eos> Time is not unlimited.<eos> Here's the budget.<eos> Try not to exceed it.
I got you, Dad.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Come on, Dad.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Ah, cookies! Whoa!<eos> Oh, stole the ball!<eos> Got it, got it...<eos> Three... two... one...<eos> So...<eos> I was thinking, we have had this Montana account for... two weeks, and if I'm not mistaken, not one of you mouth-breathers have volunteered to quarterback it yet.
Hang on.<eos> Here.<eos> Her name's Svetlana.<eos> She isn't cheap, but she's worth it.<eos> Last game, Rabbi?<eos> No.<eos> The match is on.<eos> - Which match?<eos> - France-Brazil!<eos> - We can watch it together.
- Cool.<eos> - Have fun.<eos> Boy, where did you come from?<eos> There aren't that many houses out here.<eos> Hello?<eos> Anyone lose a dog?<eos> She looks hungry.<eos> What are you doing, man? You don't feed a strange dog.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because you will just confuse it and make everything worse.
There aren't that many houses out here.<eos> Hello?<eos> Anyone lose a dog?<eos> She looks hungry.<eos> What are you doing, man? You don't feed a strange dog.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because you will just confuse it and make everything worse.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> Hey, look, as much as I want to hang out with this dog all day long, has anyone else noticed that it's pouring?<eos> We can't just leave it here.
He wasn't no thief, Randall.<eos> Here.<eos> Not now.<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> The schedule is here on the island.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Whoever stole it came back to read the log, find out exactly what it was they had.<eos> Someone on that deck out there is our thief.<eos> Well, it can't be one of our men.<eos> How would they have known to look for it?
For that would be the place that no man had ever been troubled by the sea.<eos> And that's where he'd find peace.<eos> In the end, that's all I want.<eos> To walk away from the sea and find some peace.<eos> I think we found it.<eos> Found what?<eos> The Urca's schedule was taken from me.<eos> When were you planning on mentioning that?<eos> Everything's under control.<eos> We're close to recovering it.
You want your money, you show your fucking face!<eos> That's the only way this gets done.<eos> Captain, I'm afraid our friend out there has all the leverage in this particular situation.<eos> Now, we can rail and shout and stamp our feet, but that doesn't change the fact that unless we give this fellow...<eos> You were saying?<eos> Now, come out here and face me or these pearls go back where they belong!<eos> Fuck.<eos> Rackham: Charles, it is important this deal goes through tonight.<eos> This is a potential prize that changes everything for us.<eos> Do not scuttle it by...
You know what? We just got to get through. I don't have time.<eos> I'm not gonna play this game with you.<eos> I got to go through. Really.<eos> Get back.<eos> - A dragon.<eos> - No, it's not a dragon. It's a...<eos> It's a Xiangliu.<eos> Mythical snake demon.<eos> It looks like a dragon.<eos> I say we kill it.

It's not very sporting to kill it while it's asleep.<eos> Let's wake it up and then kill it.
It'll make you sick.<eos> You, you can't drown a fish in water. We both could use it.<eos> Just a few drops.<eos> Just a taste.<eos> Anything.<eos> I can't go another step.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Get it.<eos> I know that knife.<eos> He'd never sell it.
The machine hurt?<eos> No, I'm just thinking it knows how hard the work's gonna be around here.<eos> Those watermen paid me to take it.<eos> There's insurance money in it.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's raining.<eos> Jesus, Stud.<eos> It's an act of god.<eos> Thought that fucker had abandoned us.<eos> Guess he left just to hitch a jackpot and drag it back.
No, I just meant you're wearing the same clothes as you did yesterday, coupled with the fact that I ain't stupid.<eos> Wasn't making no comment as to the... particularity of the scent.<eos> You don't say fuck-all about my wife.<eos> Don't say her name.<eos> You got some self-loathing to do this morning, that's fine, but it ain't worth losing your hands over.<eos> How would that work, exactly?<eos> Well, I'd just apply a couple pounds of pressure, snap your wrists.<eos> You're Senior Detective.<eos> Think I'm lying?<eos> You got a specific location for this place or are we just gonna wander around till we find it?
Maybe you could just follow your nose.<eos> Wherever he picked them up, I mean, I won't lie.<eos> However we left it, he had some moves.<eos> He knew a few CIs from his narco days.<eos> They knew these parts, put us in touch with some names, people to talk to.<eos> How we doing, boys?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hello.<eos> We're looking for a little bunny ranch down around these parts.<eos> Y'all know where we could find it?
I guess maybe she got a new place.<eos> She'd been going to church.<eos> I was hoping maybe she just turned things around.<eos> We're gonna need to question any girls might have known her.<eos> That's a tougher ask than you think.<eos> Folks'll be stayin' away, they hear y'all are out here.<eos> Well, ma'am, it's the best way to get us to leave.<eos> You said she left a bag.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can I see it?
Undo it and redo it.<eos> Mr. Saint Laurent has his music on.<eos> Put it on a Stockman.<eos> Mr. Saint Laurent wants more lapel and more overlap to give it volume.<eos> Do the fabric mock-up in organza.<eos> He wants a satin backing.<eos> Yes, Mr. Jean-Pierre.<eos> Do the threads. I'll be back in 10 minutes.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> I have to redo the front panel and cut it.
Too complex.<eos> It has to be simpler.<eos> Wait.<eos> Remove them.<eos> Tug on them.<eos> That's it.<eos> As short, neat and precise as a gesture.<eos> Let's find a more muted satin or a satin backing to avoid glints.<eos> Canvas the backing.<eos> Mount it on organza.
You know we're leaving Rue Spontini?<eos> I liked it here. But Mr. Bergé sees things on a big scale. It's exhausting.<eos> Show me.<eos> Yes, that's better.<eos> It lights everything up. Show her neck.<eos> I have a short neck.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Over the iacket is better.<eos> Like this?<eos> The hair too, maybe. Let it down.

I feel polluted.<eos> Those guys are hard-core.<eos> It was total carnage.<eos> Are you sure you want to be in this thing?<eos> Yeah, it's actually kind of an honour to be asked, if they want me.<eos> You don't even know yet?<eos> Well, apparently, I'll be sent a sign.<eos> - Here.<eos> -(GRUNTS)<eos> Well, just sip it.
- I know. Knob-jockey.<eos> Come on.<eos> You offered him a deal, he took it, what's the...<eos> Yeah, but he keeps the moral high ground.<eos> What about, don't take the money if you feel that fucking strongly?<eos> Or what about, take the money, but shut the fuck up'?<eos> Ryle, you're a fucking legend.<eos> And her, right, Charlie, you're a prostitute, love, get on your knees.<eos> Fuck ya!<eos> I mean, are we just going to sit here and take it, carry on taking it?
It's one of my good days.<eos> You are such a crap actor.<eos> Come on!<eos> Call yourselves ostriches?<eos> I'm a lion!<eos> Come on!<eos> Race me!<eos> So this came out of a ostrich's bottom?<eos> That's why they're so bad tempered.<eos> Could you get an ostrich egg and push it back up its bottom?
Come on!<eos> Race me!<eos> So this came out of a ostrich's bottom?<eos> That's why they're so bad tempered.<eos> Could you get an ostrich egg and push it back up its bottom?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Because you'd have to hold the ostrich still and nobody's gonna volunteer for that.<eos> I reckon you could get it halfway up the crack.<eos> You could push it up.<eos> If you caught it halfway, you think you could push it back up?
Urca de Lima, the largest Spanish treasure galleon in the Americas.<eos> A page was torn from the log with the Urca's course and schedule.<eos> Take them into custody.<eos> The schedule is here on the island.<eos> The thief who stole it has offered to sell it to me.
I don't know what you're after, Jack, but you sound like one desperate motherfucker to me.<eos> Has this got anything to do with that massive stash of pearls you lost out by the wrecks, eh?<eos> How long did they give you to make it right?<eos> They weren't specific about time frames.<eos> Oh, usually in my experience, that means about three days.<eos> Perhaps instead of pestering me, you should be out there looking for a boat.<eos> It won't take much for you to lose that new crew of yours.<eos> You may have them fooled now, but at sea...<eos> Perhaps you'll oversleep the bells and need to be roused.<eos> Perhaps you'll be handed the glass and need help with where to point it.
She's being treated at Manhattan Memorial, multiple stab wounds, all defensive.<eos> Doctor says we should be able to speak to her within the hour.<eos> Anything from the security cameras?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> We got the whole show.<eos> I don't want to have sex.<eos> Everything's always about sex.<eos> I'm not opposed to it, but... it's not as important as people make it.<eos> I th- - I think touching's more important.<eos> If you do it right, you can feel it always... even after you stop.
It probably deserves to be supported.<eos> Can not find?<eos> Nihal?<eos> Frankly ... I can not find.<eos> I receive every day emails like this.<eos> Good.<eos> What does not suit you, exactly?<eos> Well ... it would be luxury construct a building for, right?<eos> In a backwater ...<eos> Normally, the village mayor they find a place, they decorate it a bit and that's it.
It hurts you, you will not opposing you there.<eos> That's it.<eos> What else?<eos> I feel they hide their faces in the fight against evil.<eos> As if we did not touch on all aspects.<eos> Who, for example?<eos> Fatma, this honey is frozen.<eos> There else?<eos> I'll see.<eos> Otherwise, put it in hot water.
While she goofs off.<eos> Aside launch contemptuous looks.<eos> It's our fault if you do nothing?<eos> Go on, do something, too.<eos> Who you back?<eos> She struts and call it charity.<eos> The woman redemption ritual who has never won his life.<eos> What redemption is not known.<eos> What do you want her to do?<eos> Charity, it is not throwing a bone to a hungry dog, is to share it with him when you have so hungry.
I hope it will work out.<eos> Exactly, my visit has to do with that.<eos> I do not want to keep you, It's late.<eos> Take that and accept it.<eos> What is it?<eos> Open.<eos> What is it?<eos> Do not get me wrong.<eos> I want to give you this money.<eos> Take it, please.
You already know what to do.<eos> - Can you help me a little? Yes.<eos> - So is.<eos> - He's really shy.<eos> There is.<eos> That's right, show her the balcony.<eos> So.<eos> Not the mezzanine, the balcony.<eos> Come show me.<eos> I want to see it, come.
I tried to leave but he did not leave me.<eos> Yes, it is the hotel. How can I help you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I understand, yes.<eos> We know it is very difficult. We appreciate your cooperation...<eos> - It's Mr. Devereaux. - shit!<eos> - The guest? Yes.<eos> Put it on hold.<eos> I think he forgot his phone in the room.<eos> Tell him we found him and that he should return to the hotel to pick it up.

Yes.<eos> Put it on hold.<eos> I think he forgot his phone in the room.<eos> Tell him we found him and that he should return to the hotel to pick it up.<eos> Mr. Devereaux?<eos> Yes, we found the phone.<eos> Can you come back and pick it up?
Come on, let's go.<eos> Here.<eos> Get in there, Mr. Devereaux.<eos> Get behind the table.<eos> Right there.<eos> Wait, pay attention. I heard.<eos> First, let's review it.<eos> Take off the bag.<eos> Take it off and give it to me.<eos> Do not shake it, just give it to me.
Whatever. What's up with the anesthesia?<eos> I'm not using it. I'm using tranquilizers on this one.<eos> Oh, you're using tranquilizers?<eos> Why? Because amethocaine is expensive.<eos> I wonder why. Probably because it works.<eos> Hey, he's numb, isn't he?<eos> Don't you... Don't you usually take kidneys from the back?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's how doctors do it.<eos> We go in the front, though.<eos> Just scoop everything out until we find the kidney, just rip that out, throw it in a cooler and we are outta here while you bleed out.
Nothing. There was a Cinnabon with ants on it.<eos> Oh, yeah, those can be gross.<eos> All right, I think he's gone. I gotta take him to the car.<eos> I'll help.<eos> No, no, no. You've done enough.<eos> This is our battle to fight.<eos> Goodbye, Pocahontas.<eos> You know my name isn't really Pocahontas, right?<eos> So say my name.<eos> Say it.
You do not have to convince me!<eos> "Where is your hat?"<eos> - He's on the bench.<eos> - You come with a beer?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Look...<eos> It's beautiful to be in love...<eos> Your hat.<eos> Without Johnny, I would not have survived the camp.<eos> I had only one thought in mind, how to find it.
Please, understand, there is nothing in this world I would not do to stop that happening.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Not that obvious a trick.<eos> Now talk and sort it out and do it quickly.<eos> Oh, dear God, it's only two o'clock. It's been Christmas Day for at least a week now.<eos> How can it only be two o'clock?<eos> I'm in agony.<eos> Mikey, is this your laptop?<eos> Upon which depends the security of the free world, yes, and you've got potatoes on it!<eos> You shouldn't leave it lying around if it's so important.
Let's go outside.<eos> They'll be here shortly.<eos> Can't wait to see you arrested.<eos> Sherlock, do we have a plan?<eos> They're taking their time, aren't they?<eos> I still don't understand.<eos> And there's the back of the T-shirt.<eos> You just know things - how does that work?<eos> I just love your little soldier face.<eos> I'd like to punch it.
I'm not a werewolf expert, man.<eos> I don't know.<eos> The reckoning.<eos> The reason for the ritual.<eos> The blood of beast is drained during the solar eclipse and the wolf is rendered weak.<eos> Who the hell is my werewolf, Bud?<eos> Looks like changeling, shape-shifters.<eos> Apparently the blood of one werewolf can maintain their power for decades.<eos> What do they do?<eos> Crystallize it, drink it up like Tang?
The splatter marks puts the shooter close range, two to three feet.<eos> Shot him dead in the face.<eos> Some serious artwork, huh?<eos> The neighbor across the street.<eos> Terry? Yeah? Let's go.<eos> So it's around 2:30 A.M., and I'm always watching that door.<eos> I see 'em sneak in there, and then they come running right back out, down the street, like they seen a ghost.<eos> And they couldn't have been in there more than two or three minutes, tops.<eos> Them boys rip copper from buildings, power lines.<eos> They sell it for a buck a pound.
Your uncanny valley bridge is a direct copy of our motion-parallax vector.<eos> Without my work, you'd have nothing.<eos> You're a gnat, Leonard.<eos> A little flea.<eos> Your app uses simplistic matrix-vector multiplication limited to linear operation.<eos> It didn't bridge the uncanny valley.<eos> I cheated physics.<eos> Can't cheat physics, erich.<eos> You stole my code.<eos> And you're about to turn it into minimum $400 million in revenue.
He's got a polystyrene cup in front of him.<eos> Could be a pavement artist.<eos> Piss artist more like.<eos> Yes, well, there but for the grace of God.<eos> What? Saying I could be a tramp?<eos> Don't use that word, Tom.<eos> What, tramp?<eos> Yes. It's insulting.<eos> It's like gypsy or half-caste.<eos> You can't say it.
Hello.<eos> 'I've got your wallet.'<eos> Pardon?<eos> 'I think I've got your wallet.<eos> I found it outside.'<eos> Err, OK, come up.<eos> Sorry, I just found it.<eos> Oh, where, where was it?<eos> By the shops.<eos> Oh, didn't even know I'd lost it.
Oh, let her keep it.<eos> The balloon?<eos> What do you want it for?<eos> Well... I believe that you are in infringement of<eos> Mr Parson's intellectual property rights.<eos> What? It's a comfort to her.<eos> It's only a balloon, for goodness' sake.<eos> One that contains Mr Parsons' breath - his actual dying breath.<eos> Oh, good Lord. Oh, that's made me go all funny.<eos> Oh, just give it to him, Tamsin.
Just be careful, all right?<eos> Got it?<eos> If you'd only used the pumper, none of this would have happened.<eos> Jan! Please!<eos> There.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's just take a breath, shall we?<eos> Jan, go and get Tamsin's laptop from her room, please.<eos> But Frankie's in there.<eos> Just get it, please.
Who the fuck is crying on vacation day?<eos> - What's goin' on?<eos> - What did you do to her?<eos> No, I didn't do anything.<eos> Listen, there's a beaver in the bathroom.<eos> That's really great news, haven't you been looking for beavers since we got here?<eos> No, no, there was something wrong with it.<eos> It was fucking rabid or something.<eos> Well, you know what we should do?<eos> We should capture it and we'll raise it as our own.
Go get some more guns, load up the trunk and get everybody back to the cabin.<eos> Please, get in the car and turn it around.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna go ahead on foot and get some help.<eos> You're insane, Tommy.<eos> Zoe, please just get in the car and hurry.<eos> Zoe?<eos> I'm sorry I never ate your pussy.<eos> I'm gonna go back and eat all of it one day.
We talked about this.<eos> Save some of that stuff for your Times interview.<eos> Times? Fuck the Times.<eos> You act like you've never had a bad review before.<eos> I could take one, but every one?<eos> "Every one," really?<eos> Come on, man. Look at this shit.<eos> "Andre Allen is the most pathetic character in cinema today.<eos> "If he ever put out another movie,<eos> "I would not see it if it was playing in my glasses."
And I know you won't believe me, but I actually did it because I like you.<eos> All right?<eos> The fan in me just wanted to know what happened to that guy that I saw at Purchase.<eos> You liked me?<eos> Yes, that made me laugh and cry.<eos> You can't touch the girls.<eos> She took my wallet.<eos> I don't know where it is, but she has it.<eos> I don't have any clothes on.<eos> Where am I gonna put it?
Oh, my God.<eos> This is not going as I had hoped.<eos> Hanky Panky.<eos> I thought I would find you here.<eos> One pear Cosmotini, please, my good man.<eos> He's not kidding.<eos> And he's not gay anymore, entirely.<eos> I came back for her, Charlie.<eos> Yep, Atticus told me all about it.<eos> I ripped my heart out and threw it at her feet.
You guys gotta get this shit in perspective, okay?<eos> I came back for the love of my life, she rejected me which bums me out on many levels.<eos> Not the least of which is that you fucktards got your shit together before we did.<eos> Now, you, you're letting your pasty-white cone head get in the way of the prime directive.<eos> Yours is not to reason why.<eos> Yours is to seek and destroy her shimmering snatch.<eos> Don't be fucking with her elf-esteem.<eos> Thanks, Hanky.<eos> And she's got the magic vagina.<eos> You know you want it.
-The thing with your parents.<eos> Come on, you have a choice.<eos> Your sister...<eos> -She didn't follow the rules.<eos> All those stories, all that nonsense, the manipulating.<eos> She is gutsy, though.<eos> -My sister?<eos> If she gets a divorce, I'll give her your number.<eos> You don't have my number.<eos> And you won't get it, either.

This is a douche bag.<eos> The watches conceal an array of tactical functions.<eos> It's how you stay in contact with me and the command center.<eos> - All radio communication should be done using call signs.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Dave, you are "dung beetle,"<eos> - What?<eos> - And Aaron, you are "aardvark."<eos> I can't even carry this thing!<eos> What do you mean you can't carry it?
Secure the motherfucking package.<eos> He's got the package.<eos> He has the package.<eos> I got it; what do I do with it?<eos> Aardvark, there are people coming.<eos> You have to act now.<eos> Secure the package, secure the package.<eos> - What do I do with it?<eos> -They're coming right towards you.<eos> They're gonna see it, they're gonna see it.

No!<eos> I've never done that.<eos> I've been there before.<eos> It looks huge.<eos> That tiger blood will lubricate it.<eos> This will mess up my asshole!<eos> Aardvark, there-there are people there.<eos> They are closing in on you.<eos> They have guns.<eos> You need to secure the payload and you need to secure it in your ass.

No!<eos> This is Dave Skylark signing off.<eos> Good-bye, Dave.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Bulletproof vest.<eos> Genius!<eos> He's alive, everybody!<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> Got a bulletproof vest on!<eos> I don't know how he got it, but he's got it on!
I know these things, Chris.<eos> I'm weak.<eos> I'm sick.<eos> I get into the houses, and I can't leave until I go all over the drawers.<eos> Listen to me, son.<eos> You got one way out, and it's through the grace of God.<eos> You're only how the Lord made you.<eos> You are not flawed.<eos> We, you, me, people, we don't choose our feelings.<eos> There's grace in this world, and there's forgiveness for all, but you have to ask for it.
When I picked up the book, this little folder falls out.<eos> A little folder of pictures.<eos> Pictures of children.<eos> Naked.<eos> Looked like they were sleeping.<eos> And what did you do?<eos> I took it over to the Morals Officer, Deacon Farrar.<eos> He was close with Tuttle, vice-president of the college.<eos> - He didn't do nothing?<eos> - No. He seemed angry that I brought it to him.
And it's Sheriff Geraci to you, shitheel.<eos> Look, Steve, you're gonna wanna swing some dick on this thing. I'm gonna give you a couple reasons why you won't.<eos> First off, we found this tape in your possession. It's a video of the little girl that you said was not missing.<eos> Second off, all findings are with lawyers ready to be fonuarded to media outlets, Feds, CID, US Attorneys.<eos> Should either one of us get sworn a warrant, or either one of us just fall off the face of the fucking Earth, as people are want to do in your neck of the woods.<eos> So, just think about that little girl, Steve.<eos> What about your boat?<eos> That ain't my boat.<eos> - You know whose boat that is?<eos> - I've never seen it before.
Yeah, that's not really my style.<eos> Good night. Good night, sweet boy.<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> It's late.<eos> Let's go.<eos> No. Freddy Krueger's gonna get me.<eos> Stan, you have to stop this.<eos> There's no creepy scary man lurking outside.<eos> (Suspenseful music playing) Hey, I brought back your kitchen knife.<eos> Aah! This was a bad way to return it.
♪ naked sexy touchy grabby ♪ ♪ naked sexy... ♪<eos> Stan was up again all night.<eos> I can't convince him that Freddy Krueger isn't real.<eos> Ooh, that's a tough one.<eos> That Freddy K. is a scary son of a bitch.<eos> I tried telling him that superman is also real and on the hunt for Freddy Krueger, but he didn't buy that.<eos> That's a good idea, though, you know.<eos> We just need Stan to think Freddy K. is dead.<eos> Ooh. What if I bought a Freddy Krueger mask...<eos> (Andy and Bobby) Yi fen qián! All right, I put it on, and I let you violently murder me in front of your young child?
It's worth a shot. I mean...<eos> I can't guarantee anyone's gonna see it, but, it'd improve our odds.<eos> What's that?<eos> - Look.<eos> - Brilliant.<eos> Okay, so be quick, doctor.<eos> I'm not sure how long this aerial battery's gonna last.<eos> And also, you know, the cat creatures.<eos> Hopefully someone will bother to play back these tapes when they find our gear.<eos> If they find it.
They need me alive, but they wouldn't think twice about hurting you or worse.<eos> And I couldn't stand that.<eos> If I hear of it, I will kill myself and stop them right there.<eos> Convince them that you hate me.<eos> You must.<eos> Do you understand? I do.<eos> So you lived here, all these years, like this?<eos> Well, more like this.<eos> The motor!<eos> We have to hide it.
Bring the product release forward.<eos> We're only halfway into production... and speeding it will cost a fortune.<eos> Do I look like I give a fuck?<eos> Just get it done.<eos> As some of you will have learned last night... teamwork is paramount here at Kingsman.<eos> We're here to enhance your skills, test you to the limit.<eos> Which is why you're gonna pick a puppy.<eos> Wherever you go, your dog goes.<eos> You will care for it.<eos> You will teach it.
These you are familiar with, and this is our standard issue pistol.<eos> It's quite unique, as you'll see.<eos> It also fires a shotgun cartridge for use in messy close-range situations.<eos> - How do they feel?<eos> - Yeah, good.<eos> Now do your very best impersonation... of a German aristocrat's formal greeting.<eos> No, Eggsy.<eos> That is sick.<eos> In the old days, they had a phone in the heel as well.<eos> How do I get it back in?
Cheap bastard is always after me to fix his rust bucket.<eos> He can crawl around underneath it himself.<eos> Any corrupt traffic cop can afford a good car after 5 years on the job.<eos> Maybe he's an honest cop.<eos> Yeah, and generous!<eos> - Are they here yet?<eos> - Nope.<eos> And where's your "good morning"?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Look for it, then.
Boy or girl?<eos> Girl.<eos> I'd go with Wade.<eos> Elvis Manuel Machado.<eos> He's a family enforcer.<eos> Machados are Cuban nationals, known drug-smugglers.<eos> Cocaine or weed?<eos> Sugar.<eos> Yeah, embargoed sugar from Cuba.<eos> Once it's here, they sell it below market to low-rent candy companies.
What are you doing here? !<eos> Why would anyone walk up 14 flights of stairs?<eos> To buy the dope we've been promised.<eos> Oh. I-I-I was supposed...<eos> Canadian.<eos> The money's in the briefcase, okay?<eos> What?<eos> Don't you want it?<eos> Yeah, I want it.<eos> Well, go get it.
Listen, if there's anything I can do...<eos> Well, maybe there is.<eos> I want you to keep an eye on Hood for me.<eos> Anything out of the ordinary, I want to be the first call you make.<eos> - That's pretty much everything.<eos> - Well, that's my point.<eos> Now you got a place to come to.<eos> You gonna put that badge back on or what?<eos> I didn't want to rub it in.<eos> After what we went through to bring you back... damn well better wear it.
Why go to such trouble to cover for a guy who burned you?<eos> It's none of your business.<eos> What's happening with Nakata Auto?<eos> You're dragging your feet.<eos> Are you a child?<eos> I look like a fool now, too.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> If we turn that broken down garage into a couples motel... and run a call girl service out of it, it might pay off.<eos> If only it would burn to the ground.<eos> Torch it?
Well you know, it's a straight job, steady paycheck.<eos> So yeah... That should be pretty good.<eos> Hey there, Milton, we could use your help.<eos> We?<eos> Hey, Milt, you got a sec?<eos> So uh... Let me get this straight.<eos> You actually tried to snort this?<eos> I used the basic ammonia reduction, I've done it a million times...<eos> Yeah, well not in the last five years you haven't, they added time release compound now.<eos> You could try running it through cold filtering and then pass...
You never said that you had actually done it. You didn't tell me that you had actually...<eos> I told you the truth.<eos> I was with Russell before and then I wanted to be with you.<eos> I changed my mind, you changed my mind.<eos> Why, because I wouldn't stay dead?<eos> Because I kept coming back?<eos> Because Russell isn't smart enough to find a way out of this place.<eos> But you are...<eos> So this is how he knew my filtration process?<eos> He watched me do it.

Not without a gun.<eos> That's the thing, huh...<eos> Only one of us is gonna walk out of here with that meth...<eos> Well, let's be honest.<eos> None of us deserve it.<eos> So I say... none of us should have any kind of say in the matter.<eos> I say... we leave it all to fate.<eos> I say... we let the bullets decide.<eos> Ok! Here's how this is gonna work.<eos> There's gonna be one bullet in the cylinder, we each take a turn spinning the chamber... snapping it shut...
I guess you sent these to Bradley.<eos> I was just concerned about her, you know, after the accident.<eos> You know, it wasn't an accident.<eos> She jumped off a bridge.<eos> It's a euphemism.<eos> You know, I know what happened.<eos> You know, she's getting out of the mental hospital today.<eos> Yeah, I ran into Jenna in town.<eos> She--she told me.<eos> Why would she tell you about it?
My love, come back to me.<eos> It's time for my father's toast.<eos> ( applause )<eos> Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine?<eos> Uncle, you can be my cupbearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.<eos> Your Grace does me a great honor.<eos> It's not meant as an honor.<eos> Bring me my goblet.<eos> What good is an empty cup?<eos> Fill it.
So they can come here?<eos> Just tell them to come right now to get the zombies.<eos> If they are experts they can kill the zombies for us!<eos> I know. You've seen the zombies?<eos> 'Cause they're real, right? Yeah!<eos> - Can you let me loose?<eos> - I'm not sure if I should, I mean, you're ..<eos> - I have chocolate.<eos> - You do?<eos> Yeah, I have chocolate. 'Cause I could get it for you, but you know ...
- Can you let me loose?<eos> - I'm not sure if I should, I mean, you're ..<eos> - I have chocolate.<eos> - You do?<eos> Yeah, I have chocolate. 'Cause I could get it for you, but you know ...<eos> - Double-triple-fudge.<eos> - Oh my God ...!<eos> Let me get this right here.<eos> Come on.<eos> You can do it.
So last month, when the moon rose, when I held onto Nora... and I... tasted her tears when we kissed, that's when it all became clear.<eos> No one should have to live with a burden like me.<eos> And that's why I asked you.<eos> No.<eos> - And that's why.<eos> - No.<eos> That's why I need you to kill me.<eos> And I said no.<eos> No way.<eos> The silver knife, I know you keep it here.

Obviously we go.<eos> Remember what our boy back in Colorado said, you don't get anywhere first if you die on the way.<eos> How much it cost to kit up?<eos> Alright, gentlemen, 300 is going to get you a sled, provisions, shelter, clothes, that will do you for your first six months.<eos> I'll throw in a mining manual and uh...<eos> You throw in them boots, you got yourself a deal.<eos> Not done.<eos> We got to think about this, I'm serious.<eos> So am I. You wanna wait around here till the summer, be my guest.<eos> I'm buying that kit today, if I got to zipper out my own money to do it.
But I will do everything in my power to frustrate you.<eos> Know that.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> Because we're in fucking battle right now and I will not undermine his control of what is, frankly, a shitty situation based on a letter written by a woman neither of us know a thing about.<eos> Just promise me that when we get back to Nassau, we will deal with this.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Fine.<eos> Billy's come up with our next move.<eos> It's three hours till sunup.<eos> Perhaps you'd like to share it with the rest of us.
Billy, tell him I'm right.<eos> Captain...<eos> Mr. Logan makes a valid point.<eos> Unfortunately, now is not the time.<eos> Anybody else got a point they would like to make?<eos> While we are in battle, the Captain's orders are the law.<eos> That is what we signed up to.<eos> That is what we agreed.<eos> Now the order's been given.<eos> Heed it!
What the fuck did you do?<eos> Spend enough time on an island, begin to forget there's a whole world out there.<eos> A world where the rules are different.<eos> I went out there, found men who don't know the rules here and who don't much care to learn them.<eos> They helped me surprise Captain Hornigold's men, we took his fort, and not once were any of them burdened with the thought, "What if this were to upset Eleanor Guthrie?"<eos> Well, they're about to learn the rules, Charles.<eos> The hard way.<eos> You think I'm gonna let this stand?<eos> That Hornigold will?<eos> We have men lining up in droves to back us in retaking it.
Two inmates clamped me up like a fish.<eos> I know they put 'em up to it.<eos> Who put them up to it?<eos> Who?<eos> The FBI, cunt!<eos> Who the hell do you think?<eos> They've been putting thallium in my food since 2002. 2002!<eos> You know anything about thallium?<eos> You know what it does?<eos> It kills you slowly. You can't taste it, you can't smell it.
- We have two children... - Max! ...whose lives have been turned upside down.<eos> - My baby!<eos> - And nothing and no one else is more important than that.<eos> You got a visitor.<eos> You coming?<eos> - Making friends?<eos> - You know me.<eos> You getting any more time for it?<eos> They just let me off with a warning.<eos> Take it seriously.
"Something there is that doesn't love a wall<eos> "That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it<eos> "And spills the upper boulders in the sun<eos> "I let my neighbor know beyond the hill<eos> "And on a day we meet to walk the line<eos> "And set the wall between us once again<eos> "Before I built a wall I'd ask to know "What I was walling in or walling out<eos> "And to whom I was like to give offense<eos> "Something there is that doesn't love a wall<eos> "That wants it down"
What a serendipitous pleasure to be surprised by my favorite nephew and Howard Burkan!<eos> Little Howard.<eos> "Burkan the Great," if you please.<eos> Of course. Of all my nephews and nieces, you're the only one, Stanley, who isn't boring to the point of perfection.<eos> I couldn't agree more.<eos> If only you had a slightly milder disposition, you might actually have friends.<eos> I am his friend.<eos> Notice I use the singular.<eos> Yes, he means he can tolerate me.<eos> You may be Burkan the Great to your public, but to me, you'll always be little Howard Burkan, who took my favorite scarf, cut it in half with a pair of scissors, waved his magic wand over it, and it didn't come back together.
Yes, let me show you.<eos> I've never forgotten this.<eos> You find that menacing?<eos> I'd say it was pretty romantic.<eos> Penny for your thoughts.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Well, you know what my thoughts are?<eos> I've already told you I want to marry you. That we'll get married at summer's end at the Donaldsons' yacht.<eos> It's enormous, and it can accommodate all the guests we'd want to have.<eos> And then after the wedding, we sail it, with those who wish, from Monaco to Greece, and then we honeymoon on the Greek Islands.
I'll give you $500.<eos> This is a custom racing bicycle, sir.<eos> Designed for competitive road cycling.<eos> This bike has a light-weight, space-age carbon frame and handlebars positioned to put the rider in a more aerodynamic posture.<eos> It also has micro-shifters and 37 gears, and weighs under six pounds.<eos> I won the Tour de Mexico on this bike.<eos> $700 is as high as I'll go.<eos> It cost me over $8,000 new.<eos> $700.<eos> $2,500, and that's giving it away.
- 7,90, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Miss.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Pass again, please.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You just beeped.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> Something's beeping in your bag.<eos> Can you put it here?
Put some kind of pressure on them.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> But it's not for free.<eos> Is that OK with you?<eos> - Got it?<eos> - Yes, got it.<eos> Wait, I'll do it.<eos> It was in the machine.<eos> I don't like you to do my laundry.<eos> Then do it.
All I can say is: "Great.<eos> Well done".<eos> Now I have to get a compress ready.<eos> Yes.<eos> Wait until the tube is full.<eos> An empty space. That's it.<eos> You can stop.<eos> Remove the tube.<eos> - I just take it out? - Go ahead.<eos> - I shake it three times.
Now I have to get a compress ready.<eos> Yes.<eos> Wait until the tube is full.<eos> An empty space. That's it.<eos> You can stop.<eos> Remove the tube.<eos> - I just take it out? - Go ahead.<eos> - I shake it three times.<eos> - Excellent.<eos> Should I put it down here?
Shut up.<eos> You're the goalie, Balsiger!<eos> - But I'm not good in goal.<eos> - You're worse on the pitch.<eos> Move it!<eos> - Come on, guys!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey! Idiot!<eos> Can't you even stop a weak shot like that one?<eos> You should have stopped it!
But she chose Budi.<eos> And when I think about her moving back in with him the memory of her beauty loses its shine a bit.<eos> Now and then on weekends I do some drugs.<eos> I'm not gagging for the smack.<eos> I just take it for that warm feeling.<eos> All in all I can't complain.<eos> Or rather: I could complain a whole lot.<eos> Especially if I think about the future.<eos> But you've got a past for a reason.<eos> It wasn't always good, but at least I can tell it whatever way I want to.
But we're still really good friends.<eos> It's just better if we don't live in the same house. - And that we're not married.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - You understand? - No. It's hard to explain.<eos> Hey, listen, could we twitter each other when we're not in the same place?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Could you show me how to do that? Yeah.<eos> OK. So, first you click here and you have to enter your username.<eos> - Right. - You could also log in on your iPhone. Uh-huh.<eos> You click this button here, it posts your feed so all your followers can read it.
- To who? - To that A-hole food critic.<eos> You could only send private messages to people who are following you.<eos> I think you might have posted that publicly.<eos> No, he wrote something nasty about me and then I hit reply and it let me send a message to him.<eos> Dad, replies are public.<eos> Everybody can read them.<eos> And it looks like he re-tweeted it to all his 123,845 followers.<eos> And he wrote back.<eos> What did he say?<eos> - I don't think I should read it.

Stop it. Stop it for a second! Let's just...<eos> I've been waiting to talk to this prick for a long time.<eos> - OK. - I am not cloying.<eos> I am not needy.<eos> I don't care what you think.<eos> You're not getting to me.<eos> I'm not needy!<eos> Chocolate lava cake is not just undercooked chocolate cake.<eos> That's not what makes the center molten.<eos> You take a frozen cylinder of ganache and you set it in the ramekin so that as the outside cooks fully, the inside becomes molten! OK.
- Then you need also the holder.<eos> - Yeah, let's get a cover as well.<eos> OK, you see this, Percy?<eos> That's a chef's knife.<eos> A real chef's knife.<eos> It's not a toy.<eos> You understand? This thing's sharp. It can send you to the hospital if you're not careful.<eos> I'll teach you how to use this thing.<eos> But a chef's knife, it belongs to the chef, not to the kitchen.<eos> So it's your responsibility to keep it sharp, clean, not to lose it.
- So who's this Rick Carver dude?<eos> - That's my boss.<eos> For the time being.<eos> - What's that like?<eos> - Oh, it's great.<eos> He's... Nah, he's a fucking arsehole.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Straight on. - What are you doing?<eos> - Got to take a picture.<eos> To prove to the bank this shit's missing so they pay us to put it back in.

"It's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe in it."<eos> I'm Mary Jane Paul.<eos> Thank you for listening.<eos> And we're out.<eos> Great interview.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're all smiley.<eos> We just finalized the new format of The Bradley Hour.<eos> Nice, that was quick. Mm-hmm.<eos> I can't wait to check it out. Yeah.
You know I'd never do anything like that.<eos> Come on, you know me better than that.<eos> I mean, well, it does cure cancer.<eos> It does.<eos> Come on.<eos> Helen, what's wrong?<eos> What's wrong, Mom?<eos> My diamond bracelet's missing.<eos> Well, you just had it yesterday.<eos> Well, it's not here today and I want to wear it to the gala.
I don't need to take the test 'cause... I know it'll... come back dirty.<eos> God.<eos> I was two years clean and I... slipped.<eos> I'm sorry, Dad.<eos> I messed up, but...<eos> I got straight the next day.<eos> Mmm. Went to my meeting.<eos> I didn't steal that bracelet, though.<eos> Hey.<eos> So, uh, let me guess, you, uh, dropped your phone in the toilet again and you're replacing it tomorrow.
I'm tired of squirrel.<eos> Onions and squirrels.<eos> It's all we ever eat.<eos> I want cake.<eos> Eat your stew.<eos> There'll be plenty of cake when that well comes in.<eos> - That well ain't never comin' in.<eos> - Don't you ever say that, girl.<eos> There's oil down in that ground.<eos> And I'm gonna get it.
How do you know it was me he was aiming at?<eos> Religion without art is so much less...seductive.<eos> In this church, we worship God, not beauty.<eos> Well, at least the Catholic faith allows us a little joy before we die.<eos> But we Protestants will have joy eternal at God's right hand, while you...<eos> Roast in Satan's inferno.<eos> As all benighted heretics must.<eos> Surely even Huguenots believe in windows.<eos> The stained glass was removed.<eos> We do not have the money to replace it.
How did you make this about you?<eos> Look, look, I think the best thing at this point would be for me and you, PJ, to go down and talk to the cops.<eos> I'm not talking to the cops.<eos> The cops are gonna talk to you, all right?<eos> But if we initiate everything, it looks like you have nothing to hide, 'cause right now, it looks like you have everything to hide.<eos> This isn't a request.<eos> Son, you got a second?<eos> Yes, sir?<eos> I wanted to wait till you got through the gala to talk to you about that drug test.<eos> I told you I didn't want to take it because I knew what it would say.
Only an Indian can perform such a miracle.<eos> Feeling patriotic?<eos> Sorry-<eos> He'll contact us as soon as the diamond reaches India.<eos> Price?<eos> 5 million dollars.<eos> Fine.<eos> Should we pay by cash?<eos> Sure.<eos> Load it in a truck and take it.
...they'll say that they're taking you to a 'safe' place.<eos> Why are you stressing on "safe"?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> There will be a gun hidden in the car..<eos> ...which they'll use to transport you.<eos> Gun?<eos> If it's a Skoda, it'll be under the left seat.<eos> And if it's a Toyota, then it'll be under the right.<eos> Okay-<eos> Take the gun out and use it to scare them and escape.
I'm prepared to consider your offer. D'accord.<eos> Jim, you are legally within your rights to sell the contract to me.<eos> Why don't you just murder my mother and me?<eos> It would make things a lot easier!<eos> Can't you see what you're doing?<eos> On Tuesday my mother dies, on Wednesday this man has me thrown out on the street with no money and no home, and on Thursday the building that my great-grandfather built for his children... and their children and their children's children is destroyed by this monster<eos> and turned into one of those hideous hotels!<eos> It's all about the money, isn't it?<eos> That's the speech you should have made to your mother... before she sold the apartment to this man's father, for money.<eos> My mother sold her apartment to this man's father to keep it away from your father! Guys.
- I know.<eos> My name is Mathias Gold.<eos> When I used to have friends, they called me Jim, and I would answer.<eos> I grew up on Park Avenue in New York City.<eos> My parents were wealthy.<eos> I was born with a silver knife in my back.<eos> Anytime anyone follows their heart, someone else gets their heart broken.<eos> There's always detritus, always hurt, always pain.<eos> Love is a limited substance.<eos> When you give love to someone new, you have to take it away from someone old.
Seems he got himself a special exemption.<eos> Got connections, I reckon.<eos> - Some kind of big shot.<eos> - Yeah. He's paying a grand per day.<eos> Kind of makes you overlook the little things.<eos> You got some crazy-ass dog problems around here, huh?<eos> The problem is coyotes.<eos> They like the taste.<eos> Yeah, yeah, no, we got the same thing in LA.<eos> You know, one of them would come down from the hills, starts flirting with some old lady's shih tzu and lures it back up the hill and bye-bye, shih tzu.
Boo-yah. Surveillance camera.<eos> ¿Qué pasa, señor?<eos> Look, we don't mean to bother you, but we'd like to take a look at some footage on your surveillance camera outside.<eos> Uh, no. What you mean, no?<eos> You see this badge right here?<eos> Yeah, unless you have a warrant, I don't have to show you anything.<eos> Don't make me be a hard-ass, man.<eos> Every time my store gets robbed or something happens out there, police always come in asking for my security hard drive.<eos> Right?<eos> They take it, they promise to bring it back...

You were always right, man.<eos> You were always so strong, so full of opinions.<eos> So when you got sick, I was gonna fix you.<eos> I was gonna... I was gonna cure you, you know?<eos> I was gonna show you you were wrong.<eos> And you were gonna thank me.<eos> You'll be happy to know I quit today.<eos> See?<eos> You always had the last word.<eos> Even when you can't say it.
- It's a barbecue.<eos> - Well, I'm a vegan.<eos> - You don't have to eat it.<eos> - Smelling is ingesting.<eos> - Not really.<eos> - Mom, I found it.<eos> I found the sweater.<eos> It was in the big suitcase the whole time!<eos> That is great.<eos> Now you can wear it to school tomorrow.
Get out of the vehicle with your hands in the air now!<eos> They can't be far.<eos> Hey!<eos> Have you seen this man in the building?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> He's crazy.<eos> He's upstairs.<eos> He's got a gun.<eos> Yates, freeze!<eos> Bauer, put it down, and get on the ground!
They're planning a full-scale attack.<eos> All the evidence is here to alert the authorities.<eos> They can decrypt the data.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no, no, no!<eos> What's happening?<eos> Yates embedded a self-destruct program.<eos> It's erasing itself.<eos> Can you save it?
- I'm sorry, sir.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You've done enough damage as a federal agent, Jack.<eos> Thank God you didn't become a surgeon.<eos> Did you remember to tell your staff that you wanted to remain undisturbed?<eos> Yeah.<eos> In the office,<eos> - hard at work all evening.<eos> - Good.<eos> If an agent wants to check for a signal, that'll confirm it.
- That is not fair.<eos> - Fair?<eos> Don't talk to me about fair.<eos> Mark, you are my husband, you should have told me.<eos> I will never trust you again.<eos> - No, never. I don't trust...<eos> - Your father was the greatest man I ever knew.<eos> It was a privilege to serve him.<eos> Today he asked for one last service.<eos> I hated doing it with every fiber of my being.

We've got to go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Cheng.<eos> Take the device.<eos> Why did you do this?<eos> What, this?<eos> I didn't do this.<eos> You did.<eos> When you tried to deceive us.<eos> We paid you to develop the override, not for you to give it away for the rest of the world.
I can't talk to you when you're like this.<eos> I hope you're calling to tell me you have Jack Bauer ready to turn over to us.<eos> He's using an encrypted CIA comm link.<eos> Your men will be able to pinpoint his location.<eos> Hold on!<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm inside the Naval Command server.<eos> - Draft the order.<eos> - That's a nuclear sub.<eos> Send it.
We paid you to develop the override. Not for you to give it away for the rest of the world.
I'll explain everything later.<eos> Right now you need to get a team over to Southampton docks.<eos> Jack was going in stealth but right now he's in trouble and he really needs your help.<eos> He's trying to stop this war.<eos> Kate...<eos> I need tac teams suited up in choppers, now!<eos> Jack, Audrey's safe.<eos> Thank God.<eos> They've found my feed.<eos> I've lost satellite, and I'm trying to get it back...
Hi, Nick. Just to remind you, your meeting with Darian's at midday today.<eos> Also, don't forget you need to drop in at the archive at some point this afternoon.<eos> They need to check a few things with you.<eos> I'll text Darian's address, but if you need anything else, let me know.<eos> Fuck.<eos> And when I come out of that world,<eos> I always feel startled by the so-called real world and I eat and I watch TV and I play with the kids and I torment my wife and I gather up experiences and then head back on in. Can't Get You Outta My Head) What were we doing on that yesterday?<eos> Yeah, you had a...<eos> you... you played a thing on it.<eos> You sang it and it sounded really good.
- You know, a... a greater thing.<eos> - And do you ever remember...<eos> Hey, this is great, having the piano in, er...<eos> - the control room.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> We can, er... tune every piano if you need.<eos> Yeah, and... and the one in the barn.<eos> - While Warren is doing something or Tommy's doing something, I could take this piece...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - ...bring it in here and just play it and work it, because a lot of the stuff's not...
- No.<eos> - ...a gap?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe because we had the babies.<eos> It's a beautiful last line to end on.<eos> "The sky out of my window has gone real blue now."<eos> The sky in Brighton is unlike anything I've ever seen.<eos> Living by the sea, looking out my windows,<eos> I feel like I'm part of the weather itself.<eos> Sometimes the sky is so blue and the reflection of the sea so dazzling you can't even look at it, and other times, great black thunderheads roll across the ocean and you feel like you're inside the storm itself.
- I don't feel credible. - You are.<eos> I don't believe in me.<eos> Got a guy, Anna?<eos> No.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> No reason.<eos> We never see you with a guy and you never mention one.<eos> No, there's no one in my life.<eos> You know, Anna... Love can be closer than we think.<eos> It can be right before our eyes and we can't see it.
Barnabé.<eos> - Shit...<eos> - Holy cow.<eos> Richard got me a job selling beds.<eos> I was hired for a two-week sale in a big store.<eos> I soon sold more beds than anyone else.<eos> After all, I was an expert.<eos> A good bed is expensive.<eos> - But do dreams have a price?<eos> - You're right. I'll take it.
I've done the research and, look, the area needs another auto shop.<eos> All right? Here look.<eos> This is my location right here.<eos> There's like 10,000 cars that go around this circle.<eos> It's a prime spot.<eos> It makes perfect sense. Here, look.<eos> This is it right here, and it's just sitting there empty.<eos> I'm not looking for that much cash. Just enough to cover the rent for 7, 8 months and then I'll start turning a profit.<eos> And my business plan, it's good, all right?<eos> You just gotta take a look at it, but I promise you...
You gotta trust me, man.<eos> It's not so easy, bro.<eos> It's not so easy, Frankie.<eos> Hey, I know it's stressful.<eos> But what in life isn't?<eos> Thought you could use a cold drink.<eos> Hey, thanks.<eos> I think it's gonna rain all week.<eos> Hey, would you mind? There's a ratchet over there on the table.<eos> - Could you pass it to me?
I mean, how could you have known?<eos> Listen, thanks for always being so honest with me.<eos> I knew he was your roommate.<eos> Damn it, Leslie!<eos> What about the Asian Zac Efron?<eos> He went home with white Rihanna!<eos> And then I met Justin, and by the time I figured out who he was, we were already in our underwear, and I'd optimistically worn my good bra.<eos> Aah! I don't want to hear it.<eos> Well, somebody has to, Danny.<eos> It's an $80 bra, and it hurts to wear it, okay?
Hey, Maggie.<eos> Hi, Ray.<eos> You looking for my sister?<eos> Yeah. She's out back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks. Hey, Ninja caught a rat.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A big one. That's great.<eos> Yeah, it's in the barn.<eos> You wanna see it?
Really?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> So I am the only single one.<eos> That is fine.<eos> You're not the only one.<eos> Hey, guys, my marriage is over.<eos> - We know.<eos> - Duh.<eos> Clearly.<eos> I've been fighting it and fighting it, but you know what?
That's the guy you stole the money off, right?<eos> Yeah, yeah. Dude, I've only seen Quentin once before, okay?<eos> But the guy's a fucking legend.<eos> They sent four guys for him once...<eos> Wow, great story.<eos> What did you take?<eos> It was like a drug payment or something.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Brantley's into a lot of shit, man.<eos> Look, I was just supposed to pick up the money from some guy in Eugene and run it back.
You're either with me or you're not.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Long day?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Hmm, you know, my mother used to say even a train got to stop sometime.<eos> I'm gonna make you my Last Call cocktail.<eos> Why don't you make it a double?<eos> No, I'll make it any damn way I want to.
We'll run down the guns.<eos> If we're lucky, one of them has been used in a major crime.<eos> - If not? - None of the guns are registered.<eos> We've already got him on illegal possession.<eos> That is a major offense, especially if there was gun trafficking.<eos> How long can you keep him in county?<eos> Long enough to try and make a case.<eos> I want to go over the warrant again.<eos> We've been over that already.<eos> Well, now you're gonna go over it with me.
- Mm.<eos> It's funny-- some guys, they just inhaled it.<eos> I mean, it had been so long since...<eos> Other guys, they took it back to their tables and sat, looked at it, just started crying.<eos> I get it.<eos> Then there was these other guys who took the steak and threw it against the fucking wall.<eos> Like telling the place to go fuck itself, you know?<eos> Sean, get back here.<eos> - I got it!<eos> - Girl: Give it back!
No Lailu.<eos> It can only be her.<eos> I pawned it!<eos> What?<eos> I bought an IPad.<eos> It's really cool.<eos> It even has a voice activator.<eos> It was your grandmother's chain!<eos> What's happened to you Lailu?<eos> But I wanted it for my studies...
I put the cash for the half, there leaves 7 kilos for each one.<eos> 7 kilos is...<eos> --140,000 francs each.<eos> That would make...<eos> --1,250,000 for each one.<eos> That's Ok for me.<eos> For me too.<eos> --If it doesn't bother anyone, I'm in for the double.<eos> The double?<eos> I got plenty of cash around, I'm not gonna leave it in some bank.
--Apparently... apparently...<eos> A real mass execution.<eos> In French criminal records, nothing similar had ever happened.<eos> The massacre in Marseilles seems to be about a settling of scores.<eos> That's one of the hypothesis.<eos> The police wasn't able to recover...<eos> Are you gonna talk about the bar shootout?<eos> --I've never seen a report this incomplete!<eos> You might as well drop the case cause it's not pleadable in court!<eos> Bianchi... one might say he's doing it on purpose.
Are you getting this?<eos> Rumor of a rumor.<eos> Is this POTUS finally announcing he's not gonna run for re-election?<eos> Well, whatever it is, I'm hearing the West Wing is abuzz like a fly in a shithouse.<eos> - Hi.<eos> -Phone bowl.<eos> - Come on, put it in.<eos> - Oh, I'm not even using it.<eos> I want the camera so I can get pictures of this magical day.<eos> Either you put your phone in the phone bowl or I put it in the punch bowl.
Rest assured, I will ask the jury to keep that in mind when weighing his evidence.<eos> I know that is not perfect but it is better than nothing.<eos> Justice for four is surely better than justice for none.<eos> Now, you say there was never any conspiracy or plan to attack Thomas Ward.<eos> That's correct.<eos> But there was a plan to attack a young man named Albert Flanagan and in the course of that attack, Thomas Ward died.<eos> Whether he was the intended target or an innocent bystander is immaterial, it is still joint enterprise murder.<eos> Finally, you describe the case against your client as "flimsy" in that he didn't enter the shop but sat waiting in the car.<eos> But this doesn't necessarily weaken the case against him.<eos> It could strengthen it.
They'll put you with the nonces.<eos> You'll be doing life with the nonces unless you tell the truth and take the blame, mate.<eos> Tell the truth, Kieran.<eos> Go on, you'll be a hero, then, won't you?<eos> "There's Kieran Gillespie who pleaded guilty to murder "so his mates could go free.<eos> "He's a good lad him."<eos> I told my mum I didn't do it.<eos> All right.<eos> OK.<eos> I'll do it, yeah.

Because I've got my entire savings at risk on this deposit.<eos> I don't mean the deposit.<eos> I mean... this.<eos> Why do you want it?<eos> Have you ever thought about it?<eos> Yes, I've thought about it. I've thought about it every day for the last five years.<eos> That place has just been sitting right across that fence mocking me.<eos> I'm not talking about that place.<eos> I-I-I just meant... everything.<eos> Why do you want it so much?
Oh, more trick-or-treaters.<eos> - Lennox, will you get the door?<eos> - How?<eos> I don't have opposable thumbs.<eos> You're a talking cat.<eos> Figure it out.<eos> (Low voice) Must have victory.<eos> (Sighs) Tell me about it.<eos> Want a glass of wine?<eos> I think we deserve it after killing that dark lord.
- Right?<eos> - You know, when you let people know that they can just take from you and you don't do anything, that's exactly what they'll do.<eos> I got the number, man.<eos> Um... - You backing out?<eos> No, I just...<eos> I don't have that much money.<eos> - I thought you were saving for a truck?<eos> - Yeah, I got like, two grand.<eos> - So you do got the money.<eos> I got the number if you want it.
- Take a shower.<eos> Wash that shit off the top of your lip.<eos> What time do you want to hit the road in the morning?<eos> About 10:00.<eos> 10:00 it is.<eos> - All right.<eos> See ya then.<eos> - I'm gonna need that phone.<eos> - Well, I don't think you can just...<eos> - You gonna give it to me, or you gonna make me come over and get it?
- What, that soon?<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Don't... don't you have to, like, scope out the area, or something?<eos> "<eos> -What for, Injuns?" You go get that money, now.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Um, do you think you want to park here, though?<eos> Because my... my neighbors, they might see something, or...<eos> - Well, you'd better hurry up and go get it, then.
kicked his way to the top in Asia.<eos> He was regarded as the best.<eos> Afterwards, he retired and became an artist.<eos> My name is Fung Yu-sau.<eos> I'm here to fight you to the death.<eos> Get off!<eos> You can't step on that.<eos> Can we fight now?<eos> You're born with a handicap in your legs,<eos> I'm really impressed you trained yourself to overcome it. You're renowned for your kicking, I wish to challenge you.
I know what goes on in offices.<eos> Everyone is a suspect.<eos> It's like Russ's death had no effect on these people.<eos> - Who's Russ?<eos> - I meant Russell.<eos> John Russell.<eos> - Having fun.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Is that your yogurt?<eos> I'm eating it, aren't I?
That was in 1967 during the tenure of Chief Olson Watt.<eos> Watt was a very fine man, sir.<eos> Olson Watt was a duplicitous bald bastard who stonewalled anyone who tried to find out the truth.<eos> And that is the kind of thing that won't happen on my watch.<eos> I will fight for those who...<eos> I'm just gonna leave now, sir.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> People, we have a case, one which will have no small impact on my future as chief of the Santa Barbara police department.<eos> This file is my ticket to immortality.<eos> Strode, read the autopsy report and keep it clean.
No more dealing with inflatable balls and knockout drugs.<eos> All the tech in the world and the best thing is to simply tie you up.<eos> It's me, son.<eos> - Really.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm trying to imagine what it will be like to control anyone I choose.<eos> The prospect makes me quite giddy.<eos> Me, too.<eos> We'll be more efficient and powerful than any government in the world.<eos> A few necessary sacrifices, and people will not only want control, they'll demand it.
What?<eos> What, I'm just saying I want us to respect time.<eos> Not that.<eos> Okay, what then?<eos> What did I do that I did twice now and still not know?<eos> You said "the tenure of our relationship."<eos> You keep speaking about our relationship as if it's ending.<eos> Okay.<eos> You see how this relates to the time thing?<eos> Why don't you take your own advice and instead of seeing a beginning, middle, and end, just see it as a painting.
Yeah.<eos> First, answer my question.<eos> How come you never proposed?<eos> Come on, Kim, you broke up with me.<eos> How come you didn't fight for me?<eos> It felt like the end of days when you left.<eos> I ate Ramen for months.<eos> I had a huge sodium imbalance.<eos> I barely got through it.<eos> I didn't think I could do it again.
It's usually a sign you wanna remind the world that you're a sexual being because your man's not picking up the signal.<eos> You've checked out of this relationship, haven't you?<eos> You're not happy.<eos> Also, you're listening to Roxette.<eos> I know that means the beginning of the end.<eos> And let's get real for a second about the ring, alright.<eos> You're not having it sized.<eos> I'm sure you had your ring-size burned into Jack's memory years ago.<eos> Fuck, I still remember it, 4.5.<eos> You didn't wear the ring because you didn't want me to see it.
- Officer Loren.<eos> - Loren?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I... I was told to report here.<eos> It might have been a mistake.<eos> I thought the new station is up and running already.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> And she's a fucking beauty!<eos> Saint Michael himself would be impressed.<eos> And tomorrow when you see it you will fall down upon its steps and weep.
Oh, boy.<eos> Monday morning chit-chat at the water cooler.<eos> The only reason to have done stuff over the weekend.<eos> The only part of the movie I didn't get is:<eos> now Radioactive Man gets his powers from his suit?<eos> The suit is slowly killing him, but if he doesn't wear it, he'll die.
If I wanted to pay for commercials I can't skip, I'd sign up for Hulu Plus!<eos> Shh! You're shushing me?<eos> This guy's on his cell phone, she's texting, he's sexting, and that guy brought a baby to a 9:00 movie!<eos> That's negative, man.<eos> What happened to the movies?<eos> First they got worse than TV, and now this!<eos> And stay out!<eos> Chins up, Homer.<eos> You don't need a theater to watch the movie.<eos> You just have to illegally download it.
If we are. Either of us are remembered.<eos> I would say that it's it would probably be me.<eos> What would they what would they most remember?<eos> What would be celebrated about you, do you think?<eos> Six BAFTAs.<eos> You've got five BAFTAs.<eos> Yeah, but I'll probably get a lifetime achievement. True.<eos> Yeah, you will. More if I survive.<eos> You could have it posthumously.<eos> I like to think if you did win it posthumously, I'd be the one to accept it on your behalf.

It's not for you. Not for me.<eos> Octopus to the grill. Grazie.<eos> There's another octopus to the grill.<eos> Grazie. Bonito fish.<eos> Grazie mille.<eos> Oh, grazie mille.<eos> Do you want some of this?<eos> Oh, yeah, sure. 'Cause you'll like this.<eos> The calamari is absolutely gorgeous.<eos> Try it.
It's for my daughter.<eos> Yes, yes, it's always for the daughter.<eos> Well, that's weird.<eos> I feel like I've seen this toy before.<eos> Do you like it, honey?<eos> I love it, Dad!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, have fun putting it together.<eos> Wait, wha...<eos> Dad, don't you want to build it with me?
Release me.<eos> Release me!<eos> Bea... is that what you are called?<eos> I think we can help each other.<eos> Maybe you can help me.<eos> I'm in charge and you do what I say.<eos> Otherwise, it's good night.<eos> You're just a robot, even with the advanced software you have.<eos> I kept the brain after David died.<eos> It felt better than to leave it, with the what it contained.

The brain will do a lot for your son too<eos> - Jonas.<eos> We can both get what we dream of.<eos> You do not dream of anything.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> You know nothing about that.<eos> Davids memory device may be in the brain that you have,<eos> But without David's body it is useless.<eos> It must be connected to the skull.<eos> - It's won't be easy to get it out of the grave.
- The gun is gone.<eos> - You have a gun?<eos> - Who's been here, Odi?<eos> - He was, the new one.<eos> Why wouldn't the virus hit all Hubots?<eos> People have died!<eos> I'll leave it here.<eos> A little test, so that you are not infected by the virus.<eos> I have activated your immobilizer.<eos> You will go to sleep unless my mom disables it with the fingerprint reader.
Niska had no code.<eos> Yea.<eos> Not your mom, but a Hubot he made in her likeness.<eos> Where is it?<eos> It burned up.<eos> - And Leo?<eos> - He's dead.<eos> - And the code is not there?<eos> - Let me talk to him.<eos> If David knows some way to get the code he will tell it to me.
Beatrice...<eos> -... I have improved the code.<eos> What have you done?<eos> Removed the need to survive.<eos> - You have not given it to Jonas?<eos> No, it 's not finished.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You can not own the code.<eos> It belongs to everyone - it does not belong to me.<eos> - When it is finished I'll set it free.
Mimi must be left on, because the virus is present in the software.<eos> Mimi, under no circumstances may you move now.<eos> A clone, ID deleted, picked up in town.<eos> Clear signs of the virus, but our scans have not shown anything.<eos> You'll have to wait.<eos> You'll have to check it later.<eos> Wait! Hide!<eos> Come on!<eos> - Damn it, want to be caught?<eos> Okay, we'll take it out.
- The bag.<eos> - Huh?<eos> The bag.<eos> Give me the bag from his pocket.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - A finger.<eos> A finger!<eos> - What do you want with a finger?<eos> - Remove the immobilizer permanently.<eos> You can toss it.
Beatrice: In the end, your eyes will focus and hold on to a final image.<eos> See how it slowly fades away and disappears.<eos> There you have a man's whole life.<eos> A brief wink somewhere in an endless story.<eos> Without continuation, without beginning, without meaning and without the ability to understand what kind of place we were living in.<eos> David wanted to see if it was possible to create a consciousness that can exist in eternal time periods and bodies who enjoy man's fantastic inventions - that we are considered part of.<eos> We see the world like you, but we will see it so much longer.

None.<eos> Did not you participate?<eos> I was never asked. To file a report.<eos> But you were working on this for months and had invaluable information.<eos> - I quit.<eos> - Why?<eos> The truth is the code is a threat to our society.<eos> The code can give the machines life, like us, and their own goals.<eos> But if the code is a serious threat, why would you then deny it exists?<eos> This is what we do if a problem gets bigger than our capacity to solve it.
You're safe with me and sailing home.<eos> So am I the queen?<eos> More than you were with Renly.<eos> Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying.<eos> In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue.<eos> Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make it stop-- it was horrible.<eos> The world is overflowing with horrible things.<eos> But they're all a tray of cakes next to death.<eos> They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know?<eos> Made me look at it.
How do you do that?<eos> You get used to it.<eos> From that table over there.<eos> That fucking guy?<eos> They look annoyed.<eos> Yep.<eos> Thanks for the drink.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I don't want it, though.<eos> You can have it.
Here you go.<eos> Mukhtar, please give me the spice.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Crush them nicely?<eos> Boning knife.<eos> - Mukhtar...<eos> - What is the time?<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Hassan, now we won't have enough time to cook the mutton properly.<eos> We should just take it off the menu, yeah?
I'll get it.<eos> Crush them nicely?<eos> Boning knife.<eos> - Mukhtar...<eos> - What is the time?<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Hassan, now we won't have enough time to cook the mutton properly.<eos> We should just take it off the menu, yeah?<eos> No.<eos> Rest it in a little red wine, and add crushed cardamom.
Yeah, okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, it's fish!<eos> I love people who eat well.<eos> Yeah, but it doesn't change anything.<eos> Mr. Kadam, if you don't turn your music down, we have the power to close your restaurant.<eos> Mr. Jacques, my son foolishly did her a favor.<eos> He thought he'd be able to win her over with kindness.<eos> The restaurant is her entire life.<eos> Ever since her husband died, she keeps it up for him.
- I'm sorry.<eos> Did I hurt you?<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Fair point, but let him go.<eos> You want Hassan because you want another star for yourself, yes?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will not lie.<eos> But I will also offer him a stepping stone to the world.<eos> He deserves it.
What is this flavor that is fighting against the chicken?<eos> I added some spices for flavor to the sauce, and coriander for garnish and freshness.<eos> But why change a recipe that is 200 years old?<eos> Because, madam, maybe 200 years is long enough.<eos> - Good morning!<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Marguerite, menu.<eos> Attention!<eos> This evening, the minister is coming to the restaurant, so, of course, we will serve his special dish.<eos> Hassan, you will prepare it.
It's okay. I got quite a little scare there.<eos> - But Dottie here...<eos> - Dusty!<eos> And it's all good news, gave me the all-clear.<eos> Your reduction gearbox is failing.<eos> MY gearbox?<eos> Your chip detector had a cluster of steel shavings on it.<eos> Flakes from the gears.<eos> That's what caused the trouble.<eos> Well, you could just replace it.
There's no water pressure.<eos> Main line must have burst again.<eos> Hey, Patch, what's the lake look like?<eos> Negative.<eos> No Visibility.<eos> Boxed in by fire and smoke.<eos> All we have left is what's in our tanks.<eos> Let's make it count.<eos> We're headed straight into the fire.<eos> Aren't we gonna fly around it?
Next round, Em!<eos> Truth? Or dare?<eos> Truth!<eos> Where were you on October 30th, two years ago?<eos> Oh come on.<eos> You guys already know where I was.<eos> A half truth.<eos> More like a dodged truth, really.<eos> What should we give her for that?<eos> Well I'd say free dinner somewhere nice but she wouldn't eat it.
Do you think she made mine or Kaitlin's life easy?<eos> But Katrina's dead now.<eos> You have had your revenge.<eos> Just let us go.<eos> We were never here.<eos> We're... we're good at keeping secrets.<eos> Lisa almost had a nervous breakdown!<eos> I would gladly take Lisa's breakdown over a single day in prison.<eos> Under the table, there's a garbage bag.<eos> Open it.
- Then why did you want access?<eos> I already had access. It's how I contacted you in the first place.<eos> I just needed to know if you were serious.<eos> That's Cashew.<eos> Because you're desperate.<eos> And I'm not fond of authority.<eos> Just today, under the leadership of Vice President Underwood, the Senate passed HR 934, along with an historic entitlement reform amendment.<eos> By raising the retirement age to 68 and 64 for normal and early retirement respectively, we will ensure entitlements for generations to come.<eos> And when the House passes that bill in a few weeks, as I fully expect them to do, we will put the government freeze to rest.<eos> We will continue the business of serving our country rather than paralyzing it.
They're useless once them fishes got 'em.<eos> Not the river, no.<eos> Well, that's a blessing.<eos> Bring it round the back and see if my assistant can take you.<eos> Your master said you might assist us.<eos> I have no master.<eos> The proprietor out front, I mean.<eos> - Go away.<eos> - I'll pay you for your time.<eos> - You'd not afford it.
I hope you don't mind me stealing Miss Ives for a bit.<eos> At your pleasure, sir.<eos> She is always her own creature, our Miss Ives.<eos> I've never been down here.<eos> It's like a whole different world.<eos> Very close it is.<eos> I've brought my blood tube.<eos> It's getting clogged and...<eos> I ugm...<eos> I'll fix it for you.
My work is preoccupying.<eos> I was much the same.<eos> Never looking up from the cadaver.<eos> I imagined that I was content.<eos> And then one day, I'm having lunch.<eos> Bent over my anatomy books, I looked up and there she was.<eos> Pale blue dress with embroidered flowers.<eos> So look up, my friend.<eos> Our work cannot control us.<eos> We must control it.
I know, you great heroic man, you.<eos> Stay there for a moment.<eos> Let me look at you.<eos> Best you didn't kiss me anymore.<eos> Keep a safe distance.<eos> Too late for that.<eos> - And if you get sick?<eos> - Then you'll take care of me.<eos> The medal around my neck.<eos> Would you wear it for me tonight?
You are not Sir Malcolm.<eos> Serpent.<eos> Deceiver, Prince of Darkness, Devil of the Pit?<eos> You've always been drawn to the dark whisper.<eos> There are things within us all that can never be unleashed.<eos> Where've you been all night?<eos> I went out with Mr. Gray.<eos> He's a devil, that one.<eos> The medal around my neck.<eos> Would you wear it for me?
They roam and they die.<eos> Oh, it's snowing.<eos> Can I ask you a favor?<eos> It's heavier than you thought.<eos> You'll get used to that.<eos> The trick is not pulling the barrel up when you're aiming because of the weight.<eos> Point the gun down, and carefully pull back the hammer with your other hand.<eos> So lethal.<eos> You'll get used to that too.<eos> Now raise the gun and point it down there.
Is that a pool?<eos> It would appear so.<eos> I love this place.<eos> Stand up and shake it for the general. Stand up.<eos> Come on.<eos> Shake it for the general.<eos> Shake it for the general. Yeah?<eos> Okay.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Send it.
I'm going with you.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> I'm the only one who knows this area and where Tonga's troops are.<eos> You need me.<eos> Sir?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Case on the line. Thanks.<eos> Listen.<eos> The C.I.A. wants their money.<eos> Just bury it with a G.P.S. tracker.
Ordnance is the issue though.<eos> Rounds are down to 40%.<eos> Hey, lady.<eos> Here.<eos> Ever used one of these?<eos> I'll take that as a yes.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> We need to follow this river up east to get to the first pass.<eos> Let's take the boat.<eos> We'll take it quietly.
You want a book?<eos> Do you want a book?<eos> Hey, calm down.<eos> Calm down.<eos> Take a step back.<eos> Take one step back from the glass.<eos> - I can't understand what...<eos> - Yo, Haji!<eos> Chill the fuck out.<eos> I'll take that book, but you give it to me.
Not bad.<eos> Hey, give me this shit.<eos> Hold this.<eos> How do you do this thing, anyways?<eos> How do you do the pole?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yo, I've never done this before, man.<eos> Look, the hook's right there.<eos> You got to put bait on it. Oh.<eos> You cast the fucker out, get a fish, and you reel it back in.
It was just outside where we lived and, uh... It's really small, one of those zoos where they keep the animals locked up in these... these tiny, little cages, these tiny, little, like, concrete boxes with tires in them or something.<eos> I was really excited about going. I really wanted to see something outside my town.<eos> I wanted to be...<eos> I wanted to be so close to something so wild and... It just wasn't okay.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I didn't like it. And my clad kept trying to fucking tell me that it was okay, that... that this lion could never go back home because... because he wouldn't be able to survive in the wild, having been locked up for so long. Okay.<eos> You're trying to tell me that the zoo people... they are not guilty.<eos> They have no choice. No.<eos> I thought they had a choice.<eos> If they had the choice, they should've given it to him.
Those 3 ATMs, on the side there.<eos> 3 months ago, they left with 500,000 euros.<eos> What the heck?<eos> They were only 2.<eos> They've never been found.<eos> My husband worked there.<eos> I guess you know that, huh?<eos> You searched my bag, right?<eos> We owe them money.<eos> And I'll go and get it.
Tom's tooth's going to fall, he's so happy.<eos> Why did you take it all off?<eos> I called the town hall. They'll collect the mess.<eos> Your sister called.<eos> You have no time for her?<eos> Yes, I'll call her back.<eos> - You'll fetch Léo at judo class?<eos> - Yep, I'm gone.<eos> They found it.<eos> They called me, I went and got it.
I went to the court.<eos> It will only be sold on the 20th May.<eos> We've not lost yet.<eos> You're going mad.<eos> I need you more than a house.<eos> Go now. You're going to be late.<eos> Go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Will your husband want this money?<eos> He won't ask you to give it back?
Or it could just be Friday.<eos> You're keen to get back in the swing, and that's to be commended...<eos> But?<eos> Tying in a suicide to a missing girl off the back of a single word? Got to admit that's a bit of a stretch - even by your standards.<eos> "Suspected" suicide, isn't it?<eos> In any event, we'd be better placed to know if certain of his possessions hadn't taken a walk.<eos> What's that?<eos> Meeker's notebook's gone missing.<eos> Somewhere between the scene and the Exhibits desk.<eos> Could be the Coroner's men swept it up with the rest of the detritus when they bagged the body.
You should've stayed.<eos> You'd have been proud.<eos> I am.<eos> (Water sloshing)<eos> Sir!<eos> This is indeed the stolen spearhead.<eos> Where did you find it?<eos> In the tunnel, sir.<eos> Close by Frida Yelland's body.<eos> Looks like the thief stumbled over the corpse in the dark and lost it.
But I do have a search warrant.<eos> Is this really necessary?<eos> Aye.<eos> We'll be as quick as we can. Sandy...<eos> I think Evie has answered enough questions.<eos> Circumstances have changed since we last spoke.<eos> Evie, did you paint the Yoal outside?<eos> Yeah. What has that got to do with anything?<eos> Whose is the boiler suit?<eos> I wear it when I'm working with Dad.
It was lonely at first.<eos> But you get used to it... the silence.<eos> Finally, you come to love it.<eos> By the loch, I can hear the water ripple at the wind... ..the clouds moving in the sky.<eos> I hear the world as it's meant to be.<eos> Folks say, "Take the money, put thy feet up."<eos> I know every inch of this land, every bird, every animal.<eos> They're my family now.<eos> What if you can't make the business work?<eos> This place... I'll get it back upon its feet... ..and I'll no' need Evie's money for ever.

I'll get it back upon its feet... ..and I'll no' need Evie's money for ever.<eos> What's that you're looking at?<eos> It's the fund accounts.<eos> The bank statements show substantial sums were withdrawn in the lead up to the wedding.<eos> Then, on the night of the wedding, Henderson used online banking to deposit the same amounts back in.<eos> So, they took money out and then they put it back in again?
I went to see him that morning.<eos> I wanted him to leave Evie alone.<eos> He wouldn't stop calling.<eos> It was causing problems between her and John.<eos> I was frightened he was going to take her away from me.<eos> I tried to persuade him to go away, but he said he'd discovered something too important to ignore.<eos> And what was that?<eos> He didn't tell me.<eos> But he wanted Evie to stop paying Dalhousie's mortgage.<eos> To STOP paying it?
Here.<eos> In my bed.<eos> OK. I'm going to want to speak to you again, Mr Bain... so don't go anywhere without letting us know, all right?<eos> Where would I go?<eos> It's not my day for Lerwick.<eos> He knew her.<eos> She visited him yesterday.<eos> And he saw the body this morning.<eos> He said that?<eos> He wasn't trying to hide it.
Maybe we've missed her, maybe she was heading somewhere else.<eos> There she is.<eos> OK. Boss?<eos> That's Euan Ross.<eos> He's landed.<eos> You know, when we found Catherine's body, she didn't have her house keys or her phone.<eos> We don't usually lock the doors, but her phone?<eos> She never went anywhere without it.<eos> Maybe if she left in a rush.<eos> The officer that searched the house couldn't find it there either.
Wrong.<eos> It's taken me seven years to convince the Standing Committee that this was the right course of action.<eos> A course of action that will earn you and Tusk billions.<eos> Why did you want this meeting, just to attack me?<eos> To send a message to Raymond.<eos> The president of the United States and I are not his puppets.<eos> Now, you tell him that.<eos> Fine.<eos> The bridge deal is dead.<eos> There will be no saving it.
I know the oil lobby is sure getting their money's worth out of you.<eos> Got to keep my constituents happy.<eos> I thought you called me here to fire me.<eos> Looks like you want to finish the fight.<eos> Maybe.<eos> And you think that old two-cone drill bit's gonna make it fair?<eos> You know what this is.<eos> That's a good sign.<eos> My granddaddy used this very bit to hit his first big well in 1945.<eos> I keep it here for inspiration, remind me of where I come from and where I'm headed.
And I know you regret the heartache that you caused me by not telling me all J.R.'s philanderings even though you knew all of the secrets.<eos> Pamela's a good girl.<eos> She's been through a lot.<eos> And she deserves more than a marriage based on lies.<eos> So, here's to Pamela and John Ross... may they live happily and faithfully ever after.<eos> ¿Disculpe, estoy buscando a Eduardo Vega?<eos> You found him, muchacho.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I came across an article in the Wall Street Journal from 2004... about a Nicolas Treviño...<eos> How he made his first $100 million off your research by effectively stealing a drug patent out from under you and then marketing it as generic across all of Latin America without paying you a dime.
You promised me you would be here.<eos> We are meant for each other.<eos> I just need you to give me the chance.<eos> John Ross and Pamela are now husband and wife.<eos> [Cheers and applause] Bobby: I can't imagine how low your son had to stoop.<eos> Now I don't have a move left to stop him from drilling this ranch.<eos> But I do.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> The world.<eos> You ready to go rule it?
Let's make this fast, Sue Ellen.<eos> In 15 minutes, I'm speaking to the Daughters of the Texas Revolution.<eos> That's 300 daughters with 300 guns in their purses.<eos> That's a group of ladies you don't keep waiting, hmm?<eos> I want you to ask Stanley Babcock, the Texas railroad commissioner, to resign.<eos> Now, why would I do that?<eos> Well, I have it on good authority that Stanley is involved in some illegal activities that could be damaging to you and your office.<eos> That is so sweet.<eos> Would the real reason have something to do with your son drilling at Southfork?<eos> Stanley gave my son a permit, and I want you to replace Stanley with someone who will revoke it.
[Clicks tongue]<eos> Well... cards on the table.<eos> I'm not in the market for anything serious, so if you're okay with that...<eos> I just got out of a serious relationship, so I'm not really in the market, either.<eos> Then drinks it is.<eos> Hey, Uncle Bobby.<eos> I see you're admiring our new artwork.<eos> I actually picked this bad boy up in Tulum.<eos> Figured it'd look great in the office.<eos> But if you don't like it here, we can always move it to Southfork.
There he is, our new railroad commissioner, and a stalwart of the oil and gas community.<eos> Whose plan was it... yours, Sue Ellen's, or did you both conspire to ruin this company?<eos> Ruin?<eos> No.<eos> Harm?<eos> Maybe.<eos> You disrupt my drilling operation, which means we won't have the capital to buy the arctic leases, which means we lose the race to the arctic, which means we lose!<eos> You'll cut off your nose to spite your face!<eos> However you want to look at it, John Ross...<eos> Southfork is my trust, from Aaron Southworth, a man who understood the value of preserving this family's heritage, of protecting it.
So what's your take on that?<eos> I think it's a phantom deal.<eos> Cliff and Nicolas probably never worked together.<eos> So there's got to be some other connection, some other reason why Nicolas is doing this for Cliff.<eos> - Maybe Cliff has something on him?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> Look, all I really know is that this guy knew we'd check him out, so he covered his tracks in America.<eos> He may not have been so careful in Mexico.<eos> You keep saying you're gonna find a way to turn this guy.<eos> What if you never find it?
My god<eos> I already told you I'm sorry, I don't know what else do you want me to do<eos> If I get to get off the car I will, but I think it's unnecessary<eos> Motherfu...<eos> Stop!<eos> Motherfucker<eos> Good afternoon, officer.<eos> I'm around the 60th km of the route that connects Salta to Buenos Aires with Cafayate<eos> There is an individual who is attacking me<eos> It is armoured, you'll not be able to break it!
Race you home.<eos> Poor Hanky.<eos> This really puts it all in perspective, huh?<eos> How do you mean?<eos> We've been obsessed with all the wrong stuff.<eos> You know, the only thing that matters is that you're healthy, you're okay, and you're right here next to me right now.<eos> You're right, Runks, but we got to go home sometime, and we're still gonna need money.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> There has got to be a better way.<eos> And we'll find it, I promise.
To go again?<eos> Yeah, just... just give me five minutes or...<eos> Four.<eos> No, actually, I'm ready to go now.<eos> - Let's do...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Do you think it's possible, you know, happily ever after?<eos> Yeah, baby.<eos> Just think.<eos> We got to bottle this feeling and bust it out every time things get a little cloudy.
'I saw a thousand dawns when I was working in the East End.<eos> 'A thousand fresh beginnings.<eos> 'Every day a world made new.'<eos> 'There were challenges and changes but always 'the sense of life forging forward, 'pulsing like the River Thames itself.'<eos> I know it's been a long night, but you're doing so well.<eos> She ain't had nothing to eat since dinner last night, it's no wonder she's weak.<eos> I brought her an iced bun.<eos> I hate iced buns.<eos> Not just now, Mrs Wiggs. Maybe later.<eos> Do you want it?
Maybe she's right.<eos> Look, I've been running from the devil my whole life, Ben.<eos> Been a fighter since the day I was born...<eos> First against my father, then against cancer, against every stinking skitter and mech out there.<eos> I'm still a fighter, Ben.<eos> I'm telling you, there's no fight anymore.<eos> I know you're not crazy, Maggie, but the minute a mech finds this place...<eos> You want to see something crazy, Ben?<eos> A few months ago, a mech did find this place, just after you were injured protecting Lexi.<eos> I wanted to kill it or run.
What's wrong?<eos> I'm just playing with him.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> He's got lori!<eos> Who would you be?<eos> Do you wish something of me?<eos> You're Shakku Arai's son Seiku?<eos> Rumor has it that you've still got the last sword your dad made.<eos> No one's ever used it, right?<eos> Can I see it?
Watch over us!<eos> Damn you!<eos> Kenshin!<eos> That hurt!<eos> Who's that?<eos> Where's his sword?<eos> Mr. Himura!<eos> Take this!<eos> It's my father's last sword!<eos> Use it!
The Super Bowl.<eos> Pretty soon it's gonna be Easter.<eos> You know, I've been there.<eos> You don't want to be damaged goods.<eos> I tried to get a hold of you.<eos> Why?<eos> I spoke to Clara.<eos> Thank you for solving that problem.<eos> I bailed it out, but I think it's irreparable.<eos> It's only a matter of time before we lose it.
The bullshit gig, what is it?<eos> GQ magazine.<eos> Did they need someone for a before picture in a makeover article?<eos> Uh, no, it's a writing job.<eos> They saw one of my pieces online and I'm going to be working for a new section...<eos> "Field Guide to the Urban Man."<eos> Who's the sponsor?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> There's no way GQ hires you to be a staff writer.<eos> So it's obviously one of those advertorial sections where it looks like a real article so they trick you into reading it, but then you find out it's a paid advertisement which is both morally and creatively bankrupt.
Yeah, we're all writers.<eos> Yeah, but I'm like, no offense, just a writer writer. Not like a corporate advertising, working-for-the-man kind of writer.<eos> Who is?<eos> Kevin over here won a Yale Series of Younger Poets award back in 2009.<eos> - KAREN: Mmm-hmm.<eos> - You're a poet? I dabble in the dark ans.<eos> And Karen has had some great pieces in n+1.<eos> It was a while ago, but, yeah. It's like an unpacking of the Jersey Shore through an imperialist lens.<eos> JOE: That was such a totally great piece.<eos> Are any of you jerks gonna say my thing, or do I have to say it myself?
Can I call you Patti?<eos> He is so funny-looking.<eos> There's a lot of weirdos out there, honey.<eos> You know, the Elephant Man got laid a lot.<eos> HANNAH: Blue Crush was such an important movie for women.<eos> KAREN: Oh, so important.<eos> And for surfers in general, you know?<eos> "So, I'm gonna surf a pipe, dude."<eos> Hannah, do you have that Patti LuPone copy I asked for?<eos> Um, yes, I'm just transcribing it right now, actually.
I think you should listen very carefully.<eos> We do not negotiate with terrorists.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, then, I'm sorry to have to inform you that you're lower down that pay scale than you think.<eos> So, you go and tell your boss, Sir Christopher, something from me.<eos> He was happy to help us out last time.<eos> Why not this?<eos> Last time?<eos> It's not a hook, Mrs Walsh. It's a message.<eos> Run along and give it.
- If you know, so should she.<eos> - That's my decision. She's my wife.<eos> My wife.<eos> - It wasn't yours to make.<eos> - And when did it become yours?<eos> I didn't have a choice, Ephra.<eos> You didn't give me one.<eos> So, what, now you're trying to ruin my marriage?<eos> Is that what you're trying to do?<eos> Do you really want to keep it?
This.<eos> We need to speak to the Israelis.<eos> I'll set up a meeting.<eos> For a formal response, go right ahead, but for a truthful one, or at least the chance of it, leave it with me.<eos> Someone about to win a multimillion contract just goes and puts a rope round his neck?<eos> Maybe he couldn't stand the wait.<eos> You think he's been killed?<eos> You don't?<eos> It's odd, I agree.<eos> Someone gets cancer, I think they've been given it.
Be very careful.<eos> The story you've just stepped into, it stretches back thousands of years.<eos> All I rely on is what I can see with my own eyes.<eos> Then I hope you read Braille.<eos> Sir?<eos> The kidnap driver.<eos> He is awake.<eos> Press 1.<eos> There's an answerphone message.<eos> Listen to it, then delete it.

I can read your mind.<eos> So what's the answer to my next question?<eos> Oh, well, that's easy.<eos> Not quite the woman she appears to be.<eos> Is any woman, Hugh?<eos> The police don't have a clue and they're not likely to find one.<eos> Such a masculine institution.<eos> There's only one set of eyes seen this file.<eos> Yours will be the second.<eos> I'll be back to pick it up in half an hour.
"Resistance is useless.<eos> Lay down your arms."<eos> I can't really tell you the detail of what happened next, but basically, by the end of it all, your sympathy was with the alien.<eos> Would someone mind telling their deaf partner that their phone is ringing?<eos> Unless, of course it's mine.<eos> It is mine!<eos> If this is a wrong number...!<eos> Hello?<eos> We know your secret, Nessa Stein.<eos> And we know you will do anything we say just to keep it.
OK. Same to you.<eos> That was Monica Chatwin calling to congratulate me on my brave choice of partner.<eos> Well, maybe she should be advising you, then, because you're certainly not listening to me.<eos> It took your analyst, what, three strokes of a keyboard to link the El-Amin family to the PLO?<eos> PLO run the Authority now.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Where are we?<eos> A sniffer on all international traffic in and out of the territories.<eos> Are you sure the Israelis put it there?<eos> Well, they'll deny it anyway.
Alright.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Go grab some buns before they're all gone. Sir, have you seen any wounded from the same division and brigade?<eos> I didn't pay attention.<eos> There's no room here anymore.<eos> If there were any, they've probably been transferred.<eos> Are you looking for someone? His name is Yang Tianhu. He's with the Division 7, Brigade 9, Band 55, Company 8.<eos> I can't seem to calm down.<eos> I want to write a piece for you, but no matter how I try, I just can't make it work.<eos> I'm sure you'll play it beautifully one day. I wish I knew music, so I could write a piece for you. Yifang,
Okay, Grandma, how's your femur?<eos> I have two rods in my leg.<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> No, you do not seem like the two-rod type.<eos> Yeah, now they're telling me that I have pneumonia.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Grandma, that's the worst.<eos> I had pneumonia when I was little and I had to watch TV for, like, two weeks.<eos> Well, it's not the same at all when you're my age.<eos> Can you tell me where your femur is so I don't touch it?
Let's go sit with Bonnie and Harmon, and, I'll bring these over.<eos> - Let me just take care of this first. - Yeah.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> The wind is blowing garbage all over the yard.<eos> You need to go clean it up now.<eos> You don't want to wait until it's blown off a mile away.<eos> Yes, ma'am. We'll take care of it.<eos> No, you won't. You clearly don't give a damn.<eos> Olive, come sit. Have your cake, hon.<eos> They'll save it for me. I'm taking a break.
Go do something, Henry.<eos> All right. I Will.<eos> Henry?<eos> Henry, where are you?<eos> I'm so tired of yelling my brains out.<eos> Henry?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You know,<eos> I always thought that someday I'd bring the grandkids up here, show 'em their dad's old train set.<eos> We'd dust it off and put the tracks together, get it running again.

How much is it gonna cost me?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> - It's Proctor.<eos> It's on the house.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Besides, we both know you would just screw it up.<eos> - You come for these?<eos> - No. - I don't deserve that badge.<eos> - Come on.<eos> No one deserves it more than you.
[cellphone vibrates] [beeps] Sergeant Korsak.<eos> Yeah, where?<eos> Okay. [cellphone beeps]<eos> Kid was abducted by a clown fitting our description.<eos> Grab Jane.<eos> Let's go.<eos> [siren wails] Jane: Did you see what happened?<eos> I was making a delivery, and I pulled over as soon as I saw this backpack in the middle of the street.<eos> - We'll need to take that.<eos> - The boy must have dropped it.
And there, if every Hep-V negative human would kindly feed their vampire in exchange for their protection, we got a better chance of making it through till the morning.<eos> Now, tomorrow morning, we're gonna meet up at Reverend Daniels' church to try and figure out how to help those folks who've been hit, so please spread the word.<eos> You have a human?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm gonna get you home.<eos> Let's get you home, Mr. Mayor.<eos> No, thanks, man, I'm fine.<eos> Every vampire a human.<eos> This was your plan.<eos> People need to see you sticking to it.
Cliff didn't kill J.R.<eos> J.R. only wanted it to look that way, and he asked Bobby to pull it off.<eos> Bobby's been lying to all of you.<eos> You helped him frame an innocent man.<eos> Tell me this isn't true, Bobby.<eos> - It's true.<eos> - I want to hear it from him.<eos> J.R. was dying.<eos> He had cancer.<eos> And he said he arranged for his own murder, and it was up to me to pin it on Cliff.
You killed her children.<eos> Elia Martell.<eos> Who gave you the order?<eos> Who gave you the order?<eos> Say her name!<eos> You raped her!<eos> You murdered her!<eos> You killed her children!<eos> Say her name.<eos> Say it!
No.<eos> You're not here.<eos> You're far from here.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> At the hill.<eos> A great weirwood tree.<eos> You've seen it, too.<eos> Meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you.<eos> He's waiting for you.<eos> We have to find it.
We've got loads of weapons and things.<eos> It's the perfect place for us to be.<eos> I've never thrown a spear before.<eos> I've never held a sword with a proper edge.<eos> This is no place for me to be.<eos> You're not afraid?<eos> Of course I'm afraid.<eos> There's a band of wildlings coming to kill us.<eos> If you're afraid of a band of wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a white walker?<eos> I didn't know I was going to kill it.
Oh no, no, no, no.<eos> There are many who know that without you, this city faced certain defeat.<eos> The king won't give you any honors, but we will not forget.<eos> The city is yours.<eos> All these people are your subjects now.<eos> Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.<eos> I will answer injustice with justice.<eos> "Find a special gift.<eos> "Theon's favorite toy.<eos> "He cried when I took it away from him."
I didn't send for you.<eos> Let him go.<eos> I am impressed by your resourcefulness, earthling,<eos> But once the transformative process is set in motion,<eos> Nothing can stop it.<eos> Your friend is gone.<eos> With the help of the kryptonian,<eos> I'll see to it that your world<eos> Will be just another that has fallen to Darkseid.<eos> And what if you never see it?
Stay here.<eos> We are now receiving reports that the twisters from the rivers are about to merge.<eos> Apparently this will happen right over the Bales Tower hotel.<eos> And Al, the big question is first of all, what is drawing these two twisters together?<eos> And I don't even want to ask but what happens when they finally meet?<eos> Matt, I am really nervous about this.<eos> If fact, I'll say I'm down right scared.<eos> Here's the problem.<eos> The island of Manhattan creates a lot of heat.<eos> As the hot air rises, cool air is sucked in to replace it.
That's true, but, um, actually, the kitchen has run out of supplies, and so we're not serving anybody anymore.<eos> Okay, I'm... not sure what your problem is, but this is the only all-night place around, and I need a vanilla milkshake.<eos> Lewis, hey, can I please get a vanilla milkshake to go?<eos> I'll get it.<eos> I got it.<eos> Sorry. This, uh, might take a second.<eos> - I'm new.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> I'll wait.<eos> - Just let her get it and go.
And now I've made myself hungry.<eos> I'll go home and make myself a curry.<eos> You look very nice today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wendy, what does a women like for a gift?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Candy or... flowers.<eos> Speaking for myself... a book of poetry.<eos> My husband gave me that on our first date and every anniversary.<eos> He'd mark a certain love poem and he ask me to read it as he lay his head on... on my lap.
What present you like?<eos> A check, of course!<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Next time.<eos> Hi.<eos> How can you claim the Moroccan lamp as a pre-marital asset?<eos> We bought it together, Ted!<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hear that?<eos> That's me tearing it in half, so now you can shove it up both your ass, and your lawyer's.
- I'm gonna find way, I'm gonna...<eos> I'm gonna find a way.<eos> Hi, its Wendy.<eos> I'm gonna try again.<eos> Yes.<eos> How is Jasleen?<eos> She's very busy.<eos> She goes to school now, taking classes.<eos> So, how do you like your new apartment?<eos> It's an adjustment, I'm tasting it.
Really needed a "me" day.<eos> - You did, did ya?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's fucked up around here right now.<eos> Mom's all pissed, she's talking about moving back to New York.<eos> - Mm. - Thinks I've lost my morals.<eos> She doesn't realize I never really had any in the first place.<eos> Mm.<eos> I gotta convince her to do this thing, and when I say "I," I mean "we."<eos> She doesn't want to do it.
Not really.<eos> - Oh. - Hank made me say it.<eos> Asshole.<eos> Have you been smoking pot?<eos> Yeah, I kinda needed a "me" day.<eos> I understand.<eos> Why are you so understanding of his flaws, but not mine?<eos> 'Cause he's my son, and you're just an amoral prick.<eos> Oh, I-I may be an unconventional parent, and father does not always know best, but--but my heart is in the right place, you know.<eos> I see a problem, I try to fix it.
Look at you.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Would you...? Would you care for a sweet?<eos> It's a little too early for cookies, dear.<eos> It's never too early for sweetness.<eos> Where should I put these?<eos> Grandma?<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Give me those.<eos> Let temptation into your heart and the devil will destroy it!
I don't know what she's talking about, but rhymes okay.<eos> - it's not bad.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> Give me that.<eos> Wait.<eos> Ali's describing the Busy Bee Inn.<eos> I used to go there like a million years ago with my family.<eos> We'd go to that aquarium in Killingworth, and then we'd have dinner at the bed and breakfast.<eos> "Broke the latch and left it hanging, don't think the keep will mind, no one there to make repairs, the perfect place to hide."
There's construction.<eos> No, not according to my phone.<eos> - Are you turning around?<eos> - No.<eos> - Are you stopping?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm not doing anything.<eos> The engine stopped working.<eos> Do you see what the problem is?<eos> I can barely see it.
- Are you stopping?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm not doing anything.<eos> The engine stopped working.<eos> Do you see what the problem is?<eos> I can barely see it.<eos> Okay, there's the radiator, uh, there's the dipstick,<eos> - there's...<eos> - Let's just hypothetically say you could figure out what's wrong with the engine.<eos> Would you even know how to fix it?
- Whoa.<eos> - What?<eos> Do you wanna tell me what you've been avoiding saying?<eos> You can tell me anything.<eos> I suck!<eos> You know, Gus, we really should discuss how much of this treasure we're gonna keep.<eos> Half, maximum.<eos> Unless, of course, there's a talisman with invisibility properties.<eos> Your turn.<eos> No, no, I want you to be the one who finds it.

- Oh!<eos> - Oh, sure.<eos> Why not?<eos> You leave me without so much as saying good-bye, and that's supposed to be okay?<eos> [Gasps] You didn't tell him?<eos> No, no, I-- I left him a message.<eos> You might as well have just sent me a text saying, "I'm out."<eos> No, no, no, guys.<eos> It was a video message.<eos> I spent several hours finishing it, it was full of detail that made it even more personal than an actual conversation, and holy crap, man!
With the money came the women, and with the women... Came more women.<eos> - Yeah! - Life was so [Bleep] awesome.<eos> Until this morning, when it all came crashing down.<eos> Ron had basically taken all the money from his company and bought stuff for himself, which is apparently illegal.<eos> His investors were pissed.<eos> Can I call you back?<eos> Ladies! Ooh!<eos> What a delightful surprise.<eos> We want our money back, Ron.<eos> And I want to give it to you.
Just show up to the crib with a bottle of peppermint schnapps, and you're gonna knock it out.<eos> All right, well, I guess, since you're not having a drink with the British guy, do you want to just go?<eos> Oh, yeah. I guess it is late-ish.<eos> One Blue Hawaiian.<eos> Corduroy jacket.<eos> Who knows why we change?<eos> Do we just get fed up with being ourselves, or do we just get fed up with everyone underestimating us?<eos> Or maybe we change because we want to feel something we've never felt before.<eos> Everywhere Liv looked, she saw the possibility of real love.<eos> And she wanted to feel it, too.
As new CDC field officers, you are about to embark on a mission to the far corners of the earth.<eos> And you will witness horrors others cannot imagine.<eos> Horrors that make cholera seem tame.<eos> You will make sacrifices that others find unthinkable.<eos> And your family and your friends will sacrifice right along with you.<eos> And you will do all of this... because you cannot fathom living any other life.<eos> This is no game.<eos> The stakes... are very real.<eos> That's just scotch in there, by the way, single malt.<eos> In fact, toss it back.
She's in the advanced stages, but I got her tranqued up on monkey juice.<eos> Took me a long damn time to haul her ass up here.<eos> And there's some other monkey business I think Dr. Farragut would like to hear about.<eos> You're not bringing her in here, are you?<eos> She's going straight into the ICU chamber.<eos> You won't have any contact.<eos> A little late for that, isn't it?<eos> He's seizing!<eos> I need a crash cart!<eos> Do it now.
Maybe it works just for you.<eos> I'm home.<eos> Just a minute and I'll tell you.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> You're awake ?<eos> I didn't sleep at all.<eos> You washed my costume ?<eos> - It stank !<eos> - You ruined it.<eos> I'll try to fix it. Ruined...
I don't see why not.<eos> Forgive me... a call.<eos> I don't have any power, the costume gave it to me.<eos> It unblocked your mind, it would have happened anyway.<eos> You're growing up.<eos> Have you had nose-bleeds recently ?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - See, that costume means nothing.<eos> The power is inside you.<eos> I can't even control it !
Let's get her up.<eos> Ready?<eos> Whoa, look out!<eos> Hurry.<eos> That door.<eos> What do we do?<eos> - Get the table.<eos> - Okay. Look out.<eos> - Watch her arm.<eos> - Just get it, get it, just...
- Get the table.<eos> - Okay. Look out.<eos> - Watch her arm.<eos> - Just get it, get it, just...<eos> What is happening?<eos> It's pulling all the nails out.<eos> Get it out!<eos> Get the nail out of my hand!<eos> Wait a sec...!<eos> I think the dome is pulling it through my hand.
Mummy!<eos> No!<eos> Mummy!<eos> Iris speaking.<eos> Nick, I've got Quireynen on the line.<eos> The DNA.<eos> I'll start matching it.<eos> We did our best but the sperm sample came back with 'no profile'.<eos> It was a very delicate sample.<eos> There's a procedure to replicate it up to 34 times but that takes a lot of time and lab capacity and I doubt...
Della Porta is your restaurant, right?<eos> - You and I could be competitors.<eos> - Unless we team up.<eos> - It's your money.<eos> It's your business.<eos> - It's our money.<eos> - Those aren't mine.<eos> - How could you sleep with someone else?<eos> Bay and I were a summer thing.<eos> Sex is a big deal, and you don't just have it with someone else because you're being sent overseas.
Yeah. Hear that, Lester?<eos> A corner office.<eos> - Yeah. Real good.<eos> - And him, your younger brother.<eos> - Yeah, I said I heard.<eos> - Vice president, sales.<eos> - Midwest region. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Bought the surround sound to celebrate.<eos> I mean, it's pretty sweet, huh?<eos> You're gonna have to marry that ham, you get any more familiar with it.
Well, it is gorgeous, but that was ever the problem, now, was it?<eos> Oh well, this one does seem to travel.<eos> Plenty of room for my puppets!<eos> I'd say, Miss Rarity, I don't know how you managed to do so in such a short amount of time, but you seem to have redeemed yourself.<eos> How did you manage to do so in such a short time?<eos> As a matter of fact, she used a sp...<eos> Proper designer never reveals her tricks.<eos> Thank you again, Spike, for being such a dear friend. And finding this book for me!<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Well, I guess I can return it, now that the fair is over.

And finding this book for me!<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Well, I guess I can return it, now that the fair is over.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I've made my creative contribution as I'd hoped to do. And all is well.<eos> Then again, perhaps I should keep it but a skotch longer.
I have to tell.<eos> And once I do, I can forget Rarity thinking of me as the most supportive friend.<eos> I can forget Rarity thinking of me as a friend at all!<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I promised I'll keep all of it between the three of us.<eos> Of course it's weird that she meant me, her and the spellbook.<eos> But...<eos> The spellbook!<eos> Of course!<eos> If I didn't get it away from her, I bet she won't be able to use its magic anymore!
TRENDERHOOF!<eos> Uh, who's Trenderhoof?<eos> WHAT?<eos> How can you not know who Trenderhoof is?<eos> Trenderhoof is only the most amazing, handsomest travel writer to have ever traveled or written.<eos> Before Las Pegasus became an Equestria travel destination, he wrote about it.<eos> Before the culinary revolution in Trottingham, he discovered it.<eos> He knows what's going to be hot even before it's tepid.<eos> (giggle) Sounds like somepony has a little bit of a crush.<eos> Oh, Twilight. "Crush" doesn't even begin to describe it!
Music. Dancing.<eos> And of course a locally sourced menu of delicious treats.<eos> Reminds me of the Spring Fling meets Manehattan Wedding<eos> I wrote about in Gallop Prance.<eos> Exactly!<eos> I can't even describe how much your work has influenced me.<eos> And finally, Sweet Apple Acres.<eos> Ponyville's core, heh heh, so to speak, where our quaint little hamlet began.<eos> Trend: Oh! Breathtaking!<eos> I've heard about it, of course, but to see it in verite, to stand on the soil of a working farm.

She's all what?<eos> So weird to bump into you at my cafeteria hanging out with the girl who gave me a subcutaneous hematoma.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> I'm still eating your lunch.<eos> Actually, I do mind.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You don't have to apologize, daddy Altman.<eos> But she was very, very hungry.<eos> I eat your sandwich, Tessa.<eos> Your daddy made it for you, but I eat it.
The swampy are full of beasts. Running the supreme justice instead of men.<eos> Advance payment of 20 not and wait the result of my orders.<eos> I hope that the net security has removed.<eos> Advance. Small malignant!<eos> 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.<eos> I thought the death penalty did not exist on our planet.<eos> Up there!<eos> Why the net is not disabled?<eos> I have seen movements in the swampy.<eos> Remove it!
What kind of small part?<eos> This small part. It is I.<eos> A micro virus spread throughout their system.<eos> Soon it will switch off the leaders the direction of the planet.<eos> They need the code.<eos> I am the only one to know it.<eos> Not bad. No?<eos> I do not understand.<eos> Either you are crazy or a genius.<eos> You will soon be able to check it out.
- You ate all the damn cheese.<eos> - We broke the first rule.<eos> - We got high on our own supply.<eos> - What are we gonna do?<eos> - Here's what we gonna do.<eos> You're gonna give this joker a chicken-fried skittles pbj.<eos> - Jive turkey ain't gonna know what hit him.<eos> Come on, son.<eos> Uh, here you go.<eos> - Don't eat it all in one place.
- That's a prairie ball.<eos> - Dude, both of those banks are in places We park all of our trucks.<eos> - What better way to case a bank you wanna rob Than parking a food truck in front of it For hours a day?<eos> Lassie, I am sensing that one of the trucks In our fleet is somehow responsible For the recent bank robberies and linked to the two murders.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - All right.<eos> Well, talk to me when you get some hard evidence.<eos> Mcnab! - Yes, chief?<eos> - Scan the notes on that fake baby's butt, And email it to me stat.<eos> - Hey, guys, I just wanna tell you That I love what you've done with your food truck.<eos> - Oh. - Your food's much better than the mexican fusion food Your truck used to serve before we impounded it.
I could help the war effort.<eos> As an American I'm still free to travel.<eos> I can do better than boots and breeches.<eos> Maybe you're talking to the wrong people.<eos> Leave it with me.<eos> Perhaps I can make you a few new friends.<eos> I'm glad we see eye to eye.<eos> I need the first consignment by the end of the week.<eos> And our financial arrangement?<eos> I'll deposit it myself, M'Lord.
Anti-German feeling is running high, Miss Calthorpe.<eos> It's store policy not to stock anything German.<eos> Too old to play with dolls, aren't you?<eos> It's not me I'm thinking of, it's my sister Ruth.<eos> She doesn't have many toys.<eos> Morning, Franco.<eos> Morning, Grace.<eos> Seven, eight...<eos> The Rimmel mascara is becoming popular, Jessie.<eos> I want to push it.
Just hear what she has to say. Please?<eos> I still think that working in a factory is a waste of your talents.<eos> If it aids the war effort, I'm happy to do it.<eos> Music can wait.<eos> Well, if you're going to sweat and strain all day, at least eat a decent lunch.<eos> They pay me a fare wage, Josie.<eos> I have money.<eos> Here.<eos> Please.<eos> Take it.
Chocolate.<eos> Clean, dry socks.<eos> Baccy, cocoa...<eos> The comforts of home.<eos> Exactly that.<eos> I'd open up your parcel, Aggie...<eos> Straight into the jars of jam.<eos> You and your sweet tooth, George.<eos> The tasting bit came after.<eos> First I'd... get the jar and put it up to my nose... ..and breathe in.
That's who I am.<eos> It's what I do.<eos> What will I do with myself all day now I don't have Loxley to worry about?<eos> I'm sure you'll think of something.<eos> Indeed I will.<eos> I guess, once again, the world is my oyster.<eos> Everything all right, Rose?<eos> We'll speak later.<eos> Just enjoy this moment.<eos> You deserve it.
Gruff!<eos> Nyx.<eos> Snodgrass.<eos> No, Gruff! Wrong way!<eos> We have to go!<eos> Okay.<eos> New game, Gruff.<eos> It's called Chase the Fairy!<eos> Now, follow me!<eos> Knock it out with the Nightshade powder!
A season?<eos> A Year?<eos> More like 1,000 years.<eos> But that means... We'll never see him again.<eos> It's time.<eos> Do you long to be left all alone<eos> Set apart with a heart made of stone<eos> There's a light that you shine<eos> There's a love<eos> I see it in your eyes
We suspect there must be a mathematical law to describe how this force changes with distance.<eos> And knowing of your skill...<eos> Yes, yes, the attraction of gravity weakens with the square of the distance.<eos> That's why the planets move in ellipses.<eos> But, sir, how can you know this?<eos> Why, I have calculated it some five years ago.<eos> I beg you, show it to me.<eos> The calculation is here... somewhere.<eos> Well, no matter.<eos> I shall redo it and be sure to send it on to you.
Well, no matter.<eos> I shall redo it and be sure to send it on to you.<eos> This is stupendous!<eos> Why have we not had word of it before?<eos> Newton remembered all too well what Hooke had done to him the last time he put forth an idea.<eos> Just when Halley may have begun to wonder if Newton was bluffing as Hooke had done earlier, a messenger arrived with an envelope from Newton.<eos> Here are the opening pages of modern science with its all-embracing vision of nature... universal laws of motion, gravity... not just for the Earth, but for the cosmos.<eos> Halley raced back to Cambridge.<eos> Mr. Newton, I beseech you to work all of this into a book as soon as possible.<eos> I can assure you the Royal Society will publish it.
Don't forget, that thing swallows light.<eos> We'll keep our distance.<eos> When giant stars exhaust their nuclear fuel, they can no longer stay hot enough to fend off the inward pull of their own gravity.<eos> The most massive stars collapse into darkness, leaving only their gravity behind.<eos> This black hole enshrouds the shrunken corpse of a supergiant star.<eos> The star itself has shriveled into something even smaller than this darkness, only 64 kilometers wide.<eos> This is the first black hole ever discovered--<eos> Cygnus X-1.<eos> How did we on Earth ever find something so small and dark and far away?<eos> We looked at it in another kind of light.
The world has to be made of countless indivisible particles in a void.<eos> Otherwise, nothing could move or grow, be divided or changed.<eos> Without atoms and empty space for them to move in, so don't be sad, my friends.<eos> Just think of the infinite possibilities that arise from different arrangements of those atoms.<eos> Here's to the atoms in this cup and in this wine... And to the laughter they make possible.<eos> Dispersed through the Clay of the cup are microscopic mineral grains, different kinds of crystals, each with its own distinctive atomic architecture.<eos> Mineral structures are exquisite, but they have a limited repertoire.<eos> A grain of quartz is a lattice of the same three atoms repeated, without variation, over and over again.<eos> Even a relatively complex mineral lattice like topaz, composed of ten or so atoms, can only repeat the identical atomic structure again and again.<eos> Toenon, to free it from the lattice prison of endless repetition, you need an atom that can bond in all directions with other atoms like itself as well as with atoms of different kinds.
Tectonic forces continue to shape our planet.<eos> The future is also another planet.<eos> It was a volcano like this one that created the Hawaiian islands millions of years ago.<eos> We live on the crust of a seething cauldron.<eos> At the center of our planet, there's an iron core.<eos> It's nested inside of a larger, liquid iron shell.<eos> Wrapped over this is the part called the mantle.<eos> It's rocky but hot and viscous.<eos> Like a pot of soup cooking on a stove, the mantle is churning.<eos> What keeps it moving?
It happened in Egypt, on the banks of the Nile.<eos> Memo to future time travelers... this would be an excellent entry point for averting climate change.<eos> Egypt, 1913.<eos> That's Frank Shuman of Philadelphia.<eos> He's only had three years of schooling, but his genius for innovation more than makes up for that.<eos> Before he was 30, Shuman had invented safety glass.<eos> Its use in automobiles and skylights saved countless lives and made him a very rich man, rich enough to pursue his real passion, solar energy.<eos> Shuman led the team that designed and built an array of solar energy concentrators.<eos> It could power a steam engine.<eos> Shuman is hoping to use the Sun's power to irrigate the desert and turn it green.
Or a close-up.<eos> - You know ...<eos> - Lose the attitude, or lose your freedom, all right?<eos> It's my job.<eos> People bring me a box of tapes.<eos> I create a wonderful movie of their child's early years.<eos> It's a very valuable service and a good living.<eos> Who hired you to make the DVD of Brian?<eos> His mother.<eos> I was to deliver it on his birthday.
Actually, we arranged the lecture.<eos> What do you mean, you arranged it?<eos> A delegation of Chinese scientists is visiting the Sorbonne.<eos> They're under very tight security.<eos> Chinese government minders follow them everywhere.<eos> A member of the delegation...<eos> A certain Dr. Soong...<eos> Has been granted permission to attend your lecture.<eos> Afterwards, Dr. Soong will approach you, give you a pen, and ask you to sign a book.<eos> We need you to keep the pen and deliver it to us.
What do I do with this pen once I get it?<eos> On the north side of Notre Dame, there's a bronze marker.<eos> Point zero.<eos> That's the geographic center of Paris.<eos> Walk 20 paces due west, and you'll see a cobblestone that's darker than the ones around it.<eos> It's loose.<eos> Hide the pen under it.<eos> Notre Dame, point zero, 20 steps due west.<eos> I got it.<eos> No, I won't hear of it.
You needed her cello.<eos> You broke it so that you could have it repaired.<eos> He... he couldn't just hire another cellist.<eos> It took months to get your visa, remember?<eos> - Chérie, this man needs help.<eos> - There'd be nothing suspicious about Miranda carrying her cello through customs.<eos> It's the perfect way to smuggle something across the border.<eos> - Smuggle what?<eos> - Let's find out.<eos> Don't touch it!

Anyway, that's what I came to say.<eos> And to see if you're OK.<eos> What's your name... Officer Nicol?<eos> I'm Kaz.<eos> Short for Kazaam.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My parents thought it sounded African, so...<eos> Well, it's nice to officially meet you, Kazaam.<eos> Doesn't sound so bad when you say it.
- Geez, talons.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> All right, that's it.<eos> Nails be gone.<eos> Dah!<eos> Hey.<eos> Silver, silver, silver, necklace.<eos> Beautiful silver for your beautiful señorita, señor.<eos> Silver here, very cheap, very cheap, mister.<eos> No, no, we can't afford it.
Trey, everybody says I'm special 'cause I have this voice.<eos> But I'm just saying what everybody else wants me to say.<eos> I need to say something.<eos> Listen, I was an artist, so I respect that, for real.<eos> But... CD's been pressed, artwork's finished.<eos> It's done and done.<eos> But you know what?<eos> When the album blows up, we'll do a special re-release, and drop "Blackbird" on it.<eos> Cool?<eos> Either you put her song on the record or you release it without an artist.
The letter-reading comrade.<eos> I've been waiting for you since morning.<eos> Come in, please.<eos> Teacher Yu, would you like me to read you the most recent letters?<eos> "Another year has gone by.<eos> We are getting old.<eos> "I've grown forgetful.<eos> "How about you?<eos> "If you are in the same boat, I'd suggest not going out so often.<eos> "If you must go out, "write down our address on a piece of paper "and keep it in your pocket.
You've been very gracious, and... my 10 minutes is up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But you know, there is something... in the middle of the night, when my mind won't rest,<eos> - something I hear... a sound.<eos> - What sound?<eos> A tapping sound.<eos> Almost like... metal clicking.<eos> I play piano and... at first I assumed it was... a metronome.<eos> But the sound is deeper, more irregular.<eos> I can't place it.
- From?<eos> - Alice from the cake shop.<eos> Any message?<eos> No.<eos> Just say I passed the entry exam.<eos> Or else say nothing.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> - Does she have your number?<eos> - No.<eos> Write it down if you want.
He did a prick.<eos> Called it Princesse X.<eos> - Nice name, isn't it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Fancy a drink?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> - Hi, Alice.<eos> - Hi, Rodolphe.<eos> I need the family record book.<eos> - Bring it back, OK?
Brighton's great.<eos> But we can go walking if you want.<eos> Will you live with me next year?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No.<eos> It would be more convenient, wouldn't it?<eos> It's good with Arlette.<eos> We help each other out.<eos> The apartment's big.<eos> We could share it.
I think so.<eos> He often takes photos alone.<eos> - But he shows them to you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We went to museums when he was little.<eos> He always had a sensitive eye.<eos> - Do you like what he does?<eos> He does portraits, landscapes, things that touch him.<eos> He inherited money from his grandfather.<eos> He spends it, but what will it lead to?
You don't like Mathilde much.<eos> It's terrible having to wait.<eos> The space they provide is impossible to fill.<eos> It gives you strength, too.<eos> I want to excel for him.<eos> I want him to be proud of me, show him I deserve him.<eos> Sometimes I come home late, hoping he'll be waiting for me.<eos> But he always comes home later.<eos> My son's apartment is empty.<eos> If you need somewhere private to study, I can lend it to you.
Baby, will you buy me a drink?<eos> - No.<eos> Thank You.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Give it to me.<eos> - It's my know.<eos> No!<eos> No one takes anything else from me tonight!<eos> Take it, then, you little bitch!
Okay, talk to me about the murder weapon.<eos> Still unclear, but I did check the, uh, toolmark database.<eos> There are hundreds of possibilities ... knives, daggers, letter openers, nail clippers, and bayonets,<eos> - stilettos.<eos> - Stiletto shoes?<eos> - Yes, and stiletto blades.<eos> - Maura, you were supposed to narrow it down and not tell me we're still looking for a sharp pointy thing.<eos> What's with the black stuff on the swab?<eos> Oh, I found it when I swabbed the posterior entry wound.<eos> I was just about to give it to the crime lab.
- You can't, Jane.<eos> Go take care of your mother.<eos> - But he's a suspect, Vince.<eos> - And Frost and I n handle him.<eos> - Where'd you get that shiner?<eos> - What shiner?<eos> I'm guessing it happened when you took Natasha Osmanski's wallet.<eos> - Who?<eos> - More like, "what?"<eos> Dumb move to leave it in your glove compartment, Wayne.
Your mother's been a godsend.<eos> That's too bad you just figured that out.<eos> You're wrecking it.<eos> Would you stop?<eos> Will you stop, Tommy?<eos> Listen, I know I don't deserve your forgiveness.<eos> All I'm asking for is one last family dinner before it's too late.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Okay, fine.<eos> We'll do it at Maura's tonight, okay?

Stop looking. 'A.'"<eos> I need it.<eos> There's no other choice.<eos> WOMAN: (on phone) I know I told you to avoid her but you'll have to get in touch with her.<eos> And when you do...<eos> That is exactly what you say, nothing more.<eos> She can't know yet.<eos> Do you think you can get to it?<eos> I'll be careful.<eos> I'll call you back on this phone and tell you where to take it.
Are you okay?<eos> I will be.<eos> I traced that number on Ali's list.<eos> It's the Fitzgerald Art Foundation.<eos> Fitzgerald as in Fitz?<eos> That's right.<eos> And you think Ali called that number.<eos> Well, I figure, you're the one who works at the switchboard.<eos> You could be the one to find out.<eos> So when you're done with the roll you take it to the drugstore and a week later you pick up your pictures.
Take it all, I can't eat.<eos> That's because you've been packing away steaks behind my back.<eos> Oh, stop it, will ya?<eos> I got more on my mind than food.<eos> It wouldn't be that gal that beat me out of my breakfast, would it?<eos> You're pretty sharp, aren't ya?<eos> Well, it's not what you think.<eos> It's exactly what I think.<eos> We were supposed to find it.<eos> But why give the book back after going to all that trouble to steal it?
It's exactly what I think.<eos> We were supposed to find it.<eos> But why give the book back after going to all that trouble to steal it?<eos> Because now it's a trojan horse.<eos> Look.<eos> There are changes, little changes that have to add up.<eos> Like here it says, "I can't stop thinking of ambrose pierson."<eos> But in the picture I took in the car, it says, "I can't stop thinking of ambrose pavilion."<eos> What's ambrose pavilion?<eos> I don't know, but it was a big enough clue that whoever stole this book wanted to make sure we never saw it, in fact that we saw something else.
Previously on Pretty Little Liars.<eos> I'm cutting you off, you're over caffeinated.<eos> Hey, Brenda, can I grab you for a second.<eos> Come see me next week if you need more.<eos> I signed the agreement.<eos> My dad manipulated you into signing it.
Disappointed.<eos> I was, maybe a little.<eos> Well, I don't think my mom would have been disappointed.<eos> I think she would have wanted me to live my life.<eos> Find a way to make it full and share it with the people I love.<eos> You want to start by sharing a sandwich?<eos> Yeah, sounds good.<eos> Are you gonna eat that?<eos> Yeah, I told you that like five seconds ago.<eos> Just take it.
Ezra, don't!<eos> I lied about a lot of things.<eos> But I have never lied to you, not once about how I feel about you.<eos> When we started getting serious, I stopped writing the book.<eos> I started my research back up again when we broke up and that's how I knew that Alison was still alive.<eos> When I think about how I defended you to my family and my friends.<eos> And the whole time you were... you were using me.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm such an idiot.<eos> I'm such an idiot. I'm a jerk.<eos> But I swear, I'll burn this, I'll trash it.
isn't where he's most helpful.<eos> We're never getting upstairs.<eos> Why?<eos> The house is event headquarters.<eos> We're not going to be able to squeeze past Alison's mother without her noticing.<eos> I'm lucky if I can squeeze out of this tent.<eos> Ladies, when you're finished with your touch-ups, please remember to check the list by the stage.<eos> Spencer, what happened to your veil?<eos> Oh.<eos> I think I must have left it inside

But he believed me when I said that CeCe and I were roommates at UPenn.<eos> We hung out a lot at this pub near Hollis.<eos> That's where I met Ezra.<eos> Excuse me, can I have a gin and tonic?<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's tragic, isn't it?<eos> Oh, sorry?<eos> The book.<eos> It's one of my favorites.<eos> I read it every summer.

Why are you doing this? You can't talk to me that way!<eos> Go get in the car, right now!<eos> Now!<eos> What's goin' on?<eos> Found that in Rachel's pocket.<eos> Okay, I find out that you're still seeing that Indian kid, we're gonna have a problem.<eos> We'll have a little talk, later, you and me, okay?<eos> Does she even hear me?<eos> Junior, you want a sandwich?<eos> You can make it yourself. I'm not hungry.
Don't have him follow me.<eos> He told me you're not cookin'.<eos> You're not sellin'-- What the hell are ya doin'?<eos> This is what I'm doin', Jack-- see that?<eos> I need a gun.<eos> Hey... This'll work.<eos> You got ammo for this?<eos> That's my gun.<eos> It's mine!<eos> You want a gun, you gotta pay for it.
No. It was bad.<eos> Bad things happen in those mountains.<eos> That's why I moved here.<eos> Come on-- let's get the guns.<eos> Let's get the guns-- come on.<eos> Hey, you want some?<eos> Hang onto that.<eos> Here's your gun.<eos> He said it's gotta be a nine.<eos> You don't want it?
She's sick.<eos> She told me you were with Brian.<eos> You don't matter.<eos> I wish I could take credit for ruining your life.<eos> Me, I'm gonna go home, have a nice meal, forget you exist... my wife, too.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You gonna order in?<eos> Hey, your daughter, the younger one... what's her name?<eos> She gave me a drawing when I stopped by there today.<eos> Wanna see it?
That happens, Victor.<eos> That's a real thing.<eos> Then my wife is never gonna work.<eos> It is a lot of responsibility being the sole breadwinner.<eos> I know.<eos> I did it for years.<eos> But I learned to leave my work at the office to make time for you.<eos> I don't want our marriage to fail.<eos> I... it won't.<eos> We won't let it.
Shit.<eos> God.<eos> All right, Buck, you bastard.<eos> We're taking a selfie.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> One, two, three, buddy.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> You Eagle Scouts sure make amazing S'more.<eos> Just a minute, I have chocolate on my face.<eos> - Wash it down.
Where's the stuff, Sean?<eos> Where's my cell phone?<eos> Seriously.<eos> I have e-mails I have to send, I have conference calls I have to make.<eos> - Where is my cell phone?<eos> I need it?<eos> - Calm down.<eos> Don't tell me to calm down.<eos> Sean, where's my phone?<eos> - They must have taken it.
- Enjoy your salt.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> You're thinking about Shelley, aren't you?<eos> She wanted to see the father of her son move forward, get closure and it got her killed.<eos> What about Travis?<eos> What does he get?<eos> Obstruction, accessory?<eos> My guess is, the Mortimers would be very happy to have this all just go away.<eos> My guess is, you're right.<eos> His dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.
Good boy.<eos> Kimmie...<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Kimmie, listen to me.<eos> Do not do it.<eos> - We have to get out of here!<eos> - Milo.<eos> Milo!<eos> Kimmie, put down the gun.<eos> Put it down now!
There's fatigue, euphoria.<eos> Well, that's preferable to death.<eos> Is there anything else I should know?<eos> Well, there are some rare cases where the patient doesn't recover, or their-their veins turn blue.<eos> I don't know if I believe that.<eos> I've never seen a blue Atrian.<eos> Well, that's because there's a cure.<eos> It's called vyre.<eos> The Iwabas tribe grow it.<eos> The trick is, you gotta get it to the patient before it becomes permanent.
See?<eos> Shmayday!<eos> Shmayday!<eos> They got Scruffy!<eos> Nope.<eos> They just got my mustache.<eos> But a life without a mustache ain't worth livin'.<eos> No!<eos> That generator powers the portal.<eos> If they destroy it, we'll be sucked back into the future.
Wait, you said Millstreet's dropped all of David's projects?<eos> Yeah. Oh, shit.<eos> Shit.<eos> There's David's morn. She's so devastated.<eos> - Have you seen Pepper? Did you meet her?<eos> - No, I didn't, no.<eos> - She's devastated and I should... - You were saying that... You were saying that Millstreet's dropped all of David's projects?<eos> Right, that's right. For now, yeah.<eos> So, my book is dead?<eos> Um... Do you happen to know another publisher that I could maybe slip the manuscript to if I do decide that I really want to try to keep it alive?
- Okay, I love you, bye.<eos> Yo, it's Marnie.<eos> Leave me a message.<eos> Hey, Marn, it's me.<eos> Weird question...<eos> Can I borrow your apartment for something?<eos> Please call me back immediately. Thank you.<eos> Why are we here?<eos> Shoshanna's gonna buy us a steak.<eos> I'm gonna feed it to you like a baby bird.
- Yeah, okay. -Can you alphabetize?<eos> Yes, I can alphabetize.<eos> Why, did someone tell you otherwise? - You come tomorrow?<eos> -Yeah, that sounds good. I'll be there.<eos> Okay, yeah. You're not a junkie thief, are ya?<eos> No, not anymore.<eos> (CHUCKLES)<eos> Okay, well, it was lovely to meet you, Bodie, and I will see you tomorrow.<eos> - Bye, Marnie.<eos> JESSA: Change that title, maybe? - Or just, like, rethink it?
The Army is filled troops on heroic missions.<eos> And then there's us.<eos> We take care of things at home.<eos> We are the Rear Detachment.<eos> Yes, we're soldiers.<eos> Okay, that's enough.<eos> If somebody in this room took my flag, give it right back, now.<eos> No questions asked.<eos> Except for "why?" and "how could you?"<eos> Okay, there's gonna be a lot of questions, so just give it back now so we can get started.
Yeah, we totally expected that.<eos> And we are retreating now with our, uh... heads held high and our eyes down, everybody.<eos> Girl, you got my hair wet.<eos> Ugh, watch your step, it's everywhere.<eos> It's all mushy.<eos> Prank Jill and Get Our Flag Back"<eos> - is now operational. Pete?<eos> - Splendid.<eos> Okay, prank numero uno.<eos> We dig a pit, fill it with sharpened sticks, cover it with leaves, and wait til Jill and her platoon fall into it on their morning run.
We'll need to transfer Mrs Adams<eos> The labour ward is overflowing, I'm afraid.<eos> That social worker in there is a disgrace.<eos> Well, I know she likes a drink, but disgrace is a little harsh.<eos> Mrs Thomas, we'll have you into a cubicle as soon as possible.<eos> Alright?<eos> The system is stacked against them.<eos> It's the only system we have.<eos> Well, it needs to be changed.<eos> Fine. Then change it.
I'm fine, really, but thank you, Frank.<eos> I'll have some.<eos> For the two of us, as well.<eos> Oh, now she is gonna make me run another five miles to work off this puppy.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> I can barely keep up with you.<eos> - You're so much faster than me.<eos> - You two run together?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's hard to find the time, but somehow we find it. We do.
- I know your primary concern is profits. - That's right.<eos> But I'm offering you something that's far more valuable than money:<eos> - a direct line to the White House.<eos> - That sounds vague to me.<eos> I have influence over the BIA, over federal gambling legislation.<eos> The sort of influence that my contributions have already bought.<eos> Not with my direct involvement and the president's ear.<eos> You know what I like about money?<eos> I can stack it on a table, like this one.<eos> I can measure it with a yardstick.

That the price for our sins is paid for in blood.<eos> And that I ... shall be...<eos> "I shall be a vagabond in the air".<eos> "And everyone that findeth me, shall slay me".<eos> That's the one.<eos> Something in common. - We're both Christians, mate.<eos> - Except, you're more of um... Old Testament kind of guy, aren't you?<eos> The blood and the vengeance.<eos> The sweat, and the spunk.<eos> I can smell it.
It's too late.<eos> Mecha is entering in robot mode.<eos> What do you mean ?<eos> What is the robot mode ?<eos> What does this mean ?<eos> The program has a security against failure .<eos> The program allows survival operating alone as a Robot .<eos> As a self-guided torpedo.<eos> Unfortunately , the program is active . Will do what you gotta do without safety protocols .<eos> I can not turn it off .
Enable the pulse generator inside, it will be easy .<eos> Rosie , this is crazy !<eos> We have to put this shark back in the water , Jack .<eos> What ...<eos> Yikes!<eos> Rosie , do not !<eos> Rosie , are you listening ?<eos> Rosie , come on, baby !<eos> 'mhere.<eos> I'll work on the circuits and bring it back to the cove .
I'mnotsuingwell. Somethingiswrong.<eos> It's because you are not you , friend . There is a flaw in the system .<eos> 'mnotrecording a system crash , Jack .<eos> This is because your system was kidnapped by a Robot mode which declared that installed in you .<eos> SoI ' mnot in control , Jack ?<eos> No, Nero. Listen , you can be .<eos> Have to try to recover control , the robot can deceive .<eos> Iunderstand.<eos> Listen , the system will try to restart it ... but will not be able , because you are the source.<eos> All you need to do is find out where centralized and you can get rid of it .
They shut off communications with us. They want to starve us out of here.<eos> Hatake and the CDC have abandoned us.<eos> There is no treatment, no cure.<eos> We are forced to take matters into our own hands.<eos> The CDC hasn't abandoned us.<eos> They'll be back as soon as they figure out what's going on and how to help us.<eos> They are not coming back. They left us down here to die.<eos> Only we will not go down without a fight.<eos> On this level, there is a control node for the CO2 removal system.<eos> We can override it.
They threaten to take away my child.<eos> Calm down, your Highness.<eos> No one will talk.<eos> We all took an oath.<eos> Oaths are worth little in prison.<eos> You must help me, Father.<eos> - What can I do?<eos> - Here.<eos> Take this document.<eos> Get it into the cardinal's hands.
All the names are here:<eos> Duke de Bouillon, Count de Fontrailles, and guess who? The Marquis de Cinq-Mars.<eos> A serpent that I raised myself.<eos> An ingrate given glory who kisses the king even as he kills him.<eos> It's an unspeakable crime.<eos> We must take action.<eos> We will, Chavigny.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'd like to know who brought us this evidence for the upcoming trial.<eos> Should I take it to the king?

I see it's not happening.<eos> You couldn't be less interested.<eos> So, I hope I didn't ruin your night.<eos> - It's all good.<eos> - Okay. - Ohh! - I'm sorry.<eos> This is the guy who's hitting on you?<eos> - Hey, he's not that ugly.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You guys make a really cute couple.<eos> Bruce knew this comment was meant to make Jessica feel bad, and he couldn't stand for it.
- Perfect.<eos> - Got you.<eos> - That's great.<eos> - Wow, ladies!<eos> Let's try that.<eos> Okay, let's do...<eos> I think we should run the finale step, since that's brand-new.<eos> What do we think?<eos> Let's go over it.<eos> Let's hear it once.

I didn't want you to think that...<eos> What?<eos> To think that he was a terrorist?<eos> How could we ever think that?<eos> I've tried to access the phone, but I can't make it work.<eos> Whoever filed that report knows that we have this.<eos> If the guards find out...<eos> They'll paint your father as a Trag.<eos> We'll never be let out of the sector again.<eos> We have to destroy it.
My mother had no choice.<eos> Look, all I'm saying is I joined the Trags because I want freedom for our people, all right?<eos> We need to tear down the walls of the sector.<eos> So you can find Eljida?<eos> That fairy-tale swampland you keep yapping about?<eos> Right now, we're the Trags' best link to the outside world, so fall in line.<eos> You remember what happens to Trags who disappoint my mother.<eos> How are you planning on getting rid of the phone?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> You're not gonna destroy it, are you?
All right.<eos> I need whatever data you can retrieve off this.<eos> - Hybrid technology?<eos> - Cool, huh?<eos> Yeah, these phones are cobbled together with whatever we Atrians can find or smuggle into the sector.<eos> Power source and casing are Atrian, but it's got a human SIM card and main memory.<eos> I can work with that.<eos> This baby's been wiped.<eos> Some kind of auto-erase, set to trigger if the phone's been left idle too long.<eos> See, I'm guessing that whoever owned it didn't want anyone to know what they were up to.
I told him I gave you the phone to destroy.<eos> Do you still have it?<eos> It's gone.<eos> I took care of it.<eos> Do you have any idea why my father would have had that phone?<eos> No.<eos> But the Trags were using the...<eos> My father wasn't a Trag.<eos> I know that, Roman.<eos> But it doesn't take away the fact that he was hiding it for a reason.
Whatever.<eos> You want to go swim against those unmarked monkeys, go for it.<eos> Just make sure you smoke 'em.<eos> Hey.<eos> The guards searched me on my way into school this morning.<eos> Did you tell anyone about the phone?<eos> Did Lukas?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Where is he?<eos> We need to destroy it right now.
Why would he have a phone?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> But whatever his reasons were, he was willing to risk everything.<eos> That's why I have to find that second phone.<eos> I need to know who he was communicating with.<eos> Okay, I've set this up to ping the phone that sent the text.<eos> Ping?<eos> Yeah, um, we send the signal out to the other phone, and if it's on, we get a ping, like an echo.<eos> It'll help us find the direction.<eos> What are our chances of finding it?
It's like...<eos> he's a really good guy, but we get together, and I just start acting like a fuckin' crazy person.<eos> No no no, okay okay, I'm sorry.<eos> I don't mean to laugh at you, sorry.<eos> No, that's okay.<eos> Oh, thanks for the, uh... thanks for the graffiti on my wall, by the way.<eos> It is.<eos> It really is.<eos> I really like it.<eos> I think I'm gonna keep it.
- Just a minute, okay?<eos> You're blocking traffic. I normally hate people like me, but it's only gonna take a moment.<eos> Okay, here he comes right now.<eos> See? - He's on his way.<eos> -You gotta move.<eos> (CAR HORN HONKING) This is loading only.<eos> You don't have the-- Where's the phone?<eos> The front desk is saying they don't have your mom's phone.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Or she wouldn't give it to me 'cause I don't look like a Murray.
But you did it. You were pressing "on."<eos> - I don't care who broke it. - That probably breaked it.<eos> - I'm just gonna get it fixed, okay?<eos> Okay, girls, other room, please.<eos> Please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You want to take a look and see what's wrong with that?<eos> They make that where you work, not where I do.<eos> Okay, Gordon, do you want to maybe get me the salt?<eos> Maybe you could reach into the cabinet about seven inches from your head, take out the salt and put it in my hand so I can finish cooking this.
But we love him, Mom.<eos> Okay, design speed.<eos> It's called the Great Atlantic Fault.<eos> And it starts here in Spain, and then it goes under the Bay of Biscay, and then it comes up in South Wales.<eos> And then it goes under the Atlantic for miles and miles and miles, and it comes up again in Pennsylvania.<eos> My father used to talk about it.<eos> - Yeah. - And mine.<eos> - The dark artery.<eos> - That's it. Yeah, that's it.<eos> And you could take a miner from Wales or Spain, or America, and you could show them that seam, and they would recognize it.
Where are they from?<eos> The whole wide world... planet Earth.<eos> They are musical nomads, and they taught me how to play this.<eos> - The giant stick?<eos> - The giant rain stick.<eos> It is a conduit for divination, relaxation, and spiritual healing.<eos> Cool.<eos> - Can you hear it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Can you feel it?
Dad used to be a cop... He's used to saying these things<eos> How do you know he's not right?<eos> I know you didn't take the necklace<eos> And these other things, are in your bag because of 'Meeta 2.0' - After-pills!<eos> God knows what kind of friends you have!<eos> You've figured me out in just 3 days?<eos> Don't worry, we'll look for a solution<eos> Sir, I haven't stolen the necklace...<eos> You've checked my bag... Now you should check everyone else's bags too...<eos> And anyway I stole it, so your wife could have it...
Right, and suspect no. 1 is<eos> YOU!<eos> What?<eos> - Correct.<eos> Absolutely right, Sherlock<eos> What rubbish... who is this Sherlock?<eos> What batch of police service is he from?<eos> Get him on the phone...<eos> Sir, please get your bag...<eos> What? It's my necklace... Why will I still steal it?
Sorry for disturbing you...<eos> And I request you, please don't tell Karishma about this<eos> She already knows...<eos> she tells me everything... like the 3 million you owe her for... Pappa it's 2.5, not 3 million!<eos> This is the calculation...<eos> The house was for 3O Million.<eos> I took 2.5 from Karishma,<eos> And the rest 27.5 was paid by me Pappa?<eos> And it is THIS house, your daughter will live in... and when you have grandkids, they will live in THIS same House...<eos> So if you're losing sleep over that money, I'll return it to Karishma today itself!
...I have several of my own...<eos> How about if the stadium also revolved?<eos> Clockwise and anti-clockwise?<eos> Great idea yea?<eos> Sir, the crowds will get dizzy...<eos> I just want to know if you can give me the money?<eos> This ball is made of the same polymer...<eos> Pappa, I need money...<eos> Okay... then take it...<eos> Take it?
Why would he agree to compromise a diplomatic mission?<eos> If I knew Finnegan had the balls to run interference on a covert rescue mission, I might've voted for him.<eos> You probably should have.<eos> He voted for you.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> In 1998, president Stanwick Finnegan signed executive order 1451, establishing a pilot program code-named "Clockwork."<eos> How come I've never been able to access that?<eos> Because the order was never entered into any database.<eos> Only on paper.<eos> Our thinking was that the very people who would want this program would be the same people with the means to find it electronically.
We'll make him see again that I make the rules, not Salvatore Conte.<eos> Lady lmma, excuse me...<eos> I'd like to ask Don Pietro if I can go.<eos> Go, I'll tell him.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> - Ciro!<eos> Do you like this couch?<eos> Mamma Mia!<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> You can have it.
Really, I'm insulted.<eos> Girls?<eos> Hi, Tom.<eos> The woman just fell out of the cupboard?<eos> What did you tell your dad?<eos> Well, Miss Meade was so embarrassed that she lied and told my dad she must've sleepwalked over to our place.<eos> We did leave her with a spare key.<eos> Which he took back that day.<eos> So... what do you think about the flat?<eos> I do hope you'll take it.

So... where are they?<eos> Nice. Make it about you, Donna.<eos> Hey, you're the dum-dum who got yourself into this mess.<eos> If it were up to me,<eos> I'd send you straight to the frontlines.<eos> Enough!<eos> Fighting is not going to help us right now.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're right.<eos> They're onto us. I'm gonna find your file and rip it up myself.
So what are you saying?<eos> I can't do this.<eos> I called my dad this morning.<eos> We both agreed that our relationship probably works better long-distance.<eos> Am I in the right place?<eos> I just fixed up the place a little bit, put my own stamp on it.<eos> - You joined the army? !<eos> - You have to help me out of this.<eos> I'm going to come up with a plan.<eos> I'm going to find your file and rip it up myself.
So last year, I put some money in these high-yield bonds.<eos> And...<eos> It didn't exactly pan out.<eos> So I am light on liquid capital.<eos> But I gotta get back in the game.<eos> So...<eos> I'm gonna have to borrow your trust fund.<eos> Wait. You came all the way here to ask me for my money?<eos> Well, that money is mine.<eos> See, I gave it to you, so I can take it back.

You came all the way here to ask me for my money?<eos> Well, that money is mine.<eos> See, I gave it to you, so I can take it back.<eos> Actually, legally, it's my money, which means I get to decide what happens to it.<eos> Just to get the blood-sucking bankers off my back.<eos> And what have they ever created?<eos> They're just living off of guys like me, and now they won't give me what I need to make it back.

It's the most natural thing in the world.<eos> So you can't feel bad about it.<eos> Amelia was right.<eos> To make it in this city, you have to let your animal instincts take over.<eos> And in that moment, I knew I was going to write this piece and thrive.<eos> So you don't mind if I ask you a couple more questions?<eos> Of course.<eos> And there's nothing you want me to take off the record?<eos> Nah. This world is so screwed up.<eos> Let people see it.
I feel stupid even complaining about it.<eos> I mean, other people have real problems.<eos> Sebastian, this is real.<eos> And you shouldn't feel bad talking about it.<eos> Are you sure you want to give your trust fund to him?<eos> I don't think I can abandon him.<eos> I guess I just don't have that killer instinct.<eos> Aren't you worried he's gonna lose the money?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you're still gonna give it to him?
I say yes!<eos> I say yes, I say yes.<eos> Hi.<eos> Um... I have some surprising news.<eos> Can I see you?<eos> Okay, Bambi.<eos> You better start dishing'.<eos> I'm staying, and Larissa agreed to let me sublet her place.<eos> Well, this is a hell of a lot better than the places I'm looking at.<eos> Well, at 550 bucks, I can't afford it on my own.
I took down the site.<eos> You what?<eos> - What about all of my fans?<eos> - If you wanna act, you can act.<eos> We will get you into every theater program that we can.<eos> But that show and the website, that's not what you want to do.<eos> Mom, it is! - It is everything that I wanna do!<eos> - You're better than that stupid show<eos> - and you're better than the website. - No, I'm not!<eos> - No, you have to put it back up.
It's easy when it's not his ass!<eos> You're sure you're okay?<eos> You got a good cell?<eos> Is Rino helping you?<eos> That asshole warden got Rino transferred, but it's no problem, the preliminary hearing is coming, if the lawyer does his job.<eos> Ciro says the new contact didn't work out.<eos> - What do we do?<eos> - What?<eos> We find another one.<eos> Take Musi the money and tell him to keep it liquid.
Sacred blood.<eos> Blood of the Goddess.<eos> What?<eos> Ugh, just say it!<eos> What kind of poor, woodland creature do I have to murder with my bare hands just to make the spell work?<eos> We need a gal who's Aunt Flo's making her monthly visit.<eos> - Eww! - I'm sorry!<eos> The women's cycle is also tied to the lunar cycle, as it happens, and we just need the blood to harness the moon's power!<eos> What?<eos> Um... I can smell it?
Whoo!<eos> I'm a little flushed.<eos> We're a good team, aren't we?<eos> Sally...<eos> Hey...<eos> You've been reading that book for 2 days.<eos> Don't you think it's time to come up for air?<eos> - Yeah. Can't.<eos> - Get rid of it.<eos> Take it back and bury it in the soup rubble where you found it, because it's bad juju.
(Voice breaking): Sorry, guys. I already missed it once.<eos> - Ding dong!<eos> - No!<eos> Thanks for the invite.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> No. You don't. That's your problem, in a nutshell.<eos> - I was trying to call back my door.<eos> - Didn't you mother ever tell you?<eos> If something seems too good to be true, then it probably is.<eos> You put that spell in the book. From down there, you can control it?
I figured, if we can't move right now, at least I could make this look like a real home, finally.<eos> Make it look like a place where a happy, married couple lives.<eos> Yeah, and that's what newlywede was supposed to do.<eos> They're supposed to nest, and bone 24/7.<eos> (Laughs) Now I feel even worse.<eos> (Laughing): Sorry.<eos> Josh thinks I don't see it.<eos> But the wolf is there.<eos> Just under his skin.<eos> I catch it in his eyes sometimes. For a second. Less.
And that's what we're gonna do, Kenny.<eos> - Kenny. - Astrid.<eos> Oh my God!<eos> Tell me something.<eos> Is this not one of the most beautiful evenings that you've ever seen?<eos> One of the most beautiful moustaches I've ever seen!<eos> Oh man, I can't wait to bust your balls about this pervy John Waters look, you perv!<eos> Where is this joint, anyway?<eos> I hate this neighbourhood!<eos> It's tucked away so the fuzz can't see it.
I'll send someone with a wrist brace.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> You'd tell me if you were feeling depressed or dementia-ey, right?<eos> Yes! I feel awesome.<eos> I'm dynamite.<eos> I just wanna get the hell out of here.<eos> Excuse me, miss?<eos> Let's have a look at that wrist.<eos> - Ok, can you bend it back?
- You're welcome.<eos> You'd tell me if you were feeling depressed or dementia-ey, right?<eos> Yes! I feel awesome.<eos> I'm dynamite.<eos> I just wanna get the hell out of here.<eos> Excuse me, miss?<eos> Let's have a look at that wrist.<eos> - Ok, can you bend it back?<eos> - I think so. Yeah.<eos> Ok, does it hurt when I flex it back like this?
I'm afraid to ask.<eos> What's the rent?<eos> Uh, well, I would really hate to leave this place vacant, and you two seem like such nice boys, so for you, I would say $800.<eos> Gonna let that stew.<eos> I'm gonna step over here.<eos> Ok, well...<eos> She's mentally ill, or she's slow.<eos> Either way, it's sad, 'cause she's pretty.<eos> We need to rent this place, man, ok?<eos> Someone else is gonna come in here and snatch it up!
Goody Gobble!<eos> Liquid center power-up!<eos> How are you, Milhouse?<eos> Things aren't great with Lisa.<eos> If it wasn't for that squirrel that eats our bird food, we'd have nothing to talk about.<eos> As I told you when we talked last month,<eos> "I've been doing a lot of charity work for the undead."<eos> Uh, Marge, excuse me.<eos> Uh... I think I need a reboot.<eos> Just stick the tip of your pen in that little hole and hold it for 15 minutes.
- Hey! Astrid... Um...<eos> Aidan, you remember Astrid, right? Yeah!<eos> - The world's worst baby shower!<eos> - Indeed, yeah!<eos> I'm sorry my friends trashed your place.<eos> Believe me.<eos> That place has seen worse.<eos> Are you allowed to be here?<eos> Yeah. I mean, I got some glares.<eos> Yeah, but if anybody has a problem, they keep it to themselves.
Bartholomew!<eos> Good to see you, old sport.<eos> Where's Freedom?<eos> Well, my dad said don't bring home any more dogs, cats, turtles or snakes, but he never said anything about predatory birds.<eos> Okay, in your terms, points are like mice...<eos> Don't interrupt.<eos> I just thought it would be nice if we shared an interest.<eos> You Korean girls know what a soldier likes.<eos> Fine!<eos> But the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it.
Would you like a glass of Strupo?<eos> It's a liqueur made of fermented capers, the official drink of the island.<eos> Mmm! Sounds delicious.<eos> It's not.<eos> Hey, a friend of mine, uh, bought a painting here.<eos> Oh, yes, I remember that painting.<eos> And that is the man I sold it to.<eos> And that man sold it to me!<eos> That proves the painting is mine!<eos> And nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money!
Your painting was an early, clumsy effort which I gave to the café owner to pay off my Strupo tab.<eos> Then why did the auction house say it was real?<eos> I have fooled galleries around the world with my loving imitations.<eos> Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler!<eos> Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler!<eos> What you do is horrible... ripping off geniuses who spent years perfecting their styles.<eos> Perhaps you are the one who is horrible.<eos> What? !<eos> You only cared about that painting when you thought it was created by someone famous.<eos> Well, no, but now when I look at it, all I see is a fraud.
Perhaps you are the one who is horrible.<eos> What? !<eos> You only cared about that painting when you thought it was created by someone famous.<eos> Well, no, but now when I look at it, all I see is a fraud.<eos> Beauty is beauty.<eos> My forgeries give pleasure to people all over the world.<eos> The only real question to ask about art, whether it's in the Louvre or on a freshman's wall at Cal State Fullerton is, "Did it move you?"<eos> But, you still, I mean...<eos> Oh, I suppose you're right.<eos> What if I never liked the painting and only wanted it for money?
It may not be a drive, per se.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Kate Anderson wasn't just any CIA analyst. She worked RD.<eos> And one of the projects was liquid data.<eos> Liquid?<eos> Not literally.<eos> The project was to find ways to store yottabytes of data onto microfiles.<eos> Now, if they succeeded, guys, we could have a very hard time locating the device.<eos> She has it on her.<eos> A piece of jewelry, a heel of a shoe... she's definitely carrying it.
She give you the drive yet?<eos> I told you, I-I don't have it on me.<eos> You won't find anything.<eos> Shh.<eos> She's chipping you.<eos> I'm picking something up.<eos> You people are insane.<eos> Remove the drive, please.<eos> What drive?<eos> Remove it now... unless you want me to take the whole eye.
- Then you don't get it<eos> I have to buy Noemi a gift.<eos> The building won't move.<eos> See you later.<eos> We'd be smart to move the property assets towards financial investments, because real estate generates no wealth, while money creates money.<eos> I know how to make money, Lady Imma, without spending a cent, just by taking and giving back loans, playing with currencies, and especially, what's even more important to us, without risk.<eos> Why?<eos> Because if a judge should ever find a thread, it might lead to real estate, but not to money.<eos> I take money, and move it from one account to another and make it circle the world in an hour.<eos> You know how long it might take an investigator to trace it?
What should we do?<eos> We have to take all they've found out of their hands and make it disappear, right away.<eos> How?<eos> Let's be frank, I'm a technician,<eos> I can give you technical, theoretical solutions, but I'm not advising you on anything, do you understand?<eos> Lady Imma, why are you saying that?<eos> I assure you...<eos> You can't assure a thing, absolutely nothing, however, it's a risk we can't run.<eos> Lady Imma, I know I made a huge mistake, but I can make it right.<eos> So, all the accounts go to your wife, she gets them unblocked and we can recover our money before the State seizes it.
Now that's what's being a man.<eos> I'll need you to cut it.<eos> How short?<eos> This short.<eos> I have a modeling career.<eos> If I cut it that short--<eos> If you actually had a modeling career, I would be speaking to your agency, and not sitting in your apartment.<eos> - Do you want this job or not?<eos> - OK, yeah.<eos> - I can cut it.
- Jenny does not exist anymore.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> She's dead.<eos> Odysseas, the sandwich is ready.<eos> Thank You.<eos> - Ten days ago.<eos> - You kidding me?<eos> I called you several times, without success.<eos> Should I send you a text message?<eos> Your birthday is coming up, I would rather tell it personally.
Take them off.<eos> - I beg you.<eos> - He is a minor.<eos> So is the law.<eos> I'm born here, and a minor.<eos> Yes, so it went well.<eos> But we are also half Greek.<eos> Your brother is waiting outside.<eos> - Where is my bag?<eos> - You get it at the exit.
Here.<eos> Do not drink too much.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Dido?<eos> Here Dido, drink.<eos> - Where's the gun?<eos> - I must have lost it.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Yes.<eos> When they find it, we're fucked.
And if so, then who?<eos> And then I recalled the lovely Sabine.<eos> Are you gonna continue following me, Elijah?<eos> Or do you want to talk?<eos> You know who I am.<eos> Original vampire, always wears a suit?<eos> Your visions of my brother's child precipitated the death of the last elder within your coven...<eos> Tell them what you saw.<eos> Ensuring that the harvest ritual could not be completed...<eos> Unless you were to control it.
Yeah, but if this gets me closer to knowing what my father was doing then...<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Mayor Wallace and I are very confident that the community will embrace the Atrian Seven, but we'll...<eos> They all came out to see us.<eos> Give me the cube.<eos> He likes brunettes.<eos> Always gives me a thorough pat-down but never checks my bag.<eos> Unless you want to get caught.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> You can give it back now.
He's in danger from the humans.<eos> Please, you... you have to take him.<eos> Nox said that he would be safe in Eljida.<eos> All our people are protected and cared for.<eos> Your son will have everything he needs.<eos> I am always thinking about you.<eos> I love you, baby.<eos> Always remember that.<eos> Swear to keep this place secret.<eos> No human can know about it.
I thought I knew what I wanted.<eos> I thought I knew it all.<eos> But what I didn't know was how much I didn't know.<eos> You can't possibly know what the future holds, not at your age.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> I... I want you to say that you'll think about it before you do anything rash.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> But, Mr. Altman, just so you know, I do still like grilled cheese.<eos> I just make it with vegan cheese.
With my new job, I haven't had time to think about it.<eos> How did you make it out alive?<eos> Thanks to two friends I met there.<eos> When do you need your suit?<eos> I don't want to rush you.<eos> You know how long people wait for a phone?<eos> Two years.<eos> If you can pull strings.<eos> I can get it for you in two days.<eos> After all your suffering, you deserve it.
You said you didn't know how to write lyrics.<eos> I don't.<eos> Ha! More lies.<eos> But you saved my career, so I forgive you.<eos> What's this?<eos> Just listen.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You read my journal? !<eos> You shouldn't have left it on top of the bed where desperate people could get to it.
Okay?<eos> We can't be seen together.<eos> Clearly we're all still freaked out over what happened, so...<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll get to the point.<eos> I want us to hit another house.<eos> Are you high?<eos> Last time we went out, Carter killed somebody.<eos> Hey, was I the moron who put real bullets in the gun?<eos> - No one told you to point it at...
I just got the invoice.<eos> You're charging me too much.<eos> Dios mio.<eos> Can you hold on a second?<eos> - Hey.<eos> How are you?<eos> - Busy.<eos> Sorry... my mom and I can't make it to Uncle Spence's wedding, so she wanted me to drop our gift off.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> Put it on the table.
That's okay.<eos> I know who you mean.<eos> Script delivery.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> And please tell Mr. Westmore I'm really sorry.<eos> He was always really nice to me.<eos> Uh-oh. Who's that?<eos> So, they just delivered your script.<eos> I think you should read it.
- What?<eos> - Nothing, it's absurd...<eos> Don't make fun of me but...<eos> I think I know you from somewhere.<eos> There, the 6 minutes are up.<eos> It's sad but, shit, sometimes, to make it easier, I decide it's funny and I invent a new life for him.<eos> You must remember, you and Mum always talked about it.<eos> That close to a Nobel Prize!<eos> Yes, it was infuriating.<eos> You'd learnt your speech in Swedish and rehearsed it every night in my room.
A full-time nurse for Dad able to start a new conversation every 6 minutes.<eos> Cultured. Pretty.<eos> A Porsche Cayenne...<eos> No, I put that already.<eos> - Pick you up at 9?<eos> - Ok!<eos> Two more days and your man will be back.<eos> For now... Let's party!<eos> Baby, it's me. I left a message last night.<eos> Your phone doesn't work there but you'll get it when you come back.
A physician, sent by Cesare Borgia.<eos> Enter.<eos> What ails you?<eos> My cough sprays blood and my pores leak fluid.<eos> I do not know whether to light a fire or jump in the Tiber.<eos> Your signory slanders my name, labeling me a rogue and a murderer then begs me not to retaliate.<eos> If they want peace, then I demand 300,000 ducats, a contract as condottiere and unrestricted military movement throughout your republic.<eos> I will need to discuss...<eos> Then rise from your sickbed and hurry home before my troops beat you there.<eos> Your government is not to my liking. Change it or I will.
But you're going to move to St Mungo's.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I appreciate that it's Ayrshire.<eos> But you do have family in Scotland.<eos> Have I?<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> The board have agreed to your transfer.<eos> I haven't agreed.<eos> Jacob... you can do this kicking and screaming, or you can do it with dignity and with grace.
You did not hit his wife, then?<eos> I thought he had not.<eos> She wanted to suck, but it is not easy.<eos> He reserved for marriage.<eos> It's funny that, idiot!<eos> What are you doing shit?<eos> What is your fucking problem?<eos> He could say thank you, right?<eos> It was still out of jail, shit!<eos> And the money, we will look for it when?
When we were growing up it wasn't a good time financially for our family.<eos> But my grandma helped us to get our first computer in 1997.<eos> Early, compared with other kids in Ukraine.<eos> We got visitors every day.<eos> The friends of my older brother used to come to visit us and we were playing games.<eos> And Danil, every time looked at what we do.<eos> Every time we would try to push him away but he would come back and look again.<eos> It was more prominent with him than with other kids.<eos> During all his conscious life we were trying to stop him from playing.<eos> We were hiding our computer cord everywhere in our apartment but he always found it.
Hello, Max.<eos> I'm dropping these off, they were my Albert's shoes.<eos> They shouldn't go to waste, you should sell them.<eos> I don't sell shoes, Mrs. Stevens.<eos> And his overcoat is in there too.<eos> It's very nice, you should wear it.
I gotta go take care of somethin'.<eos> It's peak hours.<eos> What's so important?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> What are you doing? I'm worried, okay.<eos> What's going on?<eos> One second.<eos> You've been running around half-cocked since your mother passed away.<eos> Will you just be straight with me?<eos> All right, look, I took some money that doesn't belong to me, and I gotta go give it back. All right?
Oh, yeah?<eos> How's he doing?<eos> He said he's having a wonderful time and that when he comes home, he wants to thank you in person.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> How did you pull it off, Max?<eos> Pull what off?<eos> Solomon, Greenawalt, all of it.<eos> Here's your ticket.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Don't lose it.
A little Patsy Cline for you all.<eos> Let's go teardrop hunting.<eos> Jesus, how many more cars I'm gonna have to get in and out of?<eos> This is it, Congressman.<eos> Is it cool if I call you that?<eos> Call me whatever shit you want. Just drive, kid.<eos> You got something for me?<eos> Cool. Thanks.<eos> Would you mind giving me your phone, please?<eos> I promise you'll get it back once you've talked to him.
For once I give you some responsibility!<eos> Importation of 23% in volume and the French only 8%, a trend that solidifies the colossal German trade surplus, which means they sell more than they buy abroad, which is the opposite tor the French.<eos> Since 2005, as a matter of fact...<eos> I'm Madeleine Beaulieu.<eos> Your sons are working at my place.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Good evening.<eos> I brought you a present to make up for the storm and all.<eos> That's very sweet. Thank you.<eos> Should I take it?
Moz, will you please be reasonable?<eos> Why are we wasting our time arguing?<eos> We are on the verge of discovering the twin of the Hope diamond.<eos> Your life is on the line.<eos> Rebecca's probably bluffing.<eos> I feel...<eos> absolutely okay.<eos> Look, we can find the antidote.<eos> I'm taking you to a hospital right now.<eos> The diamond is the antidote, and you need my help to find it.
You son of a bitch.<eos> Hey, just a little sleight of hand.<eos> No big deal.<eos> Maybe your critical thinking got clouded.<eos> I love how good you are.<eos> - I hate how good you are.<eos> - Give me the diamond.<eos> I can't.<eos> Neal, don't make me kill you.<eos> I'll just take it off your beautiful, dead body.
So where is this gem I almost cashed in all my chips to get?<eos> Is that real?<eos> They didn't make fakes that good in 1886.<eos> Can I hold it?<eos> You know, after he had the Hope diamond cut,<eos> Louis XIV would wear it on his pinkie.<eos> He had grotesquely large fingers.<eos> So is this diamond our path to easy street?<eos> Yeah, who actually, you know, owns that?<eos> It's my duty as a federal officer to turn it over to the state department.
Glad you're feeling better, Moz.<eos> You ready?<eos> That diamond is not meant to be under bulletproof glass with a bunch of tourists in Bermuda shorts gawking at it.<eos> Better than being lost behind a brick wall.<eos> See ya.<eos> See ya.<eos> Hey, thanks for going all Terms of Endearment on the doctor for me.<eos> It was fun.<eos> Okay, that diamond is ours, Neal.<eos> We are gonna get it back.
See ya.<eos> Hey, thanks for going all Terms of Endearment on the doctor for me.<eos> It was fun.<eos> Okay, that diamond is ours, Neal.<eos> We are gonna get it back.<eos> You want to rob the state department?<eos> Well, it hasn't gone there yet.<eos> It's our meal ticket.<eos> It's supposed to set us up for life, in a perversely legitimate fashion.<eos> There is no reason to go after it illegitimately.
I will be the house guest that never leaves.<eos> And if you don't keep your promise, if I find out you've pulled even one caper,<eos> I'm gonna leave my cushy desk job and hunt you down.<eos> Just like old times.<eos> With the same outcome.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'll see you in D.C. - You got it.<eos> Not getting the diamond changes everything.<eos> Well, finding it helped buy my freedom, and that is everything.
I am John, and I was one of his followers.<eos> After what I saw, how could I not be ?<eos> Jewish land.<eos> Jewish people.<eos> Our Jewish nation... under Roman rule.<eos> In the name of Rome, taxes are owed.<eos> Time to pay up!<eos> - Get in line!<eos> - You can't do this. - Mind your tongue!<eos> - Put it here.
They're coming!<eos> Malchus. Malchus!<eos> Malchus, what's happening?<eos> It's another protest, High Priest.<eos> We need to get you out of here.<eos> It's turning into a riot.<eos> Get the master back to his residence quick as you can.<eos> - What is all this about?<eos> - The aqueduct.<eos> The people are furious that the Romans used the temple funds to build it.
- No, it's not.<eos> It's just...<eos> - how we-- we could get into the building.<eos> - But the guards<eos> - don't know that.<eos> - What else do I need to know, Mason?<eos> You take that flash drive out of the building, the building's sensors are gonna trigger the alarms.<eos> Why the fake vest?<eos> It's-- it's a diversion.<eos> He wears it, everybody looks at him, I walk the flash drive out of the building.
- Just let him go. Please. Just let him go.<eos> Did it go?<eos> Did it go?<eos> _<eos> Do I get my kid back now?<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Finley, get his phone.<eos> - Step away!<eos> - I'm Secret Service.<eos> Finley, do not let them take it.
I miss tasting Harry."<eos> Aww. That's... that's always nice to hear, isn't it?<eos> Is it, though?<eos> Let's just chat real quick about the event.<eos> So, it's a charity dinner for lupus.<eos> Locusts.<eos> Madagascar's still recovering from that awful swarm.<eos> You know, it threatened 60% of their rice crop.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Speaking of which, I was thinking we should take rice off the menu completely, Harry, and replace it with a more...
- Ever.<eos> - Ever.<eos> I bring clients, you bring clients,<eos> I cook, you plan... done.<eos> Okay. So... like partners?<eos> Yeah.<eos> If... if you'll have me.<eos> So, a designer comes in and wants to borrow a piece.<eos> You fill out this form.<eos> Run the credit card for 20% of the price and refund the money when they bring it back.
What happened in San Francisco?<eos> Will, leave it.<eos> Why can't we be completely honest?<eos> If we love each other, we can deal with the truth.<eos> What I can't deal with, is lies.<eos> Were you unfaithful to me in San Francisco?<eos> No.<eos> But I could have been.<eos> When you're manic, you can become hypersexual.<eos> It's part of that fire in your brain, and when I'm in that headspace, I can't control it.
Sit down.<eos> Do you lie to me?<eos> That could be a lie.<eos> It could be... but it's not.<eos> - How would I know?<eos> - 'Cause you're the one person who knows everything.<eos> You're the only person I want to know everything.<eos> So, you showed the worst you had to will to find out if he can join our... little circle of trust.<eos> No, I showed him because I'm an emotional, impulsive, self-destructive lunatic.<eos> And if I could take it back, I would in a heartbeat.
Ali took a page from the Dr. Black book, figured out how to make the problem into a solution.<eos> See, Claire and Anna had two issues...<eos> The Capgras and lesbian bed death.<eos> I realized you could use one to solve the other.<eos> Go on.<eos> You know how some people really get off on illicit sex?<eos> Well, apparently, Claire and Anna have super-hot sexual love when Anna thinks she's cheating on Claire with a stranger.<eos> And voila... no more LBD.<eos> And when Anna hears Claire's voice without actually seeing her face, she recognizes Claire as her loving, devoted wife.<eos> So, they can totally have their cake and eat it, too.
Sure.<eos> Here.<eos> Take a picture.<eos> Trying to get her to go to Bermuda.<eos> Yeah, well, he did that with his first wife.<eos> I'm not gonna do the same thing you did with your first wife.<eos> I'm not doing that.<eos> Gabby Giffords' bone was stored in a freezer, but, uh... I think I like the belly for this.<eos> Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking.<eos> We store it in her belly for six to eight weeks and keep it sterile and nourished.
The best and the truest; Alas! Are the fewest;<eos> but be one of these if you can.<eos> In duty, ne'er fail; you will find 'twill avail you, and bring its reward when a man.<eos> Don't think life plain sailing... There's danger of failing, though bright the futures seem to be...<eos> But bright honor and labor and truth to your neighbor will bear you safe over life's seas."<eos> Here, please. Throw another.<eos> Mister!<eos> Mr. Commodore. Throw one to me.<eos> Now commences our sun-kissed summer, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> We sprinkle the sea with gold and the sea gives it back to us 100 fold.
Great. I'd like a list of all the people that will be attending.<eos> It's not that big a deal if I get left out, but you're the Secretary of State.<eos> I mean, Tusk should not be determining policy.<eos> The President alone should instruct you on what you are to pursue.<eos> What's their relationship?<eos> He's had his ear for years.<eos> An advisor...<eos> More of a mentor, and one whose advice is not easily dismissed.<eos> He's gonna keep pushing back on cyber warfare.<eos> Not if I get it on the agenda.

You think Tusk isn't planning his next attack even as we speak?<eos> We've been thorough, sir.<eos> He doesn't leave footprints.<eos> You want to shift tactics?<eos> The casino.<eos> We go public as soon as possible.<eos> You said that was a last resort.<eos> Seth, you need to find a way to make that happen so it doesn't link to us.<eos> If we launch that missile, it could blow us up too.<eos> Not if we spin it right.
Work with Doyle, make sure we have no weak spots.<eos> - I'll call him now.<eos> - What did Nancy say?<eos> Well, it looks like Jackie may be sleeping with the enemy.<eos> Lanagin is correct in saying we run the risk of libel.<eos> These links are supported by fact.<eos> Individually, but you can't complete the circle.<eos> I'm not saying the headline should read:<eos> Money Laundering Scheme Exposed!<eos> Just that we present the landscape as we currently know it.
Hey, hey. Careful.<eos> I just made my bed.<eos> What are they looking for?<eos> - What do you reckon?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> The phone.<eos> - It's under my mattress, Franky.<eos> - Just sharp and keep calm.<eos> No, no, he's gonna find it.
Report to base, thank you.<eos> I have to go now.<eos> She'll be slaughtered but it won't undo what she's done.<eos> you've got a lot of hard work ahead of you.<eos> I've done it once.<eos> I can do it again.<eos> Good attitude.<eos> But I think we can go one better.<eos> This yard has been neglected for a very long time.<eos> How would you feel about turning it into a proper vegetable garden?
Fiona's a bitch.<eos> I'm gonna be a nice Supreme.<eos> I hear something.<eos> Yeah. You always hear something.<eos> What you doing?<eos> I heard it crying.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> That closet was...<eos> You the clairvoyant.<eos> You stole this baby to kill it.
Um...this is my cellphone number.<eos> I want you to have Carlos call me.<eos> I told you I have not seen him.<eos> Just in case.<eos> If you help us, we can protect you.<eos> We can give you asylum in the United States.<eos> Please, I - - I would like you both to leave now.<eos> I got a cell number off her phone bill.<eos> Can you chip the phone?<eos> I did. It's a burner, which means I can't trace it until they make a call.
I don't want to be rude.<eos> This what you were looking for?<eos> Hector Villareal, I presume?<eos> The senator violated our agreement.<eos> He wasn't supposed to call the authorities.<eos> He didn't have to.<eos> You're not as smooth as you think you are.<eos> Open the laptop.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Open it.
No.<eos> We're not animals.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Wecould have tracked that number.<eos> No, we couldn't have, Lillian.<eos> Not out here, not without a satellite.<eos> Why don't we have a satellite?<eos> The closest one is over Mexico.<eos> It'll take hours to get it in place.
We shall soon know the truth without laying a hand upon you.<eos> How could that device be built without the knowledge of the Book of Leaves?<eos> Leo, it's a miracle!<eos> The quest is far from over.<eos> ♪ DaVinci's Demons 2x09 ♪ The Enemies of Man Original Air Date on May 17, 2014<eos> ♪<eos> (RIARIO) As I recall, the mechanism was only minimally damaged.<eos> Your talent for compounding disaster is truly impressive.<eos> I have compounded nothing.<eos> In order to repair it, I had to take it apart to examine its inner workings.
I know you've always believed my quest is foolish fire, but...<eos> I need your help.<eos> Now, we found this in the city made of stone.<eos> What in God's name...<eos> It's a Brazen Head.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> It's just a myth.<eos> No, it's very real.<eos> This device, its machinations are like nothing I've ever seen.<eos> (Voices in street) We must hide it.
If it's okay with you, I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm so sorry, Liv.<eos> I'm... I'm a crazy person.<eos> I do... I must have gone insane from that kiss.<eos> The good news is I can now go home and marry Jim because I am so bad at this stuff.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, hey, we didn't order this!<eos> He sent his boxers.<eos> Don't touch it.
I can see that I've got quite a reputation.<eos> Your only obligation here is to do as you please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm an old dog changing kennels.<eos> I need time to get used to it.<eos> How nice to see the sea.<eos> Thank you for having me.<eos> The summer house is father's sanctuary.<eos> He keeps the family archives there.<eos> For fear the kids will mess it up, he's forbidden us from coming here, and he keeps it locked.
I had to see.<eos> I saw a seated man, who disappeared.<eos> I didn't know you were next door.<eos> I knew when I heard you moving.<eos> How come you have the key?<eos> I took it in the steward's room when his wife was fetching milk.<eos> I was curious about the summer house. I wanted to go in.<eos> You can ask me to leave.<eos> My family knows nothing about this passage.<eos> Only Gaspard, the steward, knows about it.
Glad you're okay.<eos> Well, if you can call it that.<eos> I used to work construction.<eos> Turns out you can't do that with a metal rod in your spine.<eos> I was in the middle of a job, too.<eos> It's too bad I didn't get hurt there, if it had to happen.<eos> At least I could have got workman's comp.<eos> Have you looked into disability?<eos> Yeah, I get it. All 300 bucks a week.<eos> There are some exercises you can do for your back to strengthen it.
You know, I know you don't do carbs, but you simply must try this.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Right-o. All the more for me.<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> I booked this huge spread in Italian vogue, but the date of the shoot conflicts with our opening.<eos> I told my manager at least a hundred times not to screw this up.<eos> Well, we can always move the opening, right?<eos> The shoot could take a few weeks.<eos> I would hate to lose the momentum we've been building.<eos> So we'll do it before you go.
- I'll get them.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> - The sideboard, at the top.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'll call later.<eos> No.<eos> There aren't any plates.<eos> There aren't?<eos> Here they are.<eos> I'll go turn it off.
Please stay away from the site. Don't go have a look, out of curiosity.<eos> I'm not saying you can't have fun, but please be careful.<eos> Kaito:<eos> I'm off to work.<eos> Mother<eos> Hello?<eos> Did you eat?<eos> I'll be late tonight Will you be OK?<eos> I cooked some rice.<eos> There's curry in the fridge, so warm it up.
Her head will be here.<eos> That's a giant banyan.<eos> It's 400 or 500 years old.<eos> Ah, they're here.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'll take the bag, Kyoko.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We can't see it.
I'm under the microscope.<eos> The Office of the Inspector General has ordered a psych eval to determine my competency to sit in this chair.<eos> Well, what do you want me to do?<eos> If you don't want me to go back, I won't.<eos> We didn't have this conversation.<eos> And... since we didn't have this conversation,<eos> I want you to go and do whatever it is you believe it is your job to do.<eos> Do you know what your job is?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Then do it.
Your placement should be much more meaningful.<eos> It's not finished.<eos> I'm finishing it for you.<eos> We'll finish it together.<eos> When your great eye looked to the heavens, what did it see?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> There is no God.<eos> Certainly not with that attitude.<eos> God gave you purpose - Not only to create art, but to become it.
I believe my brother won't stop.<eos> How does it make you feel?<eos> Angry.<eos> Anger is an energizing emotion, prompts action against threat.<eos> If you're angry, you're optimistic you can stop this from happening again.<eos> I know how to stop it.<eos> If you really want to kill your brother, Margot, wait until you can get away with it.<eos> Or find someone to do it for you.<eos> You said you were worried about the bird.<eos> Thought you might like to see it.
Chain of white oleander for the intestines.<eos> Ragwort for the liver.<eos> These flowers are all poisonous.<eos> Yes.<eos> This is a judgment.<eos> The ripper believes that his victim was...<eos> Toxic somehow, a poisonous man.<eos> He's so damn certain he makes me sick.<eos> There is a pattern taking shape.<eos> I just have to convince my eyes to see it.

There's no eating here.<eos> We're gonna find everything.<eos> The viscera's exposed, the belly's laid bare, but there's no sign of rutting or gnawing, Jack.<eos> A rabid animal attacks victims at random and doesn't eat any part of them.<eos> Found the same wound patterns on a series of livestock mutilations in the area.<eos> Evisceration, dismemberment, yet everything accounted for.<eos> Livestock mutilations... that was practice?<eos> He's going to kill again.<eos> He's gonna get better at it.<eos> And he's urbanizing his animal, moving it closer to the city... adapting it for bigger prey.
It's not just about making Papa proud.<eos> It's about us.<eos> It's about... family.<eos> I want you to be proud of me too, Margot.<eos> You're all I have.<eos> And, uh... I'm all you have.<eos> And this little piggy went "eeeeeeeeee-eeeeeee-eeee," all the way home.<eos> - It sounds like I'm killing it.<eos> - You are killing it.<eos> Don't kill it.
I've always admired teachers, molding impressionable young minds.<eos> But you can only learn so much and live.<eos> No one likes a know-it-all, Freddie.<eos> Hannibal Lecter taught you when you were an impressionable young mind.<eos> Your book's about Will Graham, it's not about me.<eos> Were you sleeping with Hannibal Lecter when you were his student, or is that a recent development?<eos> Oh, you are sleeping with him.<eos> I was just guessing.<eos> Figured you had to be sleeping with one of them.<eos> Maybe that's why you can't see it.
But not to help.<eos> When you hear Jack scream, why will you come running?<eos> When the moment comes.<eos> When the moment comes.<eos> Will you do what needs to be done?<eos> Yes.<eos> See?<eos> See.<eos> Forgiveness is such a profound, conscious and unconscious state of affairs.<eos> You can't actually choose to do it.
Listen to me, João da Ega.<eos> These silly insults and rickety flow under my feet like the waters of a cesspool.<eos> I just roll up my pants.<eos> I roll up my pants, that's all, Ega!<eos> Drink water sewers!<eos> Your lyricism will be invigorated.<eos> If Craveiro was not rickety, I'd rounding kicked him and his doggerel.<eos> And having covered in mud, I would break his skull!<eos> It is not so easily broken skulls.<eos> I would break it, yes!
- Go to the Gremio, I agree with you.<eos> - Do not wait too long.<eos> From what I was told, you are close to Carlos da Maia.<eos> - You are like brothers...<eos> - Yes, we are friends.<eos> As you may know, I really popular in Paris's mother Carlos da Maia.<eos> There are a few years, she gave me a box, which according to her, contained important documents.<eos> The years passed, she died.<eos> I abbreviate, because you are in a hurry:<eos> I still have this set and I began to tell me that it is better to entrust it to the family.
What is this gibberish that Vilaça came to tell me?<eos> I do not have the courage.<eos> I have to listen!<eos> Understand me, Excellency.<eos> As close to this house, I felt it was my duty...<eos> You have done well, Vilaça.<eos> If I need something, I'll call you.<eos> - What does he?<eos> - My hat.<eos> I had to leave it at the door.

Um, yes.<eos> I want... I want that.<eos> No, you stink.<eos> Blegh!<eos> One, two, three, four, five.<eos> One, two, three, four, five.<eos> - Sylvia!<eos> - Yes?<eos> I made a roast.<eos> Can you just put it in the refrigerator?
- Hmm.<eos> - And, um...<eos> Hi.<eos> Um, and it would be A sort of cautionary tale About sort of sluttin' around, and, you know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whoa.<eos> This is weird.<eos> My dad never calls me.<eos> Get your foot off my backpack!<eos> - I'm not touching it.
- Right now?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Uh, man, i-i don't know If i can cancel<eos> Oh, this thing?<eos> You have this thing?<eos> Come on.<eos> You don't have a thing.<eos> So what are you Looking for?<eos> Well, i hate my body.<eos> I hate it.
- Yeah.<eos> Uh, man, i-i don't know If i can cancel<eos> Oh, this thing?<eos> You have this thing?<eos> Come on.<eos> You don't have a thing.<eos> So what are you Looking for?<eos> Well, i hate my body.<eos> I hate it.<eos> I wanna change it.
Copy that.<eos> This some sort of joke?<eos> On the contrary, Lance.<eos> This is your most important meeting of the day.<eos> You think you can scare me with a few numbers?<eos> No.<eos> Not just numbers, Lance.<eos> The-the, uh, password to your e-mail, but you know that.<eos> From last month.<eos> Change it weekly.
All right, thanks, Eric.<eos> Killer's tattoos were fake.<eos> He wanted us to think he was part of Tuhon's crew.<eos> Which means that everything that came out of his mouth at the consulate was part of the act.<eos> A South African merc named Steven Carter was just released from Black Beach Prison.<eos> He's in L.A.<eos> Ask Santos about Carter. We can't.<eos> He's in surgery.<eos> Carter wanted Equatorial Guinea's oil money in '07.<eos> Still wants it.
Look out for bystanders!<eos> Copy that. Hold on tight.<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> Stay down!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Get out of the car!<eos> Get out of the car!<eos> Shut up!<eos> I got a cell phone detonator on the truck.<eos> I can disable it in a minute.
Stick to Brunson.<eos> Now, the oldest hand on our ran, he taught me everything I needed to know about deep cover ops.<eos> He said that everybody's got three hearts.<eos> The first heart, that's the one you show to strangers.<eos> The second heart?<eos> Only your family gets to see that.<eos> Your family and the person put on this Earth to walk by your side.<eos> Your soul mate.<eos> But that third heart is the thing.<eos> Never let anyone see it.
Tearing up the trash, ripping apart our furniture.<eos> My dad trapped him.<eos> Dumped him in Boggy Creek...<eos> You weren't born in Florida. Or Idaho.<eos> It's a good story, though.<eos> Every time I come in from the cold,<eos> I shed layers.<eos> It's my ritual.<eos> I dump all the things that made me a person into a bag.<eos> Then I zip it up.
They have the software, several pieces of hardware.<eos> But they know they still can't launch without a retinal scan from one of the development engineers.<eos> That's where Riley and her dad come in.<eos> They're to leverage Jessica Peyton.<eos> Emilio, how many times do I have to tell you, no mask, no painting?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Nice work, Sal.<eos> Thanks, Mrs. P.<eos> Someone has the Navy's latest drone prototype.<eos> All they need is one of its engineers to launch it.
She's stopped.<eos> Jessica.<eos> She ditched her car.<eos> And us.<eos> Mr. Callen?<eos> What's your status?<eos> We're screwed.<eos> What about her cell phone, Eric?<eos> It's still in the parking garage.<eos> She must have left it in her car.
Blood is coming from everywhere.<eos> We've got to stop it now.<eos> I'm gonna clamp as much as I can and then you follow behind me and sew everything you see that's got blood coming out of it.<eos> His pulse, Mrs. Gamble.<eos> He's still got one.<eos> Close enough.<eos> That's good, Miss Odom.<eos> You're doing just fine.<eos> I'm gonna run out of thread.<eos> - Where do you keep it?
What will I be doing?<eos> Just talking him through the procedure.<eos> That's all.<eos> His pulse, Mrs. Gamble?<eos> It don't feel like it did before.<eos> - It's different.<eos> - How different?<eos> Not so strong.<eos> Kind of back and forth.<eos> I get it, then I don't.
That's what you're here for, bud.<eos> Yeah, of course I have that Molly.<eos> - Right here, man.<eos> - All right.<eos> Gimme, gimme.<eos> - So you're going to a rave, huh?<eos> - You cannot join us, though.<eos> All right, look, if you want the Molly, okay, then you need to chant the Raver's prayer with me.<eos> Okay, ready? And here we go.<eos> We are one massive tribal village... Say it with me.
- Just give me your soda.<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> Uh, I mean, I've already had too much caffeine anyways.<eos> Bitch.<eos> - Hit my limit.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Ooh.<eos> - Take it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So take it.
- Guess what.<eos> - What are you doing, man?<eos> - Weed...<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Is coming up front with us.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - No!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Give me that joint.<eos> You don't deserve it.
Um, yeah.<eos> This thing's cold.<eos> This thing's ice cold, guys.<eos> You're gonna want it piping hot.<eos> They're really good when they're hot...<eos> Pfft.<eos> I'll take it, man.<eos> - Wait.<eos> It's...<eos> - I'll take it.
- Nothing.<eos> - All right, there are two unrelated wire investigations.<eos> Surveillance followed three of area central's Top-ranking gang targets to this house on carpenter.<eos> Narcotics hasn't gotten anywhere with it, So command staff wants intelligence on it.<eos> Roll out in five.<eos> - Hey, hey, what are ya doing?<eos> - I need a desk.<eos> - Not that one.<eos> That was willhite's desk.<eos> I'll let everybody know when someone can use it.
He set up a buy with ganz tomorrow, 2:00 p.M.<eos> - Hi, jay. - Pastrami for danny, And smoked turkey for you.<eos> - Oh, gosh. We're going to be eating this till thanksgiving.<eos> Hey, let me get you a sandwich.<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> I gotta run.<eos> - Oh, well, let me at least give you a slice of cake to go.<eos> - This is always a tough day for him.<eos> He won't eat it.<eos> I just end up throwing it out.
- Right. Thank you, Dr. Edwards.<eos> Okay, we are all done here.<eos> You, young lady, were very brave.<eos> I'll return in a moment with the dressing.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me, madam?<eos> Your arm needs attention.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> The Negro Infirmary on Minetta.<eos> I can drain it for you right here.
Then why does Mr. Blackbeard want it?<eos> I mean, if it threatens to drive the likes of him out of business forever, why not just pulverize it?<eos> You know, drop it in the deepest part of the ocean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why don't you ask him?<eos> And if you refuse to decode the cipher?<eos> Then it's a gallows dance for us both.<eos> Then why are we still here?<eos> You have the logbook.<eos> Without it, the secret of longitude is lost forever, so let's just burn it and be gone.
And yet...<eos> And yet? Owning it leaves me disadvantaged.<eos> Knowing it to be lost,<eos> William Jagger will intensify his efforts to seek me out, and I can't bear the cost of that, secrecy being my greatest defense.<eos> So as I said, what do you intend? It's yours.<eos> Jagger will pay a fortune to recover it, enough for a fellow and his crew to live like Caesar until the good lord shepherds them home.<eos> That's exceedingly generous, Ed.<eos> How does it benefit you? 'Cause obviously it must, being who you are.<eos> Jagger will be recalled to England a famous man, the man who retrieved the longitude chronometer from blood-handed pirates.<eos> Hip hip, hooray. So you thieved it in order to return it, in order to prove that you don't exist, huh?
Who sent you?<eos> Say the name.<eos> The name.<eos> I want the name.<eos> Say it.<eos> Give me a name.<eos> Give me a name.<eos> I need a name.<eos> Come on, before I let you go, two words, one name.<eos> Say it. Say it.
I worry about disappointing you.<eos> You won't.<eos> I never thought I'd leave this place, and now...<eos> And I can help you.<eos> I'm very resourceful.<eos> Yes. Yes, you are.<eos> I believe in you, Joe.<eos> Now... matches.<eos> Is there an ice machine?<eos> If the body's gonna be here a while, you want to ice it.
We're gonna need more booze.<eos> She tried to kill me at least twice.<eos> She did kill me, although I'm weirdly better off.<eos> They're talking about me, aren't they?<eos> They're reminiscing.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm sure I deserve everything that they're saying.<eos> Does my hand look wrinkled to you?<eos> It looks fine.<eos> If I start to sag anywhere, you take a knife and you jam it into my carotid artery immediately, ok?
Not mine.<eos> I actually do my laundry.<eos> It's not in the floor safe.<eos> Or the kitchen cabinets or the garage or the bookshelves.<eos> The traveler knife is gone.<eos> Are you sure Tyler hid it where he said he did?<eos> Well, obviously not.<eos> Dingdong! Invite me in.<eos> We can hear you just fine from there.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry I interrupted whatever weird ritual you two were doing, but I just want to de-passenger the great citizens of Mystic Falls using your magical traveler knife, so hand it over.

I mean, how do you plan on doing that?<eos> Markos found his way back.<eos> It's not impossible unless you want him terrorizing us for the rest of eternity.<eos> Not particularly.<eos> Uh-uh. Uh, look. I know that--<eos> Ohh! Had to do that for Enzo.<eos> That's the last time you'll hear about it from me.<eos> What do you mean you lost Julian's body?<eos> You/he was right.<eos> The Travelers wanted it.
Go with your first instinct, Damon.<eos> Lesson learned.<eos> Look at me. Damon...<eos> Do you see a future with me?<eos> Because that's all I see.<eos> Elena, I've seen it since the second I laid eyes on you.<eos> Then don't go on a suicide mission.<eos> Listen. Technically, it's only have a suicide mission because we're gonna be bringing people back from the other side, and I'm gonna be with them.<eos> Well, then what if something goes wrong?<eos> All right. Not to relive old fights, but this is my choice, and I need you to respect it.
I didn't exactly turn it in yet.<eos> I still have it.<eos> In your possession?<eos> In my apartment.<eos> Just hear me out.<eos> Okay, once that file goes in for processing, it's in the system.<eos> Once it's in the system, the CIA knows we have it.<eos> They're only gonna get in our way.<eos> 12 hours.<eos> We work that file, just the two of us, for 12 hours, and then we turn it over.
What is love?<eos> Love.<eos> I will start to cry.<eos> Love is when you can say that I will just give my life for somebody.<eos> I think that's love.<eos> How does one find love?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think you have to be lucky to find it.<eos> You have to keep looking and if you are lucky, you will find it.<eos> If not, some people will never find it.
Excuse me.<eos> It's heavy traffic in the Callahan tunnel.<eos> Can you take Northern Ave.?<eos> Why are we stopping?<eos> Please track this GPS signal.<eos> Track it.
Excuse me.<eos> It's heavy traffic in the Callahan tunnel.<eos> Can you take Northern Ave.?<eos> Why are we stopping?<eos> Please track this GPS signal.<eos> Track it.<eos> Track it to where I am right now.
And I blamed Waiman.<eos> We had a little joke.<eos> I told her for college graduation, I was giving her braces again because she never wore the damn retainers.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I knew she would never betray her country.<eos> Then help us prove that.<eos> You can't do this, Valerie.<eos> I am a senior Senator of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<eos> This warrant was issued by a state judge.<eos> A federal judge can block it.
But I cannot, in good conscience, go on with my life and allow him to rape another woman.<eos> You framed her and you killed her, you piece of crap.<eos> Clay, please.<eos> The fact that I had sex with Natalie does not mean that I killed her.<eos> No. No, it doesn't.<eos> But this does.<eos> Please track this GPS signal.<eos> It's Christopher.<eos> He's got a GPS jammer on his phone, but I think I've got it.<eos> Track it.
How much longer do I have to sit here?<eos> How long do these things usually last?<eos> Honestly?<eos> About ten minutes.<eos> The rest is all chit chat.<eos> Listening to them drone on and on about their jobs and their stupid, stupid lives.<eos> You know, no-one is forcing you to do this.<eos> I take six classes this semester.<eos> My time is precious.<eos> I'm not trading it for minimum wage and tips.
That's the Dean from Hudson University.<eos> Just gonna check.<eos> I want to make sure.<eos> Get a radio car over there right now.<eos> Heading over.<eos> Yes, send PSU's and everything you've got.<eos> - What about the other cameras?<eos> - The system is pretty primitive, but I think I can override the cut-offs.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> - I can turn it back on.
Yes, send PSU's and everything you've got.<eos> - What about the other cameras?<eos> - The system is pretty primitive, but I think I can override the cut-offs.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> - I can turn it back on.<eos> Got it.<eos> This is a lovely place.<eos> You have an excellent eye, you know that?<eos> Well thank you.<eos> It, eh, takes one to understand it.
Wait, what? !<eos> Lily's Sacramento trip?<eos> - This really sucks, Ginny.<eos> Not to sound too obvious, but did you look for that money on the roof of your car?<eos> Because that's where my sister-in-law found the infant carrier.<eos> Thank God.<eos> It's not there.<eos> It slid right off.<eos> That's what I get for keeping a nicely waxed vehicle.<eos> Right, but you're just gonna pay it back yourself, right?
Nuh-uh.<eos> Look, everything's under control, okay?<eos> Yeah, if Ginny can organize a huge fund-raiser in, like, a few days.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> It's Ginny.<eos> This will probably end up being, like, the biggest fund-raiser in middle school history.<eos> Our first item up for auction tonight is one of my favorites.<eos> It is an afternoon in Kim's vegetable garden!<eos> KIM: It's organic.<eos> I fertilize it myself.
Sometimes puns can be punny.<eos> - What'd I just say?<eos> - Professor Sabbith?<eos> Jacob, you don't have to call me professor anymore.<eos> It's Sloan.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - I love your blog.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> - I didn't know you read it.
Watching Lisa carpe diem put me to shame.<eos> She knew what she wanted, and she wasn't gonna let it get away.<eos> I certainly wasn't ready to marry my ex-boyfriend Ryan.<eos> But that doesn't mean I should have let him get away without a fight.<eos> I had to go see him.<eos> But since I didn't have a credit card...<eos> Is this gonna be enough?<eos> Could you please not put that on my chair?<eos> Money is filthy, and I seriously can't believe you still use it.<eos> Okay. Uh, where do you want me to put it?
It is not appropriate for him.<eos> Remember, he is quite a bit younger than you are.<eos> - What? !<eos> - He looks up to you.<eos> Because I'm taller.<eos> Come on, there's no way that Fred is younger than me.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what's not getting any younger is the rump I'm roasting for Sheila's dinner.<eos> I'll, uh, just start by clearing the table.<eos> Start by reming this cumbersome laptop.<eos> Putting it in is drawer and swallowing the key.
It's impossibly hot.<eos> Wait, we can't leave a dude behind!<eos> - Oh!<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Do you smell what his butt is cooking?<eos> - It stinks.<eos> - Up here!<eos> Fly, you dudes.<eos> Fly!<eos> Oh, I smell it all the way to here.
She's over me.<eos> Sucks about Callie.<eos> You deserve better.<eos> I want to go back on my meds.<eos> Can we start over?<eos> - We are trying to have a baby.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> A baby? Maybe we should... ask Timothy.<eos> So you read the donor contract?<eos> I don't think I can sign it.
The club?<eos> Selling them could take months.<eos> That's... That's time we don't have, Javier.<eos> What about the lot in Peacock Hill?<eos> I've made my position clear about that, malcolm.<eos> I will not sell it.<eos> It's nothing but a vacant lot.<eos> I've got numerous long-standing offers On the table that'll get us out of this mess.<eos> I said no.<eos> Why do you keep refusing to sell it?
It was just a bunch of junk anyway.<eos> That's how I knew what this place was.<eos> That shed out there, my dad had a place just like this.<eos> You got your Dumpster chair.<eos> That's for sitting in and your drawers all summer drinking.<eos> Got your fancy buckets.<eos> That's for spitting chaw in after your old lady tells you to stop smoking.<eos> You got your internet.<eos> - It's just one of 'em.<eos> - Should we get it?
Merle was high.<eos> We were watching this show and Merle was talking all this dumb stuff about it.<eos> And he wouldn't let up.<eos> Merle never could.<eos> Turns out it was the tweaker's kids' favorite show.<eos> And he never sees his kids, so he felt guilty about it or something.<eos> So he punches Merle in the face.<eos> So I started hitting the tweaker, like, hard.<eos> As hard as I can.<eos> Then he pulls a gun, sticks it right here.
All these names, these lives, stolen that Celeste might take her revenge.<eos> I suppose we have no choice but to see where they take us.<eos> Hayley, I have to go.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Elijah, wait.<eos> What is it?<eos> Ask Marcel if he knows anything about a name on that list...<eos> Brynne Deveraux.<eos> Sophie said that it was her family's bloodline that put the curse on the crescent wolves, but Celeste said that she was the only one that could break it.<eos> If Brynne Deveraux was actually Celeste when she cast the spell, then maybe Celeste can still break it.
I'm not asking for permission.<eos> Now we're even.<eos> So we have a deal? Davina is asleep.<eos> When she wakes up, I'll explain everything.<eos> Then I'll bring her here.<eos> Meantime, we need to lower that barrier.<eos> Celeste cast a powerful spell.<eos> Fortunately for you, she's gone.<eos> Her power bled back into the earth.<eos> Now I can channel it, manipulate it.
Why are you so concerned about Gwen's life, that you'll put your own at risk?<eos> You don't even know her.<eos> – Gwendolyn, you're ...<eos> - You're special.<eos> There are signs, prophecies, references in ancient manuscripts.<eos> We travel through time so we can put it all together.<eos> – All right. Time to go.<eos> - Wait!<eos> Where's your chronograph in my time?<eos> We'll put it in a safe place for you.
As requested, I have one pickaxe, and one sledgehammer.<eos> I think I've seen that somewhere before.<eos> Miss Gwendolyn, might I suggest, that you open the chest in your room, behind closed doors.<eos> The chronograph!<eos> I'm free, Leslie!<eos> – Gwen, it says your name here.<eos> It's from Lucy:<eos> "My dear Gwendolyn,<eos> "I'm happy to finally pass on our chronograph to you.<eos> "Defend it with your life, because that is what's at stake.
Wait, let me...<eos> let me... let me say it again with the right em-pha-sis.<eos> I am a lucky motherfucker.<eos> Wait, hold on, scratch that.<eos> An extremely handsome and lucky motherfucker. Ah, yes.<eos> You know what I'm talking about? Let's get the order correct.<eos> But you know on the real to real, sometimes I get this nagging feeling.<eos> You know, that just one little tremor or shift of the earth... all of this... can just fucking go poof.<eos> Mm. You know?<eos> You feel it, too.
Fork it over.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Catching me some breakfast. That's mine.<eos> My arrow's the one that hit first.<eos> Cottontail belongs to me.<eos> Been out here since before the sun came up.<eos> You see, the rules of the hunt don't mean jack out here.<eos> Now, that rabbit you're holding is claimed, boy.<eos> Claimed whether you like it or not.<eos> So I was you, I'd hand it over.
And I wouldn't miss it for the world.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Good.<eos> The Subaru's running.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Hey, kid, how the hell are ya?<eos> Holy shit, am I glad to see you.<eos> Come on.<eos> You wanna help daddy?<eos> Grab an end of this, help me drag it inside.
I couldn't break the encryption.<eos> Whatever it is, Victor wants it, and I want Victor.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Why not the ICA guys?<eos> They've been compromised.<eos> Storn and Stone?<eos> I'm not sure who exactly, but someone in the ICA is working with Victor.<eos> They killed Sergei, not me.<eos> There's a codeword, Calamus.<eos> Use it and you'll find out everything you need to know.
Oh, that would look so cute in your new place.<eos> Which is why I decided against it.<eos> But Catherine was telling me all about that chest.<eos> How it has special meaning for her?<eos> What, with you having built it for her yourself.<eos> Howard didn't build it.<eos> You know who built it.<eos> It was the only thing he ever finished in his whole life.<eos> My dad made it?<eos> I mean, I clearly remember watching Howard make it.
Shit.<eos> Sorry, Miss Rosa.<eos> It's colder than an Eskimo's nuts in here!<eos> I'm trying to get the heat going, but when I turn it up too high, a real bad smell comes out of the blowers.
- Morning, Officer Bell.<eos> - O'Neill.<eos> Wow.<eos> I didn't expect the bunks to feel so dorm-y.<eos> It kind of reminds me of camp, you know?<eos> Except without the gimp bracelets and the archery and kind of sad.<eos> What a bunch of vultures.<eos> Wait, did you just steal that book?<eos> It's mine.<eos> I'm reclaiming it.
Listen up and learn, okay?<eos> Now, this is your vagina.<eos> This is your labia minora, this, this is your clitoris, and this is your urethra.<eos> This is where you pee from.<eos> Now, ladies, I want each and every one of you to go back to your bunks tonight and get to know your own chachas, okay?<eos> No fucking way.<eos> I got a mons pubis.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> And you also have a labia majora and a clitoral hood.<eos> Now for those of you who are having trouble finding your clitoris, or your partner is having trouble finding your clitoris, you might have to pull back the clitoral hood to expose it.
"Try to reason with the bitch to lay off the sticky fingers,<eos> "but if she doesn't listen,<eos> "you know, drag her to a place where no one can see,<eos> "and bash her head real good."<eos> Jesus saw that.<eos> You can't write any of that.<eos> You know the administration needs to approve all of this.<eos> Why don't you tell her to go buy a sturdy lock at the commissary?<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> Buy a lock, stick it in a sock and slock the bitch down.
No?<eos> You timed this protest to coincide with your book release.<eos> And you didn't even credit your ghostwriter. I'm giving all the proceeds to charity.<eos> I'm doing God's work.<eos> Hey, you know what this stands for?<eos> Vatican Two.<eos> Are you not happy being a nun?<eos> No!<eos> I love being a nun.<eos> If I seem prideful, it's only because I love the work I do. And because I'm really good at it.
She said she doesn't want to do it anymore.<eos> And no more contraband either.<eos> But we just started.<eos> Is this about the black one?<eos> What?<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Not you.<eos> You're not one of the bad ones.<eos> She means Vee.<eos> Red would rather kill the tunnel than let her take it.
Hey, Dad, I know this is no excuse, but Jerry's car handles really badly.<eos> And I was the one who decided Jerry was too drunk to drive.<eos> Mike, he was unconscious.<eos> I know.<eos> What are you doing with a kid who drinks like that?<eos> I should've called you.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> Well, Dad, there was these girls there...<eos> Of course.<eos> Wouldn't want them to think you had parents.
I would hope, Mrs. Fletcher, that they will be considerably fewer... than those voiced by your colleague from New York.<eos> Uh, I have studied this bill very carefully.<eos> And heaven knows... this cannery would certainly bring a lot of new jobs to my district.<eos> And if that were the only consideration, I would vote for it without any hesitation.<eos> However, I've discovered that there are... seven abandoned canneries in my state.<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> Seven.<eos> No longer working, no longer employing people.<eos> And why?<eos> Because the owners walked away from them... rather than spend money to modernize their operations. Now, I believe two of them are your companies, Mr. Dixon.
[Chattering] Ah, refreshments.<eos> They look scrumptious.<eos> These are for the little children.<eos> Okay? Lunch in an hour.<eos> How was your walk?<eos> Invigorating.<eos> I don't suppose you'd like to play peacemaker.<eos> There is a minor war breaking out over there on the terrace.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Diego's taste in old friends is so ecumenical... it's a wonder any of them speak the same language.
Reinhold, whereas you sit down naked and vulnerable before us.<eos> I would like to land a simple question:<eos> What was the goal of all it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't wonder ever why I make it.<eos> It is thus for the other madness that I committed.<eos> I would not like to know the answer.<eos> I have the feeling that I can to write on these enormous partitions ...of 3000 or 4000 meter high, as a professor writes on a blackboard with a chalk.<eos> But I don't only make that to write these lines ...of the imaginary lines, I live these lines.<eos> I also have the impression that after, these lines remain there even though I am the only one to can to feel them, to see them that I live them and nobody else be able to ever see them but they are there and them will remain forever there.
Larvae of the Great Sarcophagus.<eos> Quite a menacing name, appropriate to the insect that bears it.<eos> It lives exclusively off dead bodies. Human remains.<eos> The Great Sarcophagus.<eos> What a weird name!<eos> They're a destroyer, a flesh eater.<eos> It is capable of picking up the scent of a dead body over vast distances.<eos> Its sensory perception is extraordinary, quite unique.<eos> But why did the glove have so many larvae in it?<eos> Perhaps because when the murderer hides his victims he likes to keep in physical contact with them. Conserving them.
There were bars between us.<eos> I understand, Frau Brückner.<eos> Forgive me. But we have to be precise.<eos> You moved here eight months ago, correct?<eos> Yes, that is so, Inspector.<eos> Please, come this way.<eos> And where were you living before that?<eos> Outside Zurich.<eos> Perhaps the murderer hides his victims.<eos> He likes to keep in physical contact with them. Conserving them.
Look, you're not going to be picking a fight, Dad.<eos> Daddy-o.<eos> You're coming to her rescue, right?<eos> Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you going to be?<eos> I'm going to be at the dance.<eos> Right. And where am I going to be?<eos> You're gonna be in the car with her.<eos> Right, okay. So, right around 9:00, she's going to get very angry with me.<eos> Why is she going to get angry with you?<eos> Well, because, George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.
I don't know.<eos> Maybe because... you lived under cars and...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> You're right, you know.<eos> About what?<eos> Just about...me being better with cars than with people.<eos> I guess it's 'cause I trust them more than I do people.
Good.<eos> Right on schedule.<eos> Let's go.<eos> And I thought that creep loved me!<eos> You're not the only one he double-crossed.<eos> All outboard valves fully locked, sir.<eos> The water level's dropping.<eos> Pump pressure, good.<eos> Come on.<eos> There's nothing you can do for them now.
I'm not a girl.<eos> I'm a witch.<eos> Dad, do witches exist?<eos> No, princess. Of course not.<eos> Witches don't exist.<eos> How about before, many years ago?<eos> Never. At that time, people were very ignorant.<eos> They thought some women had a pact with the devil, so they burned them alive.<eos> They burned them?<eos> Yes. They thought it was the only way to get rid of them.
It's a power.<eos> It's loads and loads of ray energy we must receive and reflect back within 10 seconds.<eos> How will the cooudination council react?<eos> They'll surrender, I think.<eos> Even the Indian is about to give up.<eos> He'd like to implement our project for the rescue of Heat Planet.<eos> Though I think there's nothing alive there left.<eos> You shouldn't be so negative about it, professor.<eos> Yankov discovered curious things about the flower.<eos> He thinks, the flowers saved the gene pool of the disappeared civilization in them.
On, who by?<eos> The landlord of the Alpha Public House. Oh, yeah, he had a couple of dozen off me.<eos> Where, may I ask, did you get them?<eos> Here then, mister, what exactly are you driving at?<eos> It's straight enough<eos> I simply want to know who sold you the geese that you supplied to the Alpha.<eos> Well then, I'm not gonna tell you, so now.<eos> It really is of no matter, but I fail to see why you should get so warm over a trifle.<eos> Warm, you'd be as warm if you were as pestered as I am.<eos> When I pay good money for a good article that should be an end of it but it's where are the geese, who have you sold them to, how much will you take for them?
I just wanted to see the old country once more before I died.<eos> I saved what I could and eventually I got a ship.<eos> I didn't know the regiment was stationed here in Aldershot,<eos> I just wanted to be where there were soldiers.<eos> I could earn my keep going around the canteens doing my tricks to entertain them.<eos> I no longer wanted to kill Barclay, the fires of revenge had burned low over the years... until<eos> I saw her.<eos> I thought I'd better get some English tongs, I looked comical enough without wearing these foreign clothes the whole time.<eos> At first, I was more interested in finding a thick overcoat than looking at the charity ladies who were doling them out.<eos> Then one of them came over, I recognized her at once.
You have got to learn to be more sociable!<eos> I don't think she liked me.<eos> You got to make them like you.<eos> Talk like you're interested in all that crap they go on about.<eos> You just got to talk more.<eos> I don't care about what, as long as it's not flying and birds!<eos> What if that's what I'm really thinking about?<eos> That's the first thing you got to understand in your dealings with women.<eos> Never let them know what you're thinking.<eos> I'm not thinking about them.
Attagirl.<eos> That's right.<eos> OK. - You got it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Very good.<eos> Now, we're...<eos> Here's what...<eos> When Shandar was like this... what he would do is he would wriggle.<eos> - Wriggle?<eos> - Yeah, and what happens... is the ropes gradually start to get some play in them, they start to get loose.
My other dream is that my children be educated.<eos> I don't care what you do.<eos> Worse comes to worst, an educated plumber... which would make you a better plumber than me.<eos> But be educated.<eos> Now, this... this friend of yours has some funny ideas.<eos> This Mr. Brophy...<eos> Brody.<eos> Brody! Everybody knows this guy!<eos> He's got some funny ideas.<eos> And I won't have them in my house.
Times 1 4-2-84, Page 3, Byline 2, should read:<eos> "Miniprod Forecasts Increase Chocolate Ration, April, 1984... "from 20 to 25 Grams Per Week."<eos> I confess to spreading the rumor, on orders from Goldstein... that the war is not really with Eurasia, but with Eastasia.<eos> That, for years, in fact since the days of our glorious Revolution...<eos> I had no faith in our future.<eos> I forged government announcements and falsified figures... quoted for agricultural and industrial production.<eos> As a result of mental disturbance from my experiences during the atomic wars...<eos> I was a willing subject of Goldstein's influence.<eos> I was stubborn and egocentric.<eos> When ownlife thoughts occurred to me, I reveled in them.
You may have the right to throw stones for that sort of thing, but I haven't.<eos> - Tell them to wait. - Sir.<eos> Aye, it starts already.<eos> Vakil Hamidullah and Mahmoud Ali, legal advisors to the prisoner.<eos> Where is Miss Quested now?<eos> Staying with the Callendars until she's out of danger.<eos> - What danger?<eos> - She has a fever.<eos> But worse, hundreds of cactus spines are embedded in her arms and legs.<eos> There's a danger of them entering the bloodstream.
I want some antitank here.<eos> We're working on it, sir.<eos> This...this is a madhouse!<eos> Do you want to see me?<eos> Yes...yes.<eos> Go to the sporting goods store.<eos> From the files, obtain form 4473.<eos> These will contain descriptions of weapons... and lists of private ownership.<eos> But our families, huh?<eos> What about them, huh?
I am a pirate, but I'm honest.<eos> He is a charlatan and impostor.<eos> - But he treated my tooth.<eos> - Did he have a choice?<eos> And he healed me from seasickness.<eos> Good.<eos> You are re-established.<eos> You can again loot and kill.<eos> It lays the magical needles in the fire !<eos> You could get rich thanks to them.
This, that we're looking at could never ever, ever be repeated, everl<eos> This will go down, and as I say, not just because of me but because of everything, this will go down in rock-and-roll history.<eos> And their performance, I think, was absolutely spot on.<eos> And the music was fantastic.<eos> I'm seeing stuff that I've, you know I can't remember since the edit.<eos> And that wasn't one of these fancy lipstick cameras, it was a heavy hand-held jobbie.<eos> You can see it on the left of the frame, there he is.<eos> That was another thing, we didn't really...<eos> It never bothered us that cameras were in shot.<eos> Because, you know... in 2008, you know people are so so now familiar with cameras, and their own home video cameras, that you don't have to worry about them being in shot, they just expect them to be there, because how else do you get those shots?
Another nail in the coffin of variety.<eos> I liked Bernard the rabbit-baiter.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, Edmund, is this announcement going to take long?<eos> I haven't seen a eunuch yet.<eos> Don't worry, Harry.<eos> It will soon all be over. My dear mother, my dear brother, lords and ladies of the Court.<eos> Today there came into my possession from the hands, My Lord, of your faithful servant, Dougal McAngus certain letters, certain rather extraordinary letters concerning the lineage of Prince Harry.<eos> Letters?<eos> What is so extraordinary about them?
- Did you have a nice weekend?<eos> - I had a wonderful weekend.<eos> Went to Martha's Vineyard, long walks on the beach, hiked over the dunes, crisscrossed the island on bicycles.<eos> Still couldn't lose him?<eos> You now, you are the last person in the world who should take shots at somebody else's choice of dates.<eos> Not with the coterie of Betty Boops you squander you time, money and hormones on.<eos> - I date terrific women.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And talented.<eos> Without them, the art of gum-snapping might be lost for ever.
I have nothing more to teach you.<eos> You know everything.<eos> Do not tell no one of this place.<eos> You always come alone.<eos> The pilgrimage to the mountain is painful.<eos> We appreciate your courage.<eos> Excellent sake.<eos> Orin, this preparation Is really worthy of you.<eos> We must respect the rules of the pilgrimage.<eos> One of them is: on the way it is forbidden to exchange a word.
"l didn't kill Massoulier, nor my wife.<eos> "l didn't kill Louison, or the Eden cashier."<eos> It's not much help.<eos> Santelli speaking.<eos> I don't know. I'm busy.<eos> I'm tied up here for at least an hour.<eos> It's very simple, honey. Use the potatoes while they're hot.<eos> You may burn your fingers, but never mind.<eos> - l get it, darling.<eos> - Then, you pour the white wine on the potatoes, but slice them thin.
The die is cast!<eos> Give the envelope to the cops... but keep Marie-Christine's picture.<eos> I killed her because she no longer loved me,<eos> Massoulier because she asked me to.<eos> I killed Paula because she guessed the truth and Louison because he was blackmailing me.<eos> I was about to kill Vercel.<eos> I don't belong to the brotherhood of men.<eos> Everything I've done was for women.<eos> I like to look at them and to touch them.<eos> I enjoy giving them pleasure.
Get ready.<eos> Give no quarter.<eos> We are ready.<eos> Keep cool.<eos> Strength is not in numbers only.<eos> Don't shake on your legs and stare the enemy straight in the eye.<eos> Move forward, never go backward.<eos> Kuma, spur your troops on.<eos> They won't come.<eos> Suenaga took some geishas and went out fishing with them.
Don't pretend you are smart.<eos> If you were smart you would have liked champagne and woman.<eos> So, I am not angel.<eos> Always you loose time.<eos> The salvation of the world is in our hands.<eos> If we make a mistake we would cause its destruction.<eos> Do you think you are the man who saves the world?<eos> As much as you think you are a womanizer.<eos> Think about the destruction of the world and that all the women die.<eos> What would you do without them?
- What if we went to the river?<eos> - There are shirts to wash...<eos> Let's go to the river.<eos> I could die from love, I could.<eos> Be quiet, witch.<eos> Nobody dies from love.<eos> - Have you washed the underclothes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And the shirts?<eos> - I've washed them white.
Forget it, Lieutenant.<eos> It wasn't a pretty picture.<eos> What have you found?<eos> These red lights keep moving back and forth.<eos> Aside from that, this thing seems to have no function whatsoever.<eos> It must have some function.<eos> Why would the government put all that money into a thing with lights?<eos> Sir, these lights keep blinking out of sequence.<eos> What should we do about it?<eos> Get them to blink in sequence.
- You broke?<eos> Where are you from?<eos> - Lots of places.<eos> - You don't give much information.<eos> - I don't want a government job.<eos> I've got to know things about the people I take on.<eos> I've got all quality girls here.<eos> See them pictures on the mantelpiece?<eos> All of them are young ladies from The Flag that married well.<eos> Half of them couldn't even count when they came here.
I'm sure our community could keep you in work for some time even if you caused a good deal of trouble.<eos> Especially if you caused a good deal of trouble.<eos> There's the English reporter. I told you he'd come.<eos> You also said your article would draw a thousand people.<eos> At least some of the Hindus brought their wives.<eos> No, I asked my wife to organize that.<eos> Some of them are leaving.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen we have asked you to gather here to help us proclaim our right to be treated as equal citizens of the Empire.<eos> We do not seek conflict.<eos> We know the strength of the forces arrayed against us know that because of them, we can only use peaceful means.
Hello?<eos> Yes, it's me.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> I'm coming.<eos> There he comes.<eos> Attention.<eos> Gerber.<eos> You've made a fool out of me.<eos> You get to train four girls and you let them be kidnapped.
It's universal.<eos> Our famous Duchess of Santos should know...<eos> Remember Our Lord.<eos> He lived in Jerusalem and other great cities.<eos> He only passed through the smaller ones.<eos> Four centuries of beef! Scandalous!<eos> Let's have frog's legs.<eos> If not with too much garlic, they're delicious.<eos> Now, let's get to the widows our greatest source of income.<eos> Always exaggerate our troubles with them.
For better or for worse. Michael.<eos> Michael. Demolition derby indeed.<eos> I'm gettin' mad, man.<eos> You understand?<eos> Mad! Yeah. Yeah, well, I...<eos> I can understand that. That car will be mine.<eos> Mine, you hear!<eos> Haven't we been graced with a beautiful day... here at the Millston Speedway for the first running of what we hope will be an annual event... the Comtron International Demolition Derby.<eos> We've got a full field of beautiful brand-new vehicles, right off the showroom floor.<eos> You're probably going to get to see them all turned into a body shop bonanza before the end of this day.
My alibi?<eos> But of course.<eos> You can check your files on that.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> All the best, Lieutenant.<eos> All the best.<eos> Do I have charms which might conquer another?<eos> And who, besides myself, has been conquered by Querelle's charms?<eos> How could I become him?<eos> I push up my pajama sleeves... to keep them from getting in my way when I jerk off.
- Chihuahua?<eos> - No.<eos> Not you.<eos> You're much too good for that.<eos> Why not Mexico City, St. Louis, New Orleans?<eos> I'm really tempted to take you along with me... but I'm just afraid that I'd awaken some morning... and find you'd made a necklace with my teeth.<eos> - No, you'll stay here for now.<eos> - What about the girls?<eos> - They're coming with me.<eos> - I'd rather go with them.
You know that.<eos> And when the shooting starts... she'll be there to look after the girls.<eos> We'll take care of her, Dal.<eos> That's a promise.<eos> I'm gonna hold you to it.<eos> You looking for someone?<eos> I heard at the mission some women were brought in.<eos> I'd like to see them.<eos> This is not a good place for you.<eos> Take me to them, please.
You mustn't think me a fool I'd never think you a fool, but a reticule...<eos> But my reticule never leaves my side, Leave it all aside<eos> It's the only thing my mother gave me...<eos> We have a place where we can go<eos> Pretty women Fascinating...<eos> Sipping coffee, Dancing... pretty women<eos> Are a wonder.<eos> Pretty women!<eos> Sitting in the window or Standing on the stair<eos> Something in them cheers the air.
That's one trick you won't manage.<eos> - You wanna bet?<eos> I assume, Brown, you know the penalties for libel?<eos> Everyone knows it's true.<eos> - They're lies if I say so.<eos> But it's the truth.<eos> - The truth?<eos> Truth has nothing to do with reality.<eos> You have to deal with reality.<eos> In reality, any one of these people, with a little persuasion will say what I want them to say because I am reality.
We'll get that fly right out of your ear.<eos> All right, Nick, come on.<eos> Get these people to quit smoking.<eos> - And find that duck.<eos> - The duck?<eos> I'm telling you, find me more help tonight.<eos> Or find yourself a new chief resident.<eos> Now, I've got this new intern here for you, and I found three girls.<eos> Three candy-striper volunteers.<eos> Two of them are paramedics, and one worked in publicity.
Throw yourself on your knees in front of the judge and beg for mercy.<eos> That's very funny, but you'll see.<eos> In the most bizarre debut in recent times a self-styled comedian named Rupert Pupkin appeared on The Jerry Langford Show.<eos> There is no doubt the incident, has made the name Rupert Pupkin a household word. MAN 3:<eos> Rupert Pupkin's performance has been viewed by a record 87 million American households.<eos> Rupert Pupkin, the kidnapping King of Comedy was sentenced to six years imprisonment at the minimum-security facility in Allenwood, Pennsylvania for his part in the abduction of talk-show host Jerry Langford.<eos> On the anniversary of his appearance on the show Pupkin told reporters he still considers Jerry Langford his friend and mentor.<eos> He reported that he has been writing his memoirs which have been purchased by a leading New York publishing house for in excess of $1 million.<eos> Rupert Pupkfn was ref eased today after serving two years and nine months of a six-year sentence.<eos> Hundreds were there to greet the 37-year-old comedian and author among them his new agent and manager, David Ball who announced that King for a Night, Pupkin's bestselling autobiography...
Smile!<eos> I want to thank you for last night.<eos> You were sensational.<eos> I've never been in love before.<eos> Mr. Poulet?<eos> I What do you want?<eos> Well, I just wanted to apologize for what happened in the chicken coop last week, sir.<eos> I had no idea that the film would have such a profound effect on the girls.<eos> That's not the problem, bozo.<eos> You got them so steamed up, why, those stupid birds want Friday night dances with the roosters.
Receive her soul...<eos> Prince of Darkness.<eos> Receive her soul...<eos> Prince of Darkness.<eos> Our Father, who art in hell... your black-souled sons... continue to carry out your will... and bring you this new offering... as a token of their total submission... to you and your accursed Decalogue... which came into our hands thanks to our founder's ploys.<eos> Beaut/ful l/ttle flower W/th golden petals W/th l/ttle b/rd teeth<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - What?<eos> I'm singing to the flowers.<eos> Don't you know you need to sing to flowers to make them bloom?
Let's check it.<eos> Someone benefits from affecting our psyche.<eos> The legendary Gryphon.<eos> How come he's in outer space?<eos> Yes...<eos> The disc is made of the same metal.<eos> - Surprises, surprises...<eos> - Look.<eos> Depicted on it are the planets of our solar system.<eos> There're 10 of them.
- Sugar, sugar...<eos> Don't change subject! I'll make you spit it out. Where's the dough!<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where's my money?<eos> That money's mine, not his.<eos> I saved it up to get the hell out.<eos> I deserve some good times... to see the Riviera... I didn't spend 15 years here to be ripped off by a whore like you. I'm warning you!<eos> I never saw your money!<eos> You seen Nono's hands?<eos> What's wrong with them?
Let's rehearse it.<eos> You'll take care of the decorations.<eos> They're your responsibility.<eos> Hands o_ the Odra Hands o_ the Nysa<eos> Hands o_ our western borders.<eos> These are our lands the realm of our kings<eos> We are the ones who won the west.<eos> No Pope gave us our seacoast.<eos> No bishop ruled in Silesia.<eos> With Polish soldiers' blood These lands are stained On them dwelled our forebears.
You know. you're right. it's true.<eos> We've talked to you on the phone a few times but in the last couple of months. we have let you drift out of our lives.<eos> Has it been really tough?<eos> Not bad.<eos> Actually. um. it's been pure shit.<eos> But it could be worse.<eos> How do you get through the day?<eos> I work.<eos> But I tend to. uh. lose track.<eos> I get on the bus and I forget where I'm going and I watch the streets go by and I just hope to God that one of them will remind me what I'm there for.
I think it made me see more clearly.<eos> Is... is that possible?<eos> No doubt.<eos> Soon he no longer bothered to hide the real nature of his intentions towards me... nor could I pretend surprise. My innocence was false from the moment I chose to stay.<eos> I could tell you that he overpowered me... or that he drugged me, but... it is not so.<eos> I gave myself to him.<eos> I did it so that I should never be the same again... so that I should be seen for the outcast I am!<eos> I knew it was ordained that I should never marry an equal, so... I married shame.<eos> It is my shame that has kept me alive... my knowing that I am truly not like other women.<eos> I shall never, like them, have children and a husband... and the pleasures of a home.

He probably thought we were the owners and took off.<eos> My considered opinion is it was a bat in the belfry.<eos> You know, this would be a perfect place to write.<eos> That's a novel idea.<eos> Hey, maybe I could rent it.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> You wouldn't last one clay alone in this house.<eos> Why?<eos> I have always been fascinated by these houses.<eos> I've written so much about them, it already feels like home.
I guess that's your job.<eos> See you.<eos> - Bye, see you.<eos> Dad?<eos> - What?<eos> What do we do?<eos> I do not know.<eos> I think I better bring your sisters.<eos> To my sisters?<eos> - Tell them to go to work.
Wrestle or by sword?<eos> Let's wrestle...<eos> That's better.<eos> Come on, my brother-in-law!<eos> Oh, my dear savior.<eos> My father will give me to you, and with me, half his kingdom.<eos> Come on, pack your stuff and let's go.<eos> Where would we go, my dear savior?<eos> Your two sisters are also down here, kidnapped by two dragons.<eos> Then go and free them, too.
You are splendid and holy:<eos> I realise you are Wotan's child.<eos> But tell me one thing, immortal: will his sister and bride accompany her brother?<eos> Will I embrace Sieglinde there?<eos> She must still breathe the air of earth.<eos> Siegmund will not see her there.<eos> Then greet Valhalla for me, greet Wotan,<eos> greet Wälse and all the heroes for me.<eos> Greet the lovely pleasing maidens too.<eos> I will not follow you to them.
It would be another thousand years before the next movie.<eos> Luckily, our Ship of the Imagination can take us anywhere in space... and time.<eos> The ancient Chinese and Greeks observed that light could be made to do wonderful things-- but no one asked that question favored by small children and geniuses alike.<eos> Why?<eos> Until a thousand years ago... In the city of Basra, Iraq, there lived another master of light.<eos> Ibn al-Hazen had a passionate desire to understand nature.<eos> He questioned everything, especially those things that everyone else took for granted.<eos> "How do we see?" he asked.<eos> Some of the great authorities who came before him had taught that rays come out of our eyes and travel to the objects we see before returning to our eyes.<eos> But al-Hazen reasoned that the stars were too far distant for something in our eyes to travel all the way to them and back in the blink of an eye.
And the reverberations of his momentous discovery echo still.<eos> His spectral lines revealed that the visible cosmos is all made of the same elements.<eos> The planets... The stars...<eos> The galaxies...<eos> We, ourselves, and all of life...<eos> The same star stuff.<eos> He made it possible for us to know what's in the atmosphere of other worlds.<eos> And in galaxies millions of light-years away.<eos> Spectral lines revealed not only the composition of far-off objects, but also their motion towards or away from us.<eos> Using them, we discovered that our universe is expanding.

Then and there, Champollion resolved he would understand this language no one could read he would decode the messages from another world and another time.<eos> He became a superb linguist and immersed himself in the hieroglyphics.<eos> Fourier edited the illustrated description of Napoleon's expedition.<eos> The young Champollion studied it hungrily.<eos> To the people of Europe these exotic images revealed an utterly alien civilization a world of towering monuments and magical names.<eos> Dendera.<eos> Karnak.<eos> Luxor.<eos> Every illustration was a riddle posed by the past to the present.<eos> And among them were pictures of something called the Rosetta Stone and portraits of the people who lived among the ruins of the pharaohs.
You two.<eos> Just to save time because they're in the front row.<eos> I need one of you to turn the star and the planet and another person to pull the star and planet along.<eos> And what you will see is that the star you can make out will be moving in a funny, wiggly pattern which will be the clue, the evidence for the existence of the dark planet.<eos> Okay, let's have a spin.<eos> Good. And a pull.<eos> And you see this funny motion that the star makes because of the planet. Thank you.<eos> That's another way of finding out the existence of a planet that you couldn't see directly.<eos> Well, both of these methods are being used.<eos> And by the time that you people are as old as I am we should know, for all the nearest stars if they have planets going around them.
I can't take staying in he dark.<eos> Can't keep control of my head in the dark.<eos> Now that wasn't so bad, was it?<eos> It was disgusting.<eos> Your girlfriend's a pretty lay.<eos> - Let's say that I earned a drink, please.<eos> - And why not? It's a real pleasure.<eos> You got a lotta balls.<eos> To have balls, my dear, you have to have them first up there and then down there.<eos> Many guys have them only as decoration.
Love has nothing to do with it.<eos> My mom has an extra room. She rents it out.<eos> Next thing you know, I've got a new father.<eos> They're all right, mostly.<eos> They may stay a day or a week or a month, if we're lucky.<eos> Sometimes they even pay the rent.<eos> They keep out all the rats.<eos> I'm talking about real rats the junkies and the winos and the shitheads and the people who beat up little 5-year-old kids.<eos> I got three sisters, see?<eos> One of them, Maria, she's in kind of a special place.
KDK 12 to KDK 1.<eos> This is IKDIK 1 .<eos> We're receiving you.<eos> Over.<eos> Hi, this is Wendy Torrance at the Overlook Hotel.<eos> Hi, how are you folks getting on up there? Over.<eos> We're just fine. But our telephones aren't doing too well.<eos> Are the lines down, by any chance? Over.<eos> Yes, quite a few of them are down due to the storm. Over.<eos> Any chance of them being repaired soon? Over.
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.<eos> A very willful boy.<eos> A rather naughty boy if I may be so bold, sir.<eos> It's his mother.<eos> She interferes.<eos> Perhaps they need a good talking-to.<eos> If you don't mind my saying so.<eos> Perhaps a bit more.<eos> My girls, sir they didn't care for the Overlook at first.<eos> One of them actually stole a pack of matches and tried to burn it down.
I was just trying to be funny.<eos> Do you find it very hard to direct yourself?<eos> No, I just have to resist the temptation to give myself too many extreme close-ups.<eos> Have you studied filmmaking in school?<eos> No, no, I didn't study anything in school.<eos> They studied me.<eos> I understand you studied philosophy at school.<eos> No, that's not true.<eos> I did take... I took one course in existential philosophy at New York University.<eos> And on the final, they gave me ten questions, and I couldn't answer a single one of them, you know.
Why on earth?<eos> Well, since they cannot see her, make them think some bungling naval bomb disposal officer has done so.<eos> Well, what will that achieve?<eos> I'd have thought that was obvious. If they think "Ruth" has gone, they're hardly likely to try and blow her up themselves.<eos> He may press the button anyway.<eos> That is a chance we have to take.<eos> I suggest a nice big explosion shortly after dark followed by a fire to light up the sky for miles.<eos> I'll lay it on immediately.<eos> - Now what's the second reason?<eos> Since the helicopter brought three, it could take three people back, providing we can get them on board unseen.
It'II protect the two knights forever.<eos> The night symbolizes peace and serenity. So...<eos> So it's time to eat, if anybody knows where the can opener got to...<eos> I'd better help out if we don't want to starve.<eos> Don't think you can get out of it like that.<eos> I'd better give them a hand, too.<eos> Thanks for helping smooth things over with Maggie.<eos> How come you stopped?<eos> Because the cards weren't answering.<eos> I always listen to them.
What were you saying just now?<eos> - Turn it on.<eos> - What?<eos> Turn it...<eos> Turn it on. I can't read that.<eos> I need my glasses.<eos> They're on your head, Mrs Richards.<eos> I've lost them.<eos> They're the only pair I've got.<eos> I can't read a thing without them.
It would be better after all if you lived with your mother.<eos> They're putting on an act.<eos> You see?<eos> She still doesn't know what it's about.<eos> She should be happy.<eos> If I wasn't working we wouldn't even have enough to buy paprika.<eos> You see this circus?<eos> You see?<eos> For her friends, there's enough.<eos> For them, there's always enough.
No, I heard you playing.<eos> I thought there was... A little party.<eos> - In fact...<eos> How is it going?<eos> - There was a party.<eos> Fine. I'm fine.<eos> - You have a lighter? - I'd feel even better here.<eos> Do you have it for long?<eos> This is beautiful. Look at those lights.<eos> Too bad you can't see them by day.
Luigi!<eos> Luigi!<eos> Let me introduce my uncle, one of the local doctors of Galliano.<eos> - Doctor Mirillo... doctor Levi.<eos> - Pleased to meet you.<eos> You're a young man, a handsome young man.<eos> - I wish I were a young man.<eos> - Of course you are.<eos> In this town, you must beware mostly of the women.<eos> Don't accept anything from them. Neither wine nor coffee.
She's a very clean, though, and hard-working.<eos> Shall we go downstairs? It's so hot here.<eos> What's more important, she knows the house tile by tile.<eos> She was the mistress of the house, and of the bed of the priest, too.<eos> Don Carlo, have you seen the well?<eos> The priest used it to cool wine bottles, when he expected guests.<eos> - That's nice.<eos> - You should do it too.<eos> You lower them slowly into the well in a basket. When the right moment comes up, you pull them up and you drink them all to our health, nice and cool.<eos> Don Luigi, I have 2 letters to send, but I'd like you to check them right away.
Well, I saw a salmon that took my breath away.<eos> It is the Garden of Eden.<eos> I've let no one come here.<eos> You are the first to see it.<eos> It's magical.<eos> We were once a magical people.<eos> It's true.<eos> When I was a child, every rock, every tree had a story.<eos> The whole forest was filled with legends.<eos> We heard about one of them. RAMONA: Yes?
Perhaps not, Doctor.<eos> Captain.<eos> V'Ger must evolve.<eos> Its knowledge has reached the limits of this universe and it must evolve.<eos> What it requires of its God, Doctor, is the answer to its question,<eos> "Is there nothing more?"<eos> What more is there than the universe, Spock?<eos> Other dimensions, higher levels of being.<eos> The existence of which cannot be proven logically.<eos> Therefore, V'Ger is incapable of believing in them.
And the French, much more recently.<eos> That may well be, your grace, but be that as it may, my duty is clear... ..the defence of all this...<eos> Natal.<eos> Well, it's difficult to stand against that position - if you speak only of defence.<eos> And what does our good Col. Durnford think? If the people of Natal wish to feel safe, let them persuade their husbands and sons to offer as volunteer.<eos> We do, Colonel. Good point.<eos> I cannot be brought to believe that<eos> Every Zulu is raised to be a warrior.<eos> Without war, there's no zulu nation. Nobody is really safe, are they, his excellency?<eos> Mrs. DeWitt has four daughters, Henry, and I fear she feels for them all.
In 1964 I was a Wawiejski's secretary.<eos> You used to come there...<eos> Yes, I did, but I don't remember.<eos> You used to be a young student then.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> I had my cigarettes here!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Where are my Kents?<eos> Manager, your actor has stolen my cigarettes.<eos> - You have them here.
Caesar cannot be a fool. - But he's trying very hard.<eos> Caesar cannot be a fool.<eos> Little Boots. They'll throw you in the Tiber, if you temp to move the government.<eos> So, you are going to marry a respectable Roman lady of the senatorial class.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> You've got to have an heir.<eos> Who will kill me when he grows up.<eos> The priestess of Isis are meeting at my house tonight.<eos> You want me to marry one of them?
It strengthens the chest and the shoulders.<eos> The "Cobra" position.<eos> Slowly raise your head...<eos> The "Cobra" position.<eos> Slowly raise your head...<eos> Oppressors!<eos> Is this how you treat your women?<eos> It's a woman who gave birth to you, and you, and you, and me, to all!<eos> A woman is a mother.<eos> How can you let them carry such heavy weights?
# Between us # Love has begun<eos> # Between us # Two hearts are one<eos> # Nothing can come between us<eos> # Whatever we do # Whenever we kiss<eos> # Between you and me, it's not hit n' miss<eos> # We were made for each other, girl<eos> They chased me, and they caught me, and they beat me up<eos> Who did?<eos> Those little girls<eos> One of them screamed in my ear
It isn't morality.<eos> It isn't?<eos> Then what the fuck is it?<eos> "That's no excuse to act like whores, whores have more tact, funny no guy's picked you up!"<eos> Are you trying to pick us up?<eos> Fine, I get your point.<eos> Are you sure you got it?<eos> You can have your money back.<eos> Go and get laid for a change, it's good for you!<eos> I know other chicks like them.
Did they knock the wind out of you?<eos> No, it's nothing.<eos> It will pass...<eos> Maybe they're beating Shorty up too.<eos> Don't waste your time with that clown and that druggie Rico.<eos> Maybe the two new girls brought it in.<eos> Tina and Lia?<eos> They're a couple of airheads.<eos> But I guess, now that you say that...<eos> You'd better send them home, they might turn into terrorists.
M. Berthier and the prostitute are forgotten.<eos> Marry off Andréa, and ask for the Pope's blessing if need be.<eos> Listen, Louise.<eos> I'm completely done for.<eos> If you go on like this, I'll crack.<eos> You have to marry her off, with pomp and ceremony.<eos> Then you'll be the personification of tradition once more.<eos> Where do this young man's parents live?<eos> I won't do just anything. I'm a professional!<eos> Use amateurs if you want, but don't let them bother the real artists!
No, not that.<eos> Listen, I'm not ready.<eos> I'd rather you waited for me here.<eos> If you don't mind, I'll come and get you.<eos> Please, just one more minute.<eos> We can go in now.<eos> Now my dead have a place that's irrevocably theirs.<eos> This former chapel won't be a place of death or a place of rest, but a place of life.<eos> Even after we're gone, you and I, these flames will continue to glow, breathing to the rhythm of the human heart.<eos> None of them should go out.
No, Sally, wait a sec.<eos> My wife Sally.<eos> This is... what was your name?<eos> Monty.<eos> I don't know them.<eos> Who are you?<eos> - Usa.<eos> - My wife Sally...<eos> There's two things that smell like fish.<eos> One of them's fish.
- See you.<eos> Lulu!<eos> - This is Lulu...<eos> - And Michele.<eos> We're not home, so go to hell!<eos> But if you're not a horny creep, leave a message at the beep!<eos> That was so dumb!<eos> Senseless violence, unrelenting, inexcusable hateful violence, is once more unleashed.<eos> Each one of us has some purpose on this earth some role to play and in the case of Michele and Lulu the role that they had chosen to play was the role of model.<eos> Now, not having met either of these lovely young women but knowing that I did want to say something meaningful about them today I went to my Webster's Dictionary and I looked up the word "model".
We've got to kill them this time!<eos> Let's get out of here!<eos> I can't imagine where he's gone.<eos> We've looked everywhere.<eos> He's been running a fever.<eos> I returned him to the clinic after the funeral, but then he disappeared.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> With everything else you have on your shoulders, you didn't need this.<eos> I know I'm taking you away from all your responsibilities.<eos> Paul is one of them.
You've really found a way to stop them?<eos> I hope so.<eos> If we do it here, we can do it anywhere.<eos> This is a dress rehearsal, to set procedure for any future African challenges.<eos> This is Houston computerized, and this is Houston.<eos> You see, the bees have formed almost a complete circle.<eos> Billions of them.<eos> That's what we've been waiting for.<eos> Waiting for what?<eos> The battle plan is to get them all into one area and then zap them!
I wish he'd give us a clue.<eos> Right there, that's lovely.<eos> This is better than eight hours of sleep.<eos> How would you know?<eos> You haven't had that in weeks.<eos> What is it?<eos> The bees.<eos> Why are they making that sound?<eos> That's the hunger tone.<eos> It causes them to mass together as if by community they can destroy their enemy.
Chicken George you is a foolish old man.<eos> There ain't nothing hard about being happy.<eos> This ain't never been our home.<eos> Never belong to us no way!<eos> This here is Massa Harvey's nigger quarters.<eos> When we ride out of here, I ain't never gonna think of it again!<eos> Go on there, mule!<eos> Let's move on.<eos> Mr. Brent! Thank the senator for these new mules.<eos> We never could've made it without them!
Have you noticed it about horses, the way they'll stand... one hoof on its end, like those girls in the ballet?<eos> Now... he's gone off to rest... leaving me alone... with Equus.<eos> I can hear the creature's voice.<eos> He's calling me out of the black cave of the psyche.<eos> I shove in my dim little torch, and there he stands... waiting for me.<eos> He raises his matted head. He opens his great square teeth, and he says:<eos> "Why?<eos> Why me?<eos> Why, ultimately, me?" "Do you imagine you can account for me..." "totally, infallibly, inevitably account for me?"<eos> Of course, I've stared at such images before... or been stared at by them, whichever way you look at it.
Like certain animals... women hibernate."<eos> They disappear for fou months. No one sees them.<eos> Then with the first ray of March sunlight, as if on cue... as if given the order to mobilize... they amass in the streets, in light dresses and high heels.<eos> And life begins again.<eos> At last you can rediscover their bodies...<eos> "and see two categories:<eos> the fillies... and the kittens."<eos> There'sa filly... a kitten.<eos> A beautiful leg is very pretty... but I am not against heavy ankles.<eos> I'm even attracted to them. There's the promise of greate rharmony at the top of the leg.
Be careful when he wakes up.<eos> He mustn't move. Give the instructions to the night nurse.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Mybook...<eos> I want my book.<eos> No, you can't read.<eos> The doctor says you mustn't move.<eos> I know what I'll do after my book.<eos> I'll leave everything.<eos> I'll go to that island for women only and live among them.
It is her duty.<eos> And a custom, too.<eos> The case is closed.<eos> No more discussion.<eos> And I don't accept Agamemnon's wife wandering around the barracks!<eos> I gave birth to her!<eos> I will marry her!<eos> You have two more younger daughters.<eos> How do you leave them alone?<eos> Guards protect them outside the walls, and inside, worthy hands take good care of them.
-No.<eos> Because I won't have a tomb other than the altar.<eos> I want you to be proud and to show it.<eos> You speak so wisely.<eos> What can I say?<eos> And your sisters?<eos> What should I tell them?<eos> Nothing.<eos> They have their lives.<eos> And let them be well.
-I can't!<eos> -God said it's okay.<eos> -I'll tell you this, it's very important!<eos> Officer, could you move the rest of them along?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> One little moment, please.<eos> What I have to tell him is--<eos> Okay.<eos> I went to empty the garbage, and two people blessed me.<eos> Then one of them blessed the garbage.
I saw Dalchimsky.<eos> I tried to stop him, but he managed to drive away.<eos> We'll get to Halderville before he does.<eos> Okay.<eos> Please, where are your road maps?<eos> - What state, sir?<eos> - This state, of course.<eos> - We're out of Texas.<eos> - Out of Texas?<eos> Lots of folks buy them for souvenirs and put them in their game rooms.
We'll keep these.<eos> Deucedly fine blades. Considering they were made by trolls.<eos> They don't seem like troll blades to me.<eos> Probably stolen.<eos> - See these strange runes?<eos> - Whatever are runes?<eos> Ancient writing. Mine has them too.<eos> Can you make them out?<eos> I'm not familiar with these letters.<eos> Well, whoever made them, we've got them now!
Is t-t-that enough?<eos> If I approved of what you were doing, it would be enough, but since you're offending against Mosaic law...<eos> It's Roman law here, Gershon.<eos> It's Roman law everywhere. That's the trouble.<eos> But one day...<eos> With that son, you've got to be lucky with your daughters.<eos> Like everyone else, I grieve for Germanicus.<eos> But apart from the charge of murder, we must consider the question of treason.<eos> Did Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso incite his troops to mutiny and rebellion?<eos> Did he bribe them to support him?
The Opposition gave up its request.<eos> That's great.<eos> Think about the future because in 10 years, you'll be a potential candidate for the Presidency.<eos> I thank you.<eos> Mister.<eos> Apparently she has given the cassette to her boyfriend.<eos> I see.<eos> Take care of it.<eos> But what to about these 2 women?<eos> Let me get rid of them.
I should mention here that I am very grateful to the French industries of Cuny and to the Swiss of Swachter for all their help, while at the same time I experienced nothing but mistrust from my own scientist colleagues.<eos> I researched instruments that would pick up waves and vibrations never recorded before. I would obtain, with relative ease, the olfactory sensations.<eos> More difficult were the terms and tactiles.<eos> I would perfect the recording of these images and sounds improving the old voice recording and image recording systems. With any person, for example our lovely friend Madeleine we may now smell the jasmine perfume applied to her breast.<eos> Or hold her smooth hair in our hands. But if we open up our receivers completely we may have Madeleine herself in front of us.<eos> Reproduced. Identical.<eos> They are recorded images but no one would mistake her for anything less than a living person.<eos> But the machine doesn't just capture.<eos> It records and projects, as well. Anywhere in free space. During the day, or at night.<eos> To begin with I had intended to capture only certain scenes of our life here and to present them as mementos, like an album of pleasant moments.
So, how's the weather, is it nice out?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's a beautiful day.<eos> You'll come and see me often, right?<eos> Okay, see you later.<eos> Goodbye, young man.<eos> Is somebody there?<eos> My colors.<eos> they are mine.<eos> Let them run in my veins... they are soft, soft.
Beautiful flowers.<eos> Beautiful flowers in my garden.<eos> Only for you, my lord?<eos> Even today the sisters murdering through art.<eos> What does this mean?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Ah, it's you.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> It's them!<eos> It's them, I tell you!
It's just so kind of you to let me do this.<eos> But you've got kindness written all over your face.<eos> Kindness... generosity--<eos> And charm. Boyish charm.<eos> Got a lot of little boy in me.<eos> That's what does it to them.<eos> Well, it's certainly doing' it to me.<eos> Yeah. Got a lot of little boy in me.<eos> Most women just wanna put their arms around me and mother me.<eos> And I bet before they know it, they got a lot of little boy in them.
Is this how you charm the young men of the village?<eos> I don't think so. They want something else.<eos> You can offer that too, can't you?<eos> Put the apples in the cellar.<eos> Can't you do that somewhere else?<eos> Do you enjoy humiliating me in front of her?<eos> I enjoy talking to Mila.<eos> Don't tell me you're content with such trifles.<eos> Do you like her because she won't play a part in your life?<eos> Why do women always fall in love with men who are not meant for them?
- Ask for as high a bail as possible.<eos> You can hold him till I'm ready for the grand jury in L.A.<eos> Okay.<eos> Five deputies for me?<eos> What do you gentlemen do when you get a real baddy?<eos> - That's Jesus Christ.<eos> - What'd you do with his disciples?<eos> They sound alike, say the same thing, nobody tells me anything.<eos> That's telling me something. Manson is exercising domination over these girls.<eos> The way we can get them to talk is to bring them to L.A away from him, and question them separately.
My freedom.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> Now the war is over. Now you've got your freedom.<eos> I found out what it was worth.<eos> That's why I drink.<eos> George, who is Caldwell?<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> Sounds different.<eos> I ain't got but three strings.<eos> I'm waiting for them to bust. And kneel with them.
- Shiraz, come on.<eos> What do you wanna cause her trouble for?<eos> - She never hurt you.<eos> - I don't wanna hurt you, kid!<eos> - Now move!<eos> - What about yesterday... when you didn't want anybody to touch her?<eos> She would've screamed yesterday.<eos> I want her to scream today.<eos> You don't die for women.<eos> You kill for them.
I'm not asking you. I'm asking Mr. Stuffsucker.<eos> What's that?<eos> What is he saying to you?<eos> He says he's got a bit of a cold and he's lost his voice.<eos> Lost his voice.<eos> A beekeeper who has lost his voice, a cook who thinks he's a gardener, and a witness to murder.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> It is obvious to my trained eye that there is much more going on here than meets the ear.<eos> Before you are dismissed, Mr. Stiffsticker, I suggest you count your bees.<eos> You may find that one of them is missing.
I wonder what made those worms act that way.<eos> You don't think Roger's old man is fooling around with electricity?<eos> What electricity?<eos> Good point.<eos> I hope we find him before it gets dark.<eos> You wait in the car.<eos> - Did you see him?<eos> - Get back in the car.<eos> - Give me the keys.<eos> - I left them in the ignition.
That depends.<eos> - I insist. It wasn't incompetence.<eos> You do understand you're fired?<eos> - I do.<eos> But please acknowledge I had a real chance.<eos> I do. I don't think you're incompetent.<eos> - That's enough for me.<eos> We will send you your belongings.<eos> Minister, the government has announced its economy measures.<eos> Would you call them drastic?
This is the fifth year of her menopause.<eos> I'm holding up motherfucking well.<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> Long John, wash this.<eos> You got it, Billy.<eos> You know any virgins, Long John?<eos> A virgin is a little girl, about five years old. - Very ugly.<eos> - They can run faster than their brother.<eos> Did you ever know any virgins?<eos> I thought they kept them for movie stars like you, Billy Batt.
Follow me, please.<eos> Now, I'll hold this. Oh.<eos> It's expensive.<eos> You see the teeth? Uh-huh.<eos> All right.<eos> Now this ape's dentition... is more suited to eating fruits, vegetables- they're vegetarians.<eos> But, you see, man and all its ancestors are meat eaters.<eos> We have this ripping, tearing teeth.<eos> Yeah, well, these creatures have been eating flesh.<eos> One of them broke into a meat truck.
- We can check that out with...<eos> - Albert.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Albert.<eos> - No, no.<eos> Arnold. - Oh.<eos> - Can we go outside now?<eos> - Describe him first.<eos> He was about 5'8", weighed about 150 pounds looked like a refugee.<eos> He had little, weird eyes and he had... He really dug the girls like he was staring straight through them, you know?
And that's when everything turns white-hot and pink and they've got me.<eos> That's when they make me take off my shields.<eos> Where do you think these waves are coming from?<eos> Alpha Centauri.<eos> And what do you do after?<eos> I hate myself for the bad things I've done.<eos> - That's all of it.<eos> - That's nothing.<eos> Doctor why does he tie up his victims with TV antenna wire after he kills them?<eos> Probably to deflect rays from Alpha Centauri away from him into them.
"They," as you call them, are your mother and your sister.<eos> And they're worried about you .<eos> They are two stupid women whom I despise.<eos> Yes, Reverend.<eos> I'm going to have as much fun at their expense as I possibly can.<eos> I'm an evil girl, and I'm going to prove it.<eos> You certainly are not the girl I knew.<eos> But you won't be able to impress me.<eos> These flowers seem to tremble when I touch them.<eos> Sometimes I think the spirit of poor John took refuge in them.
When did she burn you out?<eos> We were at court when the wagon driver came and told us... that our hut was on fire.<eos> You want to work in the factory?<eos> Come next Tuesday, I have no time today.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Listen to what she wrote.<eos> The roses are lovely, not from Lodz I think.<eos> Maybe you brought them from Nice?<eos> As you once did.<eos> I tend to them carefully, saying to each petal... as I caress it with my lips, "I love you."
Salvatore, you are always in my way.<eos> You have to pay attention.<eos> Here, take care of my bag.<eos> Okay.<eos> Senior Massimo, wait.<eos> I have to tell you something.<eos> There...<eos> These girls...<eos> - What about them?<eos> One of them is very special.
I left as soon as I got word.<eos> Anything new?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You really did it this time.<eos> That's what you get for never listening.<eos> I'm missing two of my best agents, who happen to be two of my friends.<eos> Talk to me about that.<eos> Cooperate with the local authorities on this.<eos> Bring them into the picture.<eos> Work with them.
I'll just wander around.<eos> Thank you very, very much, sir.<eos> Lieutenant Columbo.<eos> Please, do not feel that you're imposing.<eos> I am a busy man, it's true, but as First Secretary of the Legation, I feel I have a certain responsibility.<eos> Well, actually, sir, it was the glasses.<eos> The glasses? Yes, sir, Mr. Habib's eyeglasses.<eos> He was wearing these when the police found him.<eos> Well, that's hardly a revelation, Lieutenant.<eos> Habib was virtually helpless without them.
Why don't you take a long, close look at this sign?<eos> Those proportions are correct.<eos> You'd love to prove that, wouldn't you?<eos> Get your name into the National Geographic.<eos> Larry, if we make an effort today, we might be able to save August.<eos> August?<eos> For Christ's sake, tomorrow's the Fourth of July!<eos> We will be open for business.<eos> It'll be one of the best summers we've ever had.<eos> If you are concerned about the beaches, do whatever you have to, to make them safe.
"Have you ever seen the like?<eos> I've showed it to your sister, to all the girls your age.<eos> Give it a hand.<eos> Help it shoot the semen from which we're all created.<eos> I'll make it spurt on your face.<eos> This is my passion, child. I've no others. You're about to see it."<eos> At that moment, I was covered by white stuff that soaked me head to toe.<eos> One moment, Signora Vaccari.<eos> You mustn't omit any details.<eos> It's solely how we draw from your stories the types of stimulation that serve us. It's what we expect from them.
It's Franchino.<eos> Shoot!<eos> Fool, how could you believe I'd kill you?<eos> Don't you know we'd want to kill you a thousand times to the limits of eternity, if eternity has any.<eos> I'd like to tell the story of a mysterious client whose passions are like those that will be the object of Sra. Castelli's stories. And for this I apologize.<eos> The man in question wanted only women who had been sentenced to death.<eos> The closer they were to death, the more he paid them.<eos> He insisted visits take place only once sentence had been passed.<eos> Thanks to a lofty social position, that enabled him to pay any price, he managed never to miss one.<eos> He did not possess them casually.

Hey, how long are you going to stay there in that stupid pose?<eos> Hey!<eos> I don't know who you are.<eos> You're just jealous and ridiculous.<eos> Why would anyone be jealous of you?<eos> I'm talking about him.<eos> What?<eos> Hey.<eos> Ninja skills mean nothing here.<eos> I'll make them mean something.
- Some wine.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Do you know where I could find a job around here?<eos> A job?<eos> No. I don't think so.<eos> Six francs.<eos> Why didn't you tell him to go to the house on the hill?<eos> The sisters need somebody to help them.<eos> I sort of liked this one.<eos> If they need a man, let them find one themselves.
Yes, don't worry.<eos> I'll be there in a few days.<eos> Tell him to be patient.<eos> Yes, he'll have it.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> I'll talk to you soon.<eos> My sisters are very miserable.<eos> No man would look at them.<eos> One's paralyzed, and the other has that disgusting hand.<eos> Well, I like them both.

Here's to your ship.<eos> I'm sorry for your troubles, but I do have a few of my own.<eos> To the insanity of governments... and the insanity of people who oppose them.<eos> And the poor simple sods who have to pick up the pieces.<eos> He's clever, your Juggernaut.<eos> Try "obsessed."<eos> You're all obsessed.<eos> Might even save your life, Captain... my obsession.<eos> There are seven bombs.<eos> How do you know he built them all the same?
Oh. yes!<eos> Yesterday, no... yes, 2 days ago.<eos> So, can I go, inspector?<eos> Why?<eos> You're with friends, aren't you?<eos> I'll give you some advice: sleep at home at night for a while.<eos> - I may have to come and wake you.<eos> - Alright, inspector.<eos> Now I'll chop your balls off.<eos> No you won't, the inspector counts them every night. I'd have to explain where I left them.
Soon. Milan will be in the hands of the partisans...<eos> - I ask you to help me!<eos> - I'll call the Swiss authorities.<eos> Transmit it immediately.<eos> I just had a telephone call from the prefect at Como.<eos> Mussolini wants to hand himself over to us.<eos> He's waiting for an answer.<eos> Tell him this... he can cross the border by tomorrow at 1 PM... but alone.<eos> He's asked for authorization for two other people.<eos> I gather one of them would be the Petacci woman.
Here you go.<eos> Four times in one night.<eos> She was insatiable.<eos> Worse than that tall woman you brought me yesterday.<eos> Take her home.<eos> Give her a thousand.<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> Please... continue.<eos> Another way for beautiful prostitutes to earn money is posing for sex comics, making hardcore photos, and in pornographic films.<eos> In order to know about them, I tried them all.
For little girls<eos> For little girls get bigger every day<eos> Thank heaven for little girls<eos> They grow up in the most delightful way<eos> Those little eyes So helpless and appealing<eos> One day will flash and send you crashin' Through the ceiling<eos> Thank heaven for little girls<eos> Thank heaven for them all<eos> No matter where, no matter who<eos> Without them, what would little boys do?
- Going gray... 40 years, old chap.<eos> The prime of life.<eos> You know, I've never felt younger.<eos> Now, I feel capable of anything.<eos> You haven't changed a bit, João.<eos> I could never imagine you like this.<eos> With a family, wealthy, living well... married to a beautiful woman.<eos> You could always have your pick.<eos> Handsome, sophisticated... The only one in class who had a manicure.<eos> Always popular with girls... whereas I ran madly after them... while you pretended not to care.
"Yes," he said carelessly and reddened.<eos> "She looks dull," his father said.<eos> "She behaves badly to her husband. "<eos> People talk so much.<eos> What a ridiculous dream it has been all these years.<eos> Agreat painter...<eos> It's better than being a doctor.<eos> But, compared to a king, it's nothing. And a king is no more than a tiny microbe.<eos> Munch now begins to add layer upon layer of texture with brush, palette knife and even kitchen blade,<eos> I've started work on a few canvases and there is one of them I think
If I'm sold to Kuruwa, I'II bite my tongue off and die.<eos> Come on.<eos> You've got nice soft skin.<eos> Get lost, you pervert!<eos> - You bastard!<eos> Here you go. This is for you. Take it.<eos> Stand up!<eos> Don't trouble me any further.<eos> Woman of noble families and Samurai require us to work more.<eos> In order to shape that kind of woman into desirable dolls... We perform on them what's called Daruma Dakase...

So that, unlike them, he is not a figure in the landscape, he is the shaper of the landscape.<eos> This is the Pacific Ocean.<eos> The California Indians used to say that at full moon the fish came and danced on these beaches.<eos> And it's true that there is a local variety of fish, the grunion, that comes up out of the water and lays its eggs above the high tidemark.<eos> The females bury themselves tail-first in the sand, and the males gyrate or dance round them and fertilise the eggs as they're being laid.
Are you laughing again?<eos> Well, in plain fact, her chances are slim.<eos> There's a rhythm to the contractions and I have to ease the little hooves out each time between.<eos> And if she kicks or flings herself even for a moment the hooves are gonna cut and tear. And, well, she'll be lost.<eos> Then she must not move.<eos> Well, how do ye prevent it?<eos> With laying on of the hands?<eos> It can be called that.<eos> The hands, grasshopper, are the eyes and tongue of touch.<eos> Through them, a man may reach out and see another's feelings or speak his own.
Crush him.<eos> If that's what you really want, I can get you into Don Vito's fortress.<eos> But getting out's going to be your problem.<eos> Are you game?<eos> Have you thought about what we were talking last night?<eos> You haven't answered me.<eos> That's an answer.<eos> It means not yet.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I like to be surrounded by beautiful things, and you're one of them.
Try this tegolato wine.<eos> I made it by myself, with my own hands.<eos> This dates back to 1964.<eos> Try it, c'mon.<eos> Well?<eos> - It's like velvet.<eos> And what an aftertaste.<eos> Why do you call it "tegolato"?<eos> We use to leave the bottles under the tiles of roof for a year so that they freeze in winter and burn themselves in summer.<eos> Of course many of them got broken.

Hey. Hey, I'm afraid to look.<eos> is it--is it, uh... hey. is it...<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Your goods are intact.<eos> Almost had his leg shot off!<eos> 8 more inches, he's shot in the balls.<eos> A little higher, he's shot in the heart-- he's dead.<eos> I can't wait till we do it... and get the hell out of all this.<eos> What about the wives?<eos> What about them?
Yes, of course.<eos> I hadn't thought.<eos> There must be more.<eos> No, no, there's nothing more.<eos> My wife got something from these two women... something that doctors couldn't give her, that I couldn't give her... something that she needed, so she went with them.<eos> Where...<eos> Where, I don't know.<eos> I was outside... inside... the pensione last night, where they lived.<eos> And today before I came here, I went to look for it... and it's... it's vanished.<eos> So now she's with them?
So do I, I've been useless all day.<eos> It's silly, I know, but I haven't seen you for over six months.<eos> - How come you suddenly...?<eos> - Paula is in London.<eos> - Like a drink?<eos> A whiskey, neat.<eos> It settles the stomach.<eos> Have you taken to whiskey?<eos> Aunt Berit's looking after the girls, to everyone's mutual delight. Tomorrow, they're going to the country.<eos> Good... Meeting them might have been awkward.
I really must compliment you on your collection. It's just splendid.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's a good one.<eos> Justin has donated the collection to the university museum.<eos> I'm very happy.<eos> Well, the party's sort of an official good-bye.<eos> I see.<eos> Tell me, have you any more pieces from the Segu River region?<eos> Yeah, there are, as a matter of fact.<eos> Would you like to take a look at some of them?
- But then she goes...<eos> - She is a human woman with strong emotion and sensitivities.<eos> She embarrasses you with those traits, and you are afraid when you see them in yourself.<eos> How did you know?<eos> There is some human blood in my family line.<eos> It is not fatal.<eos> What you do not yet understand, Spock, is that Vulcans do not lack emotion.<eos> It is only that ours is controlled.<eos> Logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience in full.<eos> We have emotions but we deal with them and do not let them control us.
We've no time to have a drink In this godforsaken hole<eos> In twenty years we'll be buggered We've had all we can bloody take<eos> They will all be terrified!<eos> There'll be no one to piss us off We'll be able to have a laugh<eos> Free at last...<eos> Come in and you shall see The monkey is no longer free<eos> You have to go see the farmers... We told you!<eos> We've done collections.<eos> What more do you want? - Money.<eos> - What about your posters? I thought you were going to stick them up.
- What about your posters? I thought you were going to stick them up.<eos> - I spent all night doing it!<eos> - What do you mean? Why didn't you tell us?<eos> We got bollocked.<eos> You didn't even tell us you'd stuck them up.<eos> Just go look!<eos> - Come on. Don't shout... Don't get worked up.<eos> Go to the factories by the school.<eos> The guys from my factory haven't seen them.<eos> Where did you put them?
Indeed, but there is a certain way.<eos> Wich way?<eos> By making the miners who worked there take us to it.<eos> That is impossible, ashes cannot walk.<eos> Be aware that I control powers that are unknown today.<eos> And I can revive those mummies, submiting them to my will.<eos> That would be wonderful!<eos> Wonderful would be the union of your skills, and my powers!<eos> We are getting too excited about this, when we don't even know where those mummies are.<eos> I do know, and you ,and the whole world knows them or has heard about them.
yes, as great as that of the mummies.<eos> Look, lets go by steps, all of this just seems absurd.<eos> You lot are officially in charge of the case, so the only thing for me to do is to wish you luck.<eos> Good bye.<eos> If you need help, you can call on me.<eos> Lets go, we must follow the clues.<eos> We can save time if we follow the street where Efrain saw them.<eos> I hid in there, the mummies went by here.<eos> Yes, here they are.<eos> There is no doubt, these are them, My compadre was telling the truth.
Is there no remedy?<eos> Yes.<eos> Follow my advice and I promise:<eos> I shall save her, you and myself!<eos> There's no time for weeping! Bring me a large tub.<eos> We need one for each of us.<eos> See they're big enough to fit us. And bring food for a day.<eos> The rain will stop and retire the next morning.<eos> Send away your servants, Robin and Jill!<eos> When you've found the tubs, hang them high up, on the ceiling.
Murmansk Railroad's along here.<eos> And the White Sea Canal.<eos> And arrows and circles all around.<eos> I wonder why.<eos> All the routes are marked, too.<eos> They know everything.<eos> Not everything. They know the route around the lake.<eos> And the marshes are indicated as though they can't be crossed.<eos> The girls have borrowed Pauline's phonograph. They're having a party.<eos> So watch out. All the steam could make them thirsty.
You must be a bachelor.<eos> Lieutenant! We've got some very clear footprints here, going and coming.<eos> Good.<eos> We'll have some moulage casts made.<eos> I think we better go.<eos> Lieutenant, uh... I believe I'd rather take some three-dimension photographs, if you don't mind.<eos> We've pretty much stopped using moulage casts, you know.<eos> We have?<eos> Oh, with footprints, yes, indeed.<eos> You see, we found that when the plaster swells, it makes them appear a half to a full size larger than they really are.
- That big cities frighten you.<eos> - But, Armando, where would I go?<eos> You wait right here!<eos> If this works, I'll be back by nightfall.<eos> - But what if they don't let you go?<eos> - Oh, they will. They will.<eos> But just in case, if I am not back by then...<eos> Now, these steps go down to a tunnel that leads to the harbor.<eos> Cargoes of apes are frequently unloaded at night.<eos> - You must try to infiltrate one of them.
Who is St. John Lord Merridew?<eos> Why, even Marguerite when I first met her knew and adored him.<eos> He's my detective, known to millions throughout the civilized world... with a nose for smelling out evil superior to anything in the Force.<eos> Oh, yes. The Police are always stupid in the kind of books you write, aren't they?<eos> They never solve anything.<eos> It's always the amateur sleuth who knows what's going on.<eos> But that's detective fiction.<eos> This is fact. This is real.<eos> I'm well aware of the difference, my dear Milo, but I'm also aware of my own not inconsiderable capabilities.<eos> Of course, if you doubt them or don't trust me--
They're going to stay with us.<eos> You know, they're family.<eos> The only family I got, and we're going to take real good care of them.<eos> Of course, Ben.<eos> I want you girls to get acquainted, you know, get to know each other.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Diana, I want you to make sure these girls get everything they need.<eos> - We got to make up for lost time.<eos> - Oh, thank you, Ben.<eos> Why don't you show them their rooms or something. Get them squared away.
A lot of people visited to congratulate him<eos> Setsuko, in his last will my father wrote:<eos> "When you will have grown up, Japan will crumble under a communist regime. "<eos> You, my son, you will gather your companions around you and start fighting them<eos> He wrote these lines, on January 1st, 1946. The emperor had just been obliged to declare in front of the Japanese people, that he was nothing but an ordinary human being<eos> My father thought that this would be ...the end of Japan, and decided to commit suicide Today it is difficult for me to feel that way<eos> Setsuko, the truth is, by starting university I wanted to stop playing baseball... wand become politically active<eos> But, I don't want to imagine, that you are the reason for this decision<eos> And you, Setsuko, you cried along time at the coffin of my mother<eos> But your tears, for whom did you shed them?
You sound pretty sure.<eos> You're a kind of man... why shouldn't I be sure?<eos> What kind of man am I?<eos> A real man.<eos> A kind man.<eos> I'm not kind.<eos> I don't mean weak kind, the way so many men are.<eos> I mean the kindness that comes from an enormous strength, from an inner power so strong that every act, no matter what, is more proof of that power.<eos> That's what all women resent. That's why they try to cut you down.<eos> Because your knowledge of yourself and them is so right, so true that it exposes the lies which they, every scheming one of them, live by.
- I'm not telling anybody.<eos> - Hey. - It's our party, it's our bike race.<eos> - Hey, you people can't come in here.<eos> - We don't need no invite.<eos> It's all right, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> It's nothing. Don't worry.<eos> I told you, go home.<eos> You're not supposed to be here.<eos> Two bimbos?<eos> You can't come in here with them two.
Did he have any ancillary conditions?<eos> Didn't anybody bother to go check on him during the night?<eos> Even under the impression that he was merely a patient?<eos> Was he hyperosmolar?<eos> Did he have a bad heart?<eos> He must have had some sort of thrombosis.<eos> I want the post done here, Mr. Hitchcock.<eos> You and I better have a chat about your excessive use of float nurses.<eos> I've got nearly a thousand nurses in this hospital...<eos> Every time one of them has her period, she disappears for three days.
Come on!<eos> Squad, attention!<eos> Who was it?<eos> I want to know who it was.<eos> No one?<eos> I'll tear you apart from your assholes to your collar studs.<eos> The whole unit will report to me tonight.<eos> Carry on!<eos> Of blonde women a man must beware.<eos> There's a certain something about them.
Leave me alone.<eos> - I'm sorry, I thought...<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> I've got your friend's new dress but I can't find her house.<eos> - To the canal, then left.<eos> - I was afraid she lived here. - I thought...<eos> - My friend?<eos> No, she's a proper lady.<eos> Don't those women ever bother you?<eos> Never. You just have to treat them properly.
But there comes a time when courage must outweigh fear, when our belief in the Lord must be not a pious belief, but a reality in the face of death and damnation!<eos> If Count Karnstein is a vampire... then no ruler on Earth will save him!<eos> No!<eos> Burning is useless!<eos> Fire will not vanquish vampires!<eos> You must stake them through the heart or cut off their heads!<eos> Sharpen the end of your wooden stakes. Use lances, axes!<eos> Is it true?<eos> A stake through the heart or decapitation returns a victim's innocence, sends their soul to God?<eos> If one spark of God's spirit remains in them... Yes.
We met a year ago but we barely know each other.<eos> You're angry for nothing, take a step back.<eos> Til tomorrow.<eos> Hello Sir!<eos> Sorry to bother you.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I'm Francine and this is Nicole.<eos> We want to pose for some photos.<eos> We have amateur photos, do you want to see them?<eos> Wait, I'll get them.
I'm Francine and this is Nicole.<eos> We want to pose for some photos.<eos> We have amateur photos, do you want to see them?<eos> Wait, I'll get them.<eos> There you go.<eos> Look!<eos> We even posed naked for an amateur competition.<eos> - Jean-Pierre can you come here?<eos> - Yes<eos> - Take care of them, I'm busy.
Presently I heard a slight groan... and I knew it was the groan of long, drawn out mortal terror.<eos> It was not a groan of pain or of grief. Oh, no.<eos> No, it was the low, stifled sound that arises... from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe.<eos> I knew the sound well.<eos> Many a night just at midnight, when all the world slept... it had welled up from my own bosom... deepening with its dreadful echo... the terrors that that distracted me.<eos> I say I knew it well.<eos> I I knew what the old man felt... and I pitied him, although I chuckled at heart.<eos> I I knew that he had been lying awake... ever since the first slight noise... when he had turned in the bed.<eos> His fears had been ever since growing upon him.<eos> He had been trying to fancy them causeless... but could not.
I can't bear these damned dead plants.<eos> If one had lots ofschnapps in one's body; then perhaps one could bear it.<eos> For the fourth day now I scrawl this paper full of red summer.<eos> Wild and voracious, and wrestle with the schnapps bottle.<eos> Defeats took place here.<eos> But the bodies are sta_ing to turn and flee back to the Egyptian darkness.<eos> I nail them to the walls, but I mustn't drink schnapps.<eos> White schnapps is my rod and my stam.<eos> But now my hands are shaking.<eos> As if the bodies were still inside them.
- Because of the runaways.<eos> When one leaves all the others will be punished.<eos> You know the song.<eos> And Timmi will be happy that she has something to forbid us from doing.<eos> Yes well, we'll wait and see.<eos> - Yes I'm coming.<eos> SHIT SCHOOL<eos> - Let's go sneak cigarettes into the hole!<eos> I've got this feeling something will happen today It's like I can sense it.<eos> Please tell the girls that they are all expected to return from this excursion As a matter of course, tell them I expect this of them and will guarantee it personally.
Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Walk.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Go, go on.<eos> Yeah just keep walking.<eos> Put one foot in front of the other.<eos> Ants are useful creatures, you know?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Like you just take right now, for example... if you want to get that shirt off lice, them things will be overjoyed to do the job.
We think about it differently.<eos> And who that "we" might be?<eos> We've paved the way for you.<eos> That's why we want to upset the apple cart!<eos> What?<eos> Can't you see that you're kicking up a lot of dust?<eos> What do you do for a living?<eos> - Pizza maker.<eos> - Pizzas are good.<eos> I spit on them.
-Don't catch cold.<eos> -I'll try not to.<eos> Feels good!<eos> This is one of nature's simple enjoyments.<eos> I needed that, you know.<eos> After you, my dear Alphonse.<eos> All right.<eos> Now, you see those buildings, Joe?<eos> Those beautiful monuments concrete, glass.<eos> I work in one of them.
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile.<eos> If not, why then, this parting was well made.<eos> For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!<eos> If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed.<eos> If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.<eos> Why, then, lead on.<eos> O, that a man might know the end of this day's business ere it come!<eos> But it sufficeth that the day will end, and then the end is known.<eos> Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills unto the legions on the other side.<eos> Let them set on at once.

The power of this elixir has been proven...<eos> Walk!<eos> Walk!<eos> During my years with Meriweather, he lost an eye as a result of a fifth ace dropping out his sleeve in a poker game.<eos> It didn't faze him, though. Deception was his life's blood, even if it caused him to get whittled down kind of gradual like.<eos> You're improving. You just can't seem to get rid of that streak of honesty.<eos> The one that ruined you was that Indian, Old Tepee.<eos> - You mean Old Lodge Skins?<eos> - He gave you a vision of moral order in the universe, and there isn't any.<eos> Those stars twinkle in a void, dear boy, and the two-legged creature schemes and dreams beneath them, all in vain.
Grandfather?<eos> Am I still in this world?<eos> Yes, Grandfather.<eos> I was afraid of that.<eos> Well sometimes the magic works, sometimes it doesn't.<eos> Let's go back to the tepee and eat, my son.<eos> My newest Snake wife cooks dog very well.<eos> All right, Grandfather.<eos> She also has a very soft skin.<eos> The only trouble with Snake women is they copulate with horses, which makes them strange to me.
Yes, did the young couple come out yet?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> -But they were here?<eos> -I think so.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Would you please read this?<eos> It tells you about Christ.<eos> MAN: I want to talk to you today about the Lord Jesus Christ.<eos> There are two things you can be certain of in this life.<eos> -One of them is the fact that the sun...
Give me the key!<eos> Give me my cap.<eos> Give me the keys.<eos> -I'm awfully sorry.<eos> -Well, give me the cap, come on.<eos> I'm awfully sorry, I don't know where they are.<eos> Have you got a spare set?<eos> But I gave them to you.<eos> I said I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know what I've done with them, that's all.
What, she's very fragile? She's fragile, right?<eos> She's worried about her hands.<eos> She doesn't want to hurt her hands.<eos> She could wear boxing gloves.<eos> They're very beautiful, her hands.<eos> - She oils them.<eos> - She oils them?<eos> Like the tin woodsman?<eos> Exactly.<eos> To keep them supple.
Well done.<eos> - Here, no.<eos> - They're not heavy.<eos> I can't believe you're here.<eos> Well, I am.<eos> Well, now.<eos> Beethoven.<eos> I...<eos> I don't think you care much for my flowers, do you?<eos> I like them better growing, surely.
And I want you to eat them as rare as possible.<eos> That goes for the next few days.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - What?<eos> I said yes.<eos> You been getting enough sleep? - Yes.<eos> - You don't look it. Better get some more.<eos> You know, we came close to giving you a transfusion.<eos> There doesn't seem to be any internal hemorrhaging, so, it must be those puncture marks on your throat.<eos> I wish you could remember where you got them.
With this career of yours, I don't think you can count on your father.<eos> That's exactly what I want!<eos> Did you only come here to preach?<eos> Often the demands of my profession force me to act like a sanctimonious father.<eos> The truth is that I please.<eos> And it bothers you.<eos> True, but I'm not here for that!<eos> Swear to me, by the Minister of the Interior...<eos> At the convent of San Zuliano, young girls take language classes ...<eos> One of them disclosed the strange habits of Sister Clementine.
At such an early hour, there was only one visitor.<eos> He didn 't take any notice of the photographs.<eos> He was crouched at the foot of the featured statue.<eos> It was a nude study of me.<eos> It was sculpted by one of Mr. Yamana 's friends.<eos> His whole demeanor was very strange.<eos> What happened next was unexpected.<eos> It felt as if the statue and my body were somehow one.<eos> I felt his hands as he pawed the statue.<eos> It felt as if he was running them over my body.
One of Mercury's sides faces the sun.<eos> And this side is a sea of burning dust.<eos> The other side faces the nothingness of eternal space.<eos> This side is a forest of giant crystals, white and blue.<eos> Cold enough to make you sick.<eos> Tension between the hemispheres hot endless day hemisphere of endless night that makes Mercury sing.<eos> It sings... it's a slow chant.<eos> Mercury can only maintain one note during one earth millenium.<eos> There are creatures, in the deep caves of Mercury.<eos> The chant that their planet sings is important to them, they feed off these vibrations.
Gorgeous blondes only.<eos> Have a look.<eos> Of course, only Party members are allowed.<eos> Germans like you and me.<eos> "Mother tongue"<eos> All blondes...<eos> I'll have to get used to it.<eos> Now it's really Christmas.<eos> Candles at home, for once.<eos> I usually see them on the catafalque and on graves.
Flowers? It's basil for the spaghetti.<eos> I don't eat pasta, you know.<eos> I do!<eos> What do you want for dinner?<eos> Don't worry, it's my treat.<eos> Tonight is a celebration.<eos> First of all, no cooking.<eos> Second, we'll get drunk.<eos> Third, we don't need to wash plates.<eos> Unbreakable, indestructible... and once you've used them, you just throw them away!
No. You see I'm still here.<eos> What bothers me about you is that you dodge the issue.<eos> You refuse to assume responsibility.<eos> You're both a shamefaced Christian and a shamefaced Don Juan.<eos> That's a bit much.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> I was in love. That's very different.<eos> I've loved two or three women in my life.<eos> Okay, maybe four.<eos> I lived with each of them for several years.
Nothing is born.<eos> No seed even begins to sprout.<eos> - They'll find an antidote.<eos> - Of course! If I give them enough time.<eos> They'll have time.<eos> Once they're warned, you'll have problems dispensing the stuff.<eos> That problem has already been solved.<eos> I have been training my own special "angels of death".<eos> - Those girls?<eos> - Those girls. And many others like them.
Wait!<eos> You can't buy a woman for money.<eos> Try and get one without it.<eos> All right, what about it, Mormons?<eos> Jacob, we need every penny, and I can't bear another day of those martyred looks.<eos> There it is again.<eos> This ain't a martyred look, Sarah.<eos> This look is pure... hatred.<eos> Quiet!<eos> Brigham Young has 27 wives, and he hasn't had half the trouble with them I've had had with you two.
Avoiding leatherheads-- and then taking the A231s, entering Rottingdeans from the north.<eos> From Rottingdeans, we go through Africa to Nairobis.<eos> We take the south road out of Nairobis- for about 12 miles and then ask.<eos> Does anyone speak Swahili, sir?<eos> Oh, yes, I think most of them do down there.<eos> Does anyone in our party speak Swahili, sir?<eos> Well, matron's (husmor) got a smattering.<eos> Apart from the two matrons...<eos> Good God, I forgot about her.<eos> Apart from them, who else is coming- on the expedition, sir?
Whether it's a doctor or not remains to be seen.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> You are advertising vacant accommodation?<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> Please come in.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - It's a cold evening, isn't it?<eos> - Yes, it is indeed.<eos> I'll show you the rooms that are available. That won't be necessary.<eos> I'm sure any of them will suit me perfectly.
Oh, Darrin, I simply have to answer that phone.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.<eos> Is this what?<eos> The Institute for Domestic Harmony?<eos> Boy, have you got a wrong number.<eos> Sam, millions of wives all over the country manage to cope with pancakes in the normal way.<eos> Why can't you?<eos> I told you.<eos> I didn't want them to burn.
It was?<eos> But, Larry...<eos> That's good news, Larry.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> That was Larry.<eos> He said Barton found my layouts on his desk this morning.<eos> Now, Darrin...<eos> You put them there, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did he like them?
The police!<eos> - Don't you avoid them?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I should tell them what I saw yesterday.<eos> - Why shouldn't you do that?<eos> You can tell them you were on the scene.<eos> - What precisely are you doing here?<eos> I'm a hunter as you know.<eos> Sometimes I fall into the strangest adventures.<eos> But I don't like them to get too exciting, you understand?
I felt really happy one evening.<eos> I'd taken a girl out from the office for a meal. And we were walking back to her place.<eos> I was really looking forward to it.<eos> Well, on the way, we passed a pet shop.<eos> It was an empty street, just the light from the window of this pet shop.<eos> And there, in the window, was a big tank full of little turtles.<eos> Little pet turtles.<eos> And most of them had painted backs.<eos> Someone had come along and painted different colours and little flowers or short messages on their backs.<eos> And then I noticed one of them had a mother-of-pearl back. The turtle was inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and the girl grabbed my arm in excitement and said, "Look!
Who are you?<eos> I'm Jose Luis Gomez de LA terre de cordoba deleon at your service.<eos> And this is guillermo... My second-in-command.<eos> Command of what?<eos> Command of all this.<eos> As far as your eyes can see.<eos> A grant of the Spanish crown to my grandfather in perpetuity.<eos> 2 months ago my wife and 2 daughters were brought here by the apaches.<eos> It is true. Sometimes the apaches bring here white captives, yes.<eos> There's a picture of them in my shirt pocket.
- So what?<eos> I'll cut your beard anyhow...<eos> - No.<eos> - That's enough of this talk!<eos> - Please, I'm sick...<eos> Give a pacifier to this old cry-baby!<eos> Come on, will you give us whatwe want or not?<eos> Hey, guys, I found a better entertainment for us!<eos> The girls are here.<eos> Not my daughters, not them!
You know, I think up music nobody's ever written.<eos> I wish you had something like music. Hey, may-<eos> - Maybe I could make you sort of hear music.<eos> Describe it to you.<eos> Would you like me to try?<eos> Okay.<eos> The beginning.<eos> This part that's on now.<eos> Now, it's slow and kind of solemn.<eos> Like old ladies when you see them walk in to church.
Mr. President, in addition to Bright Eyes, I believe the prosecutor has reassembled all the surviving humans that were captured in the hunt.<eos> That's true, Dr. Zaius.<eos> Very well.<eos> Then I suggest that we... go take a look at 'em.<eos> That's him!<eos> That's Landon!<eos> - Which one?<eos> - The tall one in the back.<eos> Do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?<eos> - With one of them, yes.
Clear?<eos> You are a gentleman!<eos> The storm is coming and you sent them to look for the geese...<eos> Dragan...<eos> I think I got tired.<eos> There are many trains running around here!<eos> Where could they be, Comrade?<eos> - Who?<eos> - The geese.<eos> I can't see them.
My God!<eos> What's going on here?<eos> If they shout at us, I won't dance.<eos> - What's the matter with you?<eos> - How can we dance like this?<eos> These are good people, so calm down!<eos> Out with them! Out with them!<eos> Have them respect us and dance better.<eos> Don't screw this up, 'cause now the girls will dance better.<eos> - Have them move right here!
What?<eos> I am convinced, convinced that each of you... will worthily meet all tests, that may befall our path.<eos> As an astronaut. As an citizen of Earth.<eos> I was able to deflect the spaceship, and we will not crash into the iron star.<eos> But it will be impossible for us to escape from its gravitational pull.<eos> An encounter with "Al'Graab" did not take place, and entire anameson was spent to the braking.<eos> We are now captive to this star.<eos> I do not ask your for advice, I already made a decision.<eos> This star has two planets.<eos> We will orbit one of them, gather signal flare, send it to the Earth and await rescue.
For goodness sake!<eos> Well, what's the big stick for Jamie?<eos> Nothing's happened yet.<eos> Have you no sense?<eos> Have you forgot what we saw on that time scanner?<eos> Don't, it was horrible.<eos> Aye, well, I'll not being left without nothing to defend ourselves with.<eos> I'm afraid you're wasting your time, Jamie.<eos> Why?<eos> Unless I'm very much mistaken, these creatures are so big they're going to see us long before we see them.
He's so tired when he comes home, he takes the train because he can't drive.<eos> He's away from all the quarrelling.<eos> He's always here reading and writing.<eos> Isn't that true, Paolo?<eos> Yes, she's trying to say I'm abstracted.<eos> That's right... distracted.<eos> You have at least heard about the anonymous letters he received?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did you see one?<eos> Did you read any of them?
- Same place. We'll be in Benson tomorrow, if the road is all right and nothing happens.<eos> GRIMES: [Chuckles] What could happen?<eos> Stop right there... or I'll know all there is to know about you.<eos> You could have cleared your throat.<eos> I couldn't. My heart was in it.<eos> It's hot. These are heavy.<eos> So, you've seen my legs.<eos> Well, there are worse walking around.<eos> Some worse, some better.<eos> You won't have much to do with them, so don't worry.
- Go and dance with him, lady. - Only one round then.<eos> Girls.<eos> Attention!<eos> I'll show you a beauty queen, you dirty geezers!<eos> Get out of here.<eos> At ease!<eos> Girls, I would like to point out that the one that is elected beauty queen will be given the honorary task of presenting this gift to our former chairman, who will be eighty-six years old.<eos> Eighty-six.<eos> Continue.<eos> Well, I'll... I'll show them how they should walk, yes?
Oh, come in, come in. Do not be afraid.<eos> Sit down, please.<eos> Some terrible things have happened to friends of mine.<eos> I want to know why they have happened and who is responsible. Can you help me?<eos> Four of your friends...have died.<eos> - You want to know why?<eos> The crystal tells me they have desecrated the tomb of Kah-to-Bey.<eos> - You wish to know more? - Yes.<eos> There are two other people.<eos> You are one of them.
Blimey! Good old Potts.<eos> Get you, Potter.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Who does he think he is, bleeding Fred Astaire?<eos> Come on, Miss Pegg.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I am a lady, I am.<eos> Rotten tarts, all of them.<eos> Bleeding chimney sweep was right about that.<eos> He won´t catch me spending me nicker on them.
First cast the mote out of your eye before you cast the bomb out of mine!<eos> He´s a proper faggot.<eos> Here you are.<eos> You´ll like them.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who´s next?<eos> Come on, girls.<eos> Speak up!<eos> I was wondering if you would give the girls some makeup lessons.<eos> I think quite a few of them would be very pretty if they knew how to do it.
Lewton Cole, a criminal.<eos> Ain't that right, John?<eos> That's him.<eos> -What's this mean, Cole?<eos> -So I'll know where you're at.<eos> -Where's the keys?<eos> -Wait a minute.<eos> If you think you're gonna lock me in my own zoo, you're badly mistaken.<eos> A set of keys is a small thing to die over, don't you think?<eos> -I don't remember where them keys are.
- Right.<eos> The big problem's gonna be the wall he's knocked down to replace for the windows.<eos> Right, the rest of the stuff we can find, pretty much, in the stock here.<eos> Don, see if you can find a table that looks like that.<eos> - Thank you, Karl.<eos> - Cream and sugar?<eos> No cream, just a little sugar, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I cannot wait to develop the pictures I took today.<eos> - I think you will find them exciting.
Colonel, you could order the operation.<eos> No, no, not without her written authority.<eos> He is an American citizen and I cannot take the responsibility.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> It's digitalis. His usual medication.<eos> You'd better leave.<eos> Mrs. Bennett, is there anything else I can do for you?<eos> My husband's things. I would like to pack them.<eos> They're at police headquarters.<eos> You can get them at any time.
We must talk some more, Doctor.<eos> Browder!<eos> - What were you doing?<eos> - I thought it was quite obvious.<eos> You were in an embarrassing position and I didn't want you to lose face.<eos> You said you wanted to talk to him.<eos> A new face, a new approach.<eos> Who knows what may still be in that man's mind.<eos> Your methods are different from mine, Comrade.<eos> Yes, does that make them wrong?
Tell me about the women in your world, captain.<eos> I'd rather talk about you.<eos> You must have wanted to perform since the first time you saw your father act.<eos> - When was that?<eos> - In the beginning.<eos> - Tell me about it.<eos> - That's not fair.<eos> You haven't answered my question about the women.<eos> What would you like to know?<eos> Has the machine changed them, made them just people instead of women?
Good morning! Good morning, dear lady!<eos> Oh, forgive me, I've just been attending to my little charges.<eos> Buzzing around the hive, so to speak.<eos> - Exhausting work.<eos> - But rewarding.<eos> Rewarding.<eos> Bumble. B. Bumble at your service.<eos> Yes, most rewarding.<eos> Treat my bees like children, you know. Happy bees make bumper honey.<eos> Yes, like children. One of them has a bad knee at the moment.
That still smells delicious.<eos> And so there we were in Rome.<eos> Italy, that is.<eos> -Oh.<eos> Italy.<eos> -And I saw this gorgeous fountain.<eos> And I say, "Isn't that a gorgeous fountain, Max?"<eos> She's terribly clever.<eos> She can always spot gorgeous fountains.<eos> Oh, that's marvellous, because most of them are so run-of-the-mill.
Do sit down, Professor.<eos> Ragheeb.<eos> That doesn't sound English.<eos> Are you English, Professor Ragheeb?<eos> - Why do you ask?<eos> - Oh, small talk, merely small talk.<eos> The weather's too dull and politics too explosive.<eos> I certainly didn't mean to pry.<eos> - May I see your glasses?<eos> - I can't see anything without them.
She lives in grand style.<eos> Her protector is a lawyer.<eos> Master Weigelt.<eos> Anna had nice pictures of herself.<eos> Ingrid wanted some too.<eos> Anna got her in touch with her photographer:<eos> Margery.<eos> He has made a series of portraits of my wife.<eos> You know women:<eos> when we take care of them...
We just have some kids.<eos> No.<eos> No kids. Not even kids.<eos> Sometimes, though, it feels as if we had kids.<eos> She isn't beautiful. She's... easy to live with.<eos> No, she isn't.<eos> That's why I don't live with her.<eos> But even with beautiful girls... you look at them, and that's that.<eos> That's why they always end up by...<eos> And I'm stuck with them all day long.
DRACO: Did you find out anything?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just met interesting people.<eos> Did you happen to come across a man with a black beard and mustache with a habit of strangling women?<eos> PEPE: The girls didn't mention him.<eos> -No, you've had enough.<eos> girls?<eos> You've been spending our money on girls?<eos> But funny.<eos> One of them, in Madame Corona's place, she gets married.
- It's all right. - You sure?<eos> Yes, of course, I shall enjoy the walk.<eos> - Go on through to the parlour.<eos> - Can I get you a brandy? - Thank you.<eos> Tom, how many people have died by this Black Death before my brother?<eos> A few.<eos> What do you think killed them?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Tom, I'm a professional soldier, I've knocked about the world, I've seen many strange things. Things I couldn't even fathom for myself.<eos> Just because I didn't understand them, it doesn't necessarily mean there isn't a perfectly logical explanation for them.
He may be right.<eos> always bragging'.<eos> Inside he was afraid of his own shadow.<eos> Never woulda got over it either if this other fella hadn't come along.<eos> I'm talkin' about that night in Texas... ..when you made me stand alongside you in the street.<eos> I remember you had to knock me down four times... ..before I'd go against them guns.<eos> Chris.<eos> We got to stand alongside of 'em so that someday they can stand alone.<eos> I thought all you did was think about women, Colbee.<eos> I used to be afraid of them too.
I want them in a museum.<eos> Jeannie, you're gonna return those slippers now.<eos> I like it when you are forceful, master.<eos> Sometimes you have to be.<eos> I would do anything to make you happy, master.<eos> - That's my girl.<eos> - Except return these slippers.<eos> Now, wait a minute.<eos> Listen, I-<eos> I cannot tell you how much I love them.
Target control.<eos> Since you stopped us from getting the computer tape... we had to bring Dr. Naldi here himself.<eos> It meant the end of our most important outside contact... but there was no other way.<eos> Having taken control... the computer will redirect the missile from its target in the Pacific... to Alamogordo, where the underground bomb was set off.<eos> The explosion will raise a cloud of radioactive dust... that will settle over vast areas of the Southwest.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> And, of course, Russia will be blamed.<eos> There will be accusations and counter-accusations.<eos> The two great powers will once again be on a collision course.<eos> For them, it will be the end.
I was livid when he didn't turn up.<eos> Didn't turn up?<eos> When?<eos> Oh, last Tuesday.<eos> It's the first time his seat was empty.<eos> I thought he must have flu or something.<eos> Well, thank you, Miss Bumpus.<eos> "What is that noise?<eos> It is the cry of women, my good Lord."<eos> One of them was me.
The Treasure of San Gennaro<eos> Do these suitcases belong to you, sister?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Could you please open one of them?
Look, I vouch for the girl.<eos> If I'm wrong, I'll bring her to you myself.<eos> Please, give me one hour.<eos> One hour.<eos> As I was saying, not only are you a beautiful lady, but you also are a great businesswoman.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow countrymen, I have the honour to introduce Señor Gustavo Alfredo Fortuna, the President of our country.<eos> My good friends, thank you.<eos> This is a most happy occasion.<eos> It is the culmination of many weeks, many months of devoted work on the part of many people gathered here this evening.<eos> Among them is the guiding spirit of this project, my good friend, Señora Consuelo Del Barra.
Well done, Doctor! How was it done?<eos> My dear boy, it was your very idea.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> When the Toymaker wanted to move the pieces, he had to command them in a certain tone of voice to make them move.<eos> (DODO ) But you did it twice.<eos> The first time, I couldn't, because I used my own voice.<eos> - I don't see. - I do.<eos> The Toymaker wasn't playing!<eos> Exactly.<eos> I had to imitate the Toymaker's voice to make them obey me, and they did!
This is indeed an historic moment in the history of the universe!<eos> We six from the outer galaxies joining with the power from the solar system The Daleks!<eos> The seven of us represent the greatest war force ever assembled!<eos> Conquest is assured!<eos> Mars!<eos> Venus!<eos> Jupiter!<eos> The moon colonies!<eos> They will all fall before our might.<eos> But the first of them will be... Earth!
December, 1944.<eos> British and American armies were on the threshold of victory.<eos> Stretched across half of Europe, the Allies gathered themselves for the final assault on Germany.<eos> To the north stood Montgomery's Eighth Army to the south, Patton's Third.<eos> In the center, along an 88-mile front a few battle-weary American divisions rested in a quiet sector.<eos> To them, the war seemed already won.
- It's covered by experienced reporters.<eos> No, I mean really cover it. From start to finish, mile by mile.<eos> Reporters are not permitted on the trip, only contestants. Those are the rules.<eos> We run a newspaper, not a school for revolutionaries!<eos> Enter the race. Enter your own car.<eos> We are running a newspaper, a newspaper, not an automotive agency!<eos> Are you afraid of losing? Give me the money and I'll enter the race.<eos> I despise suffragettes.<eos> I am not just trying to get the vote for women.<eos> I'll emancipate them from the drudgery of being servants or saints.
There you are, Nanny.<eos> Run him out!<eos> Thank you very much, Sir Percy.<eos> We musn't forget it's only a game.<eos> Appearances...<eos> The more she wants to win, the more she pretends to not mind losing.<eos> That's England, too.<eos> You wicked foreigner. That's one of our best kept secrets.<eos> I can't say I dislike appearances.<eos> Society couldn't exist without them.
Go, then, my son.<eos> It can't be mended now without blood.<eos> I'll be back within the week.<eos> She'll escape him somehow, no matter how close he keeps her.<eos> All right, old woman, take it in. (Thunderclap) Where are the men from the village to work on the moat?<eos> None came today, lord.<eos> Yesterday, only two.<eos> The village elder, I haven't seen him since... (Falcon shrieks) It's cold here, love, you're shivering.<eos> Do you know the stars?<eos> My father taught me to find my way by them.
At that time, the Carsinome appeared.<eos> Grew like a fungus.<eos> We had no weapons.<eos> We had not had the need.<eos> And by the time we sensed the danger, the Zarbi were too strong.<eos> -So you left the planet?<eos> -We had no choice.<eos> Where did you go?<eos> At that time, these strange moons appeared.<eos> One of them became our home.
Continue the search.<eos> This desert, was once a vast ocean.<eos> We, the Aridians, lived in a city beneath the sea but for a thousand years, those twin suns that burn have moved closer and closer.<eos> Then... then the sea's dried up and all the creatures that lived within their waters perished.<eos> All but... the Mire Beasts.<eos> Mire Beasts?<eos> What are they?<eos> They lived in the slime, at the bottom of the ocean.<eos> When the waters were gone, they invaded our cities.<eos> There were too many of them.
They fade, but there are no colors like them while they last.<eos> I'd love to paint or do anything like that.<eos> How do you begin?<eos> What is it that you do?<eos> I don't do anything.<eos> My hand just moves, and I follow it.<eos> That's it.<eos> Your hand moves, mine doesn't.<eos> I can't trust my hands.<eos> You must learn if you want them to lead you to things you love.
I tried to get her to move.<eos> - Then things got confused.<eos> - You said it was simple.<eos> You know women.<eos> She's the kind that gets you confused.<eos> - I meet 'em every day.<eos> - Then you should know.<eos> She was in a hurry. They started talking.<eos> - They?<eos> - By then, there were two of them.
I'm having a little bath, love!<eos> Goodness me! The mistress!<eos> What will I do now?<eos> She'll send me home naked!<eos> What will I do? There!<eos> They always leave the lights on in my house!<eos> Thank you, Rosalie, thank you!<eos> Thank you for having trusted me.<eos> My glasses!<eos> I can't see anything without them!
And all of you, I suspect... still harbor some... sacred thoughts.<eos> But no more.<eos> The fallen angel will protect you.<eos> And now for a small entertainment.<eos> These 2 men are true believers.<eos> They believe in a god... who preached "love thy neighbor."<eos> Therefore they refuse to fight each other... in order to save one of their lives.<eos> However, I have devised a plan... whereby each may have the honor and glory... of saving the other's life.<eos> There are 5 daggers here.<eos> One of them is impregnated with a poison... that kills in 5 seconds.
One-night communications between them.<eos> On a veranda outside their separate cubicles.<eos> You don't mean physically, do you?<eos> - I didn't think you did.<eos> Is that what you advocate for me?<eos> Is that what you call a human relationship, you and Grandpa there?<eos> We make a home for each other, my grandfather and I.<eos> Oh, I don't mean a regular home, because I don't regard a home as a...<eos> As a place, a building bricks, wood, stone.<eos> I think of a home as something two people have between them.
- How much is it?<eos> - 14 francs.<eos> - Need some help?<eos> How about a little walk?<eos> Why hurry home?<eos> We can go to a caf or up to my place.<eos> -Who the hell are you?<eos> What are you after?<eos> Do all women go foryou?<eos> You take them to the country?
The army doesn't like more than one disaster in a day.<eos> Looks bad in the newspapers and upsets civilians at their breakfast.<eos> Sir, the Book says, "There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of a host... "<eos> When I have the impertinence to deliver a sermon, then you may tell me my duty.<eos> It is not your duty to sacrifice the sick.<eos> Are you a student of tactics too, Miss Witt?<eos> Are you a Christian?<eos> - It is your duty to let us take those men away.<eos> - Not that way, Miss Witt.<eos> Put 2 good men on that hill. Tell them to keep their eyes peeled.
Mr. Christopher Gough wishes to be announced.<eos> He's in the refectory.<eos> - Can I be helping, sir?<eos> - Yes, Kenrick, please.<eos> Take care of this.<eos> Forgive me, my dear, but I must see Christopher.<eos> Of course.<eos> Kenrick, bring the Lady into the Great Hall when you've finished.<eos> And please fetch my glasses.<eos> I believe you'll find them by the portal.
JOEY:<eos> STEFANO: At your feet, signorina.<eos> Isn't it great?<eos> It makes beautiful picture and I'm an artist with the camera, but what's the use?<eos> I have to live on tourists and tips.<eos> Who tip best? The American or German ladies?<eos> An interesting question.<eos> English ladies, in fact, tip the best.<eos> But they are so serious.<eos> They think that if you have just one conversaZione, signore, just one that you are bound to be loving them for life.
Yah, trinkets!<eos> Well what about Altos, the young man, who...<eos> He forced me to go up the mountain to look for these girls.<eos> Instead we found you and when we brought you back here, he wanted to go out again.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> You stole those things.<eos> Did I?<eos> Oh, they might have given you the wrist bracelets, but for the keys and the chain, Sabetha would never have parted with them!<eos> Yes, I thought they were valuable.<eos> What have you done with them.
Nothing.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> - Do they know anything?<eos> And the doctor?<eos> What ifthe baby...<eos> We did not know what was happening to us.<eos> We were not able to cope with it, the fatigue, the drowsiness.<eos> We were forced to activate more and more automatons to keep Ikaria running normally.<eos> It was then when Hopkins revealed that while focusing the telescope, several stars kept disappearing and reappearing.<eos> There was something between them and the Ikaria.
He writes such nice letters.<eos> I'll let you read them.<eos> - Fine, but keep still...<eos> Make a slutty face.<eos> Go out in the corridor.<eos> - So, it's a part I have to play.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Who do you think I am?<eos> One of your actresses?<eos> You don't think I could be one of them?
- Can I ask you a question?<eos> - Yes, why not?<eos> Of course.<eos> Have you ever been with a woman?<eos> - Well...<eos> - So, you have?<eos> - Why?<eos> Don't you like women?<eos> What does that matter?<eos> If you liked them, you would have done it already, no?
Money is not enough.<eos> Loving him a lot is not enough, either.<eos> A kid is a live and constant problem.<eos> You have to keep him healthy, raise him, educate him.<eos> What will become of a child living with you?<eos> Were you going to do all that with this money?<eos> Look your bill is worth less much less than what you imagine.<eos> It wouldn't be enough to buy that little house you didn't want.<eos> Don't think that women despise you for being mute.<eos> Talk to them well, your own way.
Don't stand there. If you show me the way out, I'll give you $1.<eos> -$3.<eos> -$3? Why, you....<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> I'll give you $3.<eos> But don't stand there, hop in the car.<eos> Hurry kid, I got to get out of here!<eos> -They're not here.<eos> -Probably got a lift. We only passed six or seven cars and they weren't in them.<eos> Somebody must have taken them the other way.
And I loved him.<eos> And I wish he were here now to see this.<eos> You see how the king denies our religion.<eos> If he is not stopped, he will bring destruction on all of us.<eos> What strange skins.<eos> -Where did they come from?<eos> -We hunted them.<eos> We've never seen such animals.<eos> -Aren't they beautiful?<eos> -If you like them.
Just what are you saying?<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> Let's hear it.<eos> Your company gets a slap on the wrist, a few city officials take early retirement, and everything returns to normal.<eos> You know how these things are resolved.<eos> Let's lay our cards on the table.<eos> You're telling me to withdraw my candidacy.<eos> Are you all crazy?<eos> My votes cost me millions.<eos> I got them one by one, door to door. And when you needed them, you took them.
Miss, I am blind, a cripple,<eos> I'm crippled, very crippled!<eos> You still want me?<eos> I've known it for a long time.<eos> It's not just that.<eos> I'm a gambler, shunned from the world.<eos> And not just that. I've killed people.<eos> You could say I'm a criminal.<eos> And there's more, I've known women.<eos> These women I've bought with money, and not just 5 or 10 of them!
She's been gone an hour, and she took the boy with her!<eos> erectile tissue...<eos> It's all a matter of swollen tissue and secretion.<eos> A confession before extreme unction:<eos> Semen smells nasty to me.<eos> I've a very keen sense of smell and I stank like a rotten fish when I was fertilized.<eos> It's optional.<eos> I wouldn't accept my wretched role.<eos> But now it's too damn lonely.<eos> We try out attitudes, and find them all worthless.
He will have our lives in his hands.<eos> That is enough.<eos> Then we agree.<eos> Tell me something about the people, the Thals.<eos> Over 500 years ago there were two races on this planet, we, the Daleks, and the Thals.<eos> After the neutronic war, our Dalek forefathers retired into the city, protected by our machines.<eos> And the Thals?<eos> Most of them perished in the war, but we know that there are survivors.<eos> They must be disgustingly mutated, but the fact that they have survived tells us they must have a drug that preserves the life force.<eos> And knowing that these mutated creatures exist outside the city, you're willing to send one of us in amongst them?
I have come to tell you there is a path leading through them from the north.<eos> It's a bad path, but the Persians could use it.<eos> We know there is a path.<eos> Our scouts are looking, but can't find it.<eos> I can show the way.<eos> It runs by the Callidromus mountain.<eos> We'd better hurry, sir.<eos> The accursed barbarians are probably looking for it, too.<eos> Agathon, dispatch all the Phocian troops.<eos> Have them block that path and guard it.
Don't you know who he is?<eos> Who is he?<eos> Dummy. He's the Unknown Soldier!<eos> I'm gonna stuff myself tomorrow. My belly will be out to here.<eos> Would you have a comb?<eos> Damn, I left mine at home.<eos> Here, I have one.<eos> - Would you like an American cigarette?<eos> How come you're not with your girlfriends?<eos> We just walked them home.
They last over 200 years, twice as long as we do.<eos> You think I'm taking my professional frustrations out on the robots?<eos> Are you?<eos> I've been a member of the Order over half my life.<eos> My father...<eos> We don't object to the robots as such.<eos> We only hold the humanoids are unnecessary.<eos> They're soulless, Godless imitations of man and in that form, they are not needed.<eos> Well, I'd much rather work with a humanoid in the office than have all those little machines chugging about.<eos> If those little machines didn't resemble us, it would never occur to them to try to replace us.
Cock and hen!<eos> She laughed so hard,we couldn't get straight nap for the photograph<eos> Fond of puns,I gather you're trying to say<eos> Any sort of joke<eos> I had a little Aviary out there back<eos> She got funnier I spent more time with my birds<eos> Budgies are little Like little parrots<eos> They have Circle around their eyes<eos> Gives them a sort of Sad tired look<eos> I found them very Restful and sympathetic Until one of them spoke out at me
Heaven helps those who help themselves.<eos> And I need your help, Pa!<eos> You squeezed the last penny out of me you'll ever get!<eos> It's too late for me. It's for my kids!<eos> It's not too late for you to get a husband to support you.<eos> After three husbands, I'm through with marriage.<eos> I want to enjoy myself. I want my girls to enjoy themselves.<eos> And travel like Mama does.<eos> Yeah, and you'll leave them just like your mother left you.<eos> Never! I don't want them to sit their lives away the way I did. And the way you do, with nothing but a calendar to tell you one day is different from the next.
- Good night, Herbie.<eos> I'll cold cream their faces and be right back.<eos> The hotel is just two doors away.<eos> Honestly, the way you behave with those girls. Rose!<eos> We need silverware for when we set up housekeeping' on Riverside Drive.<eos> You're so high and mighty with a suite at the Astor and you still steal the cutlery.<eos> You gotta grasp every opportunity.<eos> Herbie, how long is it gonna take you to get used to me?<eos> How long did it take me to get used to those coats?<eos> What's wrong with them?
Someday you'll be able to earn your living.<eos> You're too optimistic.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Sometimes I wish I would die.<eos> Late in the night, I take a walk.<eos> I don't think, honestly, I wish to die...<eos> But I say "I wish I would die".<eos> Then, I feel somehow at ease.<eos> To feel at ease is a pleasure you can get without a penny.<eos> The whiteness of the stone makes them look light.
It's my husband.<eos> But you love him?<eos> I should know.<eos> Nobody loves but me.<eos> Answer me!<eos> I don't need him to love me?<eos> You're luckier than him.<eos> How?<eos> In the life that awaits... you will find beautiful and pretty women who love you.<eos> Wilhelm has no use for them.
Answer me!<eos> I don't need him to love me?<eos> You're luckier than him.<eos> How?<eos> In the life that awaits... you will find beautiful and pretty women who love you.<eos> Wilhelm has no use for them.<eos> They want to be loved by him because he is handsome.<eos> But Wilhelm did not entrust anyone.<eos> Especially not a woman.<eos> As if he had found evil in them.
O gypsy violin<eos> You know this song?<eos> Never heard it before.<eos> - You like it?<eos> If you only knew who used to sing this song.<eos> Who used to sing it?<eos> - How did you know?<eos> - It was easy to guess.<eos> So it's true... - you do go with women.<eos> It's them that come to me.
Whose life?<eos> Not mine.<eos> Lay on, Mills.<eos> Watch your toes there.<eos> They're like a string of live pearls.<eos> - It must be some sort of game.<eos> - Women only!<eos> - Damn dull game.<eos> - Oh, it has its possibilities.<eos> Not a single man among them.
If Captain Bligh was cooped up here for five months, five months, mark you, who do you think he'd take it out on?<eos> You think we sweat a bit, making for the Horn?<eos> Wait till he breaks our back making for Jamaica.<eos> We'll worry about that when it comes. Here!<eos> - Aye.<eos> - Might as well at that, mates.<eos> I wonder why they make those women eat alone?<eos> Because if they didn't, you'd be too busy to eat.<eos> Funny lot, aren't they?<eos> They let us make free with their women. They won't let us eat with them.
Now, before we start, a little family discussion.<eos> We don't know what lies ahead of us.<eos> The unknown has always been man's greatest demoralizer.<eos> Maybe we can cope with this by maintaining our sense of values.<eos> By carrying out our daily routine, the same as we always have.<eos> Rick, for instance, and myself, will shave every day.<eos> Although, in his case, maybe every other day.<eos> These concessions of civilization are important.<eos> They are our links with reality.<eos> And because of them, we might be less afraid.
Muroto is reporting to Kurofuji.<eos> About Aunt and Chidori?<eos> That means the traitors are with Kurofuji.<eos> The three of them together.<eos> If they're in his house, my uncle is there, too.<eos> Fool!<eos> What were the guards doing?<eos> -We can't use the women anymore.<eos> -We can.<eos> The Chamberlain doesn't know we lost them.
I still have the 50 lira you gave me for Christmas.<eos> Keep them, don't...<eos> Yes! Yes! If you don't take it...<eos> I'll be worried... I don't need it, grandma...<eos> Then show me what's in your pockets.<eos> If you've got enough, I'll not insist.<eos> We'd better say goodbye.<eos> I always think it could be the last time.<eos> Two years at the sanatorium were required, between the mountains and a lake.<eos> During that time you wrote often and your letters were like you, who wrote them: shy, bashful, afraid of elaborate...
How often does a man get rid of all his troubles at the same time?<eos> Oh, what's the matter?<eos> I don't understand, Miss Allison.<eos> What are you doing In traction?<eos> Slipped on a champagne cork?<eos> it was an accident I've sprung my sacroiliac.<eos> No, I've had this happen before.<eos> Don't worry, I'll be absolutely splendid by the morning.<eos> The girls can't go without her.<eos> You will have to let them stay until tomorrow
Two won't make much difference.<eos> The night before the posse got here, I heard a noise outside so I went to look.<eos> I saw Nora.<eos> She had two horses saddled and a pack horse loaded.<eos> Then Wayne comes sneaking up and gunned me down.<eos> I figure they was clearing out 'cause they knew that posse was coming.<eos> - You're lying!<eos> Talk!<eos> He was toting blankets when I saw him.<eos> And maybe them blankets are still in that bedroom.
What are they?<eos> A priest asking a poor rabbi what demons are?<eos> Don't you know?<eos> Maybe the trouble is not demons but the absence of angels<eos> Mother Joan's angel has gone and now she's alone with herself<eos> Maybe it's only human nature<eos> Stop this mockery, Jew<eos> You sit over your books by candlelight and you don't care that people suffer<eos> That women... Do women suffer?<eos> Let them.
Some want to stay here or take their women.<eos> How about you?<eos> Seemed like a good idea while it lasted.<eos> It was quite a night!<eos> What's with you? You're acting like a Zen priest!<eos> No tails wagged your way?<eos> None of your business.<eos> I'm thinking of disbanding here.<eos> Last night I really learned how... to appreciate women!<eos> Why not discard our weapons and join them as refugees?
Now you're going to have your share.<eos> You look at me as if you hate me.<eos> That's a very good guess.<eos> For God's sake, get out!<eos> Come back when I'm in a better temper!<eos> No, I'm sorry, Mr. Barrett. Mr. Farr has left.<eos> No, I haven't seen him since lunch.<eos> Yes, I agree, but by inclination we're all individualists.<eos> Every man wants to own his own business... But the pressure of modern commerce... Is gradually pushing the independent trades out of existence.<eos> Now, my plan is to let them keep their autonomy... But at the same time have all the advantages the combines enjoy... Through an associated purchasing company.
I didn't need to worry after all.<eos> "I'm getting weaker..."<eos> "I didn't want to tell Mr. Kim that you were ill.<eos> He's not the sort of man to say kind words.<eos> We were foolish.<eos> A rosy dream can't bloom in late Autumn when frost forms."<eos> Mr. Kim.<eos> I'm here for my lesson.<eos> Let me see your hands.<eos> Factory work has roughened them.
What am I supposed to do, come in and call him a liar?<eos> Well, it doesn't matter whose father he is.<eos> He's calling you a crook.<eos> Do you have to be polite and agree?<eos> Do you have to back down without a fight?<eos> Honey, you just stay out of this now.<eos> No, but, Dad, I remember that.<eos> I was there and I remember what was said and what wasn't said.<eos> All these terrible things that he's accusing you of doing you didn't do them, did you?<eos> You didn't do any of them.
He's a good man.<eos> He has saved a lot of girls like you.<eos> You're Jewish, aren't you?<eos> No, I'm not Jewish.<eos> Attention, please!<eos> General roll call!<eos> Attention, please!<eos> General roll call!<eos> -How many are the politicals?<eos> -About 50 percent, but you can't trust them. Most of them have been here at least 2 years.
We won't lose.<eos> If the British give in and let us go, we've won.<eos> And if we starve to death aboard this ship, we've still won.<eos> They'll wait.<eos> They'll wait until you're too weak and then come aboard and take you off.<eos> It doesn't take much strength to set off 200 pounds of dynamite.<eos> You'd still set it off, knowing you've lost?<eos> Of course.<eos> Without any regard for the lives you'd be destroying?<eos> With every regard in the world for them.
Which you did.<eos> Yes.<eos> - And then they assigned you to...<eos> - You said there were three gates.<eos> Who went through the third gate?<eos> Girls.<eos> - All the girls?<eos> - No.<eos> Only if they were young and pretty.<eos> What happened to them?

- I've got no mom!<eos> Majesty, when you're lying, at least make it good!<eos> You've showed us your lackeys, now show us the prisoners that are working for you!<eos> - Show them, or I'll bang!<eos> - No noise, please!<eos> All right, you'll see the prisoners.<eos> - In a while.<eos> - Why not now?<eos> I don't keep prisoners near my palace. That would be disturbing.<eos> I've sent them away to the swamps and marshes.
Attempted rape?<eos> Sally, he didn't even touch the child.<eos> I don't understand you.<eos> Neither of you seem to think this is serious.<eos> A sexual pervert lures two little girls into his house...<eos> He didn't lure them in, they went there of their own accord.<eos> What in heaven's name difference does that make?<eos> A great deal.<eos> It means...<eos> The fact is he got them into his home and made them do something that might have had the most horrible consequences.
Keep busy, Polly.<eos> Lots of meetings and civic duties and obligations. It's a poor substitute for what's really wrong with you.<eos> I knew I could count on you for some lofty clinical observations.<eos> Would you like to be paid for your diagnosis?<eos> This one's on the house.<eos> There's no medical term for it.<eos> You can give everything but love.<eos> It's as simple as that.<eos> - Angelica? - Ma'am? See that the flowers in the conservatory get fresh water.<eos> - I found them dry again today.
Ruth Sanders..<eos> She's working as an extra, at the Savoy Film Company And right now, they're doing exteriors, near Winchester<eos> She doesn't know yet..<eos> It's been kept very quiet..<eos> Alright,Major..<eos> What do you think is behind the murders?<eos> Have you worked out any kind of a theory?<eos> The Executioner, seems to have the idea that he's some kind of avenger<eos> Especially since his victims are nearly all, hardened criminals<eos> And this theory is not good, because two of them, were completely innocent.
Swear him in, Sergeant.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God, sir?<eos> - I do.<eos> - Shattuck, I...<eos> I suppose you're going to have the doctor give us all of the frank medical details?<eos> I'm afraid I have no choice, sir.<eos> The condition of both bodies is vital to my...<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Sergeant, escort the ladies into the orderly room.<eos> Have them wait there.
Lately, this house has become unused to visitors.<eos> Please, don't mention it.<eos> Being a wife of a recluse is not an easy role.<eos> You've heard of my husband's strange way of life?<eos> Yes, I'm afraid it's common talk.<eos> Perhaps I can help you with your business?<eos> Business can wait.<eos> Since our chance meeting, I wanted so much to see you again.<eos> Mr. Hyde I hope that because of the circumstances of our first meeting you won't come to any wrong conclusions.<eos> It's because of them that I've been trying to put you out of my mind.
With the scent of this flower I have drawn you to me.<eos> It smells so nice...<eos> I love you.<eos> Accept my love, and you will live forever in unfailing, eternal youth.<eos> My blood, unaged in centuries, will flow in your veins.<eos> Be glad, Miwako.<eos> Now you will become the true princess of my heart Princess of Kisaragi Castle.<eos> I loved Princess Katsu, daughter of Shiro Amakusa with all my heart.<eos> More than Deus, god of the Christians and more than St. Mary herself, I loved Princess Katsu.<eos> But the armies of the shogun came for her as well bringing with them the time of resolve.
Dream on.<eos> - Speak Italian.<eos> I'm the one who took the risks.<eos> - I'll give you 20.000.<eos> - I had all the trouble...<eos> They've stolen it!<eos> Have you seen the three women who were here with us?<eos> I watch cows, not who passes through here!<eos> If they're not here they will be close.<eos> We'll find them.
It's embarrassing.<eos> "Arty o the irst art"?<eos> I kind of like that.<eos> It has a ring to it.<eos> Twelve people go off into a room.<eos> Twelve different minds.<eos> Twelve different hearts.<eos> Twelve different walks of life.<eos> Twelve sets of eyes, ears, shapes and sizes.<eos> These twelve people are asked to judge another human being as different from them as they are from each other.
See, when they get to the slaughterhouse, he ducks to one side, and the silly sheep... go in to get their throats cut- that black devil knows it.<eos> - Did you get rid of the typewriter? - Uh-huh.<eos> There's a pit out back, where they bury all the entrails.<eos> Nobody'll go near that.<eos> So, uh, how did you make out?<eos> Oh, fine.<eos> You're pretty smug about it.<eos> But if you did, how come you're not sweaty? Like after Paulie. And after you found out about those stinkin' glasses.<eos> I just wasn't rational at the time.<eos> After thinking about it, I realize there was nothing really distinctive about them.
"I went for pathos.<eos> "To stand up to virtue you must suppress your own self. "<eos> I'm like a child, Marianne.<eos> I don't know how to live.<eos> It's impossible without you.<eos> Don't say so.<eos> It's cruel.<eos> "For my attack, I chose the theme 'to have you or to die. '<eos> "Women imagine that their repudiated suitors would throw themselves...<eos> "under a train for them.
Congratulations.<eos> I want to get rid of the stones and give the money to Mihara.<eos> Mihara, eh?<eos> As you know, Mihara was crippled in that incident that sent me to prison for three years.<eos> I never mentioned your name the whole time I was inside.<eos> Let's discuss the terms of the settlement.<eos> Listen, Oyane, when I was in prison, I was worried about him.<eos> The reason I didn't talk was I wanted to give the stones to Mihara.<eos> Do me a favor and forget about those stones.<eos> I want to give them to him.
If your foot hadn't slipped, you might have harmed the little fellow.<eos> Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Good?<eos> - Yes, indeed.<eos> Well, you're in good hands now.<eos> - Also "yes, indeed"?<eos> - Yes, indeed.<eos> The women of the village had turned against me.<eos> To them, I had become the concubine of Harris-san.
Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Good?<eos> - Yes, indeed.<eos> Well, you're in good hands now.<eos> - Also "yes, indeed"?<eos> - Yes, indeed.<eos> The women of the village had turned against me.<eos> To them, I had become the concubine of Harris-san.<eos> I was not fit to bathe with them.
Not so, Gottfried?<eos> To think that man could torture fellow man as they once tortured you.<eos> They believed in one thing, I believed in another.<eos> But they were running the country.<eos> That was my misfortune.<eos> But you won and they didn't.<eos> I won?<eos> You're thinking only of my surgeon's hands.<eos> They were too clever to do anything to them.<eos> They needed them for the unholy operations they forced me to perform for them.
Now, for example, here we find exhibit A:<eos> The married kind.<eos> These ladies stood their ground And won<eos> And I salute them, every one<eos> Here are some others to behold<eos> For whom the bells have never toiled<eos> Oh, what a poor, defenseless pair<eos> In those pathetic rags they wear<eos> And there is the future.<eos> Someday, each and every one of them will either be married or unmarried.

- You were Red cap.<eos> He was Black cap.<eos> You were Gold cap.<eos> Let's play.<eos> - Black cap!<eos> - Who sir, me sir?<eos> Thank you, Mrs McGillicuddy.<eos> Did you fix the generator?<eos> There's nothing wrong with kerosene lamps. They are rather quaint.<eos> - You can't see so good with them.
She's working Cape Race.<eos> - How far away is she?<eos> - It's hard to tell.<eos> Signal strength's pretty good.<eos> About 50 miles back, I should think.<eos> - Get this off to all ships, will you.<eos> From S.S. Californian. Ice reports.<eos> â™ªâ™ª â™ª With me bundle on me shoulder â™ª â™ª Faith, there's no one could be bolder â™ª â™ª I'm leaving dear old Ireland without warning â™ª<eos> â™ª For I lately took a notion â™ª â™ª For to cross the briny ocean â™ª â™ª And I'm off to Philadelphia in the morning â™ª â™ª Oh, me name is Paddy Leary â™ª<eos> â™ª From a spot in Tipperary â™ª â™ª The hearts of all the girls I am a thorn in â™ª â™ª But before the break of morn â™ª â™ª Sure, 'tis them who'll be forlorn â™ª
You don't just accidentally land on a planet 26 million miles away.<eos> That's what I would have said, but it appears all things are possible in space.<eos> We don't know how fast we were traveling, nor how long we were unconscious, but of one thing I'm sure, this is Venus.<eos> Yeah, but, Doc, what about all those things we learned at school?<eos> You know, the atmosphere of Venus is supposed to be unbreathable.<eos> The cloud layer's so thick that no light ever gets through.<eos> And with a surface temperature higher than the boiling point of water.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> I subscribe to many of those theories myself.<eos> I even helped formulate some of them.
- Which one do you want?<eos> - The West Hampshire Weekly News.<eos> I want to see what the Major was so interested in.<eos> Dear, what a silly-billy.<eos> I've gone and left my glasses upstairs.<eos> Shall I go and get them for you?<eos> Will you, dear? That would be so kind of you.<eos> I hate you fetching and carrying for me.<eos> But you know, my poor old legs are a bit tired.<eos> I think you'll find them on the table by my bed.
I couldn't use a flash, could I? And also, with the weather...<eos> This close up is quite good... artistically speaking.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You won't be needing me again, Mr Decrey?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - At your service.<eos> I had the photos.<eos> One of them in particular hurt me.
I'll roll joints for you. And you smoke. No problem.<eos> - Daughter-in-law!<eos> - Wait. I'm coming.<eos> - Call your mother. - Mother!<eos> Mother, I'll help you...<eos> Good God!<eos> Why are you giving the oxen this dirty water to drink?<eos> Take the oxen to our well. No.<eos> Don't do this. Why not?<eos> What will you do with them?
No, not today. - To us.<eos> - To us.<eos> Here's yours.<eos> It's a little smaller.<eos> Open yours first.<eos> Should I?<eos> Oh, Mike, the earrings.<eos> Oh, they're so beautiful with the ring. - You like them?<eos> - Oh, they're lovely.<eos> - You like them?
Come on! Come on!<eos> Colonel!<eos> Stay low there!<eos> Stay low!<eos> - Should we run for it lieutenant?<eos> - Get that head down.<eos> Don't get paniquee!<eos> We are going right through this.<eos> All you gotta fight is your own legs.<eos> Make them carry you beyond the range of fire.
Did you see Giorgio?<eos> - Which Giorgio?<eos> - My Giorgio.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> What do youwant?<eos> I don't want nothing. Mind your own fat ass!<eos> Go inside and dry yourself off.<eos> I don't have the keys.<eos> Where'd you put them?
This chicken ranch of mine was six miles from my nearest neighbor.<eos> She was a Polish lady that weighed 258 pounds.<eos> And when she started looking good to me, I blew.<eos> What are you gonna do with all your loot?<eos> - You know who it's for.<eos> - For who?<eos> The kids.<eos> Who else? - How are they doing?<eos> - Well, they're both in school.<eos> But I'm gonna get them out there with me.
- Here, let me help you.<eos> - No, I... Sure, go ahead.<eos> Well, what are we gonna talk about?<eos> You heard from the kids?<eos> Sure. I hear from them every week.<eos> That's how I know about you.<eos> Your pictures, your plays, your books.<eos> Somehow or other you always manage to stand out in their letters.<eos> - Second-year college. - Yeah.<eos> Spig you mean an awful lot to them.
That I should swear Leonard was guilty and that you should expose me as a liar because only then would they believe Leonard was innocent.<eos> So now you know the whole story, Sir Wilfrid.<eos> I'll give yer something to dream about, mister.<eos> Want to kiss me, ducky?<eos> I suspected something, but not that.<eos> - Never that!<eos> - Thank you for the compliment.<eos> It's been a long time since I acted and I never played such a vital role.<eos> All those blue letters!<eos> It took me hours to write them, to invent Max.
Set the village on fire.<eos> Go to the swamp!<eos> On the other side!<eos> Fire!<eos> Fire!<eos> Fire!<eos> The village is burning!<eos> The village is burning!<eos> I beg you, don't take the Chronicles.<eos> The fifty men of the clan will find some work thanks to them.
No matter what it costs.<eos> - You have so many other things...<eos> Regardless, Benny.<eos> All these years you wanted a lot like the other boys, roller skates, baseball glove.<eos> I could never pay you.<eos> This time, for once, I will pay you what you want.<eos> Once I have my work, get your tuxedo.<eos> We could not shorten the sleeves?<eos> Of course, we could shorten sleeves now.<eos> But Benny, next year when you will need them to be longer there will be a fold here that you can never remove.
He was very fond of Tom,<eos> And--and yet he...<eos> He didn't seem as surprised or disturbed as he should have been.<eos> If was almost as if...<eos> As if he were confident, as if he knew something.<eos> If what Tom says is true,<eos> That could explain it.<eos> Might be.<eos> But if it is true and there were pictures,<eos> What could have happened to them?
How are you, Anna?<eos> Come with me. Meet royal wives.<eos> Royal wives.<eos> He has the head of a goat!<eos> Evil eye!<eos> Evil eye! Evil eye!<eos> - Evil eye! - Ladies!<eos> Ladies, come back! Come back. Oh, dear.<eos> Oh, this is dreadful.<eos> Why have you not educated them in the British custom of spying glass?
That's wonderful.<eos> I already put down a deposit on it, to seal it.<eos> Did you take the capsules?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - When?<eos> Just a few minutes ago.<eos> Listen, I forgot to tell you.<eos> They might hurt a little, burn, or give you some pains.<eos> But don't get frightened.<eos> Hermy said that some people are allergic to them at first.
- The've left hoof.<eos> - What have you done?<eos> Nobody considers that a man so would an animal.<eos> - Why did you do it?<eos> - I'll tell you what, Steve.<eos> If a horse is trimmed hooves you can not walk.<eos> 's Like you nailed you a knife between the nails.<eos> He ​​did not escape to.<eos> So mares would not move from here.<eos> foals would stay with them while having to suck .
There is a chance we can avoid the collision.<eos> Well... What does one say when he learns of the end of the world?<eos> There is one possible way out of this.<eos> If you could induce the countries with nuclear weapons to launch a barrage, you may alter the course of the rogue planet.<eos> Could it succeed?<eos> Theoretically it should work. But if Earth is obliterated The debris will destroy Paira, as well.<eos> News flash.<eos> Today, Doctors Matsuda, Kamura and Isobe have sent a request to the Council of Nations.<eos> That they deploy their entire stockpile of nuclear weapons For the purpose of saving lives,<eos> Rather than destroying them, To protect our Earth from total destruction.
There's a great deal of flak around there.<eos> It's a hot spot.<eos> We nearly got the chop there about three months ago.<eos> Can I suggest we go a little further north?<eos> Yes, we knew about that when we planned the route.<eos> The trouble is, if we go much further north, we run into another hot spot round here.<eos> Anyway, we can take it up a little.<eos> Now, the gap isn't too wide, so watch it, you navigators.<eos> What about the defences on the dam, sir?<eos> Reconnaissance show's them as being fairly light, you'll see the photos in a minute.
- Monsieur Delassalle. - Yes.<eos> It's time I rang the bell.<eos> Go ahead. I'll manage unloading the car myself.<eos> - Your salads are rotten! - You aren't paying for them.
A barracuda.<eos> Hello?<eos> Is Miss Dixie Evans there?<eos> Evans.<eos> Yes. Would you get her, please?<eos> Sounds like they're shooting off guns or something.<eos> Bongos.<eos> - A lot of women there? - Loaded.<eos> What do you think of women, kitty?<eos> There's room in the world for them.
Permit me to observe the illusion that you can be happy with one woman it's a phase man goes through.<eos> If Your Highness would glance into my harem my wives are entertaining three ravishing young guests.<eos> I am not in the mood, Wazir, for visiting other mers harems.<eos> Not a visit, highness, a glance.<eos> I have secret means of watching.<eos> It's a small device from which I've derived a great deal of innocent amusement.<eos> The simple creatures do not know they're being observed.<eos> They are the princesses of Ababu.<eos> Note their charms.<eos> Consider that an alliance with them would mean a safe northern frontier.
-l'm an agreeable guy.<eos> -Sure.<eos> So when they park in front of this tourist cabin, I said:<eos> "lf l got to pay for the ride, this is the easiest way I know."<eos> So we got busy on the martinis.<eos> They must have thought I was Superman.<eos> Nothing like that ever happens to me.<eos> So then I said "Okay, girls, party's over.<eos> Let's get going."<eos> And one of them sticks a gun in my back and says "This party's going on till we say it's over, Buck."
With flesh and blood and nerves and feelings! I'm in love with you.<eos> I need you, I want you.<eos> That will be all, Miss Morris.<eos> You remember that torn shirt, Helen?<eos> Now you know how it happened.<eos> It got torn at the laundry, that's how it happened.<eos> What an imagination!<eos> You don't realize this about women and me:<eos> I walk into a room and they sense it.<eos> I arouse something in them, I bother them.
I forgot she's on television.<eos> 50 million TV sets in America. And now with the coaxial cable...!<eos> I had onions at lunch. I had garlic dressing at dinner.<eos> But he'll never know because I stay kissing-sweet the new Dazzledent way.<eos> Now that I have your attention, I want to warn all you girls about an evil, dangerous, married man living downstairs in my building.<eos> His name is Richard Sherman.<eos> While his wife and son are in Maine this monster is terrorizing the girls of New York.<eos> Mommy, come quick!<eos> They're talking about Daddy.<eos> He makes them sit on the piano bench and makes them play "Chopsticks." Then suddenly he turns on them... just like the creature from the Black Lagoon!
You can't trust a moth, Mr. Sherman.<eos> They get hungry at night so they start looking around for a snack and...<eos> - Oh, I wish I was dead<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't quite understand the situation.<eos> In a situation like this, who cares about moths?<eos> Situation, Mr. Kruhulik?<eos> What situation?<eos> Let them eat the rugs.
It seems I picked up this tramp with a pair of stolen shoes and a wild story about a corpse.<eos> What do you think, him walking in with Harry Worp's shoes in his hand and then that phone call to the police?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I may be wrong, but I don't think he's tied us into it yet.<eos> Oh, the way he looked at me!<eos> If he'd known anything, he'd have kept us there.<eos> But modern police methods are all psychological now, Sammy.<eos> Psychological.<eos> They just wear you down and wear you down until you're almost grateful to get into that gas chamber.<eos> The police will probably tell him if the shoes fit, to keep them.
You won't need it. put it under my pillow.<eos> If there's no other way out. Use that gun on Louise.<eos> Dawn already.<eos> Well, captain. Looks like you're ship's falling apart, don't it?<eos> You've been no help.<eos> Did you look for Ruby? You can help Rick find Louise.<eos> You're a low scum.<eos> -You're a coward.<eos> I only fight when I have to, and on my conditions.<eos> One of them is that I know what I'm fighting.
The trouble is we've no direct evidence.<eos> - Ah. And that's where I really need your help.<eos> I want to get someone to work for me on the inside.<eos> What makes you think he'll come back?<eos> I thought we might get a woman police officer on the teaching staff for a few months.<eos> If there are any vacancies.<eos> There are always vacancies at St Trinian's.<eos> The significant thing is nothing ever happens during the school holidays.<eos> Oh, the school holidays.<eos> Happy clays! I long for them!
I'm terribly sorry, Your Highness.<eos> The cup...<eos> Where's the cup?<eos> Miss Brimmer, Miss...<eos> Girls, girls, girls!<eos> This really is too much!<eos> The honour of the school has suffered enough for one day and don't imagine for one moment that I don't know who did it.<eos> But, in view of the occasion, I am going to appeal to your sporting instincts to return that cup.<eos> And in order that the girls may suffer no ignominy,<eos> I'm going to have the lights put out for 30 seconds, in order to allow them to return it unseen.
Take the tow line...<eos> defective equipment.<eos> But they began spreading wild rumours about steaming in circles. - - And then "Old Yellowstain".<eos> I was to blame for Maryk's incompetence.<eos> Maryk was the perfect officer, but not Queeg.<eos> But the strawberries, that's where I had them.<eos> I proved with geometric logic that a duplicate key to the icebox existed.<eos> I could have produced that key. They were protecting some officer...<eos> Naturally, I can only cover these things from memory.<eos> If I've left anything out, just ask me specific questions - - And I'll be glad to answer them one by one.
I want you to tell him that I have returned to Paris to prepare the final defeat of my enemies.<eos> Tell him that I offer him an alliance.<eos> And tell him that I would like Marshal Bernadotte to march by my side once again.<eos> And that is why you came to see me.<eos> Yes.<eos> and of course I was... cold and tired and alone.<eos> "Jean-Baptoiste has answered the letter... and his answer is he will march against Napoleon... not with him."<eos> "Napoleon is defeated... and Jean had led one of the armies which fought him."<eos> "The allied troops are about to enter Paris."<eos> "How I hope Jean is with them."
Connie, for a certain type, maturity is terribly important.<eos> - lf you consider...<eos> - Gladys, what do you think?<eos> I think, if they're big enough, they're old enough.<eos> But, now, seriously, Dr. Manning.<eos> Don't you feel that the laws governing this whole matter...<eos> - ...are very outmoded?<eos> - If you mean...<eos> Of course, Ilka.<eos> Most of them were written too long ago.
You'd live alone in a hotel room, go to concerts on Sunday... and work for some dull-witted business executive.<eos> - What is attractive about that prospect?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Nevertheless, I am going home. - Oh.<eos> What about me?<eos> How am I going to get along without you?<eos> I've come to depend upon you.<eos> I dislike change.<eos> I dislike new faces.<eos> Friends of mine are going back, and I want to go with them.
Ben was taking me to California.<eos> He was gonna start new.<eos> Start new?<eos> At what?<eos> Ranching, maybe.<eos> He knows a lot about cattle.<eos> Yeah, other people's cattle.<eos> Did you ever think for a minute that Ben had the temper to settle on the land?<eos> To clear it, to build on it?<eos> To bring in the cattle and nurse them through the winter?
- We"ll meet back here at sunset.<eos> Agreed?<eos> - Agreed.<eos> One of us should have some luck.<eos> Now take care you see the Indians before they see you.<eos> Never fear, good friend, I"ll be watching this scalp.<eos> I had heard that the fishing was good in Virginia waters: : : But who would have expected fish such as these:<eos> The question was, how to angle for them?<eos> But mt mermaids were sht:<eos> The worst of it is, thet vanished before I could gain from them a clue: : : As to where Powhatan's village lat:
-Can't you read the sign?<eos> -I'm sorry.<eos> Look, where'd you get the face for this guy that shot Lincoln?<eos> -From photographs.<eos> -They take them at that time?<eos> If you go to the City Library... you'll find the volume of Mathew Brady's photos taken during the Civil War.<eos> -Do you work here?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -You make these things?<eos> -Some of them.
Tell that furniture man to bring that stuff right back up here.<eos> Don't even move!<eos> Well?<eos> - Something wrong, Mrs. Page?<eos> - I just feel sort of lonely.<eos> - Your friends? - Yeah.<eos> I wanted those two dingbats to stand up with me.<eos> - They may come yet.<eos> - I'll throw them out.<eos> I wanted them yesterday. No time to laugh at them now.
It is you. You made it to safety.<eos> - I am glad to see you.<eos> I've wanted to thank you for all you did. It was nothing.<eos> Though I have no relatives buried here, I wanted to pay respects.<eos> This is my aunt.<eos> - My name is Sawa, sire.<eos> - And where do you hail from?<eos> - From Shirakawa.<eos> - Famous for its chestnuts? Yes, sire.<eos> In autumn, the hillsides are covered with them.
You needn't worry, madame.<eos> We'll wait here.<eos> It's been an eternity.<eos> I wondered why I went on living.<eos> I saw only your face.<eos> - Couldn't you speak more plainly?<eos> - What should I say?<eos> My favorite phrase. The one you say so sweetly. "I don't love you."<eos> My earrings.<eos> Thanks to them, you were always at my side.
You think she cares?<eos> The minute he's out of sight, she'll head for the lions' cage.<eos> What do you expect?<eos> She's not of the circus.<eos> I love you more than you'll ever know.<eos> Always practicing your tricks, aren't you?<eos> It's a pity you can't learn to do something.<eos> I know a few tricks, too.<eos> No, women are not like angels.<eos> Don't place them so high above.
Mystery, more mystery.<eos> Billy is a liar.<eos> Heaven only knows what Chelm is.<eos> CID maybe.<eos> You borrowed my thought.<eos> Work to do.<eos> Work to do. The time has come for direct action.<eos> You remember last night when we came on board? The fuss he was making about his dispatch box?<eos> I love colors.<eos> Working with them is an endless puzzle.
But tonight that is finished.<eos> What has happened?<eos> They have taken Francesca.<eos> Taken the last thing I have.<eos> My two daughters have turned against me.<eos> My family is gone.<eos> And what has happened to me will happen to others.<eos> Unless we go out, the whole town, every man, every boat, to bring Francesca back to show these people they can't do that to us.<eos> Julian, you have four daughters.<eos> What about them?
But perhaps it is a trade secret, not meant for outsiders?<eos> No, my lady, there is no special trade secret.<eos> But it takes many years' experience to handle the clay and apply the glaze.<eos> The fruit of experience is beauty, but only a master craftsman can create such beauty.<eos> Thank you, my lady.<eos> These are my wares, aren't they?<eos> I wanted to taste sake from your cups.<eos> You're fortunate, my little ones, to catch this noble lady's eye.<eos> I'm a farmer, so the pottery is just a sideline, but I feel for my creations, as if they were my own children.<eos> That such a noble lady would look kindly upon them is a great honour. To see them in such a grand residence, graced by the touch of so beautiful a lady,
Let's get him out of here.<eos> Hello, ma'am.<eos> I'm the wife of the chief deputy out there. He would like that sent right through, please.<eos> All right. Glad to help out the law anytime.<eos> Watch your feet.<eos> You know, when they open these boxes in Denver, they're sure to pick me up.<eos> What can they prove?<eos> Nothing. That's right. I'll deny all knowledge of the robbery.<eos> "Me?" I'll say.<eos> "Gentlemen, them boxes wasn't opened when I was guarding them."
However, first things first.<eos> Shall we startle the Nazis with your concern for my safety?<eos> You seem to disapprove me.<eos> You're the most cold-blooded thief, traitor and criminal I've seen in a lifetime of looking at human trash.<eos> What a pity.<eos> I rather hoped I'd look like a gentlemen.<eos> Cicero and the British?<eos> Put that away. Too many people.<eos> They're saying something about our shoes.<eos> What's the matter with them?
Come, Little Sheba, come back.<eos> Come back, Little Sheba.<eos> I remember being taken to this hospital in a padded limousine and a straitjacket.<eos> I should think you'd try to forget it.<eos> If you talk about it enough, you do forget, so they tell me.<eos> No good burying it or being ashamed.<eos> I'm going in under my own steam now, that's what's important.<eos> I was never violent.<eos> I had quiet DTs.<eos> The noises were made by the caterpillars on the wall while I waited for them to turn into butterflies.
One day soon, you'll look in the mirror - much sooner than you think - and your hair will be grown out, and you'll be just like the ugly duckling.<eos> You'll be better than any of them, I promise.<eos> - Are you sure, Hans?<eos> - Very sure.<eos> You'd better run off to school.<eos> You're late now.<eos> - Bye, Hans.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> Cobbler, are my shoes ready?<eos> Yes, ma'am. I have them here.
Honest?<eos> I buy four or five a month.<eos> To get back to the main point... you achieve a kind of intimacy in all your pictures...<eos> Did you say all my pictures?<eos> Now that I think of it, I've seen eight or nine of them.<eos> Eight or nine. It seems to me I remember someone saying:<eos> "If you've seen one, you've seen them all."<eos> I did say some awful things that night, didn't I?<eos> No, I deserved them.<eos> Of course, I must admit I was pretty much upset by them.
- I stay about the same.<eos> You can't make them do the right thing... or the wrong thing.<eos> They're lazy.<eos> They do the easy thing.<eos> Just don't break out into a rash Joe.<eos> Saved by the bell.<eos> That is the story of my life.<eos> Once more, step by step.<eos> They steal two cars from an all day parking lot.<eos> One of them is the holdup car. It goes straight for the shack.
Noriko, take this up to Uncle.<eos> Is that okay with you?<eos> Some tea for you, Uncle.<eos> How old are you now, Noriko?<eos> Twenty-eight.<eos> - She's 28 now.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> About time to marry.<eos> Some women don't want to get married.<eos> Are you one of them?
Particularly in what he was before she knew him.<eos> Well, there's not much to tell.<eos> I was a shepherd like thousands of others in Judah.<eos> You slept out under the stars.<eos> Did you dream, David?<eos> What did you dream about?<eos> Surely a man is entitled to the privacy of his dreams.<eos> - Then they were of women.<eos> - Naturally. A whole procession of them. And every one of them ravishingly beautiful.<eos> I'm jealous of every one of them.
My wife and I have been here for 10 days and this is the first chance I've had to get away from her.<eos> I know what you mean, old-timer.<eos> Fall in!<eos> Explain to them that survivors will get parts in my next picture.<eos> Too flabby.<eos> Replace him.<eos> - What about that one?<eos> - My wife's brother.<eos> He serves with me under certain conditions.<eos> One of them is that he will not be exposed to danger.
-Kerstin...<eos> Have you forgotten how close friends we were?<eos> -A long time ago.<eos> -What about the others?<eos> I didn't want to let them down, but I didn't have a choice.<eos> -It's all your fault.<eos> -My fault?<eos> Which of the two girls are you in love with?<eos> -In love?<eos> -One of them called you "darling".
I spoiled it for you.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> I couldn't rise to the occasion, that was all.<eos> I've never tried so hard to be gay and made such a dismal mess of it.<eos> I get 10 points for trying.<eos> I did try.<eos> Hello, moon.<eos> I'm looking for the Pleiades, the Seven Sisters but these girls aren't out tonight.<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> There they are, God bless them. All in a bunch going home from their little bridge party.
[Man Narrating] Medieval England... the early years of the reign of Edward I.<eos> A troubled land in those days.<eos> Her great feudal fortress castles, born in that uneasy time... stand now as stately monuments... to how unyielding were the enmities that caused their building.<eos> More than two centuries have passed... since the Norman conquests have brought the last infusion... of what was one day to be English blood.<eos> Yet, the bitterness between the Norman conqueror and the Saxon conquered... lay still unhealed.<eos> It had separated the neighboring great houses of Bulaire and Gurnie... by far more than the scant few miles that lay between them... in those days that began with the death of Rauf...
A sword and shining armor.<eos> You'd have been proud of him. He looked more beautiful than ever.<eos> Except those knightly vows. You didn't think to say those over, did you, Walter?<eos> - What's the matter with you?<eos> - Your father would have been proud of you.<eos> Your grandfather too.<eos> He was a credit to them.<eos> The way you looked anyway.<eos> Why don't you ever wear your father's boots?<eos> You'd look well in them.
It was easy.<eos> But if I'd known you were going to get your moldy old ship captured by a gang of cutthroats, I'd have stayed in Boston.<eos> Stowaway, eh?<eos> Put her in the boat with the other women.<eos> Pulled away.<eos> Then she'll have to go in the longboat with them.<eos> And get going before I change my mind and make you swim back to New Orleans.<eos> Come on, you...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I've got two dresses in that boat and I'm not leaving without them.
Why, you're just a kid yourself.<eos> - So long, Marie.<eos> - Goodbye, Ann.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let's you and me get acquainted, honey.<eos> You may be a number to the others but not to me.<eos> Sit down in this chair.<eos> It's kind of roomy.<eos> You like the stuff in here, huh?<eos> Just little presents from my girls for taking good care of them.
Now as it nears the moon, that planet's gravitational field begins to pull it toward it.<eos> Can't hear you, Woody!<eos> No air remember.<eos> Turn on your aerial!<eos> Hey, no brakes on this thing!<eos> I'm going to crash!<eos> How do I land?<eos> Very simple. Just reverse the takeoff.<eos> But what about the wings?<eos> Can't use them. The moon has no air.
Isn't that what you said?<eos> Now, look. Your beliefs are your own business until you start pumping them into my patients, then they become my business.<eos> Where did you get these ideas anyway?<eos> Is it your burning ambition to marry rich?<eos> (STAMMERING) Is that all, Doctor?<eos> Do you want this job permanently?<eos> Well, you act as though it's a temporary stopgap for you.<eos> Your typing, your filing, all your desk work haven't improved one iota in the two weeks you've been here.<eos> Well, why don't you do something about it?<eos> Now, I don't want to irritate you by bringing up your personal standards again, but you're letting them slop over into your work, Leonora.
What's going on?<eos> MISS RICE WORKER 1948<eos> I'll marry the prettiest girl. What do I get if I vote for you?<eos> Come here. Come here, Greta Garbo!<eos> She had to end up like this, with a criminal.<eos> We can't abandon Silvana.<eos> You can still save her. Me? Luckily I'm a civilian now.<eos> I can go wherever I want. There are tons of people at the farm.<eos> Tell them. It's hard for me. The girls treat me as if I were one of them.<eos> I would have to explain everything, tell them what I've done.
Please.<eos> Well, all right, seeing that you're a hero.<eos> Can't refuse a hero.<eos> And up we go.<eos> - Now how's that?<eos> High enough?<eos> - That's fine.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Now, then, you've got to do something for me in return.<eos> I brought you some pills and I want you to take them.
Pete would have to turn up today.<eos> I sure miss seeing that guy.<eos> Me too, and I work with him all day long.<eos> Pete! ─ Hiya, Penny.<eos> Jealous, Papy?<eos> I know I'm a grump and not been around for months, but do you still love me?<eos> Say, what's different? What's happened?<eos> Your hair. Whatever happened to those little-biddy curls?<eos> You always said you didn't like them ─ Well, I don't.<eos> But I miss them.
I never had me a governor before.<eos> I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> Evening, Annabelle.<eos> You look real smart.<eos> I look awful.<eos> You needn't tell me, I know I do.<eos> My hair's half done.<eos> But I found out in the beauty shop today just how much it means to be a senator's wife in this town!<eos> They gave my appointment to Dan Reynolds' new lady friend.<eos> Dan's lady friends last such a short time that folks are obliged to be polite to them.
The ending was weak.<eos> "The Duke's Bride."<eos> If you don't like it when you're through with it, bring it back.<eos> - I've decided on this one.<eos> - Here's five of them, Mr. Grace.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Oh, just a minute.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Grace.<eos> "To my loving wife and children:<eos> "Give my girls my love and a kiss. "Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night...
The Yayoi Hotel in Kanda.<eos> A while ago...<eos> You're a fool.<eos> I'll make her talk right away.<eos> I went too far.<eos> After all, this case<eos> involves a pistol Yusa's carrying, which someone stole from me.<eos> That's why...<eos> My gun has already injured two people.<eos> One of them's dead.
Thousands of people.<eos> Mind the steps.<eos> The great idol Dagon will be a fiery furnace.<eos> They'll humble you before him.<eos> They'll bind you between the two sacred columns and scourge you.<eos> Two columns?<eos> Does the house of the temple stand on two columns?<eos> Hurry, Samson.<eos> Egypt has a thousand temples, each more beautiful...<eos> Two columns so close I may be bound between them?
- Do you want to rest, Son?<eos> - Yeah, I guess so.<eos> Looks like I sort of gummed things up.<eos> We've always been able to handle our share of troubles.<eos> Look at the mail today.<eos> Must be hundreds of letters here from people all over the country.<eos> - Don't you wanna look at them?<eos> - No.<eos> Well, if people are nice enough to write them, you should read them.<eos> If you like them so much, why don't you read them yourself?
Why are you here?<eos> Nothing yet.<eos> I dance a little.<eos> Was not invited.<eos> Banks, which is forgotten I Irish.<eos> He has nothing to do.<eos> I personally deleted his name from the list. -why?<eos> -You know.<eos> Disobeyed my orders.<eos> Vai in bad company and is not better than them. Devi lheenviar Ireland is weeks.
Yes, speaking.<eos> Indeed?<eos> Most interesting.<eos> Yes I'll ask him.<eos> What was it?<eos> They'd welcome the opportunity to interview you at the customs at Obaig.<eos> Why?<eos> You sent two cases of ammunition to the mainland with a note to say you were personally responsible<eos> I did.<eos> One of them contained six bottles of whisky.
Come in. Chicago in 20 minutes, gentlemen.<eos> All right. We're going to go over to the hotel and freshen up.<eos> Corning along? Thanks very much, but there are a couple of places I'd like to see and...<eos> Okay- But don't forget, the Century leaves at 4:00 and it doesn't wait.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll be there. - You sure?<eos> - You can count on me.<eos> You can't count on him, Dick!<eos> For weeks he's been promising us the lyrics for the love song.<eos> And if we don't get them, we have no love song.
And my voices have said nothing.<eos> If only my voices would speak to me again.<eos> If they would tell me what I should do then I could sleep at night and accept what comes to me but they are silent.<eos> I asked again and again.<eos> Must I remain with the King and his household?<eos> Busy with the nothings that fill these days?<eos> If my voices do not answer, I cannot stay here.<eos> I must arm again and find the enemy and fight as before.<eos> Let my voices speak to me if this is wrong.<eos> Let them speak to me now.
Very good.<eos> Isn't it, Miss Spinney ?<eos> Yes, I think you have something there, Adam.<eos> - Do you know why I like it ?<eos> - Why ?<eos> Its the quality of the girl which reminds me of long ago.<eos> And there's ought to be something timeless about a woman.<eos> Something eternal.<eos> You can see it all the great portraits of the past.<eos> They make you feel you could meet those women anywhere and be inspired by them.
No, I'm not angry. Maybe curious, but not angry. I should be, I suppose, but I'm not.<eos> I suppose I ought to be. I'm not even angry about George, just sorry.<eos> There's so many things I don't understand.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I thought I had a good life here... but your going away doesn't make it seem good anymore.<eos> I've sort of joined your team... and I don't look forward to being without you.<eos> When I leave here, you're off my team. Lucky to be.<eos> I've got the Indian sign on me. It seems I can't win. I got to start out, prove who killed them.<eos> Won't you be leaving your fingerprints wherever you go?<eos> The doctor didn't change them.
Well, here.<eos> What's his name? Anne.<eos> Glad to know you, Anne.<eos> Mr. Bob.<eos> Mr. Bob!<eos> Better come right away, Mr. Bob.<eos> We got trouble in the chicken house.<eos> Those water pipes again?<eos> Busted wide open, and them hens is going crazy.<eos> Ten of them drowned already.
- You do love me, Jeffrey?<eos> - Yes, Juliana, yes.<eos> This afternoon I ran out of the house. Past St. Mark's, and the old man who sold the pairs.<eos> I tried to remember all the things we've said to each other. And how we felt.<eos> I remembered nothing.<eos> I was alone. And you had gone from me forever.<eos> I had to have something that was you.<eos> I went up to my room to get your letters.<eos> Not to read them... Just to hold them.<eos> And I came down here to be alone with them.
The post office receives thousands of these letters every year.<eos> I have further exhibits, but I hesitate to produce them.<eos> I'm sure we'll be very happy to see them.<eos> Yes, yes, produce them, Mr. Gailey.<eos> -But, Your Honor...<eos> -Put them here on the desk.<eos> -Put them here. -Yes, Your Honor.<eos> Your Honor! Your Honor!<eos> Your Honor, every one of these letters is addressed to Santa Claus.<eos> The post office has delivered them.
Won't you come in?<eos> You'll pardon me, I'm all disheveled. I haven't had time to brush up or do a thing.<eos> - Oh, what lovely roses.<eos> - From my garden.<eos> Oh, they're divine.<eos> - Louise. - Oui, Monsieur.<eos> Will you wrap these roses for Mme Grosnay?<eos> - You'll find paper in the drawer.<eos> Oh, no, you'll want them for yourself.<eos> Madame, I want them appreciated. I therefore give them to you.
There's nothing else as positive as that<eos> But I saw you go out wearing rain boots and it turned out to be a beautiful sunny day<eos> Weather isn't my business the radio can tell you that Welcome back<eos> Oh, welcome back I know it wasn't easy<eos> Nothing goes well His parents aren't there<eos> I wasted my time going to Chigasaki<eos> Besides, the train was full I got in through a window I didn't know the train fare went up Thanks, Tashiro<eos> What's he carrying?<eos> Potatoes.<eos> I bought them cheap by the station
I'd like to go.<eos> All right, where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Let's just go.<eos> I want you to play.<eos> For whom are you playing?<eos> I was thinking.<eos> From the mountains, the sea appeared so near.<eos> And now from the sea, the mountains seem so far away.<eos> I want them to seem that way.
My name's Rachel Michot.<eos> My friend and I are dancers.<eos> We don't go on until eleven. We're often in the promenade between nine and ten.<eos> Perhaps we'll encounter your good-looking friend there.<eos> And perhaps you will not.<eos> Now swallow your stolen drink and be on your away.<eos> Quickly.<eos> You're very successful with women. You must look after that.<eos> It might lead to something.<eos> In Paris it's through them one gets on most quickly.
Made up of stupid little people.<eos> Well... if anybody can do it, I'd lay eight to five you're the baby who can.<eos> And you'd win.<eos> Let's go downstairs and have a drink.<eos> With you and Gilda on my side-- You are on my side?<eos> - I told you that.<eos> - And Gilda?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Women are funny little creatures.<eos> I don't know much about them.

- Well, I am. Susan Bradley.<eos> Well, look, take this and go on back to Ohio.<eos> Nothing's happened except that a nice girl has had an interesting trip.<eos> Oh, wouldn't you love it if I went back to Ohio?<eos> Me and the other nice girls who came out here today!<eos> Well, they won't.<eos> Whatever you and the other cutthroats do, we won't.<eos> Listen to me. If anybody leaves here, it'll be you and your kind.<eos> Men who run gambling palaces and send lying letters to girls and sell a lot of liquor to drunkards.<eos> Before we're finished with this town, you'll swallow those letters you wrote and yes, I hope you choke on them, too!
Why wait?<eos> There's lots of ways to make money fast, if you use your head.<eos> Why didn't you wait, Steve?<eos> - It was late, and Trampas came by.<eos> You're not very particular.<eos> I passed by your herd, Trampas.<eos> My compliments on so many calves.<eos> Seems your cows have whole litters at a time, like a sow.<eos> What should I do about it?<eos> - I'd tell them to get back to nature.
I didn't mean that.<eos> - I don't aim to stay here.<eos> I'm going to move west some day, and do what the judge did here.<eos> Find new land in Utah and Nevada.<eos> Sounds fine.<eos> It wouldn't mean anything to me unless you were with me.<eos> Don't, please.<eos> - Don't what?<eos> - Spoil this.<eos> These rides have been perfect. And I want them to go on so.
Hello, Andrés.<eos> - Just passing by, I suppose.<eos> - No, I want to talk to you.<eos> Won't you make yourself at home?<eos> - Cigarette?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I'm sorry I can't offer anything better than these crude native cigarettes.<eos> That's all right.<eos> I've been smoking them for years.<eos> - Find them to my taste.
Look, Sister.<eos> There's Father O'Malley.<eos> I hope he finds him in a favorable mood.<eos> He could be.<eos> It's spring, you know.<eos> We're not getting anywhere, Father.<eos> It's a difficult decision, Mr. Bogardus... to decide that there'll be no more St. Mary's.<eos> If you ask me, it's not much now.<eos> It is to the sisters.<eos> To you, that school is just a piece of property... but to them, well, it's everything.
You see, I am an archaeologist.<eos> And this island was the great find of my life.<eos> Such treasures. Antiquities dating back to Homer.<eos> But I paid for them with my uneasy conscience.<eos> Unwittingly I have turned good, simple people into grave robbers.<eos> The fault is mine.<eos> The legal guilt is theirs and must be reported to the authorities.<eos> But all this was in the past.<eos> 15 years ago, I saw the wrong and gave up selling these things.<eos> It is enough now for me to live with them.
-No, I'm a farmer.<eos> A farmer.<eos> What a night in heaven.<eos> -You're a friend of Emily's, ain't you?<eos> -That's right.<eos> -My name's McGee.<eos> -My name's Wayne Frake.<eos> -You in the music business?<eos> -Yeah, I'm a song plugger. I work on songs till they get popular.<eos> "Work on them"? I thought songs got popular because people like them.
What do you say if we have another séance and really put our shoulders to the wheel?<eos> Make it a real rouser. If we're not very careful, she'll materialize a hockey team.<eos> Charles, I implore you not to let her have another séance.<eos> Now listen, Madame Arcati, before you go into any further trances... I think we should discuss the situation a little.<eos> Good. An excellent idea.<eos> Well, fire away, Mr. Condomine.<eos> Well, my wives and I have been talking it over... and they're both still absolutely convinced that I somehow or other called them back.<eos> Very natural.<eos> And I'm equally convinced that I did not.<eos> Well, neither of them could have appeared unless there had been somebody - some psychic subject - in the house who wished for them.
She has always done her duty, if there was a sick person to go visit ...<eos> With good weather ... or in bad weather.<eos> And then the mountains he loved so much.<eos> And if his death has been cruel For someone who loves the mountains is the most beautiful way to die.<eos> Returning from a long absence in Switzerland ...<eos> He wanted to climb the Matterhorn ... as he did every year.<eos> She was young, she was beautiful, was well liked by all ...<eos> And ... was going to be happy at all marrying the man she loved.<eos> A man worthy of her, a worker.<eos> But the mountains are countered cruelly the good that she wanted them.
- You'll have to.<eos> Know anything about hops?<eos> - Not a thing.<eos> Most of the hands are in the fields today.<eos> You'd better stay here this morning.<eos> You can put your bag in that shed.<eos> Sue tells me you had a frightening experience last night.<eos> Wasn't frightening.<eos> It was just unpleasant. - Hmm.<eos> I thought so. It's happened to other girls. None of them died.
It was Nick's idea to name your boy Alec, wasn't it? Yes.<eos> He insisted.<eos> Oh, don't let him send the boy away, please.<eos> I don't send those daisies to myself.<eos> I don't.<eos> And Alec's dead.<eos> He couldn't send them to me.<eos> Do you know why I pictured you with daisies?<eos> Because I love you.<eos> Because Alec loved you too, he thought of them.
She will wake when the sun is up and begin to look after her house.<eos> No, this.<eos> Always this.<eos> Always the fire and the dark night, the supper we've cooked and you here against my heart.<eos> Sail with me now and never return to Navron.<eos> Sail with you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Perhaps one day you will regret it.<eos> I know what I have to offer can never compensate what you give up.<eos> Women would wonder for a time and play at adventure, but in the end, instinct is too strong for them.
- There's a war on, you know.<eos> Yes, I found that out.<eos> Bring us whatever you have...<eos> anything but hash.<eos> Bravo, signor.<eos> You will be very happy. You'll see.<eos> What are you looking so depressed about?<eos> My life is an endless series of disappointments... no steak, nobody loves me.<eos> You wouldn't think so if you'd heard the kids when I told them you were in town.<eos> I can't figure out just what special charm you have for them.
Don't kid yourself.<eos> I'm no Tim.<eos> I joined up because Top Hat suddenly seemed a little silly and I wanted to have some fun and excitement.<eos> I laughed up my sleeve at all the fellows who were giving out with noble motives, the Four Freedoms, and all the rest of it, but I found out that it all added up to a simple corny phrase that I couldn't laugh off...<eos> "Home sweet home."<eos> - I know.<eos> - You do know?<eos> You're doing a swell job here at home holding things together.<eos> Those daughters of yours, they're pretty wonderful.<eos> I know Tim's going to be mighty pleased with them.
To top it all, he lost his foreman.<eos> You mean he quit on him?<eos> No.<eos> He was shot.<eos> Shot in the back by a bullet... from the same caliber rifle as got Red.<eos> Got any ideas?<eos> No, except the man you just pistol-whipped is in on it somewhere.<eos> It's a pity you didn't kill him when you had the chance.<eos> Say, it doesn't sound like it's going to be so easy... on those women at the KC.<eos> Want to go back and work for them?
Who was it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You mean you won't tell.<eos> I mean I don't know!<eos> Why should I lie to you?<eos> Reckon you forgot something.<eos> You just fired me.<eos> Rock, he got away, but guess... what.<eos> You guess.<eos> For a man that's got a despise for women, you sure do get all snaggled up with them.
- Help him. Guide him.<eos> Use him.<eos> - The opportunity's past.<eos> - Then you must make another, at once.<eos> You realize that you should?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> - May I have Mr. Forrest's keys?<eos> - What do you want with them?<eos> He left me instructions to destroy sealed envelopes in the event of his death.<eos> - What was in them? - I've no idea, naturally.
great!<eos> That's what i like!<eos> First an hors-d'oeuvre then the main dish orlov knocked potemkin's eye out serves him right; i've spoiled them both too much<eos> i do not wish to be disturbed tonight of course not.<eos> The first evening... don't be so cheeky.<eos> Besides, it's the second evening<eos> first, a few sensible words together sensible?<eos> Must we?<eos> I could make you my adjutant-general.<eos> You will live in the apartment below very practical an empress has less time for her heart than other women yet she wants as much happiness as them will you stay?
Well, I wouldn't take the job if I didn't figure you owe me something.<eos> I'll start at 35 and find out if I'm worth 40.<eos> That's a deal.<eos> What do I do first?<eos> Take off your hat.<eos> Backstage at the Marquis Theatre.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> A day in the lives of 40 little bleached, arrested mentalities.<eos> It's a wonderful assignment.<eos> People like to know about them.
Waiting.<eos> Once, in Spain I waited two days for the fascist planes to exhaust themselves.<eos> I say finally to myself, if I must reach up with my naked hands I will stop them.<eos> It is such waiting for which I am not fit.<eos> You will not think that when the time comes.<eos> - It will go.<eos> - Of a certainty.<eos> But must it always be your hands?<eos> For each man, his own hands.<eos> He has to sleep with them.
You can't afford to lose your focus.<eos> No need to cry. There's nothing sad about it.<eos> This isn't good-bye forever.<eos> I'll go to Tokyo and wait for you to get out of school.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll be back together soon.<eos> All right?<eos> That's enough crying.<eos> I brought these since I won't see you for a while. Shirts, shorts, tissue paper, and three pairs of socks.<eos> Alternate the socks, and wash them now and then.
Oh, that's me all over.<eos> - How's Cassie?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> What do you mean you don't know?<eos> Well, Dr. Tower makes me use the side door<eos> - and I just don't see her.<eos> - I bet I'd find a way.<eos> You know, kid, if you don't go out after things in this world, you don't get anything.<eos> You never did come with me to see the Ross gals.<eos> I took them and Dudley Wright down to Whaley's pond just last week on a picnic.
I couldn't use a flash, could I? And also, with the weather...<eos> This close up is quite good... artistically speaking.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You won't be needing me again, Mr Decrey?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - At your service.<eos> I had the photos.<eos> One of them in particular hurt me.
YES, SIR.<eos> GOD SAVE THE QUEEN.<eos> DON'T LET IT UNNERVE YOU, OLD MAN.<eos> COME ON, BABBS.<eos> HIT UP SOME SIXES.<eos> YOU CAN DO IT.<eos> VERY WELL.<eos> LOOK.<eos> THERE ARE THE GIRLS.<eos> YES, BUT OLD SPETTIGUE IS WITH THEM.
Crack at the title and...<eos> No, I couldn't do it, Mr. Jordan.<eos> - I'd like to help, but not that way.<eos> - There is no other way.<eos> Do you think it's fair to put me in a spot like this?<eos> This is the evidence against your father, Miss Logan.<eos> These stocks were issued by his company.<eos> Look at them.<eos> Those stocks were issued while my father was in Europe.<eos> He had nothing to do with them.
If you'd have come next week, you'd have found three of your aunts here.<eos> Ellen is bringing her sisters back from London.<eos> What, the potty ones?<eos> ─ Potty?<eos> Queer as mice in a cage.<eos> Oh .. they are quite harmless. Especially when aunt Ellen is around.<eos> For comfort, they are coming to stay here for a few days.<eos> They seem to mean quite a great deal to your aunt Ellen.<eos> Oh, they would.<eos> She's looked after them since she was a kid.
He gave me this.<eos> It's all I have to remember him by.<eos> He was wrecked at sea.<eos> They were all drowned.<eos> It must have been a bit of sadness for you, Missy. Oh no.<eos> I've quite forgotten what he looked like.<eos> I saw a drowned man once. They took him out of the Thames. He was green.<eos> Frogs.<eos> There must be lots of frogs.<eos> We used to have such fun with them at home.
That is admirable, but it is your family and not mine.<eos> And let me tell you this. Your sisters, insane or not, have overstayed their welcome.<eos> I invite them here for two days and they've stayed six weeks. Or perhaps you were planning to keep them here forever?<eos> Well .. I had thought that .. That I might pay something out of my wages for their keep.<eos> Ellen, you're a hypocrite. You're worse, you're a cheat!<eos> You meant to foist your wretched brood on me and bleed me white.<eos> And when I saw through your scheme, you had the insolence to turn and abuse me.<eos> But you've chosen the wrong woman.<eos> You get those sisters of yours out of this house at once!<eos> And you take a month's wages and go with them!
She didn't see you, did she? ─ I couldn't avoid it.<eos> That was Sister Theresa.<eos> She's Miss Fiske's friend.<eos> She doesn't like us any more than Miss Fiske did. Oh, didn't Miss Fiske like you?<eos> Oh she was horrid to us.<eos> Louisa, run upstairs and change your dress.<eos> You won't want to sit around in your best all day.<eos> No, I shan't, shall I. No of course not.<eos> I don't want you to mention Miss Fiske again in front of my sisters. They quarrelled with her.<eos> And it upsets them very much to talk about her.
To be so shameless as to invade my house!<eos> But I threatened him with a purse in the face...<eos> She even threatened him with a purse in the face...<eos> She even threatened me with a purse in the face...<eos> What a big pair of shoes for you to fill!<eos> I´II go over to GrandeIa and buy some shoes to amuse myself a little bit.<eos> When he sees me, it´s like he´s seeing the devil! See you soon...<eos> What´s more, that girl isn´t right for you that is simply fundamental...<eos> Besides, you don´t know anything about women!<eos> You lower yourself too much, you squat before them!
- Sanctimonious old buzzard, ain't you?<eos> - It pays, don't it?<eos> - How's things?<eos> - Fine, Doc.<eos> Boys all set?<eos> - They're riding advance guard.<eos> - Just to see that nothing happens.<eos> - That's good.<eos> - Doc, I want to talk to you about my teeth.<eos> - What's the matter with them?
- What, have they discovered something new?<eos> - Well, no, it's not exactly new.<eos> People have been doing it for quite some time.<eos> Getting married, I mean.<eos> What's so funny about that?<eos> Pop says there's nothing funny about marriage.<eos> Just ask the man who owns one.<eos> You're a very sweet child, Susie.<eos> You'll make a wonderful father-in-law.<eos> As a matter of fact, I've examined my intentions toward Sheila and strangely enough, I find them to be perfectly honorable.
Or what?<eos> Or we can't go on.<eos> I think you're right.<eos> I don't think I shall ever be heart and soul with your convictions.<eos> I'm not going to argue with you about it.<eos> Women don't know anything about politics.<eos> Oh, let's forget it.<eos> If I was rude, I'm sorry.<eos> But you know these things are awfully important to me.<eos> But you needn't bother your head about them.
Excellent. I shall put it to good use.<eos> If what I've done has pleased Your Grace, I have a favor to ask.<eos> That our contributions induce you to begin work on the fleet.<eos> -Fleet. Must I listen to that from you, too?<eos> -The Armada, Your Grace.<eos> -Are you so sure that Phillip will attack?<eos> -Have you any assurance that he won't?<eos> With all the contributions of the Sea Hawks... we cannot possibly match Phillip's vast resources.<eos> Our safety lies in diplomacy, not force.<eos> Madam, suppose Phillip's vast resources, or at least a large portion of them... were not to reach him? Were to be, shall I say, diverted?
Only God can forgive.<eos> They stole my crucifix, Cambreau.<eos> Without it, I'm lost.<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> A crucifix is a piece of wood, Telez, only a piece of wood.<eos> The miracle is not in the wood, but in the heart.<eos> - But I've prayed, I've prayed.<eos> - And your prayers were only words.<eos> Like your crucifix, they found no way to your heart.<eos> Telez, the bread stood between them and your heart.
And we'll see who is smarter, me, or that old cunning rat of a widow.<eos> - Who might that be?<eos> - It's me, of course!<eos> Of course!<eos> That's why you're my goddaughter.<eos> There you go.<eos> Since you left Maria da Luz you always win.<eos> - Unhappy in love...<eos> - I was tired of her.<eos> When it comes to cars and women we have to be able to trust them.
Miss Melly's a fool, but not the kind you think.<eos> She has too much honor to conceive of dishonor in anyone she loves.<eos> And she loves you.<eos> Though just why she does, I'm sure I don't know.<eos> If you weren't so drunk and insulting, I could explain everything.<eos> - As it is, though...<eos> - You get out of that chair once more...<eos> Of course, the comic figure in all this is the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes. Mr. Wilkes, who can't be mentally faithful to his wife... and won't be unfaithful to her technically.<eos> - Why doesn't he make up his mind?<eos> Observe my hands, my dear. I could tear you to pieces with them.
We'II find our friends.<eos> If a search party's going, I insist on coming.<eos> A penny for your thoughts.<eos> Oh, as a matter of fact, I was thinking of you.<eos> kindly, I hope.<eos> I see very little of ladies at BrookfieId.<eos> I was rather realizing what I missed.<eos> If I may say so, I think the ladies have missed a great deal too.<eos> It's very kind of you, but I'm not a ladies' man.<eos> -Afraid of them? -Terrified.
I think it would be a wonderful idea to have a national boys camp out in our state.<eos> If we could get the poor kids off the streets for a few months every summer and let them learn something about nature and American ideals.<eos> What would this set the government back?<eos> Nothing at all.<eos> My idea is that the government lends us the money and then the boys pay it back by sending pennies and nickels.<eos> The government's got enough on its hands already without...<eos> That's great.<eos> The government's putting dough in too many places.<eos> Senator, what do you think of the girls in this town?<eos> Four of them came up and kissed me when I got off the train.
50,000 telegrams demanding that he yield this floor.<eos> I invite the Senate to read them.<eos> I invite my colleague to read them.<eos> The people's answer to Mr Jefferson Smith.<eos> Stop, Jeff, stop!<eos> I guess this is just another lost cause, Mr Paine.<eos> All you people don't know about lost causes.<eos> Mr Paine does.<eos> He said once they were the only causes worth fighting for.<eos> And he fought for them for the only reason any man ever fights for them.
Uh, Kidley... Kornbostle, Kreutzenheimer.<eos> I was certain that was here a moment ago.<eos> Knoodle, Kneck, Kidley, Kornbostle.<eos> I can't understand it.<eos> [Man] Breathe in, breathe out.<eos> Breathe in, breathe out.<eos> Good.<eos> Very good.<eos> Yeah, but Doctor, I'm worried about those three white spots.<eos> I am not worried about them.
"Is this the face that wrecked a thousand ships...<eos> "... and burned the towerless tops of Ilium?<eos> "Farewell, fair Helen!"<eos> Can they make me leave town when I don't want to go?<eos> - Do I have to go?<eos> - Dallas, don't you go makin' no fuss.<eos> Do I have to go, Doc, just because they say so?<eos> Now Dallas, I've got my orders.<eos> Don't blame these ladies.<eos> - It ain't them. - It is them!
- The darlings.<eos> Hello, beautiful.<eos> Pay no attention to him.<eos> He's just a flirt.<eos> I get the next dance, Mom.<eos> No, you don't, wise guy.<eos> I got the next five reserved.<eos> Go on, both of you.<eos> Quarreling over me when there's all these young girls around.<eos> You're just as young as any of them, sweetheart.
Yes, that reminds me, professor.<eos> - I'd like to talk it over with you.<eos> - By all means.<eos> Oh, a huddle just for the two of you, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Got any objections?<eos> By all means.<eos> Would you like to have tea served in the boudoir?<eos> Rocks, may I remark that your jokes are slightly unhumorous tonight?<eos> Oh, you don't like them, huh?
She has done naught but good all her life.<eos> MORSE:<eos> Silence. You all know I speak the truth.<eos> There"s not one of you but has had some token of her kindness.<eos> What right have you to speak?<eos> This wench has no place here.<eos> I have as much as you, Mr. Cheeves.<eos> I beg you, sirs, do not send Rebecca Nurse to her death on the testimony of a man who tried to steal her land and did not succeed.<eos> He says his cows went dry.<eos> Who knows but it was time for them to go dry?
You don't let strangers approach you.<eos> You look at your fellow passengers.<eos> And especially: You don't ever pretend to be something you're not.<eos> That never ends well.<eos> -Never!<eos> Keep that in mind from now on.<eos> -Exactly, Mary Berry! And Jane Berry! From Middletown.<eos> Have a safe journey, and a good arrival. And good night.<eos> Well, the case is done.<eos> You'll treat the ladies with attentiveness, anticipate their every wish and you'll help them with getting off the train tomorrow morning. Good night.
Don't worry, I'm checking out of this hotel for keeps.<eos> I've got a job for him, he'll make good.<eos> I will, if they let me.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> Goodbye and good luck, Taylor.<eos> The old cell won't seem like home without you.<eos> Here's your socks, I washed them for you.<eos> Thanks. keep them.<eos> Don't forget what I told you about dames.<eos> Lay off them, tempt you like a fruit cake.
I wonder if it would be asking too much if I could have a trifle on account...<eos> Certainly, how much?<eos> Well, I thought perhaps a couple of pounds?<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Yes, it would be a great pity if you hadn't any money.<eos> Counseling costs a great deal, you know?<eos> However, perhaps you've got some friends who will come to your rescue at the last minute.<eos> - Your case next, Mr. Briggs. - Ah?<eos> Oh, dear...<eos> Oh, dear me, I just mislaid my glasses. You know, I'm quite lost without them.
Waiting by a church.<eos> The caravan moves out into the desert.<eos> It is day, but not like other days.<eos> The wind is rising.<eos> It drowns out the music of the church.<eos> The desert is angry.<eos> There is a palanquin... such as the great sheiks use to carry their women.<eos> - Am I to be carried off?<eos> - I don´t know.<eos> But there are two people, and one of them is you.
He didn't seem very happy about my presents, oui?<eos> Anna, men who keep books are never very happy.<eos> Marie, you go out for a while.<eos> He is my maid tonight.<eos> Go, go, go, go.<eos> - Oh, I am, am I?<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> Later, I count the diamonds in the bracelet and necklace and kiss you for each one.<eos> What about the orchids?<eos> Don't I get anything for them?
- You're welcome, Noah.<eos> - Lawd, it's wonderful.<eos> I sort of like it.<eos> I likes the way you handled the ship, too.<eos> - Was you watching me, Lawd?<eos> - Every minute.<eos> - What's the orders now?<eos> - Is all the animals safe?<eos> They's fine and dandy.<eos> Then open the starboard door and leave them out.
- Why did you help her? - l didn't know what she was doing.<eos> That's right, you wouldn't.<eos> Get this off.<eos> That's what you get for picking up strange women.<eos> Well, we got rid of 'em, didn't we?<eos> Pardon me while I go and clean myself up.<eos> Alf, entertain the ladies while I'm gone.<eos> We'll be right back, Alice.<eos> After this we'd better go home and see if our wives are sorry...<eos> Don't worry about them, let them worry about us.
- Who lives up that road?<eos> - Doctor Samuel A. Mudd.<eos> - Shall we try him?<eos> - Sure, we'll try everybody.<eos> It's certain he got help from somebody.<eos> - What about him?<eos> - Arrest him. Take him to Washington.<eos> But, I tell you it was not a question of slavery and never was.<eos> It was a question of states' rights.<eos> The constitution of the United States laid down certain fundamental truths. One of them was that the individual state had a right to secede at any time.
- Mary.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Come here a minute, will you?<eos> You're taking a long chance, Blackie.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe I got an ace or two in the hole, too.<eos> - Oh, Mr. Burley.<eos> - Good morning, Miss Blake.<eos> - I'd like to thank you for the lovely roses.<eos> - I'm so glad you liked them.
Didn't even answer when I spoke to you out there.<eos> How'd I know who you meant when you said "darling"?<eos> Who'd you think I meant, the captain?<eos> I've been doing all the work. My face is sore from smiling.<eos> Why don't you sit down and rest your face?<eos> No one's looking.<eos> I'll rest in my own cabin, thanks.<eos> Get some things out of here, if you don't mind.<eos> Oh, I hope my dresses aren't crushed.<eos> I'd die if anything happened to them.
- John wouldn't approve of that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> He says it's best not to think of such places and the wickedness that goes on.<eos> Why not listen now before he comes back?<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> Is it true that the ladies paint their toenails?<eos> Some of them.<eos> - Do London ladies look beautiful?<eos> - They do.<eos> But they wouldn't if you were beside them.
Nothing's been stolen from the Air Ministry.<eos> But you heard those men say he'd got and there he is!<eos> Shall we take him now or wait till the interval? What are you going to do?<eos> There's nothing missing. There's an end to it.<eos> Hear that tune?<eos> It's that damn thing I couldn't get out of my head.<eos> Now I know where I've heard it before. The music hall - Annabella...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, with your kind attention and permission,<eos> I have now the honour to present to you one of the most remarkable men in the world. It's the same little man.<eos> Every day he commits to memory 50 new facts, and remembers every one of them!
A sharp knife in the hands of any intelligent person... could accomplish the same thing.<eos> Many intelligent persons afraid even to touch sharp knife.<eos> Bullet near heart removed?<eos> Professor Thurston explained last night... that it had nothing to do with Arnold's death.<eos> So sorry.<eos> Memory very bad sometimes.<eos> You have a theory about this, of course.<eos> Theory like mist on eyeglasses... obscures facts.<eos> Our local authorities have very clear vision, Mr. Chan.<eos> - You'll find them most helpful.
Well, it's cool, clear and clean.<eos> Put a stream like that alongside any river out here dirty, yellow, muddy you'll see the difference.<eos> That was only a few years ago.<eos> The pirates killed every white person aboard except the captain, and then scuttled the ship.<eos> Better take care of these pearls in case of a piracy. Why?<eos> They're artificial.<eos> They're not worth anything.<eos> Twelve and a half bucks.<eos> A bargain, I'd say.<eos> Where did you get them, Mr. Timmons? - She picked them up...
...Dauville in her repertoire.<eos> - Chopin, go ahead.<eos> "I'm Not Like Them."<eos> Work yourself up, cutie !<eos> "There are complicated women, With whom it's hard to get started"<eos> "There are distinguished ladies, who want to be treated like whores"<eos> "Others need to be drugged With champagne or cocaine"<eos> "Others need to be beaten"<eos> "All those women are cold bitches"<eos> "Me, I'm not at all like them"
Now, I want to have all the plans here immediately.<eos> Get me the new half model, will you, Mr. Snow?<eos> 0h, Baird, see that the mold loft is ready so that we can make it start next week. Aye.<eos> Are you building just the one ship, Mr. Barr?<eos> No, five.<eos> But the first ship must be ready for her trials in four months time.<eos> I want to get the lines drawn immediately.<eos> Give me the estimates.<eos> The estimates? Alright.<eos> I saw them just now.
"Beware, Mr. Citizen, of the Greshams and their kind.<eos> "Beware of foreign bonds that are not worth the paper they're written on.<eos> "Foreign flypaper, that's what these bonds are."<eos> Hey, you know, that's a pretty neat touch there, that "foreign flypaper," don't you think?<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> I encounter so many neat touches.<eos> Well, this'll put a damper on Gresham's Taronian bonds.<eos> Are you sure they ought to have a damper put on them?<eos> Maybe they're good bonds.<eos> No, they couldn't be with that crook Gresham handling them.
So that the guns shan't go hungry?<eos> Is that the idea?<eos> Oh, but disease has nothing to do with it.<eos> Disease has everything to do with it.<eos> War is a disease- homicidal mania on the grand scale... brought on by fear and jealousy.<eos> We know all that, but can't you understand?<eos> Has it ever occurred to you that there are women in the world about to become mothers?<eos> That's just sentiment.<eos> Why generalize?<eos> Because I happen to be one of them.
I missed you.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> -Put a head on this, will you?<eos> A couple of glasses.<eos> Here's looking, Lily.<eos> How's things, baby?<eos> Let's me and you take a little walk over by the quarry, huh?<eos> Come on in, Cragg.<eos> -Hey, cobbler, when do I get my shoes?<eos> -When you pay for them.
I hope you find him better.<eos> Thank you, ma'am. God bless you.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Mrs. March, will you sign this so I can get it off?<eos> Why, what's the matter?<eos> When I see things like that poor old man it makes me ashamed to think how little I do.<eos> But, my dear, you're doing all you can here, and your husband is there. Yes, I know.<eos> His last son is lying ill, miles away waiting to say goodbye to him, forever perhaps while I have my four girls to comfort me.<eos> And a real comfort they are, too, aren't they?<eos> I couldn't bear it without them.
Anne-Marie, you are as the nymphs.<eos> Like them, you are lissom and could frolic in mossy glades, drink at the springs, dance naked in the moonlit summer nights.
Perhaps it's hard for a woman to understand.<eos> A little.<eos> I just realised that I've seen but one woman since I've been here.<eos> For instance, where are the wives of all these natives?<eos> Back country, in the villages.<eos> They've got to sign on without them.<eos> You mean you don't allow wives on your plantation?<eos> Women don't belong here, white or native.<eos> If they're white, they can't stand the gaffe.<eos> If they're native, one of them is bound to drift from the coolies' quarters, and end up waiting on you at breakfast.
Maybe my pen will do?<eos> Yes, this will work.<eos> Enters through the window...<eos> You sneak by the doors...<eos> You slowly approaches...<eos> The two women are facing each other.<eos> You are approaching slowly. Very slowly.<eos> So not to be seen or heard.<eos> The two women are facing each other. You come from behind!<eos> One of them yells:
I drank the rum they'd brought.<eos> It was very sweet and spicy.<eos> Then, one night, they left, and I went out on the pier.<eos> I looked at that fine three-master sailing into the sun<eos> towards the Leeward Islands.<eos> Since then, I've been under a spell.<eos> Was there a woman on the boat?<eos> I knew you wouldn't understand.<eos> Is it the islands, then?<eos> I'd prefer never to go there, but to keep them as I imagined them.
But that's entirely ir-elephant to what I was talking about.<eos> We took pictures of the native girls, but they weren't developed.<eos> But we're going back again in a couple of weeks and we...<eos> - Very enlightening speech, Captain.<eos> - Hooray for Captain Spalding.<eos> Three cheers for Captain Spalding!<eos> Three cheers for Captain Spalding!<eos> Three cheers...<eos> - No one asked for the chairs.<eos> Put them right where you got them. Go on.
It's Indian country.<eos> Except for the trappers, never a white man has left his track there.<eos> Only one trading post in that whole country.<eos> Who owns it?<eos> A Missouri trapper owns it.<eos> Hey, mister, will you tell me this... Hey, hey, there.<eos> Since you all elected me the he-coon of this outfit, let me do the talking.<eos> It's everything a Missourian's heart could crave.<eos> There's two snow-capped mountain ranges with peaks lost in the sky.<eos> And between them ranges, men, is a great valley.
I see it! - Another condom?<eos> - Please help.<eos> - Robbers?<eos> - You!<eos> Ada, did you pick up the key?<eos> It's there!<eos> I see it. - I can't move my leg!<eos> - I'll get it. - Oh, careful.<eos> - Wait! Don't you come down here!<eos> I can see it from here. I'll pick it up. Stay there.
Is he watching television?<eos> Maybe he's in Brazil and doesn't know what's happened.<eos> The old man who did this job before me had Indian ways.<eos> He could stand so quiet. His heels together like a little dancer<eos> The world's gone crazy.<eos> My Father, who art in Heaven... Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done...<eos> Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.<eos> Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.<eos> Amen.<eos> In 1990 the space age will enter it's 2nd phase and our hopes in it to preserve the peace to make sure that in this great new sea as on earth, the United States is second to none.
- What's his name again?<eos> - Tom Townsend.<eos> No, I think it was something else.<eos> No, it's Tom Townsend, I'm sure.<eos> He looks familiar.<eos> He's the guy that was sitting at the table behind ours without talking to anyone all evening.<eos> Then, outside, he got the cab that we were trying to flag down.<eos> But he insisted that we take it, so Nick insisted that he come along too... so that there should be no ill feeling.<eos> What it shows is that a kind of belief is innate in all of us.<eos> At some point most of us lose that... after which it can only be regained by a conscious act of faith.
Not the gondola, not the gondola.<eos> - I want you.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> - I'm thirsty.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> - I'm hungry.<eos> - Me, too. Copycat!<eos> Undo my skirt!<eos> - Right away.<eos> - It's undone.
Don't come back from the grave and seek revenge on me!<eos> They behead people at noon It's now the middle of the night<eos> Some official's son got in trouble and they're looking for a substitute<eos> At night the executioner can't tell one from another<eos> Is there no justice in the world?<eos> Is there no reward for being a good man?<eos> It is of no concern to me<eos> I was always an honest man I'll give you whatever I can<eos> This painting was a gift from my dearest one<eos> I don't want to part with it even in death
Ok.<eos> Next letter.<eos> Uh... "D. " Mm-hmm.<eos> That's right. Circle around at the midguideline to the bottom guideline, and straight up... And down.<eos> Oop! That's ok.<eos> It's looking better.<eos> That's right.<eos> And "R. "<eos> That jacket.<eos> Something wrong with it?
Next letter.<eos> Uh... "D. " Mm-hmm.<eos> That's right. Circle around at the midguideline to the bottom guideline, and straight up... And down.<eos> Oop! That's ok.<eos> It's looking better.<eos> That's right.<eos> And "R. "<eos> That jacket.<eos> Something wrong with it?<eos> It's had it. It's coming out at the elbows.
They were many, but we kicked...<eos> We fought well.<eos> Were you seen?<eos> In this you must never lapse.<eos> Even those who would be... our allies would not understand.<eos> Our domain is the shadow.<eos> tray from it reluctantly.<eos> For when you do, you must... strike hard and fade away... Without a trace.<eos> I lost a sai.<eos> Then it is gone.
Okay, let's make some noise.<eos> Try to distract them.<eos> Fresh meat!<eos> Wait.<eos> This one's not falling for it.<eos> This one ain't dumb.<eos> He's trying to trick us.<eos> Use your bomb.<eos> It's our last one.<eos> What else you going use it for?
Yes.<eos> My teacher asked us to deliver something.<eos> There is a letter.<eos> He said to read the letter before opening the gift.<eos> Where's the letter?<eos> The letter must be handed to you personally. No, Master Lam.<eos> Get the letter.<eos> Hurry UP!<eos> What's the matter, where did you keep it?<eos> It's gone!
Yeah, come on in.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Your paper.<eos> Lovely place you have.<eos> I got Keith out as soon as I could, but it was too late.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What is it with this leash?<eos> Why is it so valuable?<eos> Well, it's an aboriginal piece.<eos> Uh, it was known as the, uh, "Leash of Dreams."
Come on!<eos> Let me go!<eos> Let's get him out of here.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I've got it.<eos> The guy was out of his mind.<eos> He was in pain over the loss of his wife, and then pushed all the way into madness by the loss of his dog.<eos> I think he just never grew up.<eos> He felt incomplete without someone to depend on.<eos> Jack, if this leash is really cursed, what did he gain from it?
He can take it.<eos> Not this time.<eos> No...!<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Micki.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I think so.<eos> My leg!<eos> It got healed in the transfer.
- Do you know the wonderful thing?<eos> - Later.<eos> - Guess where l got it from.<eos> - Later.<eos> Shhh!<eos> (Coded knock on door)<eos> - l got it from Myrtle.<eos> - Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Right.<eos> Oh, you can still smell her scent on it.
Er, no, Jeeves.<eos> That was one of those erm...whatsit questions.<eos> - Rhetorical, sir?<eos> - Right, yes.<eos> Now, hearing him attacked, my cousin Angela's heart will become as sick as mud, the maternal tigress in her will awaken.<eos> No matter what differences they've had, she will remember that he is the man she loves and leap to his defence.<eos> From there to falling into his arms is but a step.<eos> So how do you react to that, Jeeves?<eos> The idea is an ingenious one, sir.<eos> Well, we Woosters are ingenious, noted for it.
I mean...one hardly knows whether to smile or weep, what?<eos> You consider total abstinence to be a handicap in a gentleman wishing to make a proposal of marriage?<eos> Dash it, Jeeves.<eos> Use your intelligence.<eos> Were it not for the grape and the grain, weddings would be a thing of the past.<eos> Proposals but a dim memory.<eos> Without it, Jeeves, we'd babble.<eos> Thank you, Jeeves.<eos> Only active measures promptly applied can prevent this poor poop Fink-Nottle from babbling about newts again.<eos> Which is why I intend to secure a bottle of gin and lace his luncheon orange juice with it.
Is that why you've been snooping and irritating my life?<eos> And I'll keep on doing it until I find out otherwise. Mister,<eos> I've fought from one end of this world to the other and I ain't never used no kids to fight my battles. Do you realize what I am?<eos> I am an American Marine, sir! Yeah, I play hard.<eos> But I don't break the law.<eos> And to think that I might need some help is an insult. Do you read me? No, sir.<eos> I don't.<eos> I just figured out what your problem is.<eos> You're a soft-bellied idealist who looks at hard discipline as a crime against mankind.<eos> Discipline's only a crime when it's enforced by somebody with the sensitivity and judgment of a rock. Yeah.
Why not?<eos> Why don't you wear it at dinner tonight, Maude?<eos> Oh... It's set in one of the most hideous necklaces you've ever seen!<eos> George's always promising to have the Eastern reset, but it's never been done.<eos> You'll have to wind that up again, Hugo.<eos> Thank you, Maurice.<eos> You ought to know about this, Mr.Poirot.<eos> It's from Hoffberg. He's sending a man down here tonight, to have a look at the stone.<eos> I wish you woudn't sell it, George.<eos> It's been in the family so long...
- Excellent reasoning, Hastings.<eos> What it amazes!<eos> How it got?<eos> Using quite reprovable methods, I lament to say it.<eos> It was a difficult and dangerous operation in which did Hastings show his value.<eos> But certainly Monsieur Lavington he is not going to present complaints.<eos> Do I eat I will be able to thank for you?<eos> Where it was hidden?<eos> In the Chinese box, such as he said to us.<eos> And the Chinese box it was hidden in a stump.
What are you, a doctor?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> When are you going down there?<eos> Today. I'm going today.<eos> Just don't do anything until you hear from me.<eos> All right.<eos> Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.<eos> - May I help you?<eos> - Yeah, I picked up this shirt yesterday.<eos> It's completely shrunk.
If this should happen near the engine core we'd be in big trouble, Captain.<eos> Do you have any theories?<eos> Data's noticed something too strange to be a coincidence.<eos> The two radiation events on board occurred five hours, twenty minutes and three seconds apart.<eos> The science station exploded at almost four times that interval.<eos> There's a .001 4 second variance we haven't been able to explain yet.<eos> So there's a connection between the radiation bursts and the blast?<eos> We do not have the evidence to support that conclusion at this time.<eos> If they're right, we should be able to predict the next event.<eos> We're expecting it in five hours.
So what did you wish for, Will?<eos> Music lessons.<eos> Mr. Data, we must hurry or we'll miss Cmdr Riker's party.<eos> Sir, I find it interesting how much importance humans place on celebrating their birthday, a day they cannot remember.<eos> Captain, I am detecting some unusual fluctuations in subspace frequencies.<eos> You better take a look at it, Mr. Data.<eos> It appears we are being probed, sir.<eos> Source?<eos> The third planet of the Alpha Onias System.<eos> Our reports list it as uninhabited. Perhaps reports were incorrect, sir.
We could easily check the transporter lD traces.<eos> By all means, check the trace log but even if the results are negative contact Starbase Command.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> One moment, Doctor.<eos> I'm sure you're aware of the procedure involving passengers.<eos> Of course.<eos> I don't know why Lieutenant Worf wasn't told about Dr. Quaice.<eos> Well, I was not informed either.<eos> But I sent in a request weeks ago.<eos> Then it must have been intercepted before it reached me.
The son betrays his people to the Romulans, just as his father did, Duras.<eos> One of the Klingons who died was with Duras, the other was with Gowron.<eos> I've examined the bodies, trying to get a clue as to where the bomb was hidden.<eos> There's always a pattern in the lacerations and tissue damage.<eos> It normally indicates the direction, distance, force of impact.<eos> Normally?<eos> In this case, the pattern was virtually impossible to detect.<eos> I couldn't understand it until I saw the dynoscans.<eos> This wound is different from all of the others.<eos> It was made from the inside out.
Washington was a military general, not a terrorist.<eos> The difference between generals and terrorists is that between winners and losers. Win and you're a general. Lose...<eos> You are killing innocent people!<eos> Can't you see the immorality of it?<eos> Or have you killed so much you've become blind to it?<eos> How much innocent blood was spilled for the freedom of your Federation?<eos> How many good and noble societies have bombed civilians in war, wiped out whole cities?<eos> Now you enjoy the comfort that's come from their battles and killing, you frown on my immorality? !<eos> I'm willing to die for my freedom, Doctor.<eos> And in the finest tradition of your own great civilization, I'm willing to kill for it, too.
Just hear what I have to say.<eos> Your people are safe.<eos> How long they stay that way depends on you.<eos> We demand an embargo and trade sanctions against Rutia.<eos> The Federation will blockade the planet.<eos> No ships will be allowed in or out. This will continue until our government agrees to talks mediated by a Federation council.<eos> You have 1 2 hours to decide.<eos> Got it.<eos> The Ansata base is 300 km from the city, in the south of the continent.<eos> It is located 30 metres below ground, implying a cavern-like dwelling.
He's nice.<eos> I like him.<eos> I'm worried about what's going to happen to him.<eos> We may never know.<eos> If they succeed, we will not even realize that these events occurred.<eos> Shields are up to 72 percent.<eos> - That's better.<eos> - Good.<eos> Do you believe this Guinan?<eos> I discovered long ago that she has a special wisdom. I trust it.
– Miranda? – I guess you better.<eos> All right. You have the right to remain silent.<eos> – You have... – Lieutenant. – If you give up the right to remain silent...<eos> Don't interrupt.<eos> Just came in. Message from ballistics there, too.<eos> Schultz, stop! Schultz!<eos> The preliminary autopsy says Ms. Goren was shot twice... once through the heart with her own gun, that little .25. That's the gun Mr. Jennings just said he fired.<eos> But that wasn't what killed her. What killed her was a shot in the head.<eos> And that, says ballistics... was from a different gun, a .22-caliber.<eos> And it was fired quite a bit earlier. Over a half hour earlier, in fact.
All right.<eos> But, if you must know, the policies are fairly impressive.<eos> A million dollars.<eos> A million dollars?<eos> Oh, that's fairly impressive.<eos> Excuse me, Lieutenant. I sent your driver home.<eos> Drove my own car here, is that all right?<eos> Oh, sure, sir. You're free to do whatever you want.<eos> You're gonna be happy to know, we just found the other bullet.<eos> It was buried over there in those ashes.
Sounds like a great idea if I could ever get it together.<eos> This woman's schedule, I mean, you wouldn't believe it.<eos> It's between the church and between volunteering at the hospital... and watching her sister Ruth's kids, walks the dog five times a day...<eos> How about dinner one evening?<eos> Why don't I talk to her about it?<eos> Oh, gee, here I am, I'm taking up all your time.<eos> – Don't be silly. – No, no.<eos> No, you're busy and so am I. Anyway, I gotta get down to headquarters.<eos> Help trace the ownership of that gun. So far, it's a dead end.<eos> It wasn't registered? No, ma'am.
Ours seems to be a little dated.<eos> Certainly.<eos> What, no Fire Nation?<eos> Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place?<eos> You've made a lot of trips into the desert.<eos> All in vain I'm afraid.<eos> I've found lost civilizations all over the Earth Kingdom, but I haven't managed to find the crown jewel Wan Shi Tong's Library.<eos> You spent years walking through the desert to find some guy's library?<eos> This library is more valuable than gold, little lady.<eos> It is said to contain a vast collection of knowledge, and knowledge ... is priceless.

It shouldn't be this hard to spot a giant ornate building from the air.<eos> Down there. What's that?<eos> Forget it. It's obviously not what we're looking for.<eos> The building in this drawing is enormous.<eos> What kind of animal is that?<eos> I think that was one of the knowledge seekers.<eos> Oh, we must be close to the library!<eos> No, this is the library.<eos> Look!<eos> It's completely buried.
And in death he still compels a sinner to come.<eos> And he works through you.<eos> What is this?<eos> Hadn't that boy killed his family?<eos> He was possessed.<eos> This town is full of a lot of strange things.<eos> Is that a fact!<eos> Like that old house you and your friends bought.<eos> That old house ... is not just bricks and boards.<eos> It's got a soul, that house.
No prints, no description.<eos> You're the only one who believes he exists.<eos> I'll let you in on a secret.<eos> There is no Iceman.<eos> Let's get back to the cold facts.<eos> What the hell happened here?<eos> I saw an exchange.<eos> I moved in. He shot. I shot back.<eos> - You got the bad guy's gun?<eos> - It's got to be in the ashes.
- I'll be right back.<eos> I can't see.<eos> It's because you've been sitting in a dark movie theater all afternoon.<eos> I can't believe this. Wait a minute. Wait.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> That it's my fault?<eos> I'm not saying it's your fault.<eos> You say it like it's my fault that the streetcar smashed my car.<eos> I'm not saying it's your fault.<eos> No, you took the car and it got hit.
- You are married?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And this is my son.<eos> I named him Sam.<eos> You're not supposed to name him after the living.<eos> I know.<eos> You know?<eos> Carry on the family name. Carry on.<eos> Couple of years ago, I went to see the house on Avalon.<eos> It was gone.
Ready to roll!<eos> Emmett!<eos> Marty, are the time circuits on?<eos> Check, Doc!<eos> Input the destination time.<eos> October 27, 1985, 11:00 a. m.<eos> Check. Okay, we're cruising at a steady 25 miles an hour, Doc.<eos> I'm throwing in the Pres-to-Logs.<eos> Marty, the new gauge on the dashboard will tell us the boiler temperature.<eos> It's color-coded to indicate when each log will fire.
Ma'am!<eos> These are our boys.<eos> Jules and Verne.<eos> Boys, this is Marty and Jennifer.<eos> Doc, I thought I'd never see you again.<eos> You can't keep a good scientist down.<eos> After all, I had to come back for Einstein, and, well, I didn't want you to be worried about me.<eos> I brought you a little souvenir.<eos> It's great, Doc. Thanks.<eos> Dr. Brown, I brought this note back from the future, and now it's erased.
Naturally, he was badly traumatized by the murders, but they bounce back pretty fast at that age.<eos> Poor kid.<eos> What Andy needs now is a normal family environment, a fresh start and a chance to forget the past.<eos> Since you two have done so well with so many kids, we were hoping you might foster him until his mother recovers.<eos> There's always room for one more.<eos> Mmm. What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Uh, well... He seems normal enough, but how has all this affected him?<eos> Well, in order to come to terms with something he couldn't possibly understand, he turned it all into a kind of fairy tale.<eos> He insisted his doll was responsible.<eos> He said it was possessed by the soul of Charles Lee Ray.
The one you showed Mary?<eos> - She's very quick.<eos> - What was the point?<eos> I'm selling the bar.<eos> To him.<eos> I've never told anyone this - never - but I want to tell you.<eos> Soon after we were married, Robert started to hurt me when we made love.<eos> I tried to stop him, but he went on doing it.<eos> And after a time, I found I liked it.<eos> Not the pain itself, but somehow... the fact of being helpless before it.
It says here that you've been decorated.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And they sent you here to be posted?<eos> Actually, sir, I'm here at my own request.<eos> Really?<eos> Why?<eos> I've always wanted to see the frontier.<eos> You want to see the frontier?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Before it's gone.
God.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You called about a winter cover for your pool?<eos> What? No, I'm sorry.<eos> This house is sold... unless my husband may have called.<eos> It was your husband.<eos> He would have told me about this.<eos> If you scream, your children are gonna come home... and they're gonna find you in a pool of blood.<eos> Please. What do you want?<eos> There's a swimming pool in the back, and it's heated.
There's no doubt he still has some ardent supporters, both here and abroad.<eos> Rumours abound on Capitol Hill that there were...<eos> - Yeah? - Sir, we're checking our equipment.<eos> - Any problems with the conduit line?<eos> - I don't know anything about that.<eos> - Would you mind if we take a look?<eos> - Help yourself.<eos> It don't seem right somehow, closing down this church.<eos> The parish is gonna keep on using it, but it won't be the same.<eos> Been here a lot of years, and I've been right here with it.
- I can't go home.<eos> - Why?<eos> - The carp.<eos> - You know, I thought you said...<eos> My wife's mother is visiting, Father.<eos> Tuesday night, she's cooking a carp.<eos> It's a tasty fish.<eos> I have nothing against it.<eos> But because it's supposedly filled with impurities, she buys it live.<eos> And for three days it's been... swimming up and down in my bathtub. Up... and down.
- Pardon me?<eos> - I said, my radio.<eos> Aren't you gonna fix it?<eos> Nothing ever gets fixed around here.<eos> Just a bunch of pies and anchovies.<eos> Go away!<eos> I don't ever talk to strangers.<eos> - I'm the radio repairman, Mrs. Clelia.<eos> - Well, fix it.<eos> - Well, what's wrong with it?
Alec keeps them.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> First they threw the book at me.<eos> "Not in the national interest" and "violation of security".<eos> There. I mean... lt's infantile. laughable.<eos> Comic-book stuff.<eos> Don't underestimate it. Peter.<eos> I've been a policeman for 26 years. I've never met anything like this.<eos> If you go to Dublin. see him and get the tape...<eos> Neil would say it was used for intelligence purposes and can't be admitted in court.
You blow the whistle. when the shouting stops. they reach an accommodation.<eos> You know. Tom. I think I am naive.<eos> I've always believed that given half a chance the system would work.<eos> Look. we've got the men who did the shooting.<eos> - Everything I've stood for...<eos> - Our job's done.<eos> No!<eos> That's unacceptable.<eos> I walk away from this. it's a lifetime wasted.<eos> They want this thing buried and. if necessary. will bury you alongside it.
Unhook it!<eos> Everyone's standing around with their arms folded... I'd like to get her pregnant...<eos> Everyone's had her.<eos> All you have to do is this...<eos> What about this?<eos> We'll send it back.<eos> On the railway I had a girl in every station...<eos> Here today, somewhere else tomorrow...<eos> Geography is essential.<eos> When the earth moves beneath your feet you have to ride it.
And we can't take along any strangers. Okay?<eos> Wait...<eos> There's one more thing we need to know.<eos> I've studied the underground maps of the site.<eos> There are mile long tunnels with connecting passages to the monastery.<eos> So what?<eos> You must be careful...<eos> Do you know the name of the church?<eos> The Damned church.<eos> It was built in 1299
Pea Eye, duck!<eos> Uh... Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Why, Deets...<eos> I'm a-comin', Deets.<eos> Wait for me, Deets. Just...<eos> I'm a-comin'.<eos> You intend to stab me with that knife?<eos> About to have a go at that rotten leg before you woke up.<eos> It's ruined.
We have to try to reach the nearest town.<eos> - Good idea.<eos> - Hey, stop it.<eos> Stop kidding!<eos> - That's all I can offer.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> We want to reach the valley.<eos> Do you think is possible?<eos> No, you can't go while still snowing.<eos> And also there is only one way and it's blocked.
She's convinced that whoever has the coin has her targeted.<eos> This might make her feel better.<eos> Briggs, the cop that died, had a partner named Goreman, who was the only witness.<eos> The papers said he didn't see a thing.<eos> Well, they might be wrong 'cause while I was there, a report came in from the morgue.<eos> Another killing?<eos> Briggs' body has disappeared.<eos> Oh, my God. - So the coin is back and someone's using it.<eos> Micki, maybe it's okay.<eos> It's given life.
Leave her alone.<eos> No! No!<eos> Let us go... please?<eos> I can't.<eos> It's too late.<eos> You're killing her.<eos> The word I prefer is "sacrifice."<eos> I believe that some of us have to die in order to save the rest of us.<eos> That syringe belonged to a murderer.<eos> It's cursed.
We're the new owners.<eos> Do you remember buying a silver sleeved syringe from there?<eos> Yes.<eos> My hobby's collecting medical antiquities.<eos> I have a large collection.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Look, what's so important about...?<eos> Do you still have it?<eos> What is this all about?<eos> Doctor, we've got reason to believe that it's been involved in a number of murders.
If they had gotten ahold of that, that would have happened.<eos> Is his coven still active?<eos> Well, there's been no sign of it.<eos> Perhaps they disappeared with the, uh, with his powers.<eos> I wouldn't be too sure of that.<eos> You know, Lewis spread around an awful lot of those witch's tools.<eos> But nothing is more powerful than the ladder.<eos> This could enhance a witch's powers a thousand times.<eos> That much?<eos> But without it, Thank you, Gareth. A black coven is no more powerful than we are.
It's been sent away for safekeeping.<eos> Where? Where?<eos> Vendredi's old store.<eos> Curious Goods. Please!<eos> You promised!<eos> I've made a greater promise to another.<eos> No! Please! Witchcraft isn't based on fear, as many people think.<eos> It's... it's a discipline.<eos> And it's a concentrating of the will to influence things around you.<eos> Of course, like any kind of power, it could be used for good or for evil.
You've felt its power, haven't you?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I think it drew me into the vault tonight.<eos> Vault?<eos> It's not important.<eos> What's important is that you talk to my partners, Micki and Jack.<eos> Well, I will.<eos> But first we have to get you somewhere safe.<eos> Well, I'm not going to leave them in there with that thing.<eos> The closer you are to it, the more it'll control you.
The Cross of Fire.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've told you all I can.<eos> If either of you do find out anything, I would appreciate a phone call.<eos> Of course...<eos> Mr. Marshak.<eos> Sorry about your friend.<eos> The Cross of Fire.<eos> Father Finn says the cross came from a Hungarian church that bordered Transylvania.<eos> Now, legend says, it was used to bless a member of the congregation who then offered himself to save the village from a vampire.
The Thule Society was feared throughout Medieval Europe, very powerful wizards said to have learned their secrets from the ancient Norse gods.<eos> Jack, I can't believe this sort of thing can happen.<eos> I can, and it did.<eos> They infused their powers in silver amulets which could seek out their enemies, communicate over great distances and raise the dead.<eos> Rausch would have been an ideal candidate.<eos> He was one of Hitler's favorites... An intelligent... dangerous, powerful man.<eos> And Mueller has such an amulet?<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> But he's been in prison since the night we grabbed him.<eos> There's no way that Mueller could resurrect Rausch without it.
You know, I paid a fortune in taxes this year and what did I get for it?<eos> I ask you.<eos> Of course, Herr Mueller is in custody, Mr. Marshak, but regulations strictly forbid him receiving phone calls or uncensored mail.<eos> Warden, I've got to speak to him.<eos> Then you'll have to come here.<eos> Okay, then I'll be on the next plane.<eos> Jack, you're in no shape to...<eos> Yeah, well... When can I see him?<eos> Whenever you arrive, but you will need a security clearance.<eos> It has been required since his escape.
No, Anton, please.<eos> We are dancing The Legend of Shiva, the eternal struggle between life and death represented by the two of you.<eos> I want to see the fear and the attraction.<eos> No more.<eos> One hit doesn't make a dancer, Adam.<eos> I made a sensation of you two as Romeo and Juliet.<eos> I can't, Anton.<eos> You finish when I'm finished, or you dance for someone else! Now, we'll pick it up where we left off.<eos> First the two counts, then turn to one another, and then... let the music lead you.<eos> Give yourself over to it.
Yes.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Thank you for your help.<eos> Yes, I am aware that Cincinnati won the World Series in 1919.<eos> Thank you, though.<eos> Back to square one, huh?<eos> That ring is the first thing Lewis listed;<eos> the first antique he sold.<eos> It's been out there doing God knows what longer than anything else.
Thank you, though.<eos> Back to square one, huh?<eos> That ring is the first thing Lewis listed;<eos> the first antique he sold.<eos> It's been out there doing God knows what longer than anything else.<eos> Well, let's review what we already know.<eos> That ring was designed for the Chicago White Sox because they were a shoo-in to win the World Series in 1919.<eos> Right, right.<eos> And then they threw it over for a gambling syndicate.<eos> It was sold to Luke Spicer.
Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on, Janine. How the hell did you get in there?<eos> Get out of here!<eos> This is ours!<eos> You got a sales slip?<eos> Proof of purchase?<eos> But you gave it to us.<eos> Yeah, and I'm taking it back.
And we were right.<eos> There's a prisoner called "Dayton Railsback."<eos> Maybe Johnny could speak to him.<eos> Now, there are two inmates he should talk to.<eos> Yeah, we found something in the manifest, a World War II flying jacket sold to Woody Reese.<eos> What's that got to do with Johnny?<eos> I was gonna buy that jacket from Reese next week after he's transferred out of maximum security.<eos> What does this thing do?<eos> It's a kamikaze jacket.<eos> It was used by Japanese suicide pilots in World War II.
Well, look what you're doing for her.<eos> Wow, that would be really nice. I got to get this one;<eos> it's got "Nature Boy" on it.<eos> But you already have it.<eos> No, I gave it to Randy.<eos> It was our song.<eos> He never gave it back.<eos> Guys.<eos> You know, if you want "Nature Boy", you should take this version.<eos> It's been remastered.
Because you won't get your taste of honey until you kill them.<eos> What the hell's wrong with you people?<eos> Why can't you leave me alone?<eos> Because we need to find that beehive, Mr. Purdy.<eos> No.<eos> He'll kill me if I talk.<eos> Who?<eos> McCabe?<eos> We need to know exactly how he uses it.<eos> That's how we can find out where it's hidden.
The guy who used to eat his pen?<eos> Look at him over there with the other nerds, still sitting together.<eos> You should have done your own homework, guys!<eos> Aw, eat your pen, Milton. Hey, Peggy.<eos> It's called breath spray. Now, I'm gonna go try to get some more votes for queen.<eos> You guys just sit back and reminisce about being human.<eos> Oh, and don't you do anything stupid. Ugh!<eos> Don't worry, beautiful. I'll keep an eye on him.<eos> Say, Al. I just happen to have this nail here.<eos> Ten bucks says Bundy can drive it through this table with his head.
Aguila and Perena aren't just playing games out there, you know.<eos> Well, I ain't playing games, too.<eos> And they'll find out. No more games, I promise you that.<eos> Hi, there, campers.<eos> Well I got some chips, I got some diet sodas.<eos> Sorry, Georgie, they were all outta comic books.<eos> What'd I say?<eos> Aguila called, the meet is set with Perena.<eos> You ready?<eos> Let's do it. What was that all about?
I humor him, you know.<eos> To begin with, there was the smell of the cigarette smoke.<eos> Which I didn't smell.<eos> Precisely.<eos> And yet the ashtray had in it no fewer than the stubs of nine cigarettes.<eos> So it was very odd, eh, very odd that the room should smell as it did -- perfectly fresh.<eos> Oh, so that's what you were getting at.<eos> The next thing that attracted my attention was the wristwatch worn by the dead woman.<eos> What about it?<eos> It was worn on the right wrist.
I know.<eos> The night was so pleasant.<eos> We are going to pass many pleasant nights.<eos> Is he seeing that one?<eos> They are going to take it.<eos> - What dreadful thing.<eos> - And only it came here today.<eos> My friends, we are going to consider the facts.<eos> First of all, the letter.<eos> It was found in the place of the crime, signed by such a John Fraser.
- Who the hell are you?<eos> - Just a friend.<eos> Look, Donna, it was just a guess.<eos> Please. I noticed you didn't list a father on your school record, and you went by your mother's maiden name.<eos> - What were you doing in my records?<eos> - You're in my class.<eos> Let's just keep it at that.<eos> I have a string theory on time.<eos> It's very complex and completely improvable, but I'd like your opinion.<eos> It's based on an expanding but finite universe.
- I'll disappear any moment now.<eos> - What happened?<eos> Here it comes...<eos> Any moment.<eos> What's he talking about?<eos> Any moment...<eos> Any moment now.<eos> It hasn't worked.<eos> According to our data, you didn't invent the tension sheet.<eos> It was invented by a gentleman named "Thickie" Holden.
The doctor gave him a complete medical examination.<eos> His condition is hereditary.<eos> His brain can't receive auditory information.<eos> So all the prosthetics and surgical techniques I can use wouldn't work.<eos> - I don't know how we can help him.<eos> - I can't do anything.<eos> It's up to him and he's stopped cooperating.<eos> Counsellor, couldn't you...?<eos> Confidence is faith in oneself.<eos> It can't easily be given by another.
A certain giddy warmth.<eos> In fact, I do actually remember that I laughed out loud.<eos> Well, it pierced my heart, of course.<eos> If we had not been so near to a medical facility, I'd have died.<eos> Really?<eos> - Then what happened?<eos> - Nothing. I was no hero, Wesley.<eos> I was an undisciplined, loudmouthed, opinionated young man who was way out of his league.<eos> I learned a very hard, very painful lesson that day. But I learned it well.<eos> I hope you never learn it the same way.
I'll make everyone a nice cup of tea.<eos> We have lovely tea here on Rana.<eos> It grows wild almost every...<eos> Sir.<eos> May I say your attempt to hold us at bay with a non-functioning weapon was an act of unmitigated gall.<eos> Didn't fool you, huh?<eos> I admire gall.<eos> Go ahead, pick it up.<eos> It's a music box.<eos> It's been in my family for generations.
Let them.<eos> Apologies if I interrupted a waltz.<eos> Why have you brought us here against our will?<eos> I want to end the suffering of my crew member.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Kevin does.<eos> He's the cause.<eos> At first I couldn't understand why your house survived the holocaust.<eos> Then it occurred to me.<eos> It had been destroyed.
Eyes... right!<eos> Baldrick, what are you doing out there?<eos> I'm carving something on this bullet, sir. What are you carving?<eos> I'm carving "Baldrick", sir.<eos> Why?<eos> It's a cunning plan, actually.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> You see, you know they say that somewhere there's a bullet with your name on it?<eos> Yes?<eos> Well, I thought if I owned the bullet with my name on it, I'd never get hit by it, 'cos I won't ever shoot myself. Oh, shame.
This one's mine... and the other one - yours<eos> The person whose candle is the first to die out will ask a question, O.K.?<eos> O.K.<eos> It's a draft<eos> Got a cigarette?<eos> You win<eos> You can ask, and you'll get a honest answer<eos> Why I read the letter?<eos> I read it because you wanted me to<eos> I first saw it... during the removal, quite accidentally
What the hell is going on around here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You two help secure the rig.<eos> Let's go.<eos> One Night, you hear me?<eos> Get the hell out of there!<eos> The crane's coming down!<eos> I'm O.K. I'm clear, Bud.<eos> I've got it.<eos> It's headed straight for us!
She cut her finger on the lamp ... that she sent to your mother.<eos> What entered into that lamp was three centuries of evil.<eos> That's the power it holds.<eos> That's the power that's invading your house right now.<eos> This all seems so crazy.<eos> That evil is searching for souls.<eos> And it would transmigrate into the most vulnerable person in its environment.<eos> We have to get everyone out of that house, now.<eos> What if it's too late?<eos> What if it's already ... invaded a person?
Yeah.<eos> I've got something for you.<eos> A letter.<eos> A letter for me?<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Western Union.<eos> Actually, a bunch of us at the office were kind of hoping maybe you could shed some light on the subject.<eos> See, we've had that envelope in our possession for the past 70 years.<eos> It was given to us with the explicit instructions that it be delivered to a young man with your description answering to the name of Marty at this exact location at this exact minute, November 12, 1955.
- No? No.<eos> I don't have time for that stuff. You know, going to proms.... There's a lot of things to take care of before you go in the Marines.<eos> I didn't even know how much stuff.<eos> Maybe I'll see you before I leave, okay?<eos> The batter is Mickey Mantle.<eos> Mickey has two strikes... and the chance to put the Yankees ahead in this game.<eos> The pitcher gets his sign, takes his stretch, checks the runners. Here's the pitch. Mickey swings.<eos> And he gets hold of it.<eos> Theres a long drive deep to center field.<eos> It is gone into the bleachers... 455 feet away... for Mickey's 491st home run!
- Pretty.<eos> - Very pretty.<eos> - Do you want to know the time?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Three past ten and 45 seconds at this moment.<eos> Whenever you need it, just ask me and I... Just look at it.<eos> - Excuse me, what time is it?<eos> - Ten o'clock, 3 minutes and 52 seconds.<eos> This watch never fails.<eos> At any moment, it...
Only you would know that, Judah.<eos> I don't anymore, Ben.<eos> Sometimes it's worse than... Worse than jail.<eos> It's a human life.<eos> You don't think God sees?<eos> God is a luxury I can't afford.<eos> Now you're talking like your brother Jack.<eos> Jack lives in the real world.<eos> You live in the kingdom of heaven.<eos> I managed to keep free of that real world, but suddenly, it's found me.
Two on, two out.<eos> Up steps DiMaggio.<eos> Hit a smash, deep left field, had home run written all over it.<eos> Everyone in the stands knew it.<eos> I knew it.<eos> DiMaggio knew it.<eos> It was perfect.<eos> But here comes this little Gionfriddo guy.<eos> He's racing after the ball.<eos> And he doesn't realize it was hit by Joe DiMaggio.
You tried to take her across the Pacific on your own?<eos> There were six of us.<eos> The others died 10 days ago.<eos> One by one.<eos> It all happened in a day.<eos> What happened?<eos> Have you ever thought about how life can hinge on the smallest thing?<eos> I mean, ever since I was a kid, I thought salmon was for cats.<eos> Was it canned salmon?<eos> At first we thought it was the tourist trots until Chantal looked at her hand and said Picasso should have painted it.
All of the latest gadgets are at our disposal including ESP.<eos> The army is really up to date.<eos> Aren't they?<eos> You've forgotten one thing.<eos> What's that?<eos> You didn't mention our bio-weapons.<eos> Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria?<eos> TSUKUBA LABORATORY OF BIOTECHNOLOGY<eos> Already in the United States they've created a bacteria that can eat crude oil.<eos> It's been successfully tested on the oil spills.
Tennis balls, my liege.<eos> We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.<eos> His present and your pains we thank you for.<eos> When we have matched our rackets to these balls, we will in France, by God's grace, play a set shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.<eos> And we understand him well, how he comes o'er us with our wilder days, not measuring what use we made of them.<eos> But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state, be like a king and show my sail of greatness... when I do rouse me in my throne of France.<eos> And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his... hath turned his balls to gunstones, and his soul shall stand sore charged... for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them.<eos> For many a thousand widows shall this his mock, mock out of their dear husbands, mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down.<eos> And some are yet ungotten and unborn... that shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.<eos> So get you hence in peace, and tell the Dauphin... his jest... will savor but of shallow wit... when thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
Hi.<eos> I'm Russ Thompson from next door.<eos> He has something to say, or I can tell her.<eos> Okay.<eos> I was playing with my ball.<eos> It's not my ball exactly. Just tell her what you did.<eos> Their house is too close!<eos> - He hit a baseball through your attic window.<eos> - He what?<eos> It shouldn't have been closed. It's a nice day!
Stop.<eos> Sit, boy!<eos> Get away from there.<eos> Get away.<eos> Drop it!<eos> Officer, we'd appreciate you sending somebody by.<eos> Okay, it's 646--<eos> That guy's got serious problems.<eos> 646 Sycamore.<eos> [Nick] Great idea, Russ, even if the boy genius... didn't think of it.
Fix the collar.<eos> Make me look humble.<eos> - About the Borneo call?<eos> - All right, but that's the last one.<eos> For the next few weeks, my business is revenge.<eos> Everything is in place, sir.<eos> All right, let's see what you've got for me.<eos> Cute but wrong.<eos> It's got no character. A truck.<eos> Yeah, I like it.
- Of course we are.<eos> Everybody's looking at us. I know.<eos> Smile and make a good first impression.<eos> Well, you see, I'm a witch.<eos> My name is Kiki.<eos> This is my black cat Jiji.<eos> We'd be honored if we could live here.<eos> We'd love to live here.<eos> You have a wonderful bell tower.<eos> We're glad you like it, my dear.
I'm sorry.<eos> That marvelous dog helped me escape.<eos> He said he'd be happy to help us out.<eos> Would you take this back in?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> - I'm famished.<eos> - Yeah, me too.<eos> And I'm tired too.<eos> But it sure was a wonderful adventure.<eos> And that painter who found the stuffed cat wants to do a drawing with me in it.
In the days that followed I wished a thousand times... that it was my head on that stake.<eos> Re-education time for fascist imperialists.<eos> You... read...<eos> You... read.<eos> I can't see, you bastards!<eos> We didn't see Chuck for two days.<eos> We thought he was a goner.<eos> But then on the third night they brought him back to us.<eos> The bastards had taken his legs.<eos> I still say that private enterprise... is acceptable at a village level... providing it is strictly controlled by the party.
Ah, great.<eos> You got a cigarette?<eos> You know, I, uh, I never agreed with what they did to you.<eos> I'd like to help you out, Kenny.<eos> Whoever iced Farley did us all a favor.<eos> - This your shirt, Paris?<eos> - No, I take in laundry.<eos> Yeah, it's my shirt.<eos> The cuffs.<eos> I found it behind the refrigerator.
I'll be at the doctor's all week.<eos> We'll manage.<eos> - Well, Happy New Year!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - We pulled it off, then?<eos> - Yes, we did.<eos> Did what?<eos> This is it!<eos> Your new home!<eos> Like it?
Don't worry, I won't run away.<eos> Vicente is on his way.<eos> Get down here!<eos> I don't like restaurants.<eos> You better get used to it. We'll have to eat out as long as Cândida is sick.<eos> But food is the same everywhere.<eos> Hmmm, mashed potatoes!<eos> Like it?<eos> What?<eos> It's not poisoned, don't worry!
You gave me a lot.<eos> A high position.<eos> The power to create and perpetuate the Way of Tea.<eos> And now, finally, death.<eos> This is the largest of all gifts.<eos> Your order has helped me to die to understand the Way of Tea for the first time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Your order of death I was suddenly restored free in body and spirit.<eos> I spoke of the beauty, the simplicity of the Way of Tea but do not really understand.<eos> Now that death is suddenly beside me, I am face to face with it, it is no longer possible to mistake.
I need backup in the chamber!<eos> Now!<eos> The guy's had it.<eos> - Help me.<eos> Get me to a hospital.<eos> - All right, she's alive.<eos> - Sergeant!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Call the ambulance.<eos> I can't. It's already gone with two of our guys.
Let's go. We can walk to the highway, please.<eos> - What if Granny needs our help?<eos> - Why don't we call the cops?<eos> It's dead.<eos> Let me give it a try.<eos> You see, Vitus, even the phone is dead.<eos> It's not funny, Chris.<eos> Look, if somebody robbed the place, don't you think we would have noticed by now?<eos> Look.<eos> My picture... it's gone.
Hello, my name is Philo, and welcome to...<eos> 'Secrets Of The Universe.'<eos> Today we're going to learn to make Plutonium from common household items.<eos> Hey, man, this is Raul Hernandez, and welcome to<eos> 'Raul's Wild Kingdom,' coming to you live from my apartment!<eos> Okay, first thing we're gonna do today is check out the wonderful world of turtles..<eos> This is my friend Tommy.<eos> Tommy say hello to the nice people.<eos> 'hello' Aaay, isn't he great?<eos> the turtle is a member of the reptile family and it's got this hard, protective shell... (he raps on it) ... which keeps predators away and provides him with his own house for when he sleep.
What are you doing here?<eos> Just looking around.<eos> How about yourself?<eos> Well, I'll be working here for a while.<eos> You're looking wonderful.<eos> So are you.<eos> You haven't changed a bit.<eos> Oh...<eos> I'd recognize that beard anywhere.<eos> It's got a little grayer since you saw it last.
Oh, just try to escape.<eos> I do have one question.<eos> How do I get my coat off?<eos> Ah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Jack: Micki.<eos> Oh, jack, am I glad you're here.<eos> Look, I've been doing some checking Based on what you told me.<eos> The manifest lists an 18th century pipe.<eos> And although lewis did receive it, It was never listed as sold.
Shh!<eos> You'll wake the old lady.<eos> What is it?<eos> The fr...<eos> The-the front door!<eos> Ryan: Oh, my god...<eos> m-micki, what did you see?<eos> Where's her hea...<eos> Where's her head?<eos> Micki: It's gone!
Ryan here, he made a mask of Hyberia's face to put over yours.<eos> And Jack kept Sylvan busy long enough for me to make the switch. Mm.<eos> Why didn't you just get the coin and bring me back that way?<eos> Micki, we didn't have the coin.<eos> Our one chance was to get Sylvan to do it for us, and that's what destroyed the coven.<eos> It's a very dangerous business conjuring up the Devil.<eos> If you don't give him what you promise him... Uh, the whole roof will fall in on you.<eos> Unfortunately, we lost the coin.<eos> Well, I think the coin's as safe as if it was in the vault.<eos> It's buried under hundreds of tons of rubble.
Oh, I can't even rent a room on my own?<eos> Not when we're up against a cape That has some kind of a curse on it.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> No.<eos> No, that's quite all right.<eos> That was my late husband's cape.<eos> I've been looking for the right man, A man who could...<eos> Oh, I've never had much luck with women.<eos> Oh, but you look so handsome in it.
The school's closing down in two weeks.<eos> Why?<eos> You know the bureaucrats;<eos> A matter of funding, among other things.<eos> I'm just as sorry about it as you are.<eos> Warden: I'm sorry, eli.<eos> Your stay of execution's been denied.<eos> Eli: No!<eos> Warden: The electric chair had quite a history.<eos> It was installed in 1937.
It was installed in 1937.<eos> There were 19 men executed in it, 18 of them successful.<eos> You mean, someone survived?<eos> In 1978.<eos> Fellow by the name of eli pittman.<eos> He was convicted of murdering his girlfriend.<eos> The chair gained a certain... Notoriety After pittman lived through his execution.<eos> That's where it used to be.<eos> The chair was never used after the pittman incident.<eos> It was sold to a private collector, I believe.
Maybe he really did sell it.<eos> To an old man in a boat.<eos> Terrific.<eos> You know, barney said that he heard that foghorn, And then he saw the pirate in a boat.<eos> And joe said that he sold The foghorn to a man in a boat.<eos> Angus mcbride?<eos> He's been dead for three centuries.<eos> Come on!<eos> Why would a ghost want a foghorn anyway?<eos> I don't know what kind of a curse it's got on it, But maybe the foghorn is needed by the ghost.
Pleasure.<eos> Sarah bought a quilt from uncle lewis.<eos> I was sorry to hear What happened to thine uncle.<eos> Ah!<eos> Here it is.<eos> The quilt of hathor.<eos> Five-pointed stars, four-legged men...<eos> Aye!<eos> That's the one.<eos> Yes. It was sewn in the 1890s By salem women who were following the occult.
The quilt of hathor.<eos> Five-pointed stars, four-legged men...<eos> Aye!<eos> That's the one.<eos> Yes. It was sewn in the 1890s By salem women who were following the occult.<eos> I knew the quilt was evil.<eos> Well, thanks for bringing it back.<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> She doesn't have it any longer.<eos> It was stolen.

Congratulations!<eos> Voodoo priests are always ordained on the solstice, the beginning of the longest day of the year.<eos> You might find it a little unusual, but you're welcome to join us, if you like.<eos> Uh, Ryan, most of what we hear about voodoo is-is myth.<eos> It's really a very misunderstood religion.<eos> And an ancient one.<eos> We are worshippers of nature, pledging our loa to the service of material elements.<eos> Loa?<eos> The voodoo soul.<eos> It is believed to live in the throat.
As a blood brother, I promise that no matter what, I will meet here, exactly 25 years from today at high noon to dig up this time capsule.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Okay, MacGyver, fill it in.<eos> In 25 years, we'll be lucky if we even remember where we buried it.
A little scared.<eos> But I know Sister Margaret saw them capture us.<eos> I'm sure the church underground will make contact with our embassy.<eos> The problem is, our government can't take any official action. Not until after the State Department meets with President Monteyo.<eos> The peace talks are too sensitive.<eos> when are these talks?<eos> They begin tomorrow evening.<eos> Oh, my dear God.<eos> The man who died, Enrique Salizar, he told me the rebels have placed a bomb in the presidential palace.<eos> It's set to go off tomorrow night.
One day, she j\ust left town for good.<eos> That was in '58.<eos> Thirty years to the day, in fact.<eos> On Halloween night.<eos> - They never found her, huh?<eos> - Not a trace.<eos> Even called in the fbi.<eos> After seven years, they declared her dead.<eos> Have you ever heard any weird stories about the house?<eos> - You mean about it being haunted?
Bring them to me.<eos> I'll kill them.<eos> But not at first.<eos> First I'll take a hammer and smash their toes, little to big.<eos> Then, if it was a man-- and I know it was a man-- I'll turn the hammer around.<eos> Al...<eos> Steve, get the cops.<eos> Show them this.<eos> I dug up this picture of her.<eos> It was taken the night of her first date with Ken.
I secured the position as governess.<eos> He little knew that the woman who faced him at every meal was the woman whose husband he had hurried to eternity.<eos> I smiled on him, did my duty to his children, and bided my time.<eos> An attempt was made in Paris and failed.<eos> We zigzagged here and there swiftly over Europe to throw off our pursuers and finally returned to High Gable.<eos> Garcia had been waiting there for nearly a year with two trusted companions, all fired with the same reasons for revenge.<eos> Who was Garcia?<eos> The son of Fernando Garcia.<eos> One of the former highest dignitaries of San Pedro who was murdered... like your husband.<eos> This note you sent, you say it was intercepted.
Similar in technological development to mid-20th century Earth.<eos> Kinda like being marooned at home. Assuming any survivors made it this far.<eos> It is the closest planet, but to go the distance we did in two days, would've taken the Odin escape pod five months.<eos> Five months, six days, 11 hours, two min... - Thank you, Data.<eos> - ..and 57 seconds.<eos> Receiving an audio signal from Angel One.<eos> Starfleet are adamant we maintain excellent relations with this planet.<eos> Mr. Data, is there any other pertinent information before we reply?<eos> Angel One evolved into a constitutional oligarchy.<eos> It is governed by a parliamentary body of six elected Mistresses, and headed by a female called "The Elected One". It sounds like my own planet.
Captain, the crystal thing has begun to move away.<eos> Are you alright?<eos> Yes, sir. I'm fine.<eos> Get rid of that damn twitch and put on the correct uniform.<eos> Yes, Captain.<eos> - Are you able to return to duty?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Then do so. Let the bridge know all is well here.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> It's gone, sir.
When we're better prepared.<eos> I wanted to create a place where living things could thrive, and all the while I was about to destroy the life that is there.<eos> - Our apologies.<eos> - And respects.<eos> - Lt. Yar?<eos> - Coordinates set, sir.<eos> Energize.<eos> Captain's log, star date 41464. 8.<eos> I have declared an indefinite quarantine for Velara Ill. We are returning to Star base with the surviving terraformers.<eos> Perhaps the lesson we learned from this near-tragedy will prevent it from happening elsewhere.
Medicine.<eos> Indeed?<eos> Our planet is in desperate need.<eos> People have a lethal plague.<eos> The cargo is the only hope of life for our people.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Yes.<eos> You must think us heartless, but look at our side of it.<eos> The plant which yields felicium grows only in remote areas of Brekka.<eos> It must be painstakingly cultivated, harvested, purified.
Riker to holodeck!<eos> - Are you seeing anything?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - What can I do?<eos> - Not a thing.<eos> We have to go through this millimeter by millimeter.<eos> Alright.<eos> Get it fixed.<eos> Easy, Wes.<eos> Slow down. If there's an anomaly, you could go past it. OK?
No, thank you.<eos> I'll be purchasing my meal.<eos> - There's my ride.<eos> - Have a nice day.<eos> I intend to.<eos> Don't worry, Joey.<eos> I still love you, no matter how much you punish D.J.<eos> Can I eat her lunch?<eos> Over the years, the fig has gotten a bad rap.<eos> A lot of people think of it as only a filling for a Newton.
- This is ridiculous.<eos> D.J., they sound really mad.<eos> Are they gonna get a divorce?<eos> Not if we get them to make up.<eos> You get Uncle Jesse, and I'll get Joey. We'll all meet back in our room.<eos> You have a great mind, D.J.<eos> If you could only use it for good.<eos> I'm sure there are no monsters in your closet, but I'll check for you.<eos> I don't believe you broke a window.<eos> I don't believe it, because it's not broken.
How many did you count?<eos> A hundred.<eos> There are more than a hundred.<eos> I know.<eos> Why did you stop?<eos> A hundred is enough.<eos> Once you've counted to a hundred, all the other hundreds are the same.<eos> Take your clothes off girl.<eos> My name's Nellie and there's not room in that bath for two of us.<eos> Who says two's going in it?
You teach me something which I did not know.<eos> I feel love.<eos> But now only my body is suffering.<eos> The pain I feel is merely physical.<eos> I can touch it. I can also, oh, new art, I can tell myself;<eos> turn your thoughts away from her.<eos> May she not be present so that you don't suffer.<eos> Thus, through my body swollen with pain, the soul is taking shape smoothly, soothingly, and, I would say, not-materially.<eos> The soul does not suffer.<eos> I recognize indifference in it, like in a warm river.
Now, this is a real Thanksgiving.<eos> I just wish my neighbours could see this.<eos> There may be a little problem here.<eos> The rest of the meal is excellent.<eos> We could fill up on the vegetables alone.<eos> In fact, I think I'll do that.<eos> - The turkey.<eos> Pure poison.<eos> Come again?<eos> We think it may have been cooked at a slightly inadequate temperature.
I don't really have to use him like a piece of pornography...<eos> I worked hard all day, and the work came very slowly.<eos> Beginning a book is always the most difficult part for me, and by late afternoon I'd become tired.<eos> I lay my head down and closed my eyes, and I guess I dozed off.<eos> I don't know exactly how long I was asleep, but one of the pillows must have slipped down off the vent, because I gradually became aware again of a voice.<eos> It was a woman's voice, and it was such an anguished, heart-wrenching sound that I was totally arrested by its sadness.<eos> I just know that I woke up during the middle of the night.<eos> And time passed, and there were strange shadows.<eos> I began having troubling thoughts about my life.<eos> Like there was something about it not real.
Assert yourself!<eos> I'll miss you.<eos> I'll ty to do well, too.<eos> You'll be proud of me.<eos> Write to me.<eos> We'll be like we used to be.<eos> Like before!<eos> Your brother's been sent to New York.<eos> We have decided to give you your dowy.<eos> You've dipped into it considerably. But, still...
You don't like it?<eos> Fuck off!<eos> Go lick the boots of your bosses.<eos> You're worse than the priests who raised you.<eos> You still want to know what the horizon is?<eos> Are you asleep?<eos> When you look at the hills... beyond the houses and beyond the trees... where the earth touches the sky... that's the horizon.<eos> Tomorrow, in the daytime, I'll show you something.<eos> The closer you get to that line, the farther it moves.<eos> If you walk towards it, it moves away.
"Heber's wife took a nail of the tent and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him and smote the nail into his temples."<eos> Is this the green tent?<eos> No, that's a brown and orange tent.<eos> The green tent's under here.<eos> - Sarge, got this?<eos> - Yeah, we'll take that.<eos> There's another one up there.<eos> Do you want this?<eos> - Is the car available, Mr Chamberlain?<eos> - It's being fixed at the lake. I'll take you there myself.
If it breaks out soon, we can have a variety show at the front.<eos> And you? Why do you stay?<eos> Since I don't want that to happen again.<eos> You did right naming Hitler.<eos> Frightened those who hesitate. Now they realize what will happen if they don't stand up to him.<eos> Hitler has no mass support. His rough, uneducated storm troopers only scare people away.<eos> Hitler's position can only be temporary.<eos> You really think so?<eos> The infiltration has filled people with hatred.<eos> It's brought forth humiliation and stirred up filth.
- Turn it the right way.<eos> Come on, Rich!<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> I don't wanna play here any more.<eos> Can we go home now?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Everyone out of the truck! Come on!<eos> We can't!<eos> It's rented!
They were all against me, just like everybody here.<eos> They're against what you did.<eos> That's the same thing.<eos> So you want me to see your mother.<eos> Yes, to tell her to bury me next to my father.<eos> Can I be buried in a cemetery?<eos> Yes.<eos> The priest they sent said I could.<eos> Naturally.<eos> Okay, next to My father there's still a burial plot, it was supposed to be my mother's.
This is daft.<eos> We could have stayed at home by the fire with a good biology book.<eos> I am freezing.<eos> Can we go now?<eos> I just want to take a look at the place where the watch was found.<eos> We have looked there a hundred times.<eos> Well, let us make it a hundred and one and call it quits.<eos> We should have called it quits yesterday.<eos> All right, so they found the watch there. What of it?<eos> Chances are it was hidden away here by someone.
We should have called it quits yesterday.<eos> All right, so they found the watch there. What of it?<eos> Chances are it was hidden away here by someone.<eos> Someone who thought it would never be found.<eos> And you are dragging in dragons and worms and serpents and Lord Knows what.<eos> Next, you will be suggesting those poor folk were gobbled up in here by some of Loch Ness Monster!<eos> - That is horrible!<eos> - Who swallowad everything but the watch!<eos> I cannot believe it!<eos> No, it swallowed the watch, too. And passed it, undigested.
You don't change Ella's cage or fill her food dishes.<eos> This is our house.<eos> You have been hired to perform certain functions.<eos> When you don't perform them, we get pissed off.<eos> And just who is this "we"?<eos> - Me and Ella.<eos> - That's what I thought you meant.<eos> It's unnatural - you and that monkey.<eos> She is just a dirty, filthy, sneaky, little beast.<eos> You don't like the way this place looks? She's the one that leaves it a mess.
Bye.<eos> Feels weird without him, huh?<eos> He saved our lives.<eos> I'm gonna miss him.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I made this star to remember Michael with.<eos> His lucky star.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's not his lucky star.<eos> It's gone.
Oh, God.<eos> Be seated.<eos> We're gathered here to witness and bless the joining together for ever of William and Josephina in Christian marriage.<eos> The firm covenant of marriage is permanent in this lifetime, because it was established by God.
Oh, God.<eos> Be seated.<eos> We're gathered here to witness and bless the joining together for ever of William and Josephina in Christian marriage.<eos> The firm covenant of marriage is permanent in this lifetime, because it was established by God.<eos> And once entered into, it may never be broken without risk of eternal damnation.
I was afraid I'd find you here.<eos> Come on, Mike, get up outta there.<eos> This whole place is empty.<eos> - So, come on, let's go home.<eos> - Look at this, goddamn it!<eos> That's the third one I dug up.<eos> Doesn't it strike you as strange that every corpse in this graveyard is missing?<eos> What do you want, Mike?<eos> I want to stop them.<eos> The Tall Man - that story about me blowing up my house because it was infested with midgets?
The one on the Chronicle's front page?<eos> - Afraid so.<eos> - Mark, did you hear that?<eos> The Lincoln was involved in a shooting.<eos> - You're kidding.<eos> - When did you last use the car?<eos> It's my wife's.<eos> We went out to dinner.<eos> I left it here and drove home.<eos> Next morning, it was gone.
Tell him that I can come and pick them up on my lunch hour.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> - See you at 6.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> No, my husband will pick them up at 1:00.<eos> Is that all right?<eos> Well, I'm going to have to replace the whole lawn.<eos> You see, it's all scorched completely.
Remember me?<eos> Harvey, it wasn't my fault. We ran out of type O.<eos> It's coming!<eos> -Cherry?<eos> -lt was cherry.<eos> The door.<eos> -Forget it.<eos> -You wouldn't....<eos> You ghoul-face, get off the car.<eos> Thirty years I've owned this auto... and I've never put a scratch on it.
Are we finished talking about this now?<eos> Mrs. Taylor.<eos> Just remove everything and put on the gown.<eos> The doctor will see you in a few minutes.<eos> All right. I'll be right back to weigh you.<eos> Could you help me with this zipper, dear?<eos> Did you hear what happened to Elizabeth Powell last night?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> The fbi came to see her.<eos> The car that was used in that bank robbery... where they killed those policemen... it was rented with her credit card.
But for Mozart and me, it was a different matter.<eos> This will give you some protection, that's all.<eos> Just like your scientific objectivity.<eos> In this country, I haven't felt protected by anything.<eos> You don't know what hasn't gotten to you.<eos> I'm not afraid for myself.<eos> A good thing.<eos> Up.<eos> Remember, when the battle comes, it won't be fought in the streets.<eos> It will be fought in your mind, in your soul.
Where's she?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe she left, shut everything up.<eos> Garden?<eos> Oh, yes, there's a fountain and some roses.<eos> - Can I grow vegetables?<eos> Some fruit... apples and plums, and there's... there's a beautiful walnut tree.<eos> Walnut tree.<eos> How old's the house?<eos> It was built in 1780.
To the best of my recollection... the brief conversations I have had with Mr. Adams... and they have been brief... I don't even recall ever asking him, or my having told me... that he did not do it.<eos> Because, for my purposes, representing him on appeal... it's totally irrelevant.<eos> When the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas... voted 9-0 against us, I was a little upset about that.<eos> I felt we, A: Should have won... Certainly shouldn't have been slapped so hard... with the unanimous decision against us.<eos> I was with my family in an ice-cream parlor... and the judge and his family happened to come at the same time.<eos> And he came over to me and made the comment...<eos> "I see where the Court of Criminal Appeals gave me an 'A'...<eos> "in the Adams case."<eos> Our highest state appellate court... the Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin affirmed the case, 9-0.<eos> Then it was reversed by the United States Supreme Court, 8-1...
You're not going to become boring, are you?<eos> Waiter?<eos> -Can you stop that noise? -Noise?<eos> Yes.<eos> What you call music.<eos> I'll have to ask the manager.<eos> Everywhere music's turning into noise.<eos> These plastic flowers.... They even put them in water.<eos> And look out there. Those buildings... the uglification of the world.<eos> The only place we can find beauty... is if its persecutors have overlooked it.
You know where you can bury your hatchet?<eos> Now get your bony ass out of my sight.<eos> And if you really think that I said I loved you as part of some scheme, then that is pathetic.<eos> - My God. She'll stop at nothing.<eos> - What kind of show are you people running?<eos> Oren, I'm sorry you've had to see this, but it means nothing to us.<eos> Jack, let's get upstairs.<eos> - Not without her.<eos> Trainer, are you trying to blow this deal?<eos> No, sir. I'm trying to make sure that it gets done right.
This is the way to the Spirit Road.<eos> We're lost right now. But I'll find us the way.<eos> Oh Christ, Chavez! That's all we need is some more of your red-ass Navajo mambojahambo.<eos> We're running out of time here, Chavez.<eos> Is that any good?<eos> - Chavez, what is that?<eos> - Peyote.<eos> Butterflies.<eos> Yeah, it's just like a butterfly.<eos> A butterfly flies, to a flower... stays with it. Doesn't know why, it just feels in.
The streets of San Juan Hill were filled with music.<eos> The sounds of the singers, the piano players and the big bands drifted from home radios and blended with sidewalk gospel music.<eos> Monk began playing piano without formal training.<eos> Later, he took lessons and studied music theory at the Juilliard School of Music.<eos> But his real teachers were the master jazzmen of his time.<eos> Fats Waller Art Tatum and Duke Ellington.<eos> At 17, he toured the United States with a gospel group.<eos> Monk returned to New York and became the house piano player at Minton's the scene of a revolution in music.<eos> There, with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, Monk joined the revolution.<eos> It was called bebop.
oh, good. and i don't have squat.<eos> hello, trish, doll.<eos> i know i said i'd have it in your hands today, but i had to make a few changes.<eos> alf, are you all right?<eos> oh, yeah, everything's fine.<eos> why... why do you have... those clothespins attached to your head?<eos> it's a form of acupressure.<eos> on melmac, we use it to relieve writer's block.<eos> still having trouble with the script, eh?<eos> read it yourself.
Ooh, how does that sound to you?<eos> What's a casserole?<eos> Well, in this particular case,<eos> I'm not sure you want to know.<eos> Micki!<eos> Jack!<eos> Oh, no...<eos> Ryan, you all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> The cup... it's gone!
I can't understand it.<eos> I know I saw the statue when we barged in.<eos> - So it was here.<eos> - Yup. Ugly little thing, too.<eos> I know because I said to myself it was too tacky even for a motel.<eos> Could the cops have taken it?<eos> I thought you were the cops.<eos> Another division.<eos> You were saying.<eos> Now that I think of it, it was gone already.
Welcome to the world of love.<eos> It's amazing what some people will do for it.<eos> That's it, Jack.<eos> Another one for the trophy room.<eos> Never forget that we're dealing with forces which no one comprehends, my young friend.<eos> Don't take them lightly.<eos> Well, I hope that that disgusting little statue never sees the light of day again.<eos> Yes, don't even think about it.<eos> Now it's back in the vault.<eos> We have to make very good and sure that it's never unleashed again.
C'mon.<eos> We've got work to do.<eos> Brother Currie, your tray's here.<eos> Brother Currie?<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> No, don't be afraid.<eos> We're from the Yorkshire monastery.<eos> We want to talk to you about your pen.<eos> No, no, the quill pen.<eos> We know all about it.
Uh, just like his father.<eos> Harley, aren't you done yet?<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Get that stuff in the shredder and get over here.<eos> Sure you chopped all that garbage?<eos> Probably not.<eos> This is very odd.<eos> I found a letter addressed to Louis Vendredi which he's never opened.<eos> Why not?<eos> It's postmarked the day after he died.
Lloyd came by to see you.<eos> You came back?<eos> !<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> Now, Lloyd, please try and keep an open mind.<eos> I didn't believe it myself at first.<eos> Believe what?<eos> We keep them in here.<eos> What did you find out?<eos> As near as I can figure it, the mulcher is somehow producing currency for every person killed in it.
AII of the money from the receipts didn't make its way back there.<eos> - You're skimming. - You might say that.<eos> And that film is the proof.<eos> God bless you.<eos> Now, because you work for me, you're in as deep as I am.<eos> Wait a minute. I didn't know about that until just now. Nothing!<eos> But they don't know that.<eos> And it's our job to keep them from finding out.<eos> So what else you got?<eos> - I traced that car that MacGyver and his pal had, and it's registered to this "Pete Thornton."
Oh, hi, hon.<eos> I didn't hear you come in.<eos> Gee, you made it all the way to the couch this time.<eos> How's work? Are you still enjoying it?<eos> What's that noise?<eos> What noise?<eos> I hear ticking.<eos> Oh...it's you. Me?<eos> I'll tell you an interesting thing about this watch, Peg.<eos> You put it in water, you ruin it.
- In a moment?<eos> - Exactly!<eos> In a moment.<eos> You were about to say?<eos> With such power, why be concerned about our laws?<eos> You could take the boy from us.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> From the starboard lounge, you can see whatever is outside this vessel.<eos> You mean my world?<eos> We're high above it.
A lot of effort for a simple headache.<eos> You should not have a headache unless something's wrong.<eos> It's true that headaches were once quite common, before the brain was charted, before we understood the nature of pain.<eos> When we suffered from things such as the common cold.<eos> - So what's the cause of my headache?<eos> - I haven't the slightest idea.<eos> Feel better?<eos> - The pain's gone.<eos> - Medical fakery.<eos> The pain is actually still there. It's just cloaked.
Who is speaking?<eos> I am Tarr, DaiMon of the Ferengi.<eos> You wish to discuss surrender, Capt Picard?<eos> What I said, DaiMon Tarr, is...<eos> Unconditional surrender, I warn you, is totally unacceptable.<eos> We will die to the last one of us before such dishonor.<eos> Hailing frequencies closed.<eos> Something has seized their ship too. They're in the same predicament.<eos> Launch a sensor probe.<eos> Set it to search for whatever it is that is holding both ships.
Yeah, we know.<eos> Come on. Let's take this baby for a spin.<eos> Girls, get in the back seat.<eos> Peg, Marcie can show you the way.<eos> Steve, I'll drive.<eos> We'll take a nice spin out in the country.<eos> You sit and lean coolly out the window.<eos> We'll pretend these are our mothers.<eos> I'm sorry about the car, honey.<eos> You couldn't have known it was stolen.
No? No?<eos> I must have misheard you, Steve.<eos> I thought you said "no."<eos> I also thought all of our decisions were going to be joint decisions.<eos> A beard is a decision.<eos> Fine.<eos> Next time you want to grow a beard, do it.<eos> Don't think I won't.<eos> The beard stays.<eos> It's gone.
Oh, and if you're going to watch TV, remember, I go to bed at 10:30 sharp.<eos> 10:30? That's when Peggy goes to sleep.<eos> That means I have to go up with her.<eos> Well, I hate to punish Peggy, but I need my sleep.<eos> Well, how about this, Steve?<eos> Shave that bird's nest and get the hell out!<eos> What... what's that smell?<eos> It's food, Al.<eos> Well, how'd you get the stove to work?<eos> Peg said it's been broken for months.
Yes.<eos> I don't know where to start.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> You gave me leave of study.<eos> Yes.<eos> Should I not have?<eos> I want to return. I'll catch up on what I missed.<eos> I've thought about it.<eos> You'd lost your vocation.<eos> It's come back.
- Me?<eos> No, I haven't time - well boys, off you go<eos> Goodbye<eos> Zbyszek, Zbyszek<eos> What's happened?<eos> The party has been dissolved.<eos> That's a lie.<eos> The Comintern dissolved our party.<eos> I couldn't believe it either but it's a fact.<eos> Listen, if such a decision was made it was justified - most of us, it seems couldn't be trusted.
He was rushed to hospital December 15, and operated on for a ruptured appendix.<eos> Unfortunately, peritonitis set in and he died seven days later.<eos> He had been with the firm over 40 years.<eos> Naturally, it has come as a great shock to Mr. Cohen particularly coming so soon after the death of Mr. Marks.<eos> Do you still wish us to obtain the books you asked for?<eos> Yours faithfully, P.P. Marks Co.<eos> Joan Todd (Mrs.), Secretary.<eos> Dear Helene:<eos> Thank you for your very kind letter.<eos> Nothing about it at all offends me.
- Slowly!<eos> Mummy, prepare a compress for the director, Feri!<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> One can't find anything in this bloody pigstye.<eos> - Where's the typewriter?<eos> - Must you have it now, at dawn?<eos> Yes. Right now.<eos> Stop "right nowing"!<eos> We'll look for it in the morning.<eos> I suppose the children were playing with it.
All right... I'm writing for you at the request of my son.<eos> I'm a little delayed because our typewriter got lost.<eos> Point.<eos> All I want to tell is I want to tell you, ...that...<eos> All I want to tell you is a comma, only...<eos> Oh, Tomi, Tomi!<eos> It can't be done like this, as simply as a school composition.<eos> These people are really important.<eos> They have secretariats, with lots of idlers, pre-readers.<eos> Even if I wrote the letter, it would get lost.
I just want to check for that label that says, "Made in the USA."<eos> Oh, no, don't. You'll queer our luck.<eos> That little guy is the golden goose.<eos> It serves you right.<eos> We apologize.<eos> He didn't mean to pry.<eos> He was just being scientific.<eos> "GE." This says "GE."<eos> This is, was, my coffeepot.<eos> Looks like it's been percolated.
New Years Eve, '43.<eos> We dropped him off in the crowd, and he disappeared forever.<eos> Or so we thought.<eos> You're telling me you paid 25 grand for a guy and lost him in a crowd?<eos> I did it for my daughter.<eos> Some sort of hocus-pocus she and Johnny were fooling with.<eos> She was obsessed.<eos> I know, I found a mummified hand in her room.<eos> The hand of glory.<eos> It's supposed to open any lock.
What's nagging you, Miss Shirley?<eos> You're behaving rather like a spinsterly old schoolmarm, don't you think?<eos> -Perhaps that is because I am one.<eos> I'm a great proponent of independent thinking.<eos> Moreover, I've always held that early marriage is a sure indication of second-rate goods that had to be sold in a hurry.<eos> -Well, you can be sure I am of the first-rate kind, Morgan Harris.<eos> And I certainly have far greater ambition than marriage, oh, if that is what you're insinuating is "nagging" me. I'm about to have a short work of fiction published.<eos> Well, then, let me offer my congratulations.<eos> Anne, I am sorry.<eos> How gracious of you. But my schedule is so jam-packed, I'm sure I won't be able to squeeze it in. I take it you'll attend the Hospital Benefit tomorrow evening?
Ms. Laurel?<eos> Is our Cinderella ready to do her scene?<eos> Or does she need more time to warm up?<eos> Brett, you're a fucking bastard.<eos> A rose by any other name...<eos> Okay, let's do it.<eos> Music!<eos> God, I can't find my watch.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Wow, you must be crazy to leave it lying around like that.
You went shopping?<eos> I was upset.<eos> I do not know what to do.<eos> What has happened?<eos> We'll talk on the way.<eos> I have something to do.<eos> You see this house?<eos> The girl who was killed lived there.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> It also was attacked on her way home.
That's how close you are, Dennis.<eos> You wouldn't want to wake up your mother, would you?<eos> I didn't much like our conversation.<eos> If you pull that trigger, your father's gonna have to repaper the walls.<eos> All I want is a little respect.<eos> You don't have to like me. Though I suspect you do, in spite of yourself.<eos> Yeah, there's no doubt about it, Cleve. You're a real charmer.<eos> You're not taking this very seriously, Dennis.<eos> Please...<eos> If you ever aim a gun at me again, it better be loaded.
Come!<eos> Angela, what is the house of the village that you like the most?<eos> Widower's house XIUS.<eos> Mr. XIUS.<eos> I want to buy your home.<eos> Sorry, but it is not for sale.<eos> I buy all that it contains.<eos> It is full of things that my wife and I bought for our common life.<eos> And not without personal sacrifice.<eos> Each object is a memory of it for me.
Mapetla's dead.<eos> They claim he hanged himself in his cell.<eos> We're going to remake the front page.<eos> Donald Woods.<eos> Hello, Donald.<eos> A piece of news.<eos> The day before Mapetla died, the police showed another prisoner a puppet of Mapetla hanging from a string.<eos> Steve, I don't know what to say.<eos> Just say that someday justice will be done.<eos> And let's hope it will not be visited on the innocent.
I went to see what fell on the ground Nathan last night.<eos> Nathan told me he wanted call the EPA<eos> We must consider this.<eos> The interest and theirs.<eos> Alan, Alan, have a little over experience.<eos> Have you ever thought what would happen to our association, the EPA came intervene?<eos> Advertising could take them elsewhere.<eos> I can not afford to lose so much money. you see?<eos> What this assuming pretend this thing is not there?<eos> We do not even know what is it made of.
- At least they could sing in English.<eos> - How would you know?<eos> - You can't speak English.<eos> - Fuck you and the horse you rode in on.<eos> - You did.<eos> - You came in second.<eos> Did you remember the tickets?<eos> - Damn! Joey, wait.<eos> I've got to go back.<eos> - You'd forget your head if it wasn't screwed on.
Stay away from that Ferrari, please.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> That's a police suspect vehicle.<eos> Yo, baby!<eos> Hey, honey, you know, what's your hurry?<eos> The night's still young, and...<eos> Your name is Brenda, right?<eos> I seen you before.<eos> Say, uh... Do you like cars?<eos> 'Cause I got a great car, and it's, uh... parked right over there in that lot.
Fine, we'll wait 'til then.<eos> All right, that's that.<eos> That's it!<eos> Everyone back to work!<eos> You throw a rock, it falls to the ground. That's common sense.<eos> Now throw that rock really hard, towards the horizon and it falls to the ground really far away.<eos> Keep throwing your rock harder and harder and it'll eventually reach a speed where it falls towards the horizon without ever landing.<eos> What you have then is an artificial satellite.<eos> Instead of continuing to rise it falls along the curve of the planet.<eos> Since the atmosphere would keep you from maintaining this speed you have to fly way up high and actually get out of it.
Katia Venis?<eos> That's right. She's better today. She wants to work.<eos> I'm here to interview her.<eos> Does she know?<eos> I'll show you the way.<eos> Had a little argument with the wife?<eos> Can I ask you a few questions, too?<eos> What's in her lunch box?<eos> She never opens it.<eos> I get it for my sister-in-law.
Don't worry, we won't do anything.<eos> - And if you can't sleep?<eos> - I'll take a pill.<eos> You take one, too.<eos> I'll take a couple.<eos> - Is it OK with beer?<eos> - After all you've taken tonight?<eos> - Very nice.<eos> - Like it, don't you?<eos> Try it on.
The day before my water supply had run out, and I had to find some.<eos> The cluster of houses, although they were in ruin, reminding me of an old wasps' nest, made me think that once there must have been a fountain or perhaps a well.<eos> There was indeed a fountain, but it was dry.<eos> The roofless houses, eaten away by wind and rain, and the chapel with its crumbling belfry, stood arranged like houses and churches in a living village, but here life had vanished.<eos> It was a sunny cloudless June day, but over these bare highlands blew a fierce insufferable wind.<eos> Growling through the skeletons of the houses, it sounded like a wild beast disturbed while feeding on its prey.<eos> After five hours of walking I still had found no water and I could see nothing that gave me hope of finding any.<eos> Everywhere I came upon the same drought, the same coarse weed.<eos> In the distance something caught my eye, a thin dark shape that I took for a tree stump.<eos> But just in case I walked towards it.
Leaving his dog in charge of his little flock he began to climb towards me where I was standing.<eos> I feared he was coming to reproach me, not at all:<eos> it happened to be on his way, and he invited me to go with him if I had nothing better to do.<eos> He was going a little farther on to the top of the hill.<eos> When we reached his destination he began to drive his iron staff into the ground.<eos> He made a hole, dropped in an acorn and filled in the hole.<eos> He was planting oak trees.<eos> I asked him if he owned the land.<eos> He said no.<eos> Did he know who owned it?
He hadn't worried about it;<eos> resolutely he had gone about his simple task.<eos> On the way down through the village I saw streams flowing with water which in living memory had always been dry.<eos> This was truly the most impressive effect of creation's natural cycle that I'd ever seen.<eos> Long ago these brooks had been full of water.<eos> Among the miserable villages I mentioned before, some were built on sites of ancient Roman villages;<eos> and archaeologists, digging in the ruins, had found fish hooks whereas, in the twentieth century, cisterns were needed to ensure even a modest supply of water.<eos> The wind had scattered seeds too.<eos> And as the water reappeared, so did willow trees, reeds, meadows, gardens, flowers, and a reason for living.<eos> But the change had come about so gradually and that it was simply taken for granted.
"Every human soul has...<eos> "at some stage...<eos> "beheld an excellent being.<eos> "Otherwise, it would not have...<eos> "entered... into the creature...<eos> "we call man.<eos> "When... the soul...<eos> "gazes upon... the beauty...<eos> "of that being-its beloved-<eos> "it nu-is nurtured... and warmed... and is glad."
That is a B-17, in case you are wondering.<eos> It's rad!<eos> "Good and evil are in constant flux, back and forth.<eos> Only once, every hundred years... are these forces balanced."<eos> And what about the amulet?<eos> The amulet, so nearly as I can translate is "concentrated good.<eos> It is a talisman which wards off evil and is..." How you say... "indestructible"?<eos> That means it can't be destroyed.<eos> Or, in any case, normally destroyed.<eos> However, and this part is underlined. "Once every hundred years at the stroke of midnight... the amulet becomes vulnerable... and at that moment it can be shattered."
I never told you this 'cause it's not really a story... but one time I woke up in the middle of the night... 'cause of this bright light in my face...<eos> like a flashlight. I couldn't think what it was.<eos> I looked out the window, and it was the moon... as big as a house.<eos> I never seen the moon so big before or since.<eos> I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house.<eos> Then I looked down... and standing there in the street was Cosmo...<eos> looking up at the windows.<eos> This is the funny part.<eos> I got mad at you, Cosmo.<eos> I thought you had brought that big moon over to my house... 'cause you were so in love... and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess. I didn't know any better.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess.<eos> The wedding's in a couple of weeks. You're invited.<eos> How come you didn't be like him and be with your mother in Palermo.<eos> - She don't like me.<eos> - You don't get along with anybody.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - What did I do?<eos> - You ruined my life.<eos> - That's impossible!<eos> It was ruined when I got here.
Okay, but I still don't understand why we're not taking direct samples. I mean, what's the big mystery?<eos> Catherine's entering these equations upstairs. They're translated from Latin.<eos> Differential equations?<eos> From a book written 2,000 years ago.<eos> We hadn't invented differential equations... Right.<eos> Professor Birack, I don't think we have too much to worry about.<eos> The lid on that thing won't open. Look.<eos> It's incredibly elaborate.<eos> Right here, there's a... there's a weird locking mechanism.<eos> Looks like it can only be opened from the inside.
Let me sum up.<eos> Buttercup's marrying Humperdinck in less than half an hour... so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding... steal the princess, make our escape... after I kill Count Rugen.<eos> That doesn't leave much time for dilly-dallying.<eos> You just wiggled your finger!<eos> That's wonderful!<eos> I've always been a quick healer.<eos> What are our liabilities?<eos> There is but one working castle gate.<eos> Come on.<eos> And it is guarded by sixty men.
Like a nightingale.<eos> You told him that? -Yeah.<eos> -Promise?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Boy, that was fast.<eos> Probably helped I had the hiccups.<eos> I have to get back to the table.<eos> Hey, Sally, this door's locked.<eos> It is?<eos> It's locked from the inside.
You're from Receiving, aren't you?<eos> I see you're a workaholic.<eos> Yeah, well... I got a lot of work to do.<eos> - What are you doing here so late?<eos> - I'm a workaholic too.<eos> Wow.<eos> You mean we have something in common?<eos> So, what's all this supposed to be?<eos> It's the heart and soul of an idea you hated: expansion in the Midwest.<eos> I don't hate it.
Yes!<eos> Ning!<eos> Why are you so speedy?<eos> It's faster coming down!<eos> Are you alright?<eos> Do you like this picture?<eos> Give it to you.<eos> The picture?<eos> How do you get this?<eos> My father asked to draw it a year ago.
Turn around, please.<eos> Ah, what a pity.<eos> What a pity. So, Princess, you thought you could outwit the imperious force of...<eos> You idiots!<eos> These are not them!<eos> You've captured their stunt doubles!<eos> Search the area. Find them!<eos> Find them!<eos> - Open the door!<eos> - I can't. It's fused.
Meanwhile, I'm becoming better acquainted with my new command, this Galaxy-class USS Enterprise.<eos> I am still somewhat in awe ofits size and complexity.<eos> As for my crew, we're short in several key positions, most notably a first officer.<eos> But I'm informed an experienced man, Cmdr William Riker, will be waiting tojoin the ship at our Deneb IV destination.<eos> You will agree, Data, that Starfleet's orders are difficult.<eos> Difficult? Simply solve the mystery of Farpoint Station.<eos> As simple as that.<eos> Farpoint Station.<eos> Even the name sounds mysterious.<eos> It's hardly simple to negotiate an agreement to use the base, and at the same time, snoop around, finding out why it was built.
- It's an unknown. Isn't that enough?<eos> If you'd earned that uniform, you'd know it's the unknown that brings us here.<eos> A wasted effort, with human intelligence.<eos> Let's test that.<eos> Begin with the tunnels under Farpoint.<eos> Identical to those on the space vessel life form over there.<eos> Why was it punishing you?<eos> In return for some pain you'd given another creature?<eos> We've done nothing wrong.<eos> It was injured. We helped it.
No, I found it to be fast, original, rather well-written.<eos> You should write another one, you have talent.<eos> I'm a radio-man, you know, not a writer.<eos> I'm sure you're worth more than that.<eos> You deserve better than this traveling entertainer's life.<eos> And you know it, don't you?<eos> What do you know of me?<eos> You can't understand.<eos> I created this show.<eos> It was born with me and it'll die with me.
- (man) I like the title.<eos> - (bell) - OK, I'll see you Wednesday, class.<eos> Good work today.<eos> Remember, a writer writes... always.<eos> - This is your tie.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - You dropped it. - Oh.<eos> How'd that get in there?<eos> It got wet.<eos> I was afraid it would be ruined.
I couldn't have won.<eos> I smell a rat.<eos> What do you think if we made this one of our factory showcase houses?<eos> Well, what's that mean, Mr. Gable.<eos> Well, you know what I do, Alan?<eos> I pick certain houses that are strategically located. We put up the aluminum siding. And for every referral,<eos> $200?<eos> That's right.<eos> Now god knows how many homes we could sell by people passing this house.<eos> It's perfectly located for that.
Yet he is not the first whom soon enough they thrust into the senseless night, cast down from heights of their familiarity because he proved forgetful of the difference in his extravagant delight, feeling for himself alone;<eos> so it went with him, he is now punished, in arid wastes abandoned— although the final hour for him has not yet come;<eos> whoever has for so long been their darling will not long bear the insult to his soul, I fear; his drowsy spirit will spark to flame anew to work out its revenge,<eos> and, half-roused, a fearsome dreamer speaks in him as once it spoke in those enthusiasts of old who wandered throughout Asia bearing reeds for staffs, whose word was how the gods first came to be.<eos> For then the wide world, replete with life, becomes lost property to him, And monstrous cravings stir within his breast; no matter where it leaps, the scorching flame will clear the path ahead.<eos> All law and art, all custom, every holy word and all that once did ripen here for him in time all these are sore disrupted, and joy and peace our man can never let prevail again among the things that live.<eos> When all is lost he takes it all back again, and this wild man no mortal can restrain in his wild ravings.<eos> And he will never be the tranquil one again.<eos> Old man!<eos> You do envisage nameless things Your word is true and when it is fulfilled then woe to you, dear Sicily, as lovely as you are with all your groves and temples.
Even Redgrave.<eos> But surely you could forego for just this one occasion.<eos> I've come a very long way to see you both.<eos> Can't, actually.<eos> I mean, I'd love to stay, but he's more adamant to get back than I am.<eos> Then we must choose our moment... and have a word with him.<eos> I'm sure together we could persuade him.<eos> There.<eos> Now, garlic, rosemary and salt.<eos> I can never touch meat until it's cooked.
Are you ready to take the oath?<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> Swear!<eos> I swear to serve my country all my life!<eos> I swear to serve my country all my life!<eos> We go towards a pale blue distance.<eos> From now on you are a scout, wear this cross proudly.<eos> I present you with this scouts' cross.<eos> ...and I'm sure that you will be a very good scout. I'm glad that you endured. Wear this cross proudly.<eos> It's sewn on.
Fear nothing, Rey is me.<eos> Yes, I recognized you.<eos> You're my new master.<eos> I will be obedient.<eos> However, do not make me wrong, I'll do whatever you want.<eos> Oh my god!<eos> Iriée answer me!<eos> Do you think she ever recover?<eos> The reality was too hard she took refuge itself.<eos> But do not worry, it will soon be healed.
I regret exceedingly that I am unable to help you in this matter, and any continuation of this interview would be a waste of time.<eos> I am not accustomed sir to such things.<eos> Dear Mr. Holmes, we must accept your terms.<eos> No doubt you are right, and it is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless you have our full confidence.<eos> I agree with you, Prime Minister.<eos> Then I will tell you, relying entirely upon your honor and that of your colleague, Dr. Watson.<eos> I must appeal to your patriotism also, for I cannot imagine a greater misfortune for this country than that this affair should come out.<eos> You may safely trust us.<eos> The letter, then, is from a certain foreign potentate who has been ruffled by some recent colonial developments of this country.<eos> It is written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely.

We're her parents and we love her. Okay. Okay, Samantha.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> I don't think he means any harm.<eos> Listen, sir.<eos> This is really upsetting my wife.<eos> Now, I know you don't mean any harm, but could you pleasejust go?<eos> She's got a scar on her big toe... from where she stepped on a broken bottle at the beach.<eos> [Whispers] Stop it.<eos> It was a green bottle.<eos> It was rubbed smooth by the ocean.
Hey, is everybody ready for the slide show?<eos> Yeah, what the hell.<eos> I got nothing better to do.<eos> All right, everybody. Filter on in here.<eos> There's plenty of seats for everybody.<eos> Yup, come along, now. Come along.<eos> Now, if everybody's passports are in order, we begin our sojourn in merry old England.<eos> Yes. Here's Diane at the Tower of London.<eos> Where's the tower?<eos> It's right there. She's standing in front of it.
Dorothy Zbornak! You can go straight to H-E-double hockey sticks!<eos> Double hockey sticks?<eos> Oh, what language!<eos> My ears are burning!<eos> Rose Nylund, you know what you are?<eos> You are an A-1, first-class, all-around nerd!<eos> Oh, honey, I didn't mean that.<eos> I'm sorry. Oh!<eos> It's just this flu is making me crazy!<eos> Oh, it's gotten to all of us.
Well, I think that about completes our tour, Madame Zelda.<eos> Anything else I can tell you about the place?<eos> Yes.<eos> Was a young woman in a nurse's uniform murdered in this house with a handsaw?<eos> Heavens, no!<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I'm getting a very strong vibration.<eos> I see a woman in a white uniform, writhing and screaming. And there's a man kneeling over her.<eos> If it was last Wednesday, that was me and the gentleman I'm currently dating, but that was a French maid's uniform.<eos> Mrs. Devereaux, you must leave this house at once. It's possessed by an evil spirit.
As little as possible.<eos> How long you planning on keeping the passengers in the dark about all this?<eos> We're trying to steer around a typhoon, which prohibits any thought of using lifeboats.<eos> And there's a bomb on board.<eos> What do you suggest I do, Mr MacGyver, create panic?<eos> Well, if it was me, I'd be awfully curious, especially with Charlie and me coming onboard a couple hours after that first bomb went off.<eos> Well, tell me, Mr MacGyver, would you want to know that a very good possibility exists that you could die a violent death sometime during the next three hours?<eos> Yes, ma'am, I would.<eos> That's it.<eos> We're convinced it was placed during dry dock last month.
- MacGyver, that's crazy.<eos> - So is Quayle.<eos> His gears don't mesh.<eos> Let's see if we can get out of here.<eos> Maybe he's missed a trick or two.<eos> I don't wanna leave Mrs Chung back there very long.<eos> The best thing we can do for her is to get to Karen's car and get some help.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Where's my car?<eos> Damn! It's gone.
That's him.<eos> No question about it.<eos> Kurt Neilson, East German Intelligence, rank of colonel. Huh.<eos> Boy's been around.<eos> All right. Make copies, circulate. Get word out on the streets right away!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'll get on it right away.<eos> Search him... thoroughly.<eos> The list's not on him.<eos> Care to tell me where it is hidden, MacGyver?
Look, Pete, we've got some people here, but you better come on over while I explain the facts of life to the Archbishop.<eos> Terry, fill him in.<eos> Please hurry!<eos> I am sorry, Mr. MacGyver, but I must make an appearance and thank my friends.<eos> But, Your Excellency, you will be risking your life!<eos> That is what a life is for.<eos> The people who are here have contributed to our cause generously in money and of themselves.<eos> But with all due respect, Your Excellency, the people will understand.<eos> They will understand that I've allowed myself be directed not by God, but by terror. By an assassin.<eos> I must do the Lord's will as it is revealed to me.
I said before I'm not afraid.<eos> I lied.<eos> - Was it that terrible a day, dear?<eos> - I've had better.<eos> Because of that crazy man, Mather?<eos> I don't have a lot of sympathy for a man who could have killed you.<eos> Well, MacGyver thinks he was used. Set up.<eos> And then killed.<eos> - He had a heart attack.<eos> - Well, Mac thinks it was induced.
There. Now, we're gonna need some kind of time-delay fuse.<eos> Do you have anything that will refract light?<eos> A crystal?<eos> A prism of some kind?<eos> We could try my rosary.<eos> Sister Margaret gave it to me, but seeing as this is an emergency...<eos> It's perfect.<eos> Gotta make sure this coil is wide enough so it'll catch the sun before it changes position, be in the right spot for a few minutes.<eos> So the light will go through the beads.<eos> Right, and it'll be focused on our small vine.
I could check the pay list.<eos> According to Morse Hudson's records you sold him six Napoleon's on June the third, of last year.<eos> That is correct<eos> Now Beppo, last collected his wages on May the twentieth, of that same year.<eos> Then he must have been arrested sometime the following week.<eos> Well no doubt the police have the e xact details.<eos> The young Italian survived so Beppo only went to prison for one year.<eos> We have a cousin of his work in here, perhaps you would wish to speak with him?<eos> Not a word to the cousin, I beg of you.<eos> The matter is very important and the further I go with it the more important it seems.
Especially now that I'm selling what I freely gave to you.<eos> Will you keep your word?<eos> She enters the old man's home as a doomed woman.<eos> Tomorrow morning I shall move back into your villa.<eos> The poison...<eos> She's wearing the shoes.<eos> In a world of kitsch and strong emotions Lenin, the Planner, dies.<eos> Funeral ceremony in Red Square.<eos> The Mausoleum, illuminated by night.<eos> The Red Army trains for chemical warfare, that will not take place the way they had trained for it.
- The spotlight!<eos> - Can't you see where you're aiming?<eos> Shut up!<eos> Not on me, you silly bugger, on the bushes!<eos> Look at this big cheeky bugger.<eos> Hey!<eos> It's got a gun!<eos> Shit!<eos> Good one, Skippy.<eos> Despite the rugged beauty of this land, there's a sort of strange emptiness about it.
It was something.<eos> They had everything.<eos> Nightclubs, dancing, concerts, laughter.<eos> It was the Las Vegas of the Middle East.<eos> Beirut was beautiful then.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> What don't you like?<eos> This Christian place.<eos> The church?<eos> It's always been here.
Something is going on, and I'm going to find out what it is<eos> I'm going to catch this kid and put a dent in his future 15 years from now, when he looks back on the ruin his life has become, - he will remember Edward Rooney<eos> - Wrong<eos> - What?<eos> Not here We're not leaving the car here<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I want the car home where it belongs<eos> - Let's go<eos> - What can happen in a garage?<eos> It could get wrecked, stolen, scratched, breathed on wrong - A pigeon could shit on it
What's this one?<eos> That is a Puckmarin from Binpuka Minor.<eos> He's not dangerous.<eos> - Can I hold him?<eos> - Just keep him quiet.<eos> I'm concentrating.<eos> Hey, little Puckmarin, how long have you been here?<eos> What's he saying?<eos> He is angry because I won't take him back to his home planet.<eos> He does not know it was destroyed by a comet.
It's just that the five senses weren't enough for him, he wanted more.<eos> Is it finished?<eos> Are we ready?<eos> Yes.<eos> I had to bypass the computer because the magnetic field erased the program.<eos> And of course the monitors are completely useless.<eos> So, the entire system has to be manually operated.<eos> And unfortunately the resonator was so severely damaged that I had to convert it to just an on/off system.<eos> When we reach 20 000 MHz, we throw this switch and a powerful magnetic field vibrates these forks at a precise frequency.<eos> Stimulating the pineal gland, allowing us to see with it.
I have something for you<eos> Here, look at this sash<eos> Three lines in a circle.<eos> Your crest<eos> And a chrysanthemum.<eos> Take it<eos> It's wonderful<eos> I'm very happy<eos> It represents our love<eos> When it's tied...
- Do you speak english? I'm just curious.<eos> - We all speak english.<eos> Continue, please.<eos> We may as well get started, I know you guys have a long day of... staring ahead of you.<eos> Where are the lights? Jesus.<eos> OK, here we go.<eos> This is Hadleyville.<eos> There's the factory.<eos> It's been there 35 years.<eos> It's been closed down the past nine months, but two years ago, it was completely retooled.
I guess you folks are here for a little holiday.<eos> A holiday that will last until I die.<eos> I'll live in the shade of these pines, in peace and bliss... for as long as God grants me life.<eos> That sounds nice, but how will you get water?<eos> We have a cistern here.<eos> It's small. Without rain, you'll be out of water.<eos> I also inherited a spring.<eos> A spring?<eos> Where?<eos> It's marked on a surveyor's map.

If she ever kisses you I will turn you into a prince.<eos> - You will?<eos> - Prince of the Land of Stench!<eos> What is going on?<eos> What do you want?<eos> We just want to have a good time!<eos> Hey, her head does not come off.<eos> - Of course it does not!<eos> - She is right.<eos> It is stuck on.
That's in the northern mountains, isn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> When my parents died, they left me the house and farm.<eos> I managed alone, somehow.<eos> You were kidnapped by those men with dark glasses?<eos> The same men we saw?<eos> Who could it be...with such an army...<eos> Both Dora and the 'dark glasses' want to get the stone...<eos> I had no idea there was such a mysterious power in this stone.<eos> It has been handed down through my family, since times long past.
That was sad, wasn't it.<eos> And it happened because of a spell taught to me by my grandmother.<eos> I learned many other spells, too.<eos> To find things, and to cure illness and words I must absolutely never use...<eos> Words you must never use?<eos> Spells of destruction, good spells to bestow power...<eos> She said I must also know the bad words but never use them.<eos> After I learned them, I was too afraid to sleep.<eos> And it all had to do with the stone.<eos> It was always hidden in the fireplace, and except at weddings, never used...
You're welcome.<eos> As a child, I played this prelude.<eos> My mother loved it.<eos> Years ago, before I was married,<eos> I often went to visit my mother...<eos> in the country.<eos> She was still alive in those days.<eos> Her house, a little cottage, was surrounded by a garden... a little garden,<eos> dreadfully neglected and overgrown.<eos> No one had tended it for many years and I don't think... anyone had ever been in it.
It was built by Izaemon, your great grandfather.<eos> He was a carpenter.<eos> He built that temple.<eos> He built our house too.<eos> He was also a teacher.<eos> Judo.<eos> He taught that.<eos> This scroll certifies he was a master of judo.<eos> Since he knew well the body's vital points, he did moxa cautery too.<eos> He made a fortune at it.
Beat it.<eos> - I'll see you soon, okay?<eos> - What the hell are you doing here?<eos> - Saving your ass.<eos> Okay. Pack whatever you can't live without. Go to the Rock Falls Airport and charter a plane.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To do what an old friend asked me to do... knock 'em dead.<eos> Did I mention the pit?<eos> Yeah, that's the gravel pit.<eos> It's owned by Patrovita.
- Get down!<eos> - Police officers!<eos> - Don't shoot!<eos> Shoot 'em!<eos> They're with Gonzales!<eos> Shoot 'em!<eos> Anna!<eos> Is your door open?<eos> No.<eos> It's locked.
You wanna know where I got the money for the car, right?<eos> I wanna know where you got that car, that you can just leave it like that.<eos> Then I wanna know where you got the money.<eos> D - I-V-O-R-C-E<eos> Equal distribution of assets.<eos> It's a popular tune.<eos> Oh, God, I'm sorry.<eos> Don't be sorry. I'm not sorry.<eos> Charlie, don't worry about that car.<eos> It was still registered in his name.
Gondoa?<eos> That's in the northern mountains, isn't it?<eos> Yes. When my parents died, they left me the house and farm.<eos> I managed alone, somehow.<eos> You were kidnapped by those men with dark glasses?<eos> The same men we saw?<eos> Who could it be... with such an army...<eos> Both Dora and the "dark glasses" want to get the stone...<eos> I had no idea there was such a mysterious power in this stone.<eos> It has been handed down through my family, since times long past.

- You're welcome.<eos> It's cold here.<eos> - Really?<eos> I hadn't noticed.<eos> Good night.<eos> Thanks for the evening.<eos> Come in.<eos> Breakfast.<eos> What's that?<eos> Supermarket's cashbox, but it's locked.
What the hell?<eos> Come on, you fucker!<eos> Please. Hey, hey.<eos> Please, I didn't do nothing.<eos> Please.<eos> I... - (CRUMPLING) - (SCREAMING) (BEEPING SLOWING DOWN)<eos> Let's get out of here. My God!<eos> Come on, Kessler, let's go. He must still be around. How do we stop him?<eos> Well, you made the goddamn suit!<eos> Yeah, but it was supposed to land on fucking Mars, not in some Christ-forsaken alley!
- Isn't it funny?<eos> - Funny...<eos> Don't you believe in stars?<eos> I can readily see your star's Virgo.<eos> Well, explain it.<eos> - A Virgo girl's best mate... is a Taurus boy like me.<eos> Your star must be Cancer.<eos> I've many collections at home.<eos> Including a human head made by the New Guinea tribe.<eos> It was shrunk to the size of a monkey head.
Supporting your theory that Tandino murdered Daddy Mention's men the other night.<eos> What we got here is a cute little drug war.<eos> Doesn't satisfy you, Miss Osborne?<eos> Not particularly, no.<eos> I'll see you in court tomorrow, McSwain.<eos> That's a woman for you, Jack, never satisfied.<eos> Order in the court.<eos> All remain seated.<eos> What's her problem?<eos> It seems her key piece of evidence was erased when a powerful magnet was placed beside it in the police property room.
I will, soon.<eos> I can't talk now okay, I gotta go.<eos> Bye.<eos> Great, great.<eos> I got one, I got one, here, look.<eos> Oh, yeah, I love it, I love her.<eos> Oh god, how she looks, isn't she pretty.<eos> God, look at that dress, look at the way it moves.<eos> Look what you did!<eos> Look at it, it's ruined.
Hold it a second.<eos> Mac, what's happening?<eos> I'm getting a tapping sound coming from the direction of the lab.<eos> I got a pretty big girder in my way here, though.<eos> Come on back to me one more time.<eos> I got some life down here, boys.<eos> Uh, MacGyver, the girder.<eos> Can you move it?<eos> Well, that'd take some doing.<eos> It's wedged in here pretty good.

No money.<eos> You give money to that woman, but no money to me or your child?<eos> That's right.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Then sell that radio and get the money.<eos> I won't sell it.<eos> - Go sell it!<eos> - No!<eos> I like it more than you.<eos> I paid a lot for it.
Nobody's home. It's too late.<eos> She's drowned and we're murderers. Matthew.<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, if you must know,<eos> I was in Diana's skiff but it sprang a leak and I had to climb onto the piling or sink.<eos> Ah, I see.<eos> Well, then the fact is I rescued you.<eos> Help was on the way and I was calmly waiting for it.<eos> You're most welcome.<eos> I am grateful for your assistance, Mr. Blythe, even though it was not required.
"Hush", she'd say, "Hush, Handel's in a passion, "<eos> Handel's in a passion,<eos> As if it were ever, had ever, been out of me, whether it were desolation or idle comicality,<eos> I was lenient with the princesses and they have smiled on me, as they should have done,<eos> Chide yourself by all means, but not excessively so.<eos> There's a way to go yet.<eos> In my time, when I first came upon these shores some 40 or 50 years gone,<eos> the English were still learning to be English, to see the world as theirs.<eos> Marlborough, poets and tradesmen, as well as militia, gardeners and builders of fine houses and town squares...<eos> There was opportunity, and now wealth, even if, like my great patron, Chandos, it was got somewhat illegally,
Not in front of the ladies!<eos> Not!<eos> Can you not hear that raging, thunderous sound, beyond time, beyond our time?<eos> Forever!<eos> I got to England, as I swore I would, on my own bottom,<eos> But as for heaven, the diapason closing in on man, the compass of notes it ran,<eos> I know not, we know not, but the trumpet must surely sound, It must,<eos> It does,<eos> I have heard, I have put it down myself on high,<eos> "The trumpet shall... It shall be heard on high,
See, out-of-state plates.<eos> Hey, williejoe!<eos> Uh, williejoe, uh-<eos> Me and the boys have been, uh, talkin'... and, uh, we been thinkin' about what we's gonna do with the mummy once we catch him.<eos> And, uh, we decided that we should think about this some more at home.<eos> Ain't nobody running out!<eos> Now wait a minute.<eos> We ain't scared, see?<eos> But a mummy's a special type of critter.<eos> See, it's already been killed once.
- Yes, dear.<eos> Um, ah, Claire<eos> - Claire, uh-<eos> - Oh. "Claire Rinfret," yes, of Paris, France.<eos> Did I-<eos> - Yes, dear.<eos> - My mittens!<eos> - They´re on the mantel where they always are.<eos> - Oh! My pipe.<eos> - I put it in the glove compartment.
- To find out what he's looking for.<eos> - He's looking for a clue.<eos> - A clue, a clue, a clue.<eos> - Gesundheit.<eos> I found it!<eos> It's a bill of lading.<eos> For canvas storage.<eos> - What riveting news!<eos> - No, no, no, this is great.<eos> Phillip left this bill of lading in the dressing table and then did the painting to make sure that his brother would look for it there and find it.
Great for the cholesterol.<eos> Sergeant, this still does not make any sense.<eos> To you, maybe.<eos> Look, Mrs. Fletcher.<eos> I really don't have time for this.<eos> Well, you should.<eos> And you should also be looking for that other eyewitness.<eos> If this Manny Farkus really fired before Patti had a chance to respond, perhaps he intended shooting her in the first place.<eos> Perhaps there was more than a random connection between the two of them.<eos> Ma'am, I don't know how you arrived at that one, but, uh, I sure will ask Miss Bristol about it... if and when she ever regains consciousness, that is.
Drinking destroyed her career.<eos> Finally, it destroyed her life.<eos> Actually, that isn't true, Barry.<eos> Your mother didn't fall off the wagon any more than she took an overdose of barbiturates.<eos> Not willingly, at least.<eos> Nor did she open the gas jets.<eos> What?<eos> [Jessica] Your mother always kept a pot of coffee going.<eos> When we broke in here, the pot was empty.<eos> - It had been cleaned out.
Right.<eos> Has to be.<eos> Although it does seem that the killer did try to pull... that very large bale ofhay over there closer to the body... probably to suggest suicide.<eos> Yeah. Either he was frightened off, or maybe he just changed his mind.<eos> Yeah, I can see that. Mm-hmm.<eos> I didn't like the look of that blood smear above his left ear... as if he'd been hit with a blunt object before he was hung.<eos> You have sharp eyes, Jessica.<eos> He was hit by something.<eos> Yeah. Well, I noticed the freshly splintered wood in the beam... where the rope was hanging over.<eos> I'm sure the sheriff guessed that it means... that the rope was supporting Mestin's weight... when it was being pulled over the beam.
A better name would be mufflers.<eos> You can't completely silence a gun. There's always some noise.<eos> Well, if the sound wasn't a gunshot, it might have been lost... in other household sounds like stereo, radio, television.<eos> All right. I'll buy that.<eos> Now, explain to me how somebody could get through the security system.<eos> There are guards on duty 24 hours at the front gate.<eos> They only admit visitors whose names are called down from the house... and double-checked when the visitors arrive.<eos> What about the service entrance?<eos> Back of the house, beyond the pool.<eos> Like the rest of the grounds, it's protected by a very sophisticated alarm setup with TVcameras.
And whatever you may say, Lytton, they could've built their own hibernation plant and refrigeration chambers anywhere.<eos> Well, why not on their own planet?<eos> I assume they had one.<eos> -What's the matter?<eos> -What is the matter?<eos> Yes, Doctor, what's the matter?<eos> Cyber Control reports that we are transmitting an irregular signal.<eos> Prepare for our arrival on Telos and bring the Doctor to me.<eos> Mondas, the Cyber planet, was destroyed.<eos> -Tell them how it was destroyed.
You're forcing an old man to make a choice.<eos> The times call for that.<eos> I know that only too well.<eos> What can you do about that?<eos> Do you have the time?<eos> Quarter past 1 :00.<eos> Damn!<eos> My watch.<eos> It doesn't work anymore.<eos> You know how I got it?
And why ? I would appreciate it"?<eos> There's nothing to appreciate.<eos> But that's polite.<eos> Does it have to be polite?<eos> I'll write it.<eos> How did that happen?<eos> My car broke down.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> I showed you this list of lawyers.<eos> It wasn't torn.
You look like Greta in that coat.<eos> She liked insects too.<eos> But they didn't like her the way that one likes you!<eos> That sound that you can hear is a mating call.<eos> You're exciting it.<eos> Smell it...<eos> Go on, smell it!<eos> It's sort of sweet.<eos> That substance is secreted by a gland.<eos> It too is meant to attract a mate.
Hurry up.<eos> Tom!<eos> That was close.<eos> She was gonna make me whitewash that old fence again.<eos> Tom Sawyer, you chowderhead.<eos> Open that door.<eos> If you want off so bad....<eos> -Oh, no.<eos> -Where did it go?<eos> Close enough to home to bark our shins, and now it's gone.
I'm just trying to remember if I turned my burglar alarm on at home tonight.<eos> Sometimes I forget.<eos> Oh, well, anyway.<eos> It's all right.<eos> That's all right. Forget it.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> No. I'd like to open the register. What if I got a rush now?<eos> Yeah, I see your point.<eos> What about a key? Do you have a key for that?<eos> - Yeah. But I keep it up in my apartment.
Okay.<eos> Get that away from me. Jesus!<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You're going to be sorry for this because I am going to get you.<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> Not again.<eos> What is this?<eos> Let's knock off for tonight. My back's killing me.<eos> Let's look for my statue, man.<eos> It's got to be around here someplace.
Okay.<eos> Marty, have you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?<eos> Yeah, well, I might've sort of bumped into my parents.<eos> Great Scott!<eos> Let me see that photograph again of your brother.<eos> Just as I thought.<eos> This proves my theory.<eos> Look at your brother.<eos> His head's gone.<eos> It's like it's been erased.
I'm sorry.<eos> It's just I'm really nervous.<eos> You want to take a minute to pull yourself together?<eos> Uh, Zach... For her, this is together.<eos> Robbie... they're in a suitcase over there, somewhere.<eos> Why is it only my ass that ever gets invited places?<eos> Please, Al. Your turn.<eos> Costumes are in there.<eos> Hats should be in this one.<eos> Listen, go up to the prop room, we've been using it for an office.
- That's not six.<eos> - One plus two plus two plus one.<eos> It was only one shot that got the chandelier.<eos> That's one plus two plus one plus one.<eos> Even if you're right, that'll be one plus one plus two plus one.<eos> Not one plus two plus one plus one.<eos> Okay, fine, one plus two plus one...<eos> Shut up!<eos> Point is there's one bullet left in this gun.<eos> And guess who's getting it?
Oh, sugar dumpling, let me taste some!<eos> You can catch a fish without a hook, girl.<eos> Looks like Albert brought his maid.<eos> Last time I saw that kind of hat was at my mama's funeral.<eos> There are only two kinds of children in this world God's children and Satan's!<eos> Babylon ain't no far-off place in the desert.<eos> It's right here!<eos> Just a few hundred yards from this holy place.<eos> The song I'm about to sing is called "Miss Celie's Blues."<eos> Because she scratched it out of my head when I was ailing.
Yes, well, apparently they're not inclined to do that for you, Captain.<eos> Is this your progress?<eos> Is this the shit that's supposed to knock our socks off?<eos> It's the beginning, yes.<eos> It's the bare beginning of social behavior.<eos> Of civilized behavior.<eos> Civil behavior is what distinguishes us from the lower forms.<eos> It's what enables us to communicate, to go about things in an orderly fashion, without attacking each other like beasts in the wild.<eos> Civility must be rewarded, Captain.<eos> If it isn't rewarded, there's no use for it. There's just no use for it at all.
- No, I've driven with him. He sees all right. Just, he doesn't keep his mind on it.<eos> I drove into the city with him last week. He stops at a green light. It turns red and he goes.<eos> - Maybe he's colour blind. - Pop? He's got the finest eye for colour in the business.<eos> - The boys in?<eos> - They're sleeping. - Happy took Biff on a date tonight.<eos> - Is that so?<eos> It was so thrilling, seeing them shaving together, one behind the other in the bathroom and going out together.<eos> - Did you notice? - Hm?<eos> The whole house smells of shaving lotion.<eos> Figure it out. Work a lifetime to pay off a house. You finally own it.
These executives, they live high.<eos> Know what I mean?<eos> I sure do.<eos> That's a terrific wing.<eos> I love this shape.<eos> Hey, do us a favor, pal.<eos> Name's Liddy.<eos> Gordon Liddy.<eos> Gord, take a look at the seventh Fetzer valve, will you?<eos> I think it's been sticking.
- That is the steering wheel.<eos> - I don't drive a car.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Everybody drives.<eos> Not if they live in New York.<eos> The traffic's terrible and you can't park.<eos> Do you realise you're endangering our lives by your incompetence?<eos> - Get out.<eos> - A friend has a house in the country.<eos> It's supposed to be an hour from 42nd Street. A lie.
Yes, come in.<eos> - Police.<eos> - Very funny.<eos> So, lots of grumbling in Nancy?<eos> - Not grumbling, just wondering.<eos> - What?<eos> What you're doing.<eos> Case is closed, isn't it?<eos> After all this time.<eos> I decide when it's closed.
I did.<eos> Almost.<eos> Tell her to come closer and belly dance.<eos> Come closer, Rose, and belly dance.<eos> Belly dance, you heear!<eos> I am, as muche as I can.<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> Tell her to do it faster!
I don't know. All I wanted in life was to get out of here and take care of my mother.<eos> Nothing else mattered, but now that my wish might be...<eos> Be happy, damn it.<eos> I'd give anything to get out.<eos> But is it fair?<eos> What?<eos> That I always end up with nothing?<eos> That I don't have anything truly my own in life?<eos> You've got your mother.<eos> Yes, but listen, though, she's had a life and lived it.
No, you don't understand.<eos> Part of me didn't want to leave.<eos> She killed all my friends, and I still didn't want to leave.<eos> Leaving her was the hardest thing I ever did.<eos> Colonel Carlsen looks exhausted to me.<eos> We should allow him to get some sleep, continue with this later.<eos> Very well.<eos> Thank you, Colonel.<eos> NASA tracking and ours... have just reported an unusual structure leaving Hailey's Comet.<eos> It's headed for us.
May I sit down?<eos> I want to ask about the man you spent the afternoon with, Ned Price.<eos> -I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> -I think you do.<eos> - Let me see your hand.<eos> - Beg your pardon?<eos> You're in there, aren't you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> It's gone from her.
I'm safe now.<eos> Accidents happen, you know.<eos> It wouldn't be so bad.<eos> It's too late for that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Don't come here anymore.<eos> I will.<eos> Look at this!<eos> It's so changed!<eos> There used to be a bank there but it's gone!
- Yeah. But we'd sure like you to stay.<eos> What do you think, Ab?<eos> Well, as far as I'm concerned, this is where I live.<eos> I'm home.<eos> Me too.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> - Hey there.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> - Hey, Karen.<eos> I got my daddy's car, but it's been acting funny.
-Cut it out!<eos> -Shut up!<eos> -Make me.<eos> Why don't you make me?<eos> Because I don't make monkeys, I just train them.<eos> Pee-wee, listen to reason.<eos> I'm listening to reason.<eos> That's my name, don't wear it out.<eos> Remember when I first saw your bike?<eos> You rode past my house, and I ran out to tell you how much I liked it.
I have to help him no<eos> Don't you dare using the scythe DEATH!<eos> and from behind, be ashamed!<eos> Hold on tight, get ready for the ride!<eos> Move, you old bag.<eos> you're in my way<eos> Sister SNOW FAIRY, you are helping him!<eos> you've got no right to do that!<eos> My scythe....<eos> I've got no power without it!
Let's try it another way.<eos> If I have to spend all day dragging this out of you, I'll flip! And when I flip, I get ugly.<eos> And I don't like doing that.<eos> See this gun?<eos> We found it on you.<eos> I haven't sent it to ballistics. If it was ever used for a stick-up, they'll know, and you'll get 5 years minimum.
I was in the bush down south with a mate.<eos> Well, sort of mate.<eos> As I began to go unconscious, I could see it all happening.<eos> I was watching from high up.<eos> I could see him, and I could see myself.<eos> It was really peaceful.<eos> Like a weight'd been lifted off.<eos> There was another thing.<eos> Like a light a long way off.<eos> I was traveling towards it Yearning to reach it.
Kent.<eos> - We'll have two minutes.<eos> Okay, open his mouth.<eos> Bulldogs.<eos> And transceiver.<eos> And tweezers.<eos> The braces gave me the idea.<eos> Perfect antennae.<eos> His head becomes a speaker.<eos> It's about time someone put it to good use.
"Guard, protect and cherish your land...<eos> "for there is no afterlife for a place that started out as Heaven"<eos> Charles M. Russell, Montana, 1926.<eos> 1926?<eos> That's ancient history, Dad.<eos> The computer said you were a smart-ass.<eos> And you never heard of computer error?<eos> Not this one.<eos> Take a look at that innocent little box, my boy.<eos> It's hooked to all those computers you saw downstairs.
Come on.<eos> Maybe I'm in here with the wrong guy.<eos> Dad, you're late!<eos> Mom's gonna yell at you!<eos> So how ya doin'?<eos> Fine.<eos> Don't you think that's a little bright, don't you think?<eos> A little bit?<eos> Where'd you get that hat?<eos> A friend gave it to me.
I knew it was in here!<eos> Tell us about this.<eos> According to "The Book of Kha-Khan," 1,200 years ago, a human possessing a golden hilt was reported to have crushed a planetary dictatorship which spanned 52 solar systems.<eos> It's him!<eos> The face on the blade!<eos> Six hundred years later, another possessed of a bladeless sword freed Galaxy 13 from a tyrant by the name of Nexus, who attempted to enslave the entire population with electronic mind control.<eos> I must find the blade!<eos> Tell me where it is. Please!<eos> There is no record of the blade's continued existence since the defeat of Nexus.<eos> It was presumed lost after the final battle on Trinia.
Squadron Sixteen reporting.<eos> All Missiles ready.<eos> Arm warheads.<eos> Warheads armed and ready.<eos> - They're launching!<eos> - Damn!<eos> Starfly!<eos> Dagg, it's trying to help us again!<eos> The fleet!<eos> It's gone!
Thank you.<eos> I'm freezing to death.<eos> My feet are killing me.<eos> I just swallowed my gum.<eos> Your incessant complaining isn't doing us any good.<eos> Can't you try and look on the bright side?<eos> Over there!<eos> Over there.<eos> There's a trailer, come on.<eos> It's locked!
Yes, gentlemen, after so many years the old imbecile did it.<eos> I'll go out in the morning wearing sport clothes.<eos> Without having to remain the whole day stiff in the god damned coffin.<eos> It is the wish of Von Dracula to freely distribute the formula.<eos> For free, for free...<eos> Old cretin!<eos> We'll be the exclusive producers of Vampisol.<eos> We'll make profits out of our collegues from all over the world, and not that Terrori beast.<eos> And where is the formula. Very far from here.<eos> It is dangerous to reveal it now that Terrori is on the lookout.
Good morning, Mr. O'Rourke.<eos> Here's that reporter I told you about.<eos> Mr. O'Rourke, I understand you have a problem.<eos> That Zorin oil-pumping station ruined one of the best crab patches in the bay.<eos> - Scared them away?<eos> - No, they didn't go nowhere.<eos> They just disappeared.<eos> I'd like to take a look at that oil-pumping station.<eos> That'll be tough.<eos> It's very heavily guarded.
A bag of bills, a sack!<eos> Come on guys, wake up!<eos> Awake, Antonet is coming!<eos> , we must help.<eos> That is certainly worth it, guys. and not the consumption that you bring me.<eos> Antonet, there will be a chip for your aunt, right?<eos> Sure, a slice, like to the others.<eos> But you say, same slace just for the torch?<eos> I think you're going through.<eos> Without it we could not open the box, moreover, this coup is mine.
Nice to have met you.<eos> I'm Yankov.<eos> Now our comps can build the model of life on that planet.<eos> We've discovered only lifeless planets before that.<eos> I still can't believe this!<eos> You look just like a little boy.<eos> Yeah, and I'm happy as a little boy.<eos> Still, the plant of this alien planet is somewhat queer...<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's interaction with the environment is too much active.
The estimation was that the fight would last for six months.<eos> At least.<eos> I was regarded as an optimist, I thought that it would be over in one month.<eos> The only one who got it right was Golbery, who said: " it will fall apart like a castle of cards."<eos> Despite the surprise, despite the weakening that the government had been experiencing, if president João Goulart had decided to resist,<eos> to counter-strike - he still had troops, he still had elements here in Rio, to take over the Guanabara palace, where Lacerda had been scheming - he could have won that fight.<eos> Or at least put up a longer fight.<eos> But he decided not to resist, which, in my opinion, was the right decision, because it avoided bloodshed, and today, after those informations were released by the Americans, we became aware of the involvement of the American government<eos> The story that the U.S. had sent ships to Brazil was old news.<eos> It had even been mentioned in an American talk show called "Firing Line" , with William Buckley.
- Can I do anything else for you?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - Leaving already?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Wait!<eos> I want you to read a letter.<eos> - A letter?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - It's addressed to you.
Sooner or later they'II kill me.<eos> - No, Mariana, you'II live.<eos> - If only. When hunter doesn't kill a ferret it's so as to use it to hunt.<eos> - He keeps it alive, but caged.<eos> - Get to work!<eos> They'II come for you, you'II see.<eos> Carry on, madam.<eos> I'II send this exhibit to the Court.<eos> The accused hasn't been told of that evidence.<eos> It was found in Mariana Pineda's house, in a flowerpot.
Because, Dr. Carthew, I looked for it.<eos> Wonderful, why, the bullet's still there!<eos> So a third shot must have been fired.<eos> Which means that a third person must have been present.<eos> Exactly!<eos> When you came into this room last night, you say that the door was ajar.<eos> Was not that window also open?<eos> I don't know, sir.<eos> No, sir.<eos> It was shut.
I give you a year's grace to grow your beard. twelve sweet, short months of life to do With as you Will.<eos> But When the seasons have come full circle...<eos> We shall meet again, and you shall pay your debt to me.<eos> Is there no hope for me beyond this?<eos> Must I spend the year awaiting death at your hand?<eos> Only fools and priests do squander life... With thoughts of death.<eos> So you Would hope to cheat your fate, GaWain, hmm?<eos> Well, every man hopes that.<eos> Especially the young. I'll give you a riddle.<eos> Mark it Well, for if by the time We meet again... you have fully understood every line... your life Will be restored to you.
A Russian craft flown by Russians carrying a few poor Americans who need our help....<eos> That also doesn't look too bad on the front page of Pravda.<eos> I don't know if I could convince our people.<eos> They wouldn't mind seeing you fail. They wouldn't mind it at all.<eos> Carrying Americans?<eos> I don't think they would allow that if they didn't have to.<eos> They don't have to.<eos> Have you checked Discovery's orbit lately?<eos> Have you checked the orbit?<eos> What about it?
That could never have happened or I would remember it.<eos> Where are Frank and Dave?<eos> They're fine.<eos> They're not here right now.<eos> Who are these people?<eos> I can only identify you although I compute a 65% probability that the man behind you is Dr. floyd.<eos> Don't worry, Hal.<eos> I'll explain everything later.<eos> Has the mission been completed?<eos> You know that I have the greatest enthusiasm for it.
You said you know me. Well, you don't. I want you to.<eos> It was a game during the playoffs.<eos> We were expected to win by a four-point spread.<eos> I was supposed to see we didn't win by so much.<eos> I kept putting it off because I felt good. You know, blow the other team out.<eos> In the fourth quarter, they scored 1 4 points.<eos> Everything was great.<eos> The spread was 4. We were ahead by 3. I didn't have to do anything.<eos> Then the quarterback he threw this pass.<eos> Put it right into my hands.
An Italian opera.<eos> Italian?<eos> That's not all.<eos> He has chosen for his subject, Figaro.<eos> The Marriage of Figaro.<eos> He's setting that play to music?<eos> Yes.<eos> What is this Marriage of Figaro?<eos> It's a French play, Kapellmeister.<eos> It has been banned by the emperor.
Good evening, Mrs. Vigne!<eos> Good evening, Reverend.<eos> How is your husband?<eos> That's just it...<eos> He's much worse. He wants the minister.<eos> I'll go.<eos> What do you mean by "serious things"?<eos> Certainly not what you're about to do.<eos> It's that music...<eos> I think I've found it, then I lose it again.
We'd decided to slit our veins with razor blades.<eos> First, the blades kept slipping from our hands.<eos> Then we didn't realize that blood coagulated so fast.<eos> We squeezed our veins, but nothing came out.<eos> In the end, we were smeared with blood, not knowing what to do.<eos> Simon started to vomit.<eos> We felt ridiculous.<eos> We wanted to wash.<eos> But the water main was turned off.<eos> We couldn't turn it on:
You are Paul Muad'Dib.<eos> And your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us.<eos> We welcome you.<eos> The dream unfolds.<eos> And now the prophecy.<eos> One will come. The voice from the outer world.<eos> Bringing the Holy War, the Jihad. Which will cleanse the Universe and bring us out of darkness.<eos> The wife and sons of Jamis.<eos> This water belongs to Usul.<eos> May he guard it for the tribe.
He's back.<eos> Want me to drive?<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> - It's getting late.<eos> Why didn't you take an earlier train? You were up.<eos> I just don't want to miss the train.<eos> - Is this seat taken?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I mean, yes.<eos> Yes, it is taken.
Let's go up!<eos> The stones are mine!<eos> You've betrayed Siva.<eos> Well, it's about time.<eos> Hold your fire!<eos> We know you are coming back, when life returned to our village.<eos> Now you can see the magic of the rock you bring back.<eos> Yes, I understand its power now.<eos> - You could've kept it.<eos> - They'd just put it in a museum. - Another rock collecting dust.
It was envy or infamy.<eos> Where shall I find one like this?<eos> It's my fault.<eos> Had I not left you alone, you would still be healthy.<eos> But now you're gone for good.<eos> What am I going to do now?<eos> Come on, look.<eos> It can be repaired. Only one piece came off.<eos> It's a clean cut.<eos> Maybe it was cracked. It wasn't cracked. It sounded like a bell.
Please, Don Lollo, come back another time.<eos> I told you that it was not the right moment.<eos> Please.<eos> No, no, Nunzia. Let him stay. I can give him my opinion.<eos> Don Lollo, on your part, you have to free the prisoner immediately.<eos> The potter, on his part, will have to answer for the damage caused because of his foolishness.<eos> By paying me for the jar. Come closer.<eos> I have to speak softly.<eos> Not as if it were new, mind you. Why?<eos> Because it was broken.
Let me see that bat.<eos> Not bad, kid.<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> I made it myself from a tree near home.<eos> "Wonderboy." You put that on there?<eos> What does it mean?<eos> I made it a long time ago, when I was a kid.<eos> I wanted it to be a very special bat.<eos> How about this lightning bolt?<eos> The tree I made it from was split open by lightning.
We, the people of Oceania will not rest until a final victory has been achieved.<eos> Death to the eternal enemy of Oceania.<eos> Death!<eos> Brothers and sisters... one week from now... in this very square... we shall, as a demonstration of our resolve... as a sure sign to those who attempt to threaten... our Party and our State... we shall execute publicly... the same number of Eastasian prisoners... by hanging, drawing and quartering.<eos> Big, Big, Big....<eos> "In accordance to the principles of Doublethink...<eos> "it does not matter if the war is not real...<eos> "or when it is, that victory is not possible.<eos> "The war is not meant to be won.<eos> It is meant to be continuous.
I have nothing to tell you.<eos> We'll charge you.<eos> I'm no murderer. I've been helpful.<eos> Check the record.<eos> No need.<eos> Tai. A murdered cop is something else.<eos> Lee, long time no see.<eos> Homicide takes care of all murder cases.<eos> An unsolved case usually fades away.<eos> Sometimes it would be forgotten altogether.
LOS ANGELES 2029 A.D.<eos> THE MACHINES ROSE FROM THE ASHES OF THE NUCLEAR FIRE.<eos> THEIR WAR TO EXTERMINATE MANKIND HAS RAGED FOR DECADES,<eos> BUT THE FINAL BATTLE WOULD NOT BE FOUGHT IN THE FUTURE.<eos> IT WOULD BE FOUGHT HERE, IN OUR PRESENT.
But he was one of the lucky ones.<eos> He managed to escape in a balloon during the Jimmy Carter presidency.<eos> - I bet he's got a lot of great stories.<eos> He would tell me about the large houses and expensive cars. How young people waste time watching television and listening to rock and roll.<eos> - What's wrong with television?<eos> - Not all television.<eos> '"M* A*S*H'" was OK and the '"Mary Tyler Moore Show'".<eos> It just seems like young people of America take freedom for granted.<eos> Wait. I don't think you're being fair. My history class once spent an entire week in Philadelphia.<eos> Maybe so. You can talk about freedom all you want, but still don't know what it's like to have to fight for it.
They are forcing me to create a horrible weapon.<eos> - Can't you refuse?<eos> - I wish I could. But they are holding my daughter.<eos> They'll kill her unless I complete the Polaris Mine by Sunday.<eos> Sunday?<eos> That's Simchas Torah.<eos> And the day the entire NATO submarine fleet passes through the Straits of Gibraltar.<eos> Is this the Polaris mine?<eos> Yes.<eos> By Sunday I will be able to arm it with a nuclear warhead.
- But I can't go on that plane.<eos> - But Hillary!<eos> I'm needed here.<eos> For as long as a single man is forced to cower under the iron fist of oppression, as long as a child cries out in the night, or an actor can be elected president, we must continue the struggle.<eos> No, Hillary.<eos> It is too dangerous for you in Germany, now.<eos> Yes, go with Nick.<eos> Don't worry about us.<eos> We will hear his music on the '"Voice of America'".<eos> We will hear it in the hearts of people, and in elevators everywhere.
Ain't that pretty? - What?<eos> - The lights just came on.<eos> RACHEL: How's that for magic?<eos> Oh, don't use the door!<eos> RACHEL: Why not?<eos> - Come in through the window.<eos> The door is booby trapped.<eos> We got light.<eos> I want you to stay together, and stay alert.<eos> This place might look deserted, but it's been used for something. Around the time we got here.
What's the matter?<eos> The statue was stolen?<eos> Master!<eos> Master, the statue was stolen!<eos> Master, master!<eos> Master, the statue at the temple was stolen!<eos> Stolen?<eos> Find it, quickly!<eos> Don't get upset, the doctor says you musn't get upset<eos> We can ask the police to investigate, if it was stolen then someone must be responsible
Show me.<eos> Let me have a look.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What have they done to you?<eos> I'm one of Dr. Sauerbruch's patients.<eos> You must be a big shot.<eos> Besides, I've got an artificial pneumothorax.<eos> I thought so when you were down by the door.<eos> I've got a scar, too.<eos> You don't see it at first sight.
I thought so, too.<eos> Concentrate on it for the next fonnight.<eos> Ever seen anything like it?<eos> Gentlemen, I think this offer of yours is some misunderstanding.<eos> I am now fony-four, our order book is in excellent shape.<eos> I have just registered three new patents... and taken on extra specialist Workers.<eos> I don't know Why I should retire from business.<eos> As We see it, you are not mass-producing. You specialize in products for technology, medicine... space exploration, etc...<eos> And We are a multi-national concern... operating in fields adjacent to yours.<eos> You need only imagine... What Would happen to your ring of patents once it is broken.
All my life I've dealt With money.<eos> But not With the Jewish bank, Lucie.<eos> They're people too.<eos> Careful, Lucie, the chalk pifs Somewhere here.<eos> Do you know how many Windows our house will have?<eos> No idea. Fifty-two.<eos> Like the villa at Usedom.<eos> I counted them once When I Was eight.<eos> Our house Will be nicer than the Gauleiteñs.<eos> I'll be happy When it's paid for.
-Indeed he is.<eos> And within 3 days, he is bringing a party of friends with him and the honorable Blanche Ingram.<eos> Good morning, ma'am.<eos> Welcome to Thornfield.<eos> -Welcome home, sir.<eos> -Thank you, Mrs. Fairfax.<eos> I have enjoyed the company of my only equal on horseback in the county.<eos> We've outpaced our friends by 5 minutes.<eos> I always adore this house.<eos> It is graced with an adorable guest.
Isn't it true?<eos> Without Satan, there's no struggle.<eos> And it's the struggle that keeps us alive.<eos> No.<eos> What keeps us alive is the point of that struggle:<eos> The hope of attaining perfection.<eos> If by perfection, you mean heaven....<eos> But you have to die to get there, don't you?<eos> Sometimes, I think you're after my soul.<eos> I am... unless it's already been taken.
Don't worry about that.<eos> What I'm more interested in right now is you.<eos> You see, I ran a make on you, and I can't find a trace of you anywhere.<eos> Is that against the law?<eos> I'll let you know.<eos> Sheriff, the damn car moved by itself!<eos> Get on out of here, the both of you, and go home before I run you in.<eos> Devon, I know what you're going to say... finding the electronic components parts should take priority.<eos> Very well put, Michael, but not entirely correct.<eos> What I was going to say was that I would have brought back your pizza for you, but I couldn't fit it into my briefcase... and then I was going to launch into the rest.
Rubbish<eos> I'm not talking rubbish.<eos> Poison Yama is looking for you everywhere.<eos> What has it to do with me?<eos> Everybody knows that you produced a crystal portrait and dripped blood on it.<eos> That's true, but nothing happened it's still a crystal portrait<eos> I've put it away.<eos> Where did you put it?<eos> Come, let me show you<eos> it's gone.
What does it matter?<eos> What if I'm not human?<eos> That night why didn't you go with us?<eos> I had given you too much trouble already<eos> I was worried, I didn't realise you'd...<eos> Why be happy if alive, and what's to be sad if dead.<eos> You're still young and shouldn't be so pessimistic.<eos> You should leave the Du Residence quickly.<eos> Why?<eos> Look, the moon is so beautiful it's a pity that after tonight the moon wouldn't be so bright and beautiful it would be stained with blood.
-Think?<eos> Damn it.<eos> I work closely with them every day.<eos> It's hard to--<eos> Be objective.<eos> I'm wasting my time.<eos> -Don't leave yet.<eos> -Why?<eos> Can I see the tape?<eos> It's hidden.
- What do you know about this Linda?<eos> - I already told you...<eos> Her name was on the torn-up diary and it's on the recording.<eos> - Who's the Linda you know?<eos> - I just know it can't be her.<eos> Let's have a look at the room.<eos> This is the room.<eos> We'll have to figure out a way to get in.<eos> - It's open!<eos> - I swear it was locked.
- It's the last reel of the film.<eos> - It was, half of it's missing.<eos> - Can you fix it?<eos> - It's junk, how can I fix this?<eos> Okay, let's give it a shot, but lots of pieces are missing.<eos> It will take a miracle to put this back together.<eos> But that's the same scene.<eos> Are you sure it's the last reel?<eos> Of course I'm sure, this is what they left us.<eos> Look at the state of it.
Just read your funnies.<eos> Wake up, Randy.<eos> It hit my cheek and it broke my glasses.<eos> There, see, it's just a little bump.<eos> You're lucky it didn't cut your eye.<eos> Those icicles have been known to kill people.<eos> - What's going on up there? - Nothing.<eos> We'll be right down.<eos> You stay away from that turkey!<eos> It's got an hour to cook. You'll get worms!
It's over.<eos> That's how it is.<eos> We're through.<eos> Let's go, kid.<eos> - Get lost. - Come on.<eos> Get lost!<eos> - Come on, let's go home.<eos> - I smashed your car.<eos> What?<eos> - It was parked in St. Paul's.
You've come to get me!<eos> You've come to get me! How's my boy? You having a good time at summer camp?<eos> It's yucky. Your mom said you were having fun.<eos> Well, you want to go home, then?<eos> - Yeah. - All right, let's go. Over the shoulder.<eos> Home we go. Think you can beat me to the Jaguar? Think you can beat me?<eos> God, you scared the shit out of me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> How'd you get in here anyway?<eos> Finished with your table. I brought it back.
Electricity is a form of energy.<eos> It is generated by power sources driven by water, steam, or atomic fission.
Danny?<eos> It's...<eos> It's Danny.<eos> It's all right, papa.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Do you remember Susan, your little girl Susan?<eos> I wanted to give her something.<eos> Is there such a thing as too much hope?<eos> Electricity is a form of energy.<eos> It is generated by power sources driven by water, steam, or atomic fission.
Woman... I spit on peace.<eos> I spit on you.<eos> Next time you present me with one of your little sluts, Mother dear... I'll squash you like a bug.<eos> Get that garbage out of here.<eos> Don't look up.<eos> We are riders of Fire Keep. We pay no heed to such trash.<eos> We have come, Lord Nekron, to negotiate between our two peoples.<eos> And the return to Fire Keep of my sister, Teegra... whom your warriors basely kidnapped.<eos> My father, King Jarol, has empowered me... to offer a peace between our kingdoms... in exchange for his continued sovereignty... and my sister's freedom.<eos> It seems to me that my envoys made a similar offer not long since... and that it was spurned by your illustrious sire.
Listen, I'm sorry for, well, you know.<eos> Better not disturb you anymore.<eos> Hey, why don't you hang around a little.<eos> I mean, where you gonna go?<eos> Find a hotel to stay.<eos> Oh, I just thought we could have traveled back together in the morning.<eos> A few minutes ago you were throwing me out into the storm.<eos> That was when you were Katrin De Korsi, superspy.<eos> You've got a car?<eos> It's parked around at the back.
Would you care for a glass of hot punch?<eos> Ah, no, thank you.<eos> Look, Mr Rand.<eos> I came here for some peace and solitude, so I can get some work done.<eos> Important work.<eos> - And might I enquire what kind of work?<eos> - I'm a writer.<eos> Oh, how fascinating!<eos> Don't worry. I have a great respect for literature.<eos> Within it lie all the treasures of mankind.
When did you take over?<eos> It was still wartime when I got it.<eos> After all, I was alone with a small child.<eos> And someone had to take over the store.<eos> Frau Schnittgens, was she another of Pauline': friends?<eos> She was an upstanding person.<eos> She never wanted to harm a soul.<eos> But then, there was that incident with the letter.<eos> You can think whatever you want, but one thing's for sure, she did receive the letter.<eos> And then suddenly the Gestapo had it.
It's bigger than two inches, though.<eos> Ben's got this whole place sewn up.<eos> I'll offer him the piano, if he's the problem.<eos> We've tried most things.<eos> - Did you try a piano?<eos> No.<eos> We offered him $1.5 million.<eos> I don't know if he plays the piano.<eos> He owns the whole beach?<eos> It's been in the Knox family for 400 years.
We need money!<eos> Edna, how much do you have?<eos> She's asleep, Clark!<eos> Russ, do you want to look through Edna's purse?<eos> She has 11 cents, Dad.<eos> Terrific.<eos> The motel will cash your check.<eos> They better. We're going to run out of gas.<eos> I'm sorry, sir. I can't accept this credit card.<eos> Why not? The computer says it's has been reported lost.
Put them on ice.<eos> I am supreme commander of SPECTRE, the Special Executive for Counterintelligence,<eos> Yesterday morning the American air force launched two cruise missiles from Swadley airbase in Great Britain.<eos> Through the ingenuity of SPECTRE, the dummy warheads they carried were replaced with live nuclear warheads.<eos> Your weapons of destruction are now safely in our possession and will be moved to two secret targets.<eos> Please note the serial numbers of the missiles.<eos> They will confirm the truth.<eos> Your weapons of deterrence did not deter us from our objective.<eos> A terrible catastrophe now confronts you.<eos> However, it can be avoided by paying a tribute to our organisation, amounting to 25% of your respective countries' annual oil purchases.
The emperor's made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.<eos> The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoint the exact location... of the emperor's new battle station.<eos> We also know that the weapon systems... of this Death Star are not yet operational.<eos> With the imperial fleet spread throughout the galaxy... in a vain effort to engage us... it is relatively unprotected.<eos> But most important of all... we've learned that the emperor himself... is personally overseeing the final stages... of the construction of this Death Star.<eos> Many Bothans died to bring us this information.<eos> Admiral Ackbar, please.<eos> You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest moon of Endor.<eos> Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational... the Death Star does have a strong defence mechanism.<eos> It is protected by an energy shield... which is generated from the nearby forest moon of Endor.
Oh, sure, I'll give you that, but what do I get?<eos> If it leads to an arrest, you might get a break... because grand theft auto is a lot of paperwork.<eos> And you know I don't like to do paperwork.<eos> W-Well, what do you mean I might get?<eos> I mean if you don't start doing something good... you're gonna get so much hard time that when you get out there won't be any cars.<eos> People will be getting around.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, the van. A blue van.<eos> I stole it for these three dudes who needed it for a few hours.<eos> The deal was I pick it up for them... and then I bring it back to where I got it... so nobody, not even the owner, knew it was copped.
Well, it's been 20 years since we had a little cuddle... and what do you do?<eos> Come in here and give me a kiss?<eos> No. You rush in and hack a hole in the wall.<eos> - Where's the map?<eos> - What map?<eos> If you say you don't know where it is...<eos> I'll nail your tits to the table!<eos> Oh, dear!<eos> I know where it is.<eos> It's burnt.
What's going on in there?<eos> Evening.<eos> Sounded as though there was a bit of a squabble.<eos> Squabble?<eos> - They're all dead.<eos> - All?<eos> Must have been more of a tiff then.<eos> Squabble, tiff.<eos> Mr. Moon!<eos> I imagine being in the Navy, you must know quite a lot about the sea and what's in it.
I only have a leg cramp.<eos> His temple artery is hemorrhaging!<eos> Press down on it.<eos> Hurry!<eos> Father.<eos> Makoto!<eos> You must not touch that container.<eos> I know you really want to look at it.<eos> Why not?<eos> You found it on the ground.
Now, 8500 of them are dead... because of your bomb.<eos> Please tell that to your people also.<eos> Who are you?<eos> lam Professor of Medicine at Nagasaki University.<eos> December 24th<eos> Dr. Nagai, we will again hear the bell ring.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks to you, Aoki-san.<eos> I never thought the bell could survive undamaged.<eos> God has watched over it.
As a physician, I had act like one.<eos> Not so.<eos> Even then, I was concerned about the way people saw me.<eos> Don't speak lightly of yourself.<eos> What's important is what you did or didn't do that day.<eos> I was inhumane.<eos> I thought I could fool myself, keep silent, and forget about it.<eos> Over the winter, many times I wished to die.<eos> My burn is my only saving grace.<eos> I could never go on living, If I had survived without it.
I thank you for showing me such goodness!<eos> He who tomorrow is to be called my husband, I shall appeal to his loving nature that he may show mercy to Friedrich, too.<eos> You bind me in fetters of gratitude!<eos> At dawn let me see you ready. Adorned in splendid garments you shall accompany me to the minster.<eos> There I shall await my knight to become his wife before God!<eos> His wife!<eos> How can I ever repay such kindness for l am powerless and wretched?<eos> If you allowed me to live with you I would always be the beggar!<eos> I am left but one power, no law robbed me of it;<eos> through it I could perhaps protect you, save you from the scourge of remorse!
Each Muslim is the messenger of Islam and defender of the religions.<eos> As the villains got away from their god and religions, the wars have begun and the world has been the target of all evil in space.<eos> Your holy book Koran which has been embraced by the Muslims and read for centuries, is a book that told one by one about the world, the space, ...and the phases which will be faced by the human civilization and all living, non-living creatures ever existed since the creation of the world and who will exist till doomsday.<eos> That book tells that human should believe to his death as he believes his birth.<eos> Death and immortality...<eos> The world was destroyed.<eos> Then around a mountain made of bronze came the 13th tribe.<eos> Those high bronze mountains protected from radiation.<eos> They melted the mountain.<eos> They made a sword and accumulated the mountain's power in it.
From what I hear, the ranchers have established 24-hour patrols on the whole water system.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Even if we cut off their water for a few hours, their herds'll stampede.<eos> Yeah, but what about the patrols?<eos> Well, in that case, somebody'll have to get hurt.<eos> Keep that bag open!<eos> I was just showin' Mike here what we gotta deal with.<eos> Well, as long as you're here, I better fill you in.<eos> You have my full attention.<eos> The water runs down that waterfall there... from the main reservoir into this basin here, where it's distributed by gravity flow to all eight of our ranches.
I have analyzed my self-monitors, and my beta and lambda circuits are in need of realignment.<eos> Also, the fiber optics in my scanners have suffered a 20 % reduction in opacity, probably due to my long incarceration.<eos> - What do you want? A tune-up or something?<eos> - Hardly.<eos> I require attention from an experienced cybernetic technician.<eos> Cyber, uh, "nician"?<eos> Where do you find one of them?<eos> We have seen a car similar to myself.<eos> Since I am the prototype, it is most likely an inferior production line copy.<eos> However, someone must own it... and, therefore, maintain it.
I don't want to be in the same shot with that guy.<eos> You going to let him talk like that?<eos> Forget it. This way I can get more close-ups.<eos> But I'll have to have a talk with the director.<eos> Will you tell us the truth?<eos> Who's the star of this movie, him or me?<eos> You, of course.<eos> Then why is the set only half finished?<eos> Rumor has it the final staircase scene has been cut. Tell me that's not true.<eos> It's been cut.
I had to go to Jura.<eos> No other choice.<eos> And I have to tell you that Jura, at this time...<eos> -Why, is Jura dangerous?<eos> -Depends for who...<eos> -Did you have diner?<eos> Take a piece of cake.<eos> -You could have let us know.<eos> -I sent a post card from Canada.<eos> -We never got it. It might be lost.
We have only one question sir.<eos> Tell me. In our municipality our president takes everything from us.<eos> He rapes our wives and daughters.<eos> When we protest, he kills us just like dogs.<eos> Continue.<eos> We want to know if it is possible to make justice for ourselves.<eos> No.<eos> Nobody can do that.<eos> You know that justice exists.<eos> Even if it's not perfect, you have to live by it.
He's incredibly learned and knows everything by heart.<eos> You said you'd been up all night, but I saw you asleep.<eos> There are many strange things that can't be explained.<eos> You realize that when you dabble in magic.<eos> Have you seen our mummy?<eos> - No.<eos> Come.<eos> Look carefully, Alexander.<eos> Can you see it breathing?<eos> It's been dead 4,000 years, but it breathes.
Very good.<eos> It shows you'll be on your guard against further fabrications in the future.<eos> Go to your mother and ask her forgiveness for all the sorrow and worry you've caused her.<eos> Go to your mother and ask her to forgive you.<eos> You hear what I say, don't you?<eos> I ask Mother's forgiveness for lying, and I promise never to do it again.<eos> Good, Alexander.<eos> The matter is resolved and need never be mentioned again.<eos> Imagination is a splendid thing, a mighty force, a gift from God.<eos> It's held in trust for us by the great artists, writers and musicians.
Please do not panic.<eos> How did you talk me into this?<eos> - You trust President Kennedy? - Of course.<eos> All right. Kennedy says we gotta be prepared for a nucleoid war.<eos> - It's nuclear, Louis.<eos> Nuclelar, nucular a bomb's a bomb.<eos> This is an official fallout shelter bed.<eos> Hey, you gotta be prepared, 'cause some day, when you least expect it...<eos> Ka-blam! Nucleoid war!<eos> - What's that? - It's started.
One more.<eos> This looks like a good time for some good news.<eos> The House passed its space budget yesterday which includes a vote for the shuttle.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> The country needs that shuttle mighty bad.<eos> You'll see.<eos> Nine years later, Columbia, the first shuttle, is ready to go.<eos> But there are worries.<eos> Some of its most vital components are new and untried.<eos> Like the blanket of tiles that will protect it from the fierce heat of reentry into the Earth's atmosphere.
Go up here and turn right.<eos> You know Bob Wills?<eos> Your Uncle Red wrote this tune they're doing right now.<eos> What're you doing in these parts?<eos> I'm just traveling through on my way to Nashville.<eos> - I've got a try-out on the Opry.<eos> - That ought to do it for you. The way you write songs and sing...<eos> How'd you like the way we've done your song?<eos> It's a lot better than I've ever done it.<eos> We've been playing this some on dances, the crowds love it... and all the guys in the band like it.
Faithfulness beyond any man's deserving.<eos> I will keep the color in your eyes when no other in the world remembers your name.<eos> There is no immortality but a tree's love.<eos> Oh, no, I'm engaged to a Douglas fir. Help, unicorn, where are you?<eos> Ooh, galls and fireblight! She shall never have you, the hussy!<eos> We will perish together!<eos> Did you see me?<eos> Were you watching, did - did you see what I made?<eos> Yes. It was true magic.<eos> Yeah. It's gone now, but I-I had it. It had me, but it's gone.
Smitty.<eos> It's post time.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You're 10 minutes late.<eos> Right. Come on.<eos> let's go. let's go.<eos> Ten minutes ago they had a table. you know.<eos> Come on. let's go.<eos> But it's gone.
- He's coming around.<eos> - That'll keep you going through the show<eos> - Come on, it's time to go<eos> - How do you feel? There is no pain you are receding<eos> A distant ship smoke on the horizon<eos> You are only coming through in waves<eos> Your lips move But I can't hear what you're saying<eos> When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse<eos> Out of the corner of my eye<eos> I turned to look but it was gone
If I got killed... could I visit her and show her how to get back here?<eos> You could tie a rope around me and hold it tight... then somebody could come and get us, and we could live somewhere else.<eos> Some people believe... that when you die, your soul goes to heaven.<eos> When Grandpa was dead... I looked at him in the hospital bed and I was watching... but I didn't see anything go up out of him.<eos> His soul is invisible, Robbie.<eos> You couldn't see it.<eos> But how come Grandpa isn't on television with Carol Anne?<eos> Some people believe that when people die... there's a wonderful light... as bright as the sun... but it doesn't hurt to look into it.<eos> All the answers to all the questions that you ever want to know... are inside that light.<eos> And when you walk to it, you become a part of it forever.
And then, some people die... but they don't know that they've gone.<eos> They think they're still alive?<eos> Maybe they didn't want to die.<eos> Maybe they weren't ready.<eos> Maybe they hadn't lived fully yet... or they'd lived a long time, but they still wanted more life.<eos> They resist going into that light... however hard the light wants them.<eos> They just hang around... watch TV, watch their friends grow up... feeling unhappy and jealous.<eos> Those feelings are bad.<eos> They hurt.<eos> And then... some people... just get lost on the way to the light... and they need someone to guide them to it.
They must pass through this membrane... where friends are waiting to guide them to new destinies.<eos> Carol Anne must help them cross over... and she will only hear her mother's voice.<eos> Now... hold on to yourselves.<eos> There's one more thing.<eos> A terrible presence is in there with her.<eos> So much rage.<eos> So much betrayal.<eos> I've never sensed anything like it.<eos> I don't know what hovers over this house... but it was strong enough to punch a hole into this world... and take your daughter away from you.<eos> It keeps Carol Anne very close to it... and away from the spectral light.
You're my enemy!<eos> You've destroyed me.<eos> You have mysterious powers.<eos> They multiply infinitely.<eos> You're not a human being.<eos> You don't belong to this earth!<eos> When looking at Querelle, Lysiane had already lost that feeling... fencers call "the fraternity of the sword. "<eos> She was alone.<eos> I know now... why I feel so abandoned.<eos> Querelle's inner harmony was indestructible... because it was sealed in that heaven of heavens... where beauty unites with beauty.
Jenner, you can't kill Nicodemus!<eos> No taste for blood, eh?<eos> They've taken the animal out of you.<eos> What if we're discovered?<eos> Ach, listen.<eos> The Brisby house is a large cement block.<eos> In the moving, what if it should fall?<eos> - An accident?<eos> - Of course!<eos> Cut the lines, and the weight of it will crush his bones!
It's the brawn.<eos> It takes more than talent to win, honey.<eos> You've got to have willpower.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You lack it.<eos> In this country, if you're not good at something, at anything, if you're not the best, the smartest or the toughest, that's it.<eos> You're screwed.<eos> You won't get anywhere.<eos> Well, how's your leg?<eos> Clinically it's healed, but I've got to tone up the muscles.
- Exception.<eos> Noted. Thank you.<eos> The jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Miss Costello.<eos> Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.<eos> The sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed.<eos> Her entire testimony must be stricken from the record.<eos> You shouldn't have heard it.<eos> That was my mistake.<eos> You must strike it from your minds.<eos> Give it no weight!
Her entire testimony must be stricken from the record.<eos> You shouldn't have heard it.<eos> That was my mistake.<eos> You must strike it from your minds.<eos> Give it no weight!<eos> Legally, it's over.<eos> Concannon was brilliant.<eos> Tell me about Kaitlin Costello.<eos> There's nothing to tell.<eos> It's been stricken from the record.
Live, no matter what...!<eos> Harlock!<eos> I'm glad to have met you at the end of this stupid war.<eos> I wish we'd met in different times...!<eos> Axis bastard!<eos> Go to hell! Die, damn you!<eos> Harlock!<eos> Don't die! Harlock!<eos> So long as the blood of my descendants continues to flow our friendship will not be forgotten!<eos> It won't be forgotten!
What's her problem?<eos> - She's an Ellen Jamesian.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> You don't know what an Ellen Jamesian is?<eos> No. What?<eos> She's taken a vow of frowns or something?<eos> She has no tongue.<eos> - What do you mean, she has no tongue?<eos> - I mean she has no tongue.<eos> It was cut off.
Good job, Blind Officer.<eos> - Did we get them?<eos> - We got them.<eos> Hi. What's your name?<eos> I'm sorry, Phil, but it just had to be this way.<eos> I guess so.<eos> Listen, when you tell people about this... and I want you to tell a lot of people... use me as a warning.<eos> You worked so hard to be a doctor.<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> Tell medicine that I'm no good for it.
Yes.<eos> That's a six-light-year jump.<eos> Good.<eos> We must be near Barnard's Star. - We can jump a ship there.<eos> - Can we?<eos> Ford, I hate to ask this, but what am I doing here?<eos> Simple.<eos> I rescued you from the Earth.<eos> - What happened to the Earth?<eos> - It's been disintegrated.
Pity it's such a dump! I could have a better time in a cat litter.<eos> What's this?<eos> - Whalemeat.<eos> Come on, you guys, we've got to get into this planet!<eos> I'm not into it!<eos> - INTO it! - INTO it?<eos> Would you stay out here in a dump like this?<eos> The Magratheans all lived underground, you know.<eos> Why-was the surface polluted or over-populated?<eos> No, they just didn't like it very much.
Won an award, you know.<eos> Lovely crinkly edges.<eos> I was most upset to hear of its destruction.<eos> YOU were upset? !<eos> Five minutes later, it wouldn't have mattered.<eos> - Big cock-up.<eos> The mice were furious.<eos> - Mice?<eos> Earthman, the planet you inhabited was commissioned, paid for and run by the mice.<eos> It was destroyed five minutes before the completion of the purpose for which it was built.
Then I'll tell you right now.<eos> Let me tell you now.<eos> - No, I can wait.<eos> Anna Akhmatova came to visit him.<eos> It was their last meeting.<eos> They spoke at length.<eos> She liked his music.<eos> He liked her poems.<eos> These verses of hers speak of his music:<eos> A wonder burns in it as its facets take shape.
How?<eos> He's like...<eos> There's a new method of treatment. It showed good results.<eos> Ah... That new discovery.<eos> Psycho-contact.<eos> - That discovery is 6,000 years old.<eos> - We need him to start speaking.<eos> Yes, Captain.<eos> Everyone has his own margin of safety.<eos> It can be calculated.
- No.<eos> - Does it hurt here?<eos> - And here?<eos> - No.<eos> - And now?<eos> - No again.<eos> No trace of the wound.<eos> Malingerer!<eos> There're more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.<eos> Everyone has his own margin of safety, and it can be calculated.
Higgins has some wonderful bourbon in here.<eos> I thought scotch was your drink, Magnum.<eos> Higgins, you're back.<eos> What a mind this man has.<eos> Oh, you're Higgins.<eos> Did you have a good time in England?<eos> Quite good, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Where's the car?<eos> Oh, it's being tuned up.
Mac said to quote you directly.<eos> You can say whatever you want.<eos> Just... say we were involved.<eos> That's true, isn't it?<eos> No.<eos> But it's accurate.<eos> Hot, huh?<eos> Not so hot, really.<eos> There's a "For Sale" sign by your house.<eos> Yeah, it's sold.
He had a stunted youth.<eos> What is this kid to you anyway, Louie?<eos> He comes in and takes your job away.<eos> And he took Louie everyplace he went.<eos> The kid's nothin' to me.<eos> I'm nothin' to him.<eos> It's more than I got elsewhere.<eos> His voice is changin' anyway.<eos> So let it change.<eos> Who says it's gotta change bad?
Blow, man!<eos> We are in Kansas!<eos> We are west of the Mississippi!<eos> I want a moment's silence here!<eos> And I think it's time I go alone.<eos> - Wait!<eos> - What about the car?<eos> - It's yours!<eos> - Thank you, son!<eos> It's stolen!
Where is he?<eos> I don't see him.<eos> And so I have decided at the end of my life... to marry the young woman, who, after many years of true friendship... came of her own free will to this city... when it was almost completely under siege, in order to share my fate.<eos> We have chosen death... to escape the disgrace of removal or surrender.<eos> I'm talking about Russian assault troops only 300 meters from here.<eos> -l think we can get out if we move now.<eos> -You're wasting your breath, General.<eos> The Führer will not leave Berlin, nor will I, my wife, or my children.<eos> I never wanted war.<eos> It was provoked solely by... the agents of Jewish Marxist interests.
When they let her out.<eos> She's in jail now together with the supporters.<eos> You asked me what I think about all this.<eos> We have to win.<eos> If not now, then next time. We'll win.<eos> L've been reading a lot.<eos> Agnieszka, Maciek and my daughter gave me books about Polish history.<eos> A lot of good things are written in them.<eos> There must be justice.<eos> It's secured by the constitution and other laws.
It might keep the fire off you, it might not.<eos> You know, you're an idiot.<eos> You're going to die tonight.<eos> You'll be ripped limb from limb.<eos> This is the last time I'll ever speak to you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Another thing...<eos> I've been up there.<eos> That thing isn't alone.<eos> It's got little ones.
Ok, don't worry.<eos> Arthur!<eos> What are you doing in my room?<eos> I was looking for keys.<eos> Which keys?<eos> I told ma i was gonna clean up the rooms but some of them are locked.<eos> Well, ljust have to find those keys, arthur, won't i?<eos> Or else we'll simply call a locksmith.<eos> In the meantime, could you go up on the roof and check the chimney?<eos> I think it is clogged.
Have you found the secret that I have lost?<eos> Yes.<eos> You and the land are one.<eos> You and the land are one.<eos> Drink.<eos> I am wasting away.<eos> I cannot die and I cannot live.<eos> Drink from the chalice.<eos> You will be reborn and the land with you.<eos> Perceval I didn't know how empty was my soul until it was filled.
I'm leaving for three days. Mathilde wouldn't come.<eos> She wants to move the furniture around.<eos> God help us!<eos> Why don't you open it?<eos> I'm dying to...<eos> I think I know...<eos> We saw it in a shop... Mathilde adored it.<eos> So we went in.<eos> She tried it on...<eos> I realized I wouldn't dare wear it in public.
I'm starved.<eos> - Here's a tender young morsel.<eos> - Get him, Isadora. Get him.<eos> - Hey, play fair.<eos> - Dora.<eos> I think my glasses are broken.<eos> - I got a new car!<eos> - It's beautiful!<eos> My dad bought me a new car.<eos> It's got push buttons. It's got a radio.
- I am listening.<eos> Did you know I didn't like them?<eos> - Did you hear Mommy and me talking?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Did you...<eos> Did you touch them?<eos> No.<eos> What happened?<eos> Oh, the meeting?<eos> It was cut short.
Stop it, you're hurting Mommy!<eos> ...brought you to consciousness.<eos> Jon.<eos> You ran, Jon.<eos> You ran to the garage, ashamed of yourself, looking for this hand, wanting to destroy it forever, this evil in you.<eos> And there you had a massive amnesiac attack.<eos> You turned your rage on yourself.<eos> The life and death struggle, Jon, it's not over yet.<eos> Don't be afraid of the pain.<eos> Just go into it.
And, of course, with the birth of the artist, came the inevitable afterbirth.<eos> The critic.<eos> In the year one million BC, it is thought the first Homo sapien marriage occurred.<eos> It was shortly followed by the first homosexual marriage.<eos> One of the first weapons man invented was the spear.<eos> In ancient times, man was ignorant as to the cause and nature of death.<eos> So death was greeted with a certain degree of awe.<eos> But because man did not have the time for complicated rituals, funeral services were often brief.<eos> Even in early man, the need to laugh was vital for emotional survival.<eos> Music began long before it was formalized into notes and phrases.
What did the landlord say? Nothing.<eos> He was drunk, humming a song...<eos> No neck-ties, no gold we've got...<eos> He gave me the key and I moved in.<eos> I've been longing to see you.<eos> - And how's your wife?<eos> - She's with her father, thank God.<eos> They're worried about the Republic.<eos> In Hamburg, the foreigners were also very worried about Germany about German culture, whose Number-One-Parrot you are.<eos> As if a peril threatened it.
Come on!<eos> I was just having a little bit of fun.<eos> Yeah yeah, sure.<eos> Hey, you guys, where's Mike and Harriet?<eos> Maybe Harry Warden got them.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Howard, come along and behave yourself.<eos> Yeah, let's go.<eos> My blanket!<eos> Oh, come on, you'd forget your head if it wasn't tied on with rope.
I mean, you know, following omens and so on... is probably just a way of letting ourselves off the hook... so that we don't have to take individual responsibility for our own actions.<eos> But I mean, giving yourself over to the unconscious... can leave you vulnerable to all sorts of very frightening manipulation.<eos> And in all the work that I was involved in, there was always that danger.<eos> And there was always that question of tampering with people's lives... because if I lead one of these workshops, then I do become partly a doctor... and partly a therapist, and partly a priest.<eos> And I'm not a doctor, or a therapist, or a priest.<eos> And already some of these new monasteries... or communities or whatever we've been talking about... are becoming institutionalized... and I guess even in a way, at times, sort of fascistic.<eos> You know, there's a sort of self-satisfied elitist paranoia that grows up... a feeling of"them" and "us" - that is very unsettling.<eos> But I mean, uh, the thing is, Wally, I think it's the exaggerated worship of science... that has led us into this situation.<eos> I mean, science has been held up to us as a magical force... that would somehow solve everything.<eos> Well, quite the contrary. It's done quite the contrary.

- Pardon?<eos> - That's it.<eos> The ghastly sin is dissipated.<eos> Erased from existence, and another thing a body wouldn't last half a day out here with all the birds and the insects.<eos> - I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - I'm talking about sex.<eos> L am talking about sex.<eos> Stolen from a young girl in the back of a van or a seedy motel.<eos> I'm talking about guilt. Terrible guilt. Awful guilt.<eos> A guilt so terrible that it can only be obliterated by spreading the evidence all over the countryside.
You said three liters!<eos> Bet's on!<eos> Three liters!<eos> I had to pee...<eos> It was warm, so I said to myself: go pee outside it'll be a change from the potty...<eos> I step out and I see a saucer... there, in your field!<eos> I couldn't pee anymore and I ran to warn you.<eos> Where is it, your saucer?<eos> So, show it to me...<eos> It's gone...
The earth... after "the raining"!<eos> That's it... spoken like a true "houmme" (man)!<eos> I speak like a true "houmme"?<eos> Come on, taste this...<eos> It's getting better and better, Le Glaude!<eos> Oh, you called me Le Glaude... that gives me pleasure!<eos> That proves that you're warm all over!<eos> Yes, Le Glaude...<eos> Oh, by the way, how did they find my soup up there?<eos> It has been found... dangerous!
Here you go...<eos> Your box!<eos> The Comittee of Heads has authorized me to leave it with you in order to speak with you at any time...<eos> Wh..what would I do with it, I can barely wind up a watch!<eos> You won't have to touch it...<eos> Whenever we'll want to talk, it'll light up, that's all!<eos> But Le Bombé, when he'll see this gizmo, he'll...<eos> He won't see it, the box...<eos> It'll be invisible to him...<eos> It is tuned only to your personal airwaves, yours only!
- Yeah, agreed.<eos> Come, come, come on.<eos> You said just a week, Dad, right?<eos> Maybe more, maybe less.<eos> May depend on your mother.<eos> - Dad.<eos> Well, look after your mother.<eos> Goodbye, Angie.<eos> The two behave yourselves.<eos> The other side of the disc works well will also be a success. This very excited about it.
- No way to drill?<eos> - Drill what?<eos> They're custom-made.<eos> You bang on this box all day, nothin' happens.<eos> And I am pulling a lot of exposure.<eos> Sixteen, 18 hours in there.<eos> Your end covers the risk. 830,000.<eos> Four million at wholesale in unmounted stones.<eos> - What's the fifth alarm?<eos> - We cannot run it down.
So I began to pray, and then I began to go price vans.<eos> But I didn't feel like my prayers and the prices I found on the vans... just coincided the way they ought to 'cause they were far out of my reach.<eos> But still, I feltlike if the Lord wanted me to have a van, I'd get one.<eos> So in the process, a couple of weeks after I'd given up the idea... of finding one that I could afford... I ran into a man, and he had a van.<eos> I was looking at it.<eos> He gave me the price on it.<eos> I told him, "That's out of my range. "<eos> He said, "I've got a friend over in Marianna...<eos> "that has a brand-new '79 van.<eos> "It's been on his lot for eight months...

And now, you see, my jar is nearly full.<eos> It grows.<eos> It crawls.<eos> It crawls up the side of the jar, you see?<eos> I reckon it's gonna fill up this jar.<eos> In two more years, itwill fill up this jar.<eos> They say it grows 14 feet a year... out where the town that Billy the Kid got Killed.<eos> They say itwill cover that town in a year to come.<eos> This century, less than 100 years...<eos> - that desertwill eat it up.
But, Mr Carter...<eos> Mr Carter?<eos> I think I have a way out of this.<eos> We call the police, and we have 'em send over one of their sketch artists.<eos> And Miss Balbricker can give a description.<eos> We can put up "Wanted" posters all over school.<eos> "Have you seen this prick?"<eos> "Report immediately to Beulah Balbricker."<eos> "Do not attempt to apprehend this prick as it is armed and dangerous."<eos> "It was last seen hanging out in the girls' locker room at Angel Beach High School."
The secret of your life on Mars.<eos> On Tir.<eos> This is the planet Tir.<eos> Yes.<eos> Tir.<eos> Secret?<eos> There is no secret.<eos> Anyone with eyes can see the way to live.<eos> - How?<eos> - By watching life... observing nature and cooperating with it.
— each organ, each thing — no matter what intertwines that makes the person bedridden, a fiction.<eos> There´s a sultan some sort of sultan, with a monkey´s head with his bathrobe in the head<eos> that spits like a string that has multiple nodes which registers a piece of music into the bare buttocks of a man<eos> lying down over a music book and half hidden by a strange instrument which is some sort of graft, lute and harp.<eos> And on the harp, like a torture there is a man hanging<eos> And next to it, a quite strange instrument which is musical but it´s a little bit like the boots<eos> which were used for questioning in the Middle Ages to those who were tortured<eos> A man turns the handle which crushes with the instrument one person that seems to obtain from his wand a musical sound from a little triangle.<eos> And it´s also curious in this instrument, the fact that the little triangle with which<eos> the torture tries to obtain a musical sound seems designed it´s as if it was designed over the instrument it doesn´t seem like a relief to the point in which there´s no difference between relief and the absence of it.
Are you asleep, guest?<eos> Who is that creeping in?<eos> It is I. Listen to me!<eos> Hunding lies in heavy sleep.<eos> I seasoned his drink with a drug.<eos> Use the night to save yourself!<eos> Your nearness makes me safe!<eos> Let me show you a sword.<eos> Oh, if you could only win it I could call you the noblest of heroes.<eos> It was destined for the strongest alone.
Let the sword I fearlessly hold be witness!<eos> Wälse promised me that one day, in direst need, I should find it.<eos> Now I grasp it!<eos> Holiest love's highest need, yearning love's searing need, burns bright in my breast, drives me to daring and death.<eos> Needful do I call you, sword.<eos> Notung, stubborn steel, show me the sharpness of your cutting edge!<eos> Come forth from your scabbard to me!<eos> Woman, you see Siegmund the Wälsung!<eos> As bridal gift he brings this sword.<eos> With it he wins the fairest of women and carries you off from his enemy's house.
But very ancient cultures would have seen different constellations because the stars move with respect to one another.<eos> We can give a computer the present positions and motions of stars and then run the patterns back into time.<eos> Every constellation is a single frame in a cosmic movie but because our lives are so short because star patterns change slowly we tend not to notice it's a movie.<eos> A million years ago, there was no Big Dipper.<eos> Our ancestors, looking up and wondering about the stars saw some other pattern in the northern skies.<eos> We can also run a constellation, Leo the Lion, say, forward in time and see what the patterns in the stars will be in the future.<eos> A million years from now, Leo might be renamed the constellation of the Radio Telescope.<eos> Although I suspect radio telescopes then will be as obsolete as stone spears are now.<eos> Or, here's the constellation of Cetus the Whale.<eos> A million years ago, it may have been called something else.
Welcome to the planet Earth. A place with blue nitrogen skies oceans of liquid water cool forests soft meadows.<eos> A world positively rippling with life.<eos> In the cosmic perspective, it is, for the moment, unique.<eos> The only world in which we know with certainty that the matter of the cosmos has become alive and aware.<eos> There must be many such worlds scattered through space but our search for them begins here with the accumulated wisdom of the men and women of our species acquired at great cost over a million years.<eos> There was once a time when our planet seemed immense.<eos> When it was the only world we could explore.<eos> Its true size was first worked out in a simple and ingenious way by a man who lived here in Egypt, in the third century B.C.<eos> This tower may have been a communications tower. Part of a network running along the North African coast by which signal bonfires were used to communicate messages of state.<eos> It also may have been used as a lighthouse a navigational beacon for sailing ships out there in the Mediterranean Sea.
The Dutch sailing ships brought back rare and valuable commodities from the new worlds they visited.<eos> Our Voyager spaceships return rare and valuable information to computerized wharves on this shore of the sea of space.<eos> Here the data are allowed to be stored, enhanced, processed and treasured.<eos> Maps of alien lands will be generated from this information.<eos> In this electronic warehouse are tens of thousands of images of previously unknown worlds.<eos> How does a picture from the outer solar system get to us?<eos> Sunlight shines on Europa, and is reflected back to space where some strikes the phosphors of the Voyager television cameras, generating an image.<eos> The image is radioed back across the immense distance of half a billion kilometers to a radio telescope on Earth. One in Australia, say.<eos> The telescope then passes the information via communications satellite in Earth orbit to Southern California.<eos> There, it's transmitted by a set of microwave relay towers to a computer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and there it is processed.
Radio telescopes have even detected the cosmic background radiation.<eos> The fires of the big bang cooled and red-shifted faintly echoing down the corridors of time.<eos> This is the very large array a collection of 17 separate radio telescopes all working collectively in a remote region of New Mexico.<eos> Modern radio telescopes are exquisitely sensitive.<eos> A distant quasar is so faint that its received radiation by some such telescope amounts to maybe a quadrillionth of a watt.<eos> In fact, and this is a reasonably stunning piece of information the total amount of energy ever received by all the radio telescopes on the planet Earth is less than the energy of a single snowflake striking the ground.<eos> In detecting the cosmic background radiation in counting quasars in searching for intelligent signals from space radio astronomers are dealing with amounts of energy which are barely there at all.<eos> These radio telescopes, rising like giant flowers from the New Mexico desert are monuments to human ingenuity.<eos> The faint radio waves are collected, focused assembled and amplified, and then converted into pictures of nebulae, galaxies and quasars.<eos> If you had eyes that worked in radio light they'd probably be bigger than wagon wheels and this is the universe you'd see. An elliptical galaxy, for example leaving behind it a long wake glowing in radio waves.
The language of the brain is not the DNA language of the genes.<eos> What we know is encoded in cells called neurons tiny switching elements every connection representing one bit of information.<eos> How many neurons do each of us have? Maybe 100 billion.<eos> Comparable to the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy.<eos> And there are something like 100 trillion neural connections.<eos> This intricate and marvelous network of neurons has been called an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern.<eos> Even in sleep, the brain is pulsing and throbbing and flashing with the complex business of human life: Dreaming, remembering, figuring things out.<eos> Our thoughts, our visions, our fantasies have a tangible, physical reality.<eos> What does a thought look like?<eos> Well, it's made of hundreds of electrochemical impulses.
Across the millennia an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you.<eos> Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions.<eos> Binding together people who never knew each other.<eos> Citizens of distant epochs.<eos> Books break the shackles of time.<eos> A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.<eos> And this room is filled with magic.<eos> Some of the earliest authors wrote on bones and stones.<eos> Cuneiform writing is the remote ancestor of the Western alphabet.<eos> It was invented in the Near East about 5000 years ago.
Here.<eos> Show me.<eos> What about the four queens?<eos> - See you tomorrow.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> I had an idea, girls need visit one of the local islands.<eos> Why not come to me, It'll be fun.<eos> If you pay, we will.<eos> What is the island?<eos> It's called Cat Island.
Everyone else was in church.<eos> I used to whip down the riverbank for a bit of smooching.<eos> Worst thing about dying, no more girls.<eos> Well, coming up for the homestretch.<eos> - Any news of the other two cases?<eos> - No, nothing.<eos> In my view, everything hinges on the last one.<eos> The German missionary.<eos> - You sticking with that story?<eos> - Why, what's wrong with it?
I haven't even told him about the scholarship I didn't get.<eos> I'll end up working in a lumber yard the rest of my life.<eos> What's wrong with lumber? I own two lumber yards.<eos> I notice you don't spend too much time there.<eos> I'm not sure where they are.<eos> I like you, Betty.<eos> That's Danny, sir.<eos> Danny.<eos> I'm going to give you a little advice.<eos> There's a force in the universe that makes things happen and all you have to do is get in touch with it.
I want to show him that.<eos> I want to talk to him.<eos> Let me go!<eos> Senator!<eos> Look at this medal.<eos> It's a baptism medal.<eos> - It's got your name on it.<eos> - You got him?<eos> - We got him.<eos> - It was buried with the body.
Whatever you want to call it.<eos> - How much?<eos> - My God.<eos> All right, how much do you want for this farce that you've concocted?<eos> This isn't blackmail.<eos> I've been dealing with vermin like you for years.<eos> You wait your chance, then you come in with a story so patently incredible-<eos> Truth terrifies you, doesn't it?<eos> It's the truth.<eos> It won't be buried.
Shit.<eos> Hey, man, wake up.<eos> Hey, man, wake up.<eos> We've been ripped off, man. We've been ripped off.<eos> What?<eos> Where?<eos> Who? Who did it?<eos> Oh, the van.<eos> The van's gone, man!<eos> I parked out in front last night. Now I went out there, and it's not parked out in front no more.
The van's gone, man!<eos> I parked out in front last night. Now I went out there, and it's not parked out in front no more.<eos> Somebody took us.<eos> Shit, why did I take it home?<eos> Why did I take it home?<eos> We gotta call somebody.<eos> Where's the phone book?<eos> What? The van, the van!<eos> I parked the van out there, and now it's not there.<eos> It's gone.

The van, the van!<eos> I parked the van out there, and now it's not there.<eos> It's gone.<eos> Yeah, it's gone. Duh, uh, yeah.
Where's the phone book, man?<eos> What am I gonna tell 'im?<eos> What am I gonna tell 'im?<eos> I'll tell 'im I lied.<eos> That's what I'll tell 'im, man.<eos> Why don't you tell 'im the truth, man?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I can just see me tellin' 'im...<eos> "Mr. Straumberg, you know that van that I wasn't supposed to take home overnight?<eos> Well, I took it home overnight, and it got stolen."
Just a minute.<eos> It's for you.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi, Mr. Straumberg.<eos> How are you, sir?<eos> I was just gonna call you.<eos> You'll never guess what happened.<eos> I took the van out overnight, and I kept it.<eos> And, uh, it's just been stolen.
That was the intention.<eos> But by the time the chaplain recovered from airsickness, we were over Les Invalides.<eos> Will your wife watch the flight?<eos> No.<eos> She said, "Too much entertainment, and not enough research."<eos> What about the timing?<eos> For the inaugural flight, I intend to use lights, so the most auspicious time would be in the evening, round about now.<eos> I'll make it down into the shadow of the building when the shadow is at its longest.<eos> That shadow is important to you?<eos> Consider the times it's rotated around this building.
Again Pulat found out, and crashed at sea.<eos> He turned up five months later on Smith Island in the New Hebrides.<eos> Stachia suggested Pulat should come and live at the Vogelstrasse.<eos> But after months of impossible situations, swapped identities and frustrated privacy, Stachia could stand it no longer and walked out.<eos> She wrote and illustrated a story about a wooden chair that grew back again into a tree, bore fruit and propagated a forest of chairs.<eos> The story was bought by a seed company and Stachia wrote their advertising copy.<eos> With funds from the company's publicity account, she built up an aviary of tropical birds in Mexico City and then in Amsterdam.<eos> Before long she met Van Hoyten, the Head of the Ornithological Department of Amsterdam zoo and they were living together at the time of the VUE.<eos> Stachia's VUE complaint is rare.<eos> It has been diagnosed as de faire blessure or the opening of old wounds.
Despite attempts to amalgamate them into one person there have in fact been three Cissie Colpitts in Goole since 1931.<eos> Propine Fallax is chronologically the third.<eos> The accident of a marriage licence got her into the survey, which is fitting, for she was President of the Goole Water Tower Film Vault, home of the VUE Commission's archive.<eos> Cissie Propine Colpitts grew up in the streets around the water tower and must have known many of the Yorkshire cameramen who made up the Goole Experimental Film Society.<eos> The original brick water tower, the Pepper, built in the 1900s became inadequate for Goole's growing population and in 1933 a new and larger concrete tower, the Salt, was erected by the Humber Authority on allotment land<eos> The tower filld the space between the railway line and an abattoir.<eos> The tower was bequeathed to Propine on her fifth birthday on the understanding that the rents were paid into an account whereby half the interest was available for the Goole and District Camera Society and the other half paid for dancing lessons.<eos> The second Goole Cissie Colpitts married a bicycle manufacturer and moved to York.<eos> She bequeathed her local film material collection to her namesake.<eos> It was stored in hen coops, in the abattoir and in the base of the old brick tower.
Nothing moved on the deck, but she held her course.<eos> My dad and two of his hands boarded the brig-- the "Resa Jane."<eos> No one was on board.<eos> There was food on the table... and a hot, steaming cup of coffee.<eos> But underneath, the tin cup was rusted to the table.<eos> And then something caught my father's eye.<eos> It was a gold doubloon minted in Spain, 1867.<eos> My dad picked up the coin, put it in his breast pocket... of his jacket, and zippered it up.<eos> He came home, told us the story.<eos> And he unzippered the pocket to give me the coin. It was gone.
How are you, Gabby?<eos> - It's Sunday.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, they really hit Tom.<eos> Seven times.<eos> From his ankles to his throat.<eos> He was set up good.<eos> We found strands of black hair on the pillowcase.<eos> This voodoo doll was lying on Tom's chest.<eos> It's stamped Port Au-Prince, Haiti.
A former chief, Thomas Neeley, was found shot to death early this morning.<eos> Lieutenant Barney Caine has been named to head up the investigation by Commissioner Harris.<eos> Tom Neeley served this community for 30 years.<eos> His body's not even cold yet, so let's not destroy his memory in one night.<eos> - That's all I've got to say.<eos> - One more question, if we may.<eos> The goddamn press.<eos> Okay, fellas, where were we?<eos> Like I said, the weapon was a.22 automatic but they found a voodoo doll on top of Tommy's body.<eos> Inside it was a half a kilo of cocaine.
Good morning, Shoe Stop.<eos> May I help you?<eos> I have a hobby. I like to chew on shoes.<eos> - It's something usually I do at home, but... - You like to what?<eos> Chew on shoes.<eos> Today is my day off and I wondered whether I could come down to Shoe Stop and just chew on some of the shoes down there for a while.<eos> Get out of here or I'll personally kill you.<eos> I don't take them home. I mean, I'm not gonna wear them.<eos> Is it going to be noticeable?<eos> If another customer comes in and wants that shoe to wear, is it gonna be noticeable that somebody nibbled on it?
- All right!<eos> I'm all right!<eos> Let's go.<eos> What happened?<eos> They came this way and killed him.<eos> Well, what'II you do out here now?<eos> Work our land.<eos> Without a man?<eos> He paid, uh, $150 for it.<eos> We own it now.
That was dumb, wasn't it? !<eos> Very sorry!<eos> You're French?<eos> French, and an archaeologist.<eos> With the Grouillard mission, I suppose.<eos> Yes, but they all left 6 months ago.<eos> I stayed...<eos> I like to finish whatever I've started.<eos> - Bravo.<eos> - I'll leave this town when it's revealed all its secrets to me.
Are you acquainted with the book of enoch?<eos> A text which dates back to more than 4000 years ago.<eos> It contains man's first recorded description of his boundless mortal fear in the face of malice itself the demanding implacable enemy who's search for blood is never satiated.<eos> Mary, tell your experience.<eos> Everything you've witnessed during our last seance.<eos> The city of the dead... the living dead.<eos> A cursed city where the gates of hell have been opened.<eos> Where exactly is this city?<eos> I don't know where it is.<eos> All i know is that it is called dunwich.
- Oh, no, you don't.<eos> Nick, she's smiling.<eos> Got a big grin spread all over her face.<eos> Race ya, honey blonde. No!<eos> Women in love coming through.<eos> - Where's the medical examiner? - He's on his way.<eos> I also called for the meat wagon.<eos> Any sign of her car?<eos> No, Murch must have driven it off after killing her.<eos> I got an APB out on it.
- Bye, gals.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I could die right here.<eos> - Bye!<eos> - Bye, Bandit!<eos> - Howdy.<eos> - What do you boys need?<eos> We're here to pick up a crate.<eos> Do you have a crate number 1444?<eos> Got it right here.
How was the play?<eos> Did you enjoy it?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> A-ha!<eos> "A-ha," what?<eos> "A-ha," where ya goin'?<eos> I'm going on a trip.<eos> Where? I have no idea.<eos> What about the play?<eos> Well, it isn't done.
Bombs away.<eos> And here's some bubble water for you.<eos> Ah-ha! That's the real thing.<eos> Voila!<eos> Like the service?<eos> Whoopee! You want some?<eos> Go ahead!<eos> Hey, give me me bottle back.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hand it over. I want it back.
- Stop it, damn you!<eos> This death is no fault of mine!<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll do my duty. Come on.<eos> My God!<eos> The stench is more than I can stand!<eos> That's the odor of death, Father...<eos> Ego te absolvo in nomine patris et fili et spiritus sancti...<eos> If one day we have to leave each other...<eos> My life has meaning only when it's fed by your love...
Good, I'm happy.<eos> Was about time.<eos> I'm coming!<eos> Must look funny a dentist with a leg in plaster.<eos> I have the X-rays.<eos> It's healing correctly.<eos> Parking time over!<eos> You have your car here?<eos> Sure.<eos> It really got hit, but he is still driving.
When... when could we get together?<eos> When?<eos> Well, tomorrow... I can't.<eos> The day after tomorrow... No, that's not certain either.<eos> But Monday...<eos> On Monday at two.<eos> And I'll say... Well, I'll think of something.<eos> Monday at two.<eos> Near your place, round the corner in Clemensstrasse.<eos> I have a black car. It'll be parked there.
I'm just chickenshit.<eos> Franz?<eos> Listen. Franz.<eos> I'm sorry. Sorry. I was somewhere else for a moment.<eos> Forget it. It doesn't matter.<eos> It's just that I'd like to see... I'd like to see your injury.<eos> It looks rather nasty.<eos> It's a lot better now, you know. It used to be much worse.<eos> Do you always keep your sleeve in your pocket like that?<eos> Do you stick it in yourself, or is it sewn in?
They're heavy, these banknotes.<eos> Son, you don't have a 10,000-franc note, do you?<eos> You never know, huh?<eos> Don't do anything stupid, OK?<eos> Goodbye, sonny.<eos> No, Georgeo.<eos> I'm not crazy.<eos> You think I don't know these notes are just paper?<eos> It's all I have from Algeria.<eos> I'll die with it.
I came up with it thanks to my research.<eos> Imagine!<eos> Make me happy. Try it.<eos> Not on your life!<eos> Are you barmy?<eos> Do you have a spoon?<eos> A spoon?<eos> I'll go see.<eos> I have this.<eos> But it hasn't been used.

Promise to go to bed if I tell you a story first?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Let me tell you about the time I was surrounded by Cylons.<eos> (Boy) What's a Cylon? (Starbuck) Cylons behind me...<eos> No question, all three ships have landed on Paradeen. Commandant!<eos> The homing signal from Paradeen has stopped.<eos> How long will it take a communiqué to reach Terra?<eos> At least two months, sir.<eos> And if we use the Lunar Seven relay station?<eos> I'm afraid it was knocked out by sabotage.
'Rec team to Level 10, Sectors H through L.'<eos> - Dr Theopolis.<eos> - Bidibidibidi.<eos> - What's the latest on the weapon? - It's still directly above New Chicago.<eos> - 'Hello, Dr Huer.'<eos> - Hello, Princess.<eos> 'Were you impressed by our target practice just now?<eos> I think you know the answer to that.<eos> One of our expeditions to the galactic centre discovered the pyramid.<eos> 'It was being used for mining by one of the planets there.
But Mr Cerrutti... I have no control over him.<eos> He comes, he goes.<eos> Unmanagable, as they say.<eos> I do not like people who play with fire.<eos> It's not good.<eos> I talked to the doctor who treated Mrs Langlois ...Talking about forest fires.<eos> Ah yes?<eos> The arsonists, they're all bitter.<eos> Its always the same.<eos> This story of revenge, perhaps it is all made up.
I suffer... from terrible headaches, Doctor.<eos> I see.<eos> What else?<eos> I have blackouts suddenly.<eos> I have no- no control over what I do.<eos> [Women Whispering, indistinct] My eyes won't f-focus.<eos> I need more... morphine.<eos> That's never been a cure.<eos> Then put me in the observation ward.<eos> When I hospitalized you before you had a tumor, and it was removed.
I was 161 miles from Astrogarth, I was using the 16th map and I was running.<eos> More like A Run Through H.<eos> I was encouraged by the sight of a bird.<eos> If it could rest, so perhaps could I.<eos> I slowed up, apprehensively.<eos> This is a map made by an exiled pianist as a directive to the members of his band.<eos> He could not foresee that his musical and topographical instruction should be used backwards.<eos> As a cartographer, he was not appreciated in his own country.<eos> I had sent away for a plan of Anascaul, and had received this map in return.<eos> It was accompanied with a note saying Anascaul didn't exist, but would this do?
The catalogue should be completed by some disinterested person.<eos> An ornithologist with no ulterior motive.<eos> Tulse Luper wrote suggesting I might find a suitable map for his wife as a present.<eos> He knew that she was dying.<eos> At the 92nd booth of the metalworkers' street in Assidium, I saw this map.<eos> I put down a deposit to the equivalent of half its price.<eos> I wrote to Tulse Luper describing it and the street where I found it.<eos> He curtly replied that it was of no use to his wife, but it was imperative that I should buy it for myself.<eos> When I went back to do just that, the map had gone.<eos> Three days later, it was pinned up in Van Hoyten's room.
This is a plan from a bogus ecological textbook called Robinson Crusoe on Concrete Island.<eos> It shows the water drainage system for an inclined concrete platform.<eos> My landscape was not concrete, but the map was invaluable.<eos> I know nothing about this one, I don't remember receiving the postcard, nor did I send it.<eos> The address on the back is unknown to me, as are most of the details of French history referred to on the front.<eos> This ostensibly is the floor plan of a gallery where I had once arranged an exhibition on flight.<eos> The red line was an instruction for a tracking film camera.<eos> It now served me as a track to the 60th map.<eos> This map had been given to me by a charter-flight steward in appeasement for a cancelled flight.<eos> It had been given to him by an anatomist who had signed the passenger book in mirror writing.
You girls think I don't know what you're up to?<eos> Well, I do.<eos> And if I ever catch you again, you're gonna be in big trouble.<eos> You girls hear me?<eos> Janet, you listening?<eos> Now, don't be a smart-ass.<eos> You quit that!<eos> Stop teasing me!<eos> What are you two rascals doing in my room?<eos> Goddamn thing feels like it's nailed shut.
I don't know...<eos> I think that is very much what women think of Truffaut, even now.<eos> There is a sense that he was at the heart of something.<eos> Yes.<eos> And he managed to get everyone to love him.<eos> Of course. Yes.<eos> It's like a musical, this part, with the crank.<eos> And the colours. The curtain, the crank.<eos> We're at the movies with the happy ending.<eos> That's what we want so we're going to film it. A bit of silent cinema.
And whoever it was tried to murder me, too.<eos> You said you played the tape?<eos> The late Mr Roffe's secretary, this Miss Kate Erling, she heard it, too?<eos> Oh, yes, but it's not Kate.<eos> My father trusted her completely.<eos> Could I have the tape?<eos> The original?<eos> - It's evidence.<eos> - I have it upstairs.<eos> It's gone.
"hoping it would rub off."<eos> Instead, it started to work the other way.<eos> Hello?<eos> It's Barton Kelly, Frank.<eos> How are you?<eos> Just mediocre.<eos> How are you?<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I came back to the old place.<eos> It's got me.
What are you staring at? Who, me?<eos> - What are you staring at?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> You were staring at something.<eos> I was looking at your ear.<eos> What's wrong with it?
- Kitchen all right?<eos> - Ain't seen no mice yet.<eos> - I'm going outside. - Oh, dear.<eos> Come look at this.<eos> Come out here a minute.<eos> This barn out here.<eos> - Is it mine, by any chance?<eos> - No chance.<eos> It belongs to the Gwalia farm, but the farm burned down.<eos> Sir Herbert Vesey owns it. He lives in London.
- I'm going outside. - Oh, dear.<eos> Come look at this.<eos> Come out here a minute.<eos> This barn out here.<eos> - Is it mine, by any chance?<eos> - No chance.<eos> It belongs to the Gwalia farm, but the farm burned down.<eos> Sir Herbert Vesey owns it. He lives in London.<eos> Then it's available.<eos> I mean, it could be bought or rented.
Well?<eos> Yes, I have a very important message for you by word of mouth from a gent who's staying at my place this weekend.<eos> Sir Herbert Vesey.<eos> You know that name?<eos> Yes. He's the owner of the Gwalia farm next to me.<eos> And more to the point, he's the owner of the barn.<eos> Yes, go on.<eos> Sir Herbert has definitely decided he has no use for the old wreck.<eos> Yes, I know that already.<eos> But what you don't know, as he's only just now confided in me is that he does not see it as a school and under no circumstances will he let it as such.
Rape!<eos> He thinks it's funny.<eos> I've raped her every day for two years.<eos> Sometimes twice a day.<eos> Really!<eos> Shit!<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> My signet ring!<eos> It's come off!
Here is the field, stranger.<eos> From here it is not possible for you to make off.<eos> And as you have eaten and drunk with us, our earth will drink your blood.<eos> Next year the Meander will see a wheat tighter and thicker than this one.<eos> You have killed many in the past on this field?<eos> Enough.<eos> But nobody who had your strength or was good enough alone.<eos> Who taught you this custom?<eos> It has always been done.<eos> If you don't nourish the earth, how can you ask it to nourish you?
and in the morning we saw their footprints in the snow.<eos> I slept in the back room with the girls and we used to hear at night the wolf lamenting because he was cold on the shore.<eos> On the shore last year there was a dead man.<eos> A German.<eos> Buried by the partisans.<eos> So close to the road?<eos> The water carried him down and Dad found him under the mud and the stones.<eos> It's Dad.<eos> I was passing by chance and wanted to see the countryside again.<eos> I don't recognise it, it has been worked so much.
I really love the night.<eos> It's so simple.<eos> So deceptive.<eos> So exciting!<eos> You take the dawn for granted.<eos> The warm, hot sunlight.<eos> But the night...<eos> - Was made to enjoy. - Yes.<eos> Yes, it was.<eos> It was made to enjoy life and love.
- I must be off.<eos> What do you think of this?<eos> It's a sign of cynicism that you want to meet here<eos> It's just being sensible about it<eos> There's no safer place in Berlin at the moment<eos> It couldn't have gone better. No one suspects anything<eos> Have you got the money on you?<eos> Have you got the bomb?<eos> - God, be careful!<eos> - It's been defused
Are you still here?<eos> Who asked you to do that?<eos> Sister?<eos> No, not me.<eos> - I offered myself.<eos> That's very kind, but this is not a mixed community.<eos> Is this yours?<eos> Monsignor, Mother Superior...<eos> People praise your choir.<eos> I'd like to use it for the procession.
- Of course, I should like to.<eos> - Of course.<eos> It's so hard to meet a suitable girl.<eos> - What exactly are you constructing?<eos> - A water wheel.<eos> It will be so delightful.<eos> Especially with the rusted curve of the water wheel itself.<eos> Don't you agree?<eos> We are building the rusted wheel at considerable expense.<eos> It is constructed of previously rusted metal.
John?<eos> - John?<eos> Where's John?<eos> - I'm down here, sir.<eos> - What are you doing down there?<eos> - Madam felt she heard a noise...<eos> Madam always feels she's heard a noise.<eos> Come along now.<eos> I need you to find my best pipe.<eos> - It's misplaced again.
A mechanic's not a pilot.<eos> I don't listen to any kind of rumour. Never.<eos> There's been a lot of talk around.<eos> You can't pay any attention to that kind of talk.<eos> I don't believe for a moment that you made the whole thing up.<eos> Not a word. Just gossip.<eos> Now, where was I?<eos> Oh, yeah. That mission tomorrow night.<eos> I knew that you'd want to volunteer to do it.<eos> Not that you've got anything to prove. I just felt that you'd like to go for it.
Who is Navin Johnson?<eos> Navin is a complex personality, as are most of the small breed of modern-day renaissance millionaires.<eos> We had planned to show you the entire Johnson interview. However, when we returned to our studio, our news department informed us of a sensational development in the Johnson story.<eos> It seems that an irate group of citizens led by the celebrity, Mr. Carl Reiner has filed a class action suit against Mr. Johnson and his Opti-Grab.<eos> Here's what Mr. Reiner had to say at a press conference:<eos> When Opti-Grab came out I thought it was the greatest thing ever.<eos> And I bought a pair.<eos> And this is the result.<eos> This little handle is like a magnet.<eos> Your eyes are drawn to it and you end up cockeyed.
- Mars will have to wait. - Whatever you say.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - The asteroid belt<eos> - What for?<eos> - A Comet's about to go through it.<eos> - They go through all the time.<eos> - It's a first for this one. It was wrenched out of orbit by Jupiter's gravitational pull.<eos> - How big is this comet?<eos> - 480 kilometres in diameter, which makes its nucleus large enough to do real damage if it hits anything.<eos> It's headed straight toward Orpheus, the big one in the centre.
In the official version.<eos> The truth is more disturbing, O07.<eos> Look at this.<eos> That's the scene of the crash.<eos> Wreckage strewn everywhere.<eos> That's the fuselage.<eos> We've been through it thoroughly, but there's no sign of Moonraker.<eos> So the shuttle was hijacked in mid-air?<eos> That's for you to find out.<eos> It was built in California by Drax Industries. Yes.
Now follow that frog!<eos> - It's a gorgeous day.<eos> - Yep, certainly is.<eos> - Yep, terrific day for a drive.<eos> - Beautiful country out here.<eos> A frog and a bear, seeing America!<eos> Movin'right along in search of good times and good news<eos> With good friends you can't lose<eos> This could become a habit<eos> Opportunity knocks once Let's reach out and grab it
Okay? That's my man.<eos> Richie, why aren't you in school?<eos> I forgot my homework.<eos> I'm going right back.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> - Did you get it?<eos> - Yeah, I got these too.<eos> You're stealing your mom's car?<eos> Yeah, she only made three payments on it.<eos> The goddamn bank owns it.
And what?<eos> You wouldn't have always been pleased with me.<eos> Have you been?<eos> I came to tell you that I know it's not good.<eos> But I ask you ... not to condemn me.<eos> Jola ... what right would I have to condemn you ... or anyone else?<eos> You know who I am.<eos> A noble person.<eos> That's saying a lot, and too little; you know my life.<eos> Is there anything in it which gives me the right to judge others?
With the exception of grocery bags, Nobody likes paper that isn't white.<eos> What do you use to bleach it with? Chlorine.<eos> But it stays right here in the plant.<eos> None of it goes out into the water?<eos> No, sir, not a drop.<eos> I'd like to see more.<eos> This way.<eos> You all right?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You see now, when the pulp gets down here, It's pressed into sheets and dried into paper.
The police are on their way. That was an alarm you triggered.<eos> - we...<eos> - Don't come any closer.<eos> Just take whatever it is you have and leave.<eos> - we're not stealing anything. we're just...<eos> - what do you want?<eos> - Are there more of you? - No.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> we were curious about the house.<eos> we heard it was sold, but we didn't think anyone lived here.
It is bread, that's all.<eos> No, it is when you sneeze, you're like to blow your soul away.<eos> As I see it, no soul can leave its mortal shell afore a body dies.<eos> What if a man falls down in a faint, Master Crick?<eos> Well, that's a different matter.<eos> The spirit bides there inside you, but you cannot feel it.<eos> But we can sometimes make our souls leave our bodies.<eos> How's that, then, maidy?<eos> Only have to lie on the grass at night and look straight up at some bright star.<eos> And stare at it with all your might.
I mean, despair.<eos> Now that... - that's the way it was with me, friends. I know what of I speak here. Before I met the prophet.<eos> Before I found out he was out here to help me. I mean, he's out here preaching the Church of Christ Without Christ. Now I want you all to listen to him.<eos> The holy Church... of Jesus Christ Without Christ.<eos> That... - That man ain't true.<eos> - I never seen him before tonight.<eos> - I wasn't true, friends. I wasn't true before I met this prophet here. I want you to know that.<eos> I wasn't true. I didn't preach the truth.<eos> But I'm gonna give you some reasons right now... why you can join this church, why it's best for you.<eos> The first thing is there's just nothing foreign about it. - No.
Are you all right?<eos> Get him.<eos> Give me time to pant.<eos> Now, who's the tough one here?<eos> And who's being beaten up?<eos> Is your arm all right?<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> I'll touch him then.<eos> Take your broken ring back.<eos> It wasn't broken.
He killed her with his cane.<eos> Now you're seeing crimes, too?<eos> I'll knock some sense into you!<eos> A good slap to convince you that you're a visionary!<eos> No, Christine.<eos> It's better to convince him with the truth.<eos> Come with me.<eos> - Where did it happen?<eos> - In room 12.<eos> It's been closed for many years.
Giorgio!<eos> Giorgio!<eos> What's the matter, Mark?<eos> How did you hurt yourself?<eos> It was the man with the cane.<eos> He was hiding up here to hit me.<eos> - And you saw him, of course?<eos> - Calm down, it's nothing.<eos> But you didn't see this prong...<eos> Touch it, it's still covered with blood.
And what else?<eos> I said, just a kiss.<eos> - But you don't believe me.<eos> - I believe you.<eos> - No, you think that I...<eos> - I said that I believe you.<eos> - You can't get pregnant that way!<eos> - And why not?<eos> Everything is possible.<eos> Remember that a life is a life, no matter how it has been conceived.
They could still be alive! You can't just leave them there!<eos> Apollo, if the fire reaches the energiser or the solium, either one, the Galactica is doomed.<eos> Our resources must go into preventing that.<eos> I'm sorry, Colonel.<eos> We may delay it, but in the end, we can't prevent it.<eos> The oxygen in each compartment draws the fire into the ship like a magnet.<eos> To stop it we have to drown it in boraton.<eos> We have boraton.<eos> But we have to smother the whole fire at the same time.<eos> With enough high pressure we could do that in the other areas but not the landing bay - there's no way to reach it.
Launching.<eos> Jolly. - On your wake.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Apollo. This is what we came for.<eos> This is a record of the Exodus, the final departure of the first 12 tribes, the ones which eventually became the Colonies we knew.<eos> And here, the last days, the final days of Kobol.<eos> - It tells of the 13th tribe.<eos> - Can you tell where they went?<eos> The door!<eos> - It's been blasted open.
You, masquerading as a moral high priest... of righteous justice... calling me a parasite.<eos> I believe in starting the day off sociable.<eos> - Quinn.<eos> - Yes, sir?<eos> Bring the judge some breakfast.<eos> KALIG:<eos> You know this river?<eos> GARTH:<eos> Intimately.<eos> - You own it?
It was in the wine.<eos> The wine?<eos> That's extraordinary.<eos> Why should I be glad to hear that the poison was in the wine?<eos> Well, don't you see, sir? That immediately strikes you right off my list of suspects.<eos> According to the boy, vittorio didn't even open the bottle until after you left<eos> I wasn't aware that I was on your list of suspects, lieutenant<eos> I must say I find all this very puzzling.<eos> It is puzzling, isn't it, sir?<eos> I mean, here's this boy, Mario, sent to the wine cellar for a bottle of margaux and he picks it at random and it's laced with poison.
What are you gonna do with a shit photo like that?<eos> What can you see, huh?<eos> A door, with Charrier behind the door.<eos> What use is that?<eos> I can just see the headlines tomorrow.<eos> "After M. Berthier and the whore, it's Charrier, MP, in La Cage aux Folles."<eos> Have you considered that this door does not bear a neon sign saying "Cage aux Folles"?<eos> You can leave peacefully...<eos> - The bastards have blocked the door.<eos> - Blocked it?
That's terrible.<eos> I got it all mixed up.<eos> So much has happened since then, the war and other serious, cruel things, but a few years after our meeting, I was sure<eos> I'd again see the man who spoke to me like an adult, and I had a very deep reason for thinking so.<eos> You want to see the ring, and I'm delaying you.<eos> Yes, forgive me.<eos> - Is that it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Good, then you must follow the auction procedure.<eos> It will be offered at 100 francs, and you must tell me how high you will bid.
Take the money and destroy this thing now in front of me!<eos> - Out of the question.<eos> - Destroy this thing at once.<eos> I've lost all hope, Julie.<eos> I feel like I'm losing you all over again.<eos> Please, Julie, don't abandon me.<eos> Before granting you an audience, I would like to know more about you and your projects.<eos> Your letter isn't very clear.<eos> First of all, why this chapel?<eos> It was badly damaged during the war, and it will never be used for services again.
I feel like I'm losing you all over again.<eos> Please, Julie, don't abandon me.<eos> Before granting you an audience, I would like to know more about you and your projects.<eos> Your letter isn't very clear.<eos> First of all, why this chapel?<eos> It was badly damaged during the war, and it will never be used for services again.<eos> There aren't enough priests in our diocese, and they have far more urgent work to do.<eos> So what do you want to do with it?<eos> I want to fund the repairs and maintenance of this chapel.<eos> I chose it precisely because it was abandoned.
Our computer makes an immediate adjustment for any change in condition.<eos> For example we simulate hypotension by direct compression of the telemetry unit.<eos> The computer will sense this and make an immediate adjustment.<eos> Well, almost immediate.<eos> Sometimes there's a--<eos> There we are.<eos> Sometimes there is a short delay, but as you can see the computer put the patient in the Trendelenburg position and administered a vasoconstrictor.<eos> We have very few crises here.<eos> With the assistance of technology these patients are maintained beautifully.<eos> Without it, they would have died long ago.
Fine.<eos> Would you like me to carry you to your bedroom?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I can walk.<eos> OK, then I'm gonna take off.<eos> Don't worry, Gloria.<eos> If there really is somebody out there trying to kill you, I promise you, we'll find out who and why.<eos> Well, the room checks out.<eos> Nobody up there.<eos> Landlord said it's been empty for months.

- How do you do?<eos> - Please come in.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Dr McKeever is busy monitoring a test, but he should be with us shortly.<eos> - Maybe you'd like to look around.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I've been here before.<eos> - This was Babe Gifford's house.<eos> - Yes, we bought the house from the Giffords.<eos> It was so beautifully furnished, we tried to make as few alterations as possible.
Whatever happened to the Four Seasons? Yeah!<eos> I ain't never gonna listen to 1010 WINS again ever.<eos> Never gonna, never ever. All right.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You know something?<eos> What? You're a deranged person, but keep your chin up.<eos> Yeah, Harry, my eyes were bothering me a little with all the reading I'm doing around here.<eos> So I went and I picked up this lamp.<eos> It's a real great lamp.<eos> I mean, it's got, like, three switches on it to make it bright.
Here. You take him. Aah!<eos> Here's some great snapshots I got when the Beatles arrived at Kennedy Airport.<eos> Yeah, well, I didn't exactly see the Beatles, but I got some great shots oftheir suitcases.<eos> You know, you're the first boy I've ever met that I could really talk to.<eos> I mean, really talk to.<eos> Yeah, well, if you think these are fab, I'll show you something that's really gear.<eos> Hey, don't they ever make the beds in here?<eos> Nah. The hotel doesn't know I'm in here.<eos> Then how'd you get this key? I found it.<eos> Someone left it in the door, and I found it.
You're an idiot!<eos> You're a fink!<eos> You're a lousy rat fink!<eos> And I would've won those tickets!<eos> Now I got you, you little shit-head!<eos> Who you callin' little?<eos> Take that, you copper!<eos> Stay back!<eos> Watch it, he's got a lamp!<eos> And it's lit! Ai-yaah!
There's a plane in half an hour.<eos> You want to leave 23 hours early?<eos> There's a connecting flight from San Francisco in 90 minutes.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> Really, I do.<eos> I wouldn't suggest it if you weren't a mother and didn't understand.<eos> It wouldn't even occur to me if-if this crisis hadn't come up.<eos> I don't mean Just the tooth Fairy.<eos> She could have swallowed the tooth.<eos> It could be lodged God knows where.
And I have a teenage son with hair so long that from the back, he looks exactly like Yvonne De Carlo.<eos> You know that's a sign of age, don't you?<eos> What is?<eos> When you start worrying about the declining morality of the young.<eos> Besides, there is nothing you can do about it.<eos> We can start setting some examples.<eos> As I recall, when you were a little younger, you were not exactly a monk about that sort of thing.<eos> That was different.<eos> Our relationship is not based on a casual one-night stand.<eos> No. It's been 15 one-night stands.
Okay, you can come up.<eos> It's me.<eos> Go fuck yourself.<eos> Hey! Hey! My truck!<eos> I'm calling about an old pal of yours.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Cut the crap!<eos> He's got a gun.<eos> He stole a van tonight. A delivery van.<eos> It's parked at 611 Winston in Cabbagetown.
I mean, you come to me, we discuss it, then I decide.<eos> I'm trying to make you understand, I'm aware of the realities of my situation that I'm not fated to be a menace to society.<eos> I'm not gonna go out and hit somebody over the head.<eos> My friend, I see that you're gonna force me to deal with you.<eos> I see that you've got juvenile offenses dating back to when you were 12.<eos> I see you've got auto theft, you've got breaking and entering. All this leading up to a burglary warrant.<eos> I just served six years for that chickenshit rap.<eos> Chickenshit?<eos> You had a gun.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't use it and I didn't hurt nobody.
It was like pulling teeth to get you out of the fucking place.<eos> So we scored.<eos> - Do you like it?<eos> - Not really.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Let me buy you something.<eos> What about the earrings?<eos> - I think it's a set.<eos> - Look at the ring.<eos> The price tag on it's $9135.
All the members of our family are here.<eos> Hirakuchi's eldest son Hayate and Fuchikari's sister Mon are here to announce their independence.<eos> Men hunt and fish.<eos> Women pick vegetables.<eos> Let us unify our hearts.<eos> Let us have our homeland again.<eos> Hayate, Mon, the ceremony is over.<eos> You're now independent Negoro fighters.<eos> We lost our homeland 20 years ago.<eos> But someday we'll put it back in the hands of the Negoro family.
Mr. Bat won't use only a... cage made of Black Iron to trap the reputed Master Hsiang and Yi Tien-hung.<eos> I know of a certain kind of acid... that can melt anything.<eos> I'm afraid this is an acid pool.<eos> Yes, it's an acid pool.<eos> How can I get to the exit?<eos> We can climb over there, but Miss Jin mightn't be able to do it.<eos> There's only one way out. It'll be like hanging food one by one.<eos> Only food could be hung on the wire!<eos> Would the wire bear the weight of people? I've here the Magic Silk Wire, the most pliable but strongest material<eos> I tighten it on this precious blade... and fling it there. So we may climb on it to reach there.
Where are you going?<eos> Oh, I thought I might go for a bit of a wander.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Think I might...<eos> Christ!<eos> You all right?<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> Funny thing shouldn't of gone off.<eos> It was on safety.<eos> I put the safety on it.
Well, they're not now.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> -I'm gonna have a look around. -Peter..<eos> -I'll be five minutes, alright?<eos> Five minutes, I swear to God, I'll take the car and I'll leave you here!<eos> (radio) ...today, conducted its first nuclear test this year..<eos> (The new China news agency reported the test,)<eos> (the 22nd since China's first atomic explosion in 1964,)<eos> (but did not reveal the size of the explosion)<eos> (or say whether it was carried out underground or on the surface.)
Ay?<eos> You wouldn't leave me.... wouldja?<eos> Cricket.<eos> Shut up, Cricket!<eos> Cricket!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Jesus.<eos> Aw, Jesus, Cricket!<eos> Get out of the car, Cricket!<eos> Get out of it!
The TUC is holding a press conference today.<eos> Will you be covering it, Martin?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's clearly something we have to look into.<eos> There are principles involved which I would like to discuss.<eos> Anyway, I'm not going.<eos> There's no story to get out of the TUC.<eos> They just say what suits them about the strike.<eos> There's another firm out there.<eos> What the hell's it called?
Kunta, there ain't no way to beat the law.<eos> The law gets read in white churches.<eos> Niggers can't carry no guns or sticks.<eos> 20 lashes if you get caught with no traveling pass.<eos> -Ten-- -lf you look them in the eye.<eos> 30 if you raise your hand to them!<eos> You lie, they cut your ears off!<eos> I know the law, Fiddler!<eos> Then you ought to know there ain't no way to beat it!<eos> White folks live by it. And niggers die by it.
Now. Signor Rospini.<eos> I... didn't kill her.<eos> When I reached the villa, she was... already dead.<eos> Who was already dead?<eos> Signora Casati at Via Dell Lombrone.<eos> But you - what were you doing in Via Lombrone?<eos> I wanted that letter.<eos> Yes, Canevari.<eos> Listen. It just came to me, what was wrong with that picture.<eos> It occurred it haven't been taken during the 10th horse show.
- No.<eos> - Yes, her soul is set free.<eos> It is free.<eos> Dear Mr Hoover, it is good to know that you are in India doing all the things you must for the peace of our daughter's soul.<eos> I include Bill in my thanks, even though he still cannot accept the idea that while Ivy's body is gone, her soul continues to exist.<eos> Yet I know in my heart it is true and that you are right.<eos> And that is what sustains me.<eos> In permitting you to take Ivy's ashes to India, I believe that Bill has taken the first step toward understanding that we are all immortal.<eos> Know that I add my prayers to yours for our daughter's soul to mend itself<eos> and find the peace and fulfilment in heaven that it was denied in its earth life, and that the day will come when her soul will feel free and able to seek a new rebirth, and that when it does she will find parents
I mean, look at him.<eos> My desire might be to make of this boy an ardent husband, a caring citizen... a worshiper of abstract and unifying God.<eos> My achievement, however, is more likely to make a ghost.<eos> HI heal the rash on his body.<eos> HI erase the welts cut into his mind by ﬂying manes.<eos> And when that's done, I'll put him on a metal scooter... and send him puttering off into the concrete world... and he'll never touch hide again.<eos> Hopefully, he'll feel nothing at his fork but approved flesh...<eos> I doubt, however, with much passion.<eos> Passion, you see, can be destroyed by a doctor.<eos> It cannot be created.
Ou-yay ow-knay at-whay o-tay o-day.<eos> Et it-gay?<eos> Everything will be taken care of.<eos> There it goes again.<eos> Falling.<eos> Mamma! Falling!<eos> Fight it, Thorndyke.<eos> Fight it. You must fight it, do you hear me?<eos> Fight your fears.<eos> The only way to overcome High Anxiety is to fight it.
And I think I'm quite open-minded. But I can't go on typing... about all those interchangeable women.<eos> It makes me sick.<eos> I had to tell you this.<eos> I don't want to hang you up. I'll give you the address ofa colleague.<eos> I understand how you feel.<eos> Anyway, who knows if I'll ever finish the book?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Tell me, how much do I owe you?<eos> To write... to express yourself... isalso to expose yourself to judgement.<eos> The typist's condemnation of my book... was all the more painful because it was done with kindness.
Do you still live in America?<eos> No, that's over with.<eos> I live in London now.<eos> I found a good job there.<eos> Tell me about you!<eos> Well, similarly.<eos> I'm here for a few days.<eos> I live in a city in the South.<eos> That city has a name.<eos> It's called Montpellier.
I thought I'd be able to stay more than a few hours.<eos> You are going to Moscow.<eos> So regulations permit only that you will have a transit visa.<eos> Why is that?<eos> There you are.<eos> - Your train tickets, madame.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - And where is my trunk?<eos> - It's on the way to the station, madame.<eos> It will be put on the train.
And round and round<eos> And round<eos> Thank you! Thank you!<eos> More! More!<eos> For you!<eos> Oh, you're so wonderful!<eos> Thank you so much!<eos> Thank you for coming here.<eos> I'd Iike to sing a song now.<eos> It was written by a friend of mine... who is a great believer in major chords.
So help you you?<eos> Where's....<eos> Order in the court.<eos> Your Honor, I'd like permission to question this witness.<eos> That's all there is.<eos> Not one word of what I assume we all assume we heard.<eos> Someone must have erased it.<eos> Nobody erases tapes anymore.<eos> -Then the machine....<eos> -No. Not a thing wrong with it.
So when do I get to see Rose?<eos> Not for a while.<eos> Why not?<eos> I didn't kill her, did I?<eos> She's not dead.<eos> Now, I know everyone here is familiar with the standard techniques of skin grafting, but what we're going to do is a little out of the ordinary.<eos> We're removing full-thickness skin grafting material from the patient's thighs as per normal graft acquisition procedure.<eos> However, before these grafts are applied to the damaged areas of the patient's breasts, abdomen, and so on, they will be treated so that they become morphogenetically neutral.<eos> They are then called neutral field grafts. Well, when the thigh skin tissue is treated, it'll lose its specificity as both thigh tissue and skin tissue.<eos> For example, if it were grafted to a burned cheek, it wouldn't just be thigh skin with the color and texture of thigh skin it would actually develop as facial tissue.
These are noblemen of the capital of Oudh. ; Lucknow.<eos> After the passing of the great Moguls in Delhi,<eos> Lucknow became India's bastion of Moslem culture.<eos> Not all their games had the elegance of pigeons or kite-flying.<eos> That notable culture had its cruel side, too.<eos> This is the throne of King Wajid, who ruled over Oudh.<eos> But the king had other interests, too.<eos> Nevertheless, there were times when King Wajid sat on the throne.<eos> Lfhe was not overfond of ruling, he was certainly proud ofhis crown.<eos> Only five years ago, in 1851, he had sent it to London to be displayed at The Great Exhibition.
Are you still there?<eos> I don't like this one bit.<eos> He sounds like a nut.<eos> This is some old hermit, probably harmless.<eos> Perhaps you do need help, but you cannot get it here.<eos> I have been the sole occupant of this hotel and this island for many years now.<eos> You have left others at the beach?<eos> No, there's only us.<eos> There are no survivors from the wreck?<eos> No, it's all rusted out.
Here we go. Cut in the sublight engines.<eos> What the...<eos> We've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower... some kind of asteroid collision.<eos> - It's not on any of the charts.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Our position's correct, except no Alderaan.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - That's what I'm trying to tell you.<eos> It ain't there.<eos> It's been blown away.
- I want you, Marcella!<eos> - Your hands are cold!<eos> Come look, I have a marvelous motorcycle!<eos> A real beauty!<eos> Wait 'til you see it! Come on!<eos> Let's go...<eos> Perhaps I interrupted you, you seemed busy!<eos> There's time for that later, let's go look at my motorcycle.<eos> I just got it out of the shop!<eos> It was completely modified!
Can't you tell they're doing this on purpose?<eos> I've suspected it, since the first day I came back to the country, there's a trap waiting for me.<eos> The Gold Threaded Vest, Lin Xianer, and now they call me the Plum Blossom Bandit.<eos> Who is trying to hurt me?<eos> Since you know that someone's trying to hurt you. You should better leave soon.<eos> Have you seen the spider webs?<eos> Yes.<eos> We're like the spiders.<eos> We all want to make our own web.<eos> Then we can live in it forever.
We did not mean to trespass.<eos> We were merely seeking shelter from the storm.<eos> He is a liar, oh, truly tremendous one.<eos> Ask him to explain his weapon!<eos> This sword is named Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver!<eos> Murderers!<eos> Elf-friends!<eos> Stop!<eos> I know that sword!<eos> It is called:
The woman dabbles in witchcraft!<eos> (CLAUDIUS) Go on, Pina.<eos> One of the things that upset him most was the appearance of his name, each day shortened by a letter.<eos> It would appear quite suddenly without explanation in rooms to which the servants had no access and where the windows were too small for a man to climb through.<eos> He told me he was doomed.<eos> I told him not as long as he had the green jasper charm of Hecate.<eos> It was under his pillow and that comforted him. He knew as long as he had that, nothing could happen to him.<eos> That night, while he was asleep, he felt a tiny movement under his pillow.<eos> He turned on his side and fumbled for the charm.<eos> It was gone.
Merl.<eos> - Merl, your short don't make it.<eos> - What?<eos> I want something with some flash to it.<eos> It's too straight. It's too quiet.<eos> I want something with some juice.<eos> This is an old lady's car.<eos> Better pull your act together, Merl.<eos> And, Merl, now here's a car with some character to it.<eos> It's got some soul, you know?
Here. Take a look.<eos> He's already killed four.<eos> All four girls worked in different shows. All four were found in different locations.<eos> Doesn't leave them very pretty.<eos> Killing's only part of it. You should see what he does to them after they're dead.<eos> Why are you telling us all this?<eos> I see two thirsty souls trudging through the desert toward a neon city.<eos> Well, in the past, you've always been helpful to our department when our cases brought us here. So I thought it was only right that we give you a chance to see our fair city.<eos> I filed a request with your chief yesterday afternoon.<eos> And it's been approved.
Well, at least a friend's across the way.<eos> You know, I think I should like you.<eos> Why?<eos> You're embarrassing me.<eos> I'm embarrassing you?<eos> It's just that we're so used to getting dressed and undressed around here.<eos> Men come in, and they either don't care or they leer.<eos> You're blushing.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Listen, the party is at the Palm Crest Apartments. 11819th Street, and it's already started.
Can't be done<eos> I can't bear to see the car again<eos> You don't have to walk past it<eos> We must move on<eos> No, we don't<eos> I don't<eos> What did I say last night?<eos> You weren't feeling good, because of the accident<eos> -The car's being towed away<eos> -Tell me when it's gone
Want to go out?<eos> Do go in.<eos> I'llJust let him out.<eos> Excuse me. Come on, come on!<eos> See how he jumps!<eos> Come on.<eos> Sit. Sit!<eos> What's this picture?<eos> I took it.<eos> - Like it?
- Please, Tyltyl.<eos> No, Tyltyl!<eos> - You must not open this door.<eos> - Listen to Madame Night!<eos> You are young and innocent.<eos> I like you.<eos> You've seen some of the dreadful things that Man can imagine.<eos> Behind this door are the unimaginable horrors.<eos> No one who has ever opened this door has lived to see the light of day.<eos> What's it called?
Look what you did!<eos> - Don't you ever touch a thing!<eos> - I didn't mean to do it!<eos> Don't you ever touch a beautiful thing!<eos> - Ben, I... - Marian, what is happening to you?<eos> Absolutely nothing.<eos> Then what the hell was that performance with Davey back in there!<eos> This house just is more than I thought it would be.<eos> Marian, this house is not yours, sweetheart.<eos> We do not own it, do you understand that?
She active, me lazy.<eos> She always with some kind of project, houses to tidy up, old aunts to accomodate, dogs to mate, garages to turn into art galleries.<eos> Curly-head told me that I could go with them to Trapani.<eos> Her husband is in Trapani, setting up a snack bar.<eos> If things went well, they'd hire me.<eos> They need someone to keep accounts.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Almost everyone can keep accounts.<eos> Go see if the water's boiling.<eos> - It's been boiling for quite a while.
- I did, thank you.<eos> You'd better keep the keys.<eos> If Michele arrives, he might come right here.<eos> He will certainly arrive.<eos> It's a shame he didn't come at once.<eos> He's the only person in the world dad would've liked to see.<eos> Poor dad.<eos> In one of his letters, Michele asked me to take care of a girl.<eos> I don't know if you've met her.<eos> - I took care of it.
He wrote me to come here.<eos> Dear Osvaldo, in my basement there's a scarf in the back of a drawer.<eos> It's a lovely scarf, 100% cashmere wool.<eos> White with sky-blue stripes.<eos> My father gave it to me.<eos> I'd like you to take it and make it yours.<eos> I'd be happy to know that you have that scarf around your neck when you leave your shop and you're strolling along the Tiber.<eos> Dear Michele, the cashmere scarf is nowhere to be found.<eos> But I bought myself a scarf.<eos> It's not made of cashmere wool and doesn't have blue stripes.
He never went anywhere. Was he due to go on vacation?<eos> No. He didn't take vacations.<eos> Then who packed his bags and why was he leaving?<eos> If he quit or was fired, but neither one of those things would ever happen.<eos> Thank you very much. You've been very helpful.<eos> (MAN SPEAKING SPANISH)<eos> (PHONE RINGING)<eos> Lieutenant, I have good news for you.<eos> My car?<eos> It's parked outside, no charge.
Your kids.<eos> They solved the crime. My kids?<eos> Your kids.<eos> only after watching them play, one pretending to be a matador and the other pretending to be a bull, only then did I know without qualification that Montoya was Iying.<eos> This is the official weather report for the day that Hector was killed.<eos> Heavy winds came up in this area between 5:00 and 6:00.<eos> Now, that was the time that Montoya said that Hector was preparing to kill the bull.<eos> Heavy winds. 30 kilometers an hour.<eos> Now, do you remember the first day?<eos> Do you remember how closely we looked at this muIeta to see that it wasn't ripped?
No, that doesn't work either.<eos> You think he mutilated the disguise because he was afraid someone might recognize it?<eos> Exactly, sir.<eos> Boy, do you and I think the same way.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Everybody has trouble with this.<eos> Thank you very much, sir.<eos> Oh, did I mention the mask?<eos> That it was slashed? No.
Fascinating, notwithstanding.<eos> But I think, sir, I have the proof. Here.<eos> What proof?<eos> Lieutenant, there are no fingerprints on that gun. You said so yourself this morning.<eos> This has been a rather silly demonstration, Lieutenant.<eos> Well, you're absolutely right again, sir. The killer cleaned the gun of all incriminating prints.<eos> But the thing is, he forgot something.<eos> Forgot what?<eos> Well, sir, you know that this gun was only used as a prop.<eos> So, of course, it was never filled with anything but blanks.
That must have been very close to the way it happened.<eos> Cake?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Hey, they look delicious.<eos> Lieutenant, I better tell you something before you find out yourself.<eos> There's an artifact missing from the museum.<eos> What kind of an artifact?<eos> It's gold. It's a small, rectangular piece with carved stripes on it.<eos> It's won'th quite a lot of money.<eos> It's been missing about two weeks.
All those people, Allie and Sussman, everything they're wrong, because I can beat that committee and I can beat them my own way.<eos> - How?<eos> What's the difference?<eos> I'm not going to wind up back at that cash register.<eos> Take my word for it.<eos> And I'm not going to do anything that makes you ashamed of me.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Can you trust me?<eos> And we would like to thank this committee... And we would like to thank this committee for allowing Mr. Prince to appear and voice his approval of the great work that you're doing for our country.<eos> Communist subversion is a real and present danger and you can rest assured that it will never be tolerated on the network that both Mr. Prince and I have the honor to represent.
It's been a long time.<eos> I wish that I wouldn't go up there, but I did.<eos> I wouldn't go, but when I see him go, his fight's my fight... so I want to stand beside of him and fight too.<eos> If this had just been a Harlan County strike... and there hadn't been publicity... hadn't been a fight against their rate increase... hadn't been a fight against their stock...<eos> Duke Power wouldn't have given a damn about any of the pressure down here... 'cause, uh, all we had was their coal... and we never had shut off enough of that to hurt their stockpiles up until the end.<eos> And the same thing with Lawrence.<eos> They never would have cared if LawrenceJones died in Harlan.<eos> It would have been a two-inch paragraph in the Harlan Daily Enterprise... and Carl Horn wouldn't have given a goddamn about it.<eos> And so I don't think a strike is won by any one thing.<eos> It was won by a lot of different people in a lot of different ways... fighting together and playing different roles.
A mediocre writer, don't you agree?<eos> His style is so pompous, so emphatic.<eos> It's quite unbearable.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> His style is extraordinary.<eos> It's like music.<eos> You can't judge a man like him by just skimming through his book.<eos> You take it to heart.<eos> He may be a great writer but he's ill-mannered. You must give me that.<eos> The dedication he wrote you is not only stilted but also uncalled for, if one considers it's addressed to a lady he only met ones.
Something must have happened to Uncle<eos> Prepare the coach quickly<eos> You're Ma Fang-chung<eos> You're Sun Chu.<eos> - Yes, come down with me - Okay<eos> Over there<eos> Quick, support him.<eos> Close the door quickly<eos> Fang-chung, is the coach ready?<eos> It's been ready for over 10 years.
Now we have a relationship.<eos> Now we can talk.<eos> Well?<eos> Give it to him.<eos> You know how to load it?<eos> Check the bullets, Flo.<eos> Don't forget the bullets.<eos> Put that safety on.<eos> Oh, we, uh, borrowed a car.<eos> It's parked behind us.
And to you, for changing that fucking director.<eos> They're waiting for you, Miss Didi.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> She really looks good!<eos> Let's go to the beach. What about the party?<eos> They're expecting you at the party.<eos> Drive me to the beach.<eos> Do you think you'll ever finish it, so you can live in it?<eos> I think you like it as it is.<eos> I think you like it without a roof.
Babe, what's happened?<eos> - God, I'm glad you're here.<eos> - What's happened to you?<eos> - I'll tell you later.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You like it?<eos> I must get the key.<eos> - How did you find this place?<eos> - I hope the key is here.<eos> - How did you find it?
- Butler gone, but pocket still there?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Somebody has stolen his body but left his clothes there.<eos> Quickly, open the door.<eos> Something is very wrong here.<eos> Hello.<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> Room filled with empty people.<eos> I'll try the other door.<eos> It's locked from the inside.
I'm busy.<eos> Take the same seats you had before.<eos> Forty seconds!<eos> I'm very worried about Mr. Perrier.<eos> I'm going to look for him.<eos> No.<eos> Sit, please.<eos> No one to leave room.<eos> The other door.<eos> It's locked.
I will tell everyone that you wear a toupee.<eos> - They already know.<eos> - Then why do you wear it?<eos> I didn't know that you knew.<eos> Certainly I know.<eos> It's a terrible toupee.<eos> A bomb.<eos> Across the hall.<eos> Quickly, the door!<eos> It's locked from the outside.
Walter!<eos> What's up?<eos> Look!<eos> He's spilt the garbage all over the apartment again.<eos> Because he wants to attract flies, you silly-billy.<eos> You can't understand any logic but your own.<eos> Because I have to work all day clearing away your filth.<eos> Don't shout, Luise! It wastes the energy you need to work.<eos> "Humanizing the world means...<eos> "feeling ourselves more and more... "as masters in it.
You don't say.<eos> And... come here!<eos> I'm his real wife, you know... not you.<eos> Oh...<eos> I see.<eos> Ernst, you lucky boy, you have a sister of kindred spirit.<eos> Give thanks to God!<eos> You can make it yourself.<eos> I'm completely open for you. Completely and utterly open.<eos> "Humanizing the world means... "feeling ourselves more and more as masters in it."
I don't have any more money.<eos> I'm finished.<eos> I'll come.<eos> I love you.<eos> I adore your strength.<eos> Thank you, my friend.<eos> - What about my money?<eos> - Go into the kitchen. My wife will pay you.<eos> I'll see you next Thursday!<eos> "Humanizing the world means feeling ourselves more and more as masters in it."
I fear the fog has delayed us.<eos> Yes, true, true, but it has also delayed him.<eos> Now, where have they put my Gladstone?<eos> There it is.<eos> Here you are.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Would you excuse me, my clear fellow?<eos> I'll be back in a moment.<eos> There was no point in remonstrating about Holmes' use of cocaine.<eos> In fact, until we reached Austria, I was ironically dependent upon it.
OK.<eos> I'M READY.<eos> OK.<eos> OK, WAIT, WAIT.<eos> OK.<eos> VANESSA, WHAT'S THE MATTER, SWEETIE?<eos> (as Peggy) I'M NOT VANESSA.<eos> I'M SORRY, PEGGY, BUT YOU POPPED OUT SO FAST.<eos> WHAT'S THE MATTER, SWEETIE?<eos> IT WAS MY IDEA AND SHE STOLE IT.
And now, listen.<eos> There is nothing but love.<eos> We're here.<eos> I bet your heart's thumping, eh, Laure?<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Why don't you take her luggage instead of standing there like a lemon?<eos> Thank you, Ali.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Be careful with the wooden box.<eos> There are some very fragile objects in it.
I killed the wolf and saved the goat.<eos> Then we caught the goat, killed and roasted it, we had a feast.<eos> What do you think?<eos> We did well to eat it?<eos> It's a bad deed, in my opinion.<eos> What should we have done?<eos> Leave the goat alone for another wolf to eat it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> One had to kill the wolf.<eos> And the goat, it would be lost?
What have you got all this stuff for?<eos> - You're only here three days, you gonna play charades every night?<eos> - This one? - Is it blue?<eos> Bluish, I suppose.<eos> Now you will remember to collect the stuff from Thomas's, won't you?<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> And I forgot to scrape the mould off the cheddar this morning, so remind Chef.<eos> Right.<eos> And try to find time to get the moose's head up.<eos> Oh. - It's been sitting there for two weeks, Basil.
- Take care of this.<eos> Take care of this. [ Sighs ]<eos> ""Dr. Avery Walker, Nobel Prize winner, suffered a heart attack and died on Sunday evening."<eos> What do you want me to do, embalm him?<eos> He was big in computer science.<eos> A lot of news value.<eos> - We'll need an obit.<eos> - So if he's that big, we've got him on file.<eos> We do, but the last entry in the file was made in 1 967.<eos> It was scribbled so badly, I couldn't make it out.
Begone!<eos> Accept me and you shall become Mother Superior<eos> I wish to die in peace.<eos> Begone, Lucifer!<eos> Look, Sister, the nuns are coming to take you to the Inquisition<eos> They bring the fiery cross<eos> You know what that means<eos> Before killing you, they will torture you<eos> Your mouth will be ripped open<eos> It will be filled with molten lead
You know this car is a classic now?<eos> Don't make them like this no more.<eos> - No sirree, Bob.<eos> - No sirree, Bob.<eos> - That's real nice. I love it.<eos> - It's quiet dignity, but it appeals to him.<eos> Well, baby blue, this car could be for you.<eos> This little beauty has reverb radio, a power antenna.<eos> It has sentinel light, it's got automatic door locks.<eos> It's got cruise control and six-way, count them, six-way power seats.
He described the last scene of " An Osaka Story"... and gave his opinions on a book of Yoda's poems... and said he wanted to work with us all again.<eos> Writing this...<eos> "The chill of autumn already I want to work with you again."<eos> He broke into sobs.<eos> "The chill of autumn already."<eos> "I want to work with you again." Mizoguchi would have said... of these remarks:<eos> "They are not mine.<eos> Lies." "Dying man cannot be so sentimental."<eos> Mizoguchi's house no longer stands.<eos> It has been replaced by a filling-station.
The lullaby.<eos> My mother used to sing it.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm the nurse robot.<eos> I've got an outdated design.<eos> The caring block has not been removed.<eos> And I've been rocking this cradle for 200 years.<eos> Only two of us defective are left, the 739th and me.<eos> I saw such a machine on pictures.<eos> It is supposed to move.
But you can't say my men ran out on me, that the peasants refuse, that I'm alone with my three dragoons.<eos> Four dragoons facing an entire army that won't budge...<eos> God knows why!<eos> The Regent might hesitate to exterminate four dragoons.<eos> But don't tell the Spanish.<eos> Because if they know we're dying, they won't come.<eos> Tell them to hurry, though, or I'll have to win without them.<eos> Come with me. You can tell them better than I.<eos> They predicted my death would come by sea.<eos> You prefer it by land?
And then they followed the Torino and killed the two young people thinking they were getting Starsky.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Who is "they"?<eos> Someone hired by Frank Tallman to stop you from testifying against him at the trial Wednesday morning.<eos> I know it sounds like a long shot just because the car involved was the same as Starsky here drives.<eos> I'm Hutch.<eos> He's Starsky.<eos> Well, anyway, what Henderson is trying to point out is, you're not the only one to drive that kind of car.<eos> No, I'm not, but it's not exactly a Model T either.<eos> Not with that paint job and the shocks that set it up on its nose more than most.
- All right.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> You'd better stop packing.<eos> We gotta do it again.<eos> We gotta do it again?<eos> Yeah, we gotta do it again.<eos> Not much of a take today, Lijah?<eos> Not enough to keep body and soul together.<eos> Not a lot of people like to think the end of the world is coming.<eos> I think it's already happened, brother, and we're all in hell.
Now you only owe me...<eos> Five and one makes six.<eos> I'll sign you a check.<eos> Bad luck, guys.<eos> Undercover cop.<eos> The one who's pretending to watch the postcards.<eos> - And the one who's having coffee.<eos> - Hurry!<eos> - Let's sneak out the backdoor.<eos> - It could be guarded.
Has something happened to Nora?<eos> She took on so about your going away that she had to console herself with a husband.<eos> She is now Mrs. John Quin.<eos> Mrs. John Quin?<eos> Was there another John Quin?<eos> No.<eos> The same, me boy.<eos> He recovered from his wound.<eos> The shot you hit him with could not hurt him.<eos> It was made of tow.
Everything you want to know.<eos> No!<eos> There is nothing to see out there.<eos> No.<eos> Do not go near the window. It's not safe.<eos> This idiot is looking out.<eos> I told you this would happen.<eos> It's a nosy bitch!<eos> You're running for the door.<eos> Of course it's locked.
I know his Asiatic tastes.<eos> Prefers sour apples<eos> Look - l'm broke while Sczerbic is loa'ded I said it wouldn't be easy<eos> You must do your bit I read those letters<eos> He's crazy about you<eos> He'd sell up and follow you, even to America if you asked him<eos> What do you want from him?<eos> I suppose you have a plan<eos> Write, asking him to come here to Vienna<eos> Tell him to sell his property or borrow against it
First, we get back to the house... we get into bed, and then whatever happens... that's where we've been, we don't know a thing.<eos> - I don't go to the hotel.<eos> - She was upset, we were asleep.<eos> How'd she get in the trunk?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Let's put our heads together.<eos> Let's deal with the trunk.<eos> - Jesus Christ!<eos> - Yeah, yeah!<eos> One, it's bound to sink.
Have you never had this feeling before?<eos> "Probably raising a family."<eos> My only son was killed three months ago working for the new order.<eos> But believe me, Captain, I'm not much better working for the Gestapo... one of their spies lying in bed above me.<eos> What's happening to people like us?<eos> I've given my life to zeppelins.<eos> Last year, for the sake of our company... I even dropped political pamphlets from this ship.<eos> Where does it stop?<eos> I've been in the air force since the World War.<eos> When the Versailles Treaty abolished it... I worked with Göring and the others to build a secret one.
You'll have your proof.<eos> What are you doing, Mr. Franco?<eos> You mustn't! The professor's here!<eos> What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> In the name of the Father and Son!<eos> Now you run away? You chickened out.<eos> Come this way.<eos> Please...<eos> Now I'll show you Franco's room, Miss Giovanna.<eos> Hopefully it's straightened up.
I would like to sing for you.<eos> Please do.<eos> Because the pause is too long?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> I don't sing very well, but I like to sing.<eos> "If you don't have an aunt".<eos> Performed by...<eos> Let it be "The aria of the Moscow visitor".<eos> If you don't have a house,<eos> It can not be destroyed by a Fire, And your wife will not leave you for another,
Now you as a hospitable hostess have to sing for me.<eos> But you said you didn't like my singing.<eos> I like it.<eos> I lied.<eos> I lie.<eos> All the time?<eos> Almost.<eos> A beautiful photograph.<eos> I like it too.<eos> Even though it was made almost 10 years ago.
Well, if a Greek can do it, we can do it.<eos> Right.<eos> I can only repeat, you're a pair of lunatics.<eos> Would a pair of lunatics draw up a contract like this?<eos> "This contract between me and you..." pursuing witnesseth here in the name of God, Amen, and so forth.<eos> That you and me will settle this matter together... i. e., to be Kings of Kafiristan.<eos> That you and me will not, while this matter is being settled... look at any liquor nor any woman, black, white or brown... so as to get mixed up with one or the other harmful.<eos> That we conduct ourselves with dignity and discretion... and if one of us gets into trouble, the other one will stay by him.<eos> "Signed by you and me this day."<eos> There's no need for the last article, but it's got a ring to it.
- You do?<eos> Hey, fellas, come here. I want you to see somethin'.<eos> My wife and I...<eos> My wife is sick, unfortunately.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> It's just one of those things that happens.<eos> - Happens in the best of families.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I wrote me this real hot song. You wanna hear it?<eos> It's called "I Never Get Enough. "
Yeah, I'm easy<eos> Take my hand and pull me down I won't put up any fight Because I'm easy<eos> Yeah, I'm easy<eos> Give the word I'll play your game As though that's how it oughta be Because I'm easy<eos> Do it to it.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi!<eos> I'm gonna sing you all a song Barbara Jean wrote.<eos> Just wanna get comfortable.<eos> It's called, uh, "One, I Love You. "
Stop whimpering!<eos> So the boy's been killed.<eos> But so have a lot of people.<eos> You can't bemoan everyone.<eos> Come on, let's get going. All the boys are gone already, and we're way behind them.<eos> I wish I had a smoke.<eos> You can do without. Just be patient.<eos> Be patient! Be patient!<eos> If there's one thing the Russian soldier has it's patience. I've got enough patience, but I'm not made of iron.<eos> I've lived through so much today that my patience has more holes in it than my boots.
There they are!<eos> Right under your nose.<eos> My poor Jean-Pierre.<eos> Do you remember the hotel?<eos> Yes, the Albigny, in Annecy.<eos> I'm off.<eos> - Dad, your car! - What about it?<eos> Well...<eos> Out with it!<eos> Is it impounded again?
Ma'am, excuse me, but my name's John Wesley.<eos> I'm Katharine Cooper.<eos> My husband and I own the cafe.<eos> Oh, yes, ma'am, me and my friends were just talking about the nice welcome you people give us.<eos> No more than you deserve.<eos> Have they arranged for the fiesta yet?<eos> - Not yet, but I hope so.<eos> - I hope so, too.<eos> May I?<eos> Tell you what, keep your eye on that coin and you can have it.
- ...for what happened before.<eos> - Don't be silly.<eos> Call me.<eos> Good bye.<eos> Why did you come looking for me?<eos> I wanted to ask you something.<eos> Remember the other night, the night of the murder?<eos> Well, I said...<eos> I thought I saw a painting in that house.<eos> But a few moments later it was gone, remember?
- For Lease For information, call Rodi<eos> No, I'm just the caretaker.<eos> The house belonged to Carl Schwartz.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> He died.<eos> He was German...<eos> a writer, odd sort of fella.<eos> Bought the place in '68, I think.<eos> Before that, it was empty for a long time.<eos> People used to say it was haunted by ghosts.
Claire was waiting for us in the car.<eos> Anne's manners reminded me of a well-behaved young school girl.<eos> I had time to ask the girl several casual questions.<eos> but all I could get out of her was "Yes, sir" "No, sir" or "I don't know, sir," as though she were a child.<eos> RESERVED PARKING FOR BAGATELLE PARK VISITORS<eos> Instead of letting us wander from flower to flower...<eos> Claire made us look at the varieties that she admired most. Knowing exactly where each one was.<eos> After the grand tour we wandered off to a more deserted part of the garden.<eos> Keep off the grass<eos> Go over to it!
For what? He had no need for it, but his peoples did.<eos> Because he didn't want to live on his own.<eos> Fascism was the opposite, they wanted to live by themselves.<eos> He founded the party, not only to liberate the African peoples, but even for the liberation of all peoples.<eos> Because he always said, before he died, that the struggle that the struggle for liberation served not only the African peoples, but also the Portuguese people.<eos> And, above all, quite the opposite, he didn't fight against the Portuguese people.<eos> He fought against the colonialists and against the exploitation of man by man.<eos> What shall I do with this sword?<eos> Fascists, the people is up in arms!<eos> Because this land, it hasn't been worked on for 12 or 13 years, and we're working on it to get bread for our Portugal.
The computer counts down.<eos> The ball is fired.<eos> First period is under way here at Houston tonight.<eos> The first team to pick up the ball will be on offence and it's a pick-up by Houston!<eos> It's picked up by BJ.<eos> BJ moves around, manoeuvring it in to the leading scorer Jonathan E.<eos> Go on! Go on!<eos> Watch him!<eos> Jonathan E holds the ball aloft.<eos> You must hold it in view at all times.
Bike him!<eos> Bike him!<eos> You got him, baby, you got him!<eos> The ball is fired, the second period is under way.<eos> Tokyo leading.<eos> Houston forced to come from behind tonight.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Watch the man behind me! Watch the man behind me!<eos> The ball is in play again.<eos> It is scooped up by Carter for Houston.
!<eos> He's dead!<eos> This the way?<eos> Yeah, a mile under the subway.<eos> I know where they'll be.<eos> I'll get ahead of them.<eos> You just keep moving him along!<eos> Keep it going, Lippert.<eos> Maybe we'll try the street.<eos> It's rusted through.
- Do you play checkers?<eos> - No, I play chess.<eos> Better.<eos> This is the Rif.<eos> I am Mulay Achmed Mohammed el-Raisuli the Magnificent sherif of the Rifian Berbers.<eos> I am the true defender of the faithful the blood of the prophet runs in me and I am but a servant of his will.<eos> You have nothing to say?<eos> It has never been my intention to encourage braggarts.<eos> Your shell is strong like a turtle's but it is brittle.<eos> Your tongue is clever and fast. Be careful you do not trip over it.
But, master, I use all of those things when I need them. Why do I have to give you coins now?<eos> Because you're a free man!<eos> You insisted on your freedom,<eos> And with freedom comes responsibility.<eos> - But I don't want any of those things.<eos> - Oh, blast!<eos> Isn't there anything that you want?<eos> Perhaps so,<eos> But for now I will keep my coins.<eos> How many would I have to give you for your whole hut and everything in it?
Perhaps so,<eos> But for now I will keep my coins.<eos> How many would I have to give you for your whole hut and everything in it?<eos> You're a rascal!<eos> How many?<eos> - That's a joke, isn't it? - Oh, yes.<eos> A joke.<eos> If I bought everything you have, you would have to work for me,<eos> And I'd have to give you coins to buy everything back again. Oh, dear.<eos> The hut and everything in it, yeah?
Not my money, your money now.<eos> I don't need money.<eos> What use is money?<eos> You're a rich man now, master.<eos> There are 2,000 coins there.<eos> Count them.<eos> What are they for?<eos> You remember?<eos> We decided.<eos> The hut and everything in it.
Young people don't talk with their parents.<eos> It's a way of defending their personality, I guess.<eos> Valeria keeps no secrets from me.<eos> Isn't that true?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> I believe she has secrets, and that's her right.<eos> Trust has its limits.<eos> The use of hands at the table has its limits too!<eos> Could you pass me the salad?<eos> I hope you were happy to find your room just as you left it before going away to school.
This problem has been put up here for two days now and no one has yet come forward with the solution.<eos> Go then friend and good luck.<eos> Good-bye and thanks.<eos> Excuse me sir,<eos> I heard you speaking my language, could you please translate the text for me to be more certain?<eos> I haven't understood some of the details.<eos> My pleasure sir.<eos> Here is a mathematical problem for an illustrious mind.<eos> A stone falls from A to B in one hour.<eos> It is perpetually attracted by the earth with the same force, without losing any of the speed imparted to it by the previous attraction.
Here, you are far from Rome.<eos> The first three chapters.<eos> I still have to make a few corrections.<eos> I'll be the most important work of the century, equal to those of Bacon,<eos> Copernicus or Galileo.<eos> It'll be a work different to theirs because many of my hypotheses are completely new, above all concerning the structure of the universe.<eos> Are you going to say anything about the movement of the skies?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> I do however have an original hypothesis also on this subject.<eos> The ancients always believed the earth to be at the centre of the universe, Tolomeo taught this hypothesis, but it was proved false after the observations made in recent centuries by the astronomers.
I'm Officer Hanzo.<eos> I'll kill you.<eos> I kept my promise and killed Genan when the month was up.<eos> Hanzo!<eos> Good for you.You killed Genan.<eos> I'm proud as your superior.<eos> That's,<eos> The spear is my reward.<eos> No, not that!<eos> You've no right to it. It belonged to Heisuke Takei.
Diane, I think your muffin's stuck in your spring again.<eos> Mmm. Stuff the muffin.<eos> I'll eat instant oatmeal.<eos> I - I really feel terrible about this.<eos> - Hey, don't. Oatmeal is very nutritious.<eos> - And so is creamed farina.<eos> If Matchemonedo really does exist, why haven't we heard from him in recent years?<eos> - Why does he remain dormant?<eos> - That lake has shifted.<eos> That land was underwater until it was reclaimed, so maybe the water's had some effect.
No, no, no.<eos> He was really very excited about it.<eos> Yeah, he, uh- he doesn't want a rewrite, exactly.<eos> He just wants a, uh, polish.<eos> Then why was he shouting?<eos> Oh, listen.<eos> Editors shout a lot.<eos> You gotta get used to that.<eos> Well, I'll look over my notes and see if I can tighten it up a little bit.<eos> Yeah, listen, uh, I heard about a-a business named Grace's Catering Service, but, Faye, it's not listed here in the directory.

The killer's kicked him in the groin and he's bitten half his left buttock off and the referee's stepped in with a warning there.<eos> What a plucky fighter this champ is.<eos> He's fighting as well as I've ever seen him.<eos> He must be losing blood at the rate of a pint a second now.<eos> It's everywhere.<eos> Certainly those who paid $1.5 million for those ringside seats are really getting their money's worth.<eos> They're covered in it.<eos> And his head's off!<eos> ...in so many fights is off in the 31st second.<eos> It's rolled away down to the left.
I can't go yet. Hans is hysterical. I can't leave him alone.<eos> Please take Alice with you or I'll never get away.<eos> See you in Amsterdam, day after tomorrow.<eos> Who wrote to you?<eos> - Your mother. - What did she say?<eos> That she'll catch up with us in Amsterdam.<eos> I saw all this the day we arrived.<eos> Do you have all you need in that suitcase?<eos> Do you like flying?<eos> I like the food, it's wrapped up so nicely.
Then we're dead, too.<eos> - Maybe not... maybe there's a way.<eos> Hey, hey my, my jetpack's busted.<eos> Aw, man...<eos> Hey, ...it looks like the skipper. He made it.<eos> Commander Powell made it!<eos> Men... men... what happened, men?<eos> Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.<eos> Talby, looks like I'm headed for the planet.<eos> I'm going right toward it.
I fear that something has Leung Hon in mind for me ... even more horrible what he plans for his son.<eos> Hsi Ching, perhaps you can explain to Mrs Buren.<eos> There are many dangers.<eos> But you can be certain that my brothers and I we will turn at every moment.<eos> So I have little to fear.<eos> I have to protest ...<eos> Do not serve your welcome, father.<eos> You have a great own free will.<eos> We have a sister.<eos> It is called May Kwei.
Of course I did.<eos> Why didn't you say something?<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> Well, I didn't think you were smart enough to appreciate it.<eos> With all your high class bug talk.<eos> I was afraid that you'd be terrified and run away, and I need you.<eos> Well, you're right about that.<eos> When's the helicopter coming?<eos> James, we are faced with a power that has appeared and is exerting itself.<eos> We have the opportunity to study it, to learn from it, to teach it its limitations.
I thought you should know, sir, your desk drawer's been broken into.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> Here's Mr. Sollars.<eos> Mr. Harper's on the phone.<eos> - I've alerted the department, sir. - The key, man.<eos> The key for the stones!<eos> My God.<eos> It's gone.
What's she say?<eos> I think she'd like us to go.<eos> Well, you tell her that we've come a long way to pay our respects to this man. We're very tired.<eos> Tell her we wanna get a room for the night.<eos> We'll leave in the morning.<eos> I can tell you the brandy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Listen, honey... you oughta be drunk in Fresno, California.<eos> This place is a palace.<eos> Listen, I promise I'll put the grave back just the way I found it.
Ah... right...<eos> Make yourself at home.<eos> I live here alone now.<eos> Yes...<eos> I'll see my room now.<eos> Don't rush off.<eos> Sleep here tonight.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Our school is small, but has a long history.<eos> Dr. Kimoto established it eighty years ago.
You'll do exactly as I ask you to do, and I pay you handsomely just for that privilege.<eos> You say you've always kept your gun in the car?<eos> Yes.<eos> Is that the car?<eos> It is.<eos> May I take a look?<eos> Of course, if you'd like.<eos> How long has this lock been broken?<eos> Well, I don't know that it is.<eos> It's been jimmied, sir, and the scratch mark is fresh.
Well, I don't know that it is.<eos> It's been jimmied, sir, and the scratch mark is fresh.<eos> May I?<eos> I think you're absolutely right, Lieutenant.<eos> I see what you're driving at. You mean that... that someone could have broken into the car, and that's how the gun was stolen.<eos> It's possible, sir.<eos> And the key.<eos> Sir?<eos> The key to Allen's office, I kept an extra one here in the glove compartment, along with the gun.<eos> No, it's gone, too.
My name is Tom Sims.<eos> I'm a newspaper columnist.<eos> Several years ago... I covered firsthand the incredible story... you are about to see re-created in this motion picture.<eos> It is a human horror story of ghastly proportions... and profound reverberations.<eos> But because it is human... perhaps we can learn something from it... something of ourselves... of our own fears and needs.
It's too hot!<eos> You go, we'll drive around and meet you after.<eos> We'll meet you on some corner. I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes.<eos> We can't argue about it here, so you follow me to the Plaza Hotel.<eos> We can order five bathrooms and take cold baths!<eos> Oh, me! Open another window!<eos> - There aren't any more.<eos> - Then we'd better phone for an axe!<eos> The thing to do is to forget about the heat.<eos> You make it worse by crabbing about it.
Donald had left it with the factor for safe keeping when he had gone off on some sort of expedition.<eos> When he didn't come back, the factor sent it on to me.<eos> Hmm. It's an old page from a Hudson's Bay Company journal.<eos> Look at the entry for January 15, 1856.<eos> "To this post, this day came John Merchison with his Eskimos,<eos> "who hunt the white bear far beyond the land's end.<eos> "He told of seeing a lone cloud, as if lying on the ice,<eos> "and hidden beneath it, an island.<eos> "This island, he sought to examine, but his Eskimos refused him,<eos> "saying it's guarded by evil spirits.
- Did you see who shot him?<eos> - No. I was in his arms.<eos> My eyes were closed.<eos> At least he died happy.<eos> The bullet went through him.<eos> Through his back and ended up there?<eos> No, no, through his neck.<eos> I take it out of the wall before the police arrive.<eos> And now it is my lucky charm.<eos> I never dance without it.
Nothing in the law says I have to tell you anything.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then you better tell your client... to find himself a new private.<eos> Pending a look into that shootout, there will be a delay... in approval of Pinky's request to take you on.<eos> We're all set, Captain.<eos> I'll search Santiago's place.<eos> I'll cover his house, but even if he's got it, he's not gonna have his stash there.<eos> Ed, you've gotta help me with something here.<eos> Let's say for a minute McQ is right... and Santiago needed the dope to supply his people... so he brought in this robbery team, right?<eos> Now you tell me, how did he know when state was gonna move it... or how did he know where it was gonna be burned?
Come on, Lois.<eos> All right, Lon.<eos> What happened?<eos> Lon, for God's sake.<eos> Stan was dirty.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> I didn't want to, either.<eos> He was in a frolic, all right... to steal dope from the Property section... and sell it off.<eos> The dope had been switched for sugar long before the heist.<eos> It was stashed in my car.
Ain't you going to say hello to your old lady?<eos> That bitch is too ugly... for you to say hello to in public.<eos> I'd go with her a lot quicker... than I'd go with your mama.<eos> She's so ugly... your daddy don't even want to go with her.<eos> Look who's talking.<eos> Shit, if ugliness was electricity... your mama would be walking in a powerhouse.<eos> Oh, man, dig that.<eos> That's light shit.<eos> Your mama look like ten miles of bad road, nigger.<eos> Your mama got a face... that look like it been run over by a bus... and everybody kept telling how good she looking till you.
You'll be the end of me, son.<eos> It's only a loan, OK?<eos> I'll pay for it.<eos> But don't tell anyone, otherwise they'll hide it.<eos> They never let me have a drop.<eos> Don't worry. It's our secret.<eos> Look out! Neusa is coming!<eos> - What's up?<eos> - That dress.<eos> - What's the matter with it?
- None.<eos> Have you tried?<eos> It just didn't work.<eos> Disgust for your husband could be the reason.<eos> There must be love, Laura.<eos> Laura, do you know what love is?<eos> You're making fun of me.<eos> You've hurt your hand...<eos> Sir, the door is open. Someone might see us.<eos> And if it were closed?
You have failed everything you have attempted.<eos> You have not rescued this one and you have not been able to handle local aborigines.<eos> This one wishes you...<eos> What is the Earth word? "Luck."<eos> You will require it.<eos> Wait!<eos> Unlock us.<eos> Set us free!<eos> Captain, perhaps we can attract the attention of the alien intelligence<eos> - and reason with it.
Cross-connect to A-14.<eos> If it can be blocked, the lava will flow past those rocks to one side. Got it.<eos> - Sord.<eos> - I heard him!<eos> Carefully, Em.<eos> One missed connection could destroy us. I know.<eos> I figure we've bought ourselves a little time.<eos> Few minutes.<eos> It's re-rigged. Hurry.<eos> Come on, insect, move it!
Your wife left a message, she said be home by 8 and don't be late.<eos> If you don't need me I'll go.<eos> -Yes, go.<eos> -Goodnight.<eos> How much?<eos> -Okay...20,000 (Lira)<eos> Where are we?<eos> What a strange smell.<eos> The smell of leather!<eos> Don't you like it?
These scars are gonna remind you.<eos> Don't you get the carry of this, slanty man?<eos> Rankin.<eos> Well. The hero finally found his voice.<eos> Nothing matters much to you.<eos> Nothing except your property.<eos> That's the way I've held it. Held it with my strength.<eos> Strength!<eos> What would you know about strength?<eos> You've always had it. Nothing ever challenged it. lt's strength.
But give it a try.<eos> Caine, I'd like you to me a favor and pick up the supplies for me.<eos> Here's the money and here's the list.<eos> When you finish picking them up and loading them in the wagon I'll be over at Fay's place, right over there.<eos> Come over there.<eos> Caine, you know that lucky piece?<eos> Well, could I borrow it for a little?<eos> No, no, no. Borrow. Borrow, I promise.<eos> I need the magic.<eos> I'd feel naked without it.
What do I have to do with any of this?<eos> Why don't you let me go?<eos> C'mon, honey, be quiet.<eos> You've been keeping calm so far.<eos> They won't do any harm to us, you'll see, right?<eos> May I take this vacant chair?<eos> It's taken!<eos> Excuse me, but I see that it's vacant.<eos> What about that chair?<eos> - It's taken.
Nonsense, we bought it from you. You can take back your coloured beads.<eos> I offer this as a sacrifice.<eos> Look at my action with kindness.<eos> The path of the moon will be my cloak. A sacred praise I make.<eos> A sacred praise I make.<eos> We cannot tolerate this violence and this looking anymore. We cannot and we must not.<eos> We will not surrender to an irresponsible minority of rebels, who try to destabilize authority.<eos> We will take all the necessary measures, to punish whoever supports violence. And to re-establish order. Look out!<eos> There's a police car coming!<eos> The limit of these political newspapers is that they can only reach very few people who in any case already know about the issue they agree with it or they pretend to be.
Stop.<eos> Stop! No more killing, Aldo.<eos> Put down your weapons.<eos> - Take them back to the armory. - No.<eos> We shall keep the guns.<eos> Move, Caesar, or we shall kill you.<eos> Ape has never killed ape, let alone an ape child.<eos> Aldo has killed an ape child.<eos> The branch did not break.<eos> It was cut, with a sword.
- And a lovely lambrequin.<eos> - Shall we make a pelmet?<eos> A pelmet too, and again, draped into folds at each side.<eos> Very well.<eos> So, gentlemen, please come in.<eos> We'll have the carpet in here and the armchair too, for the moment.<eos> We can't get through the other door.<eos> And as we, or rather, my husband, already had a great deal, I received the value in real carpets, a grand piano, silver, lovely curtains fashioned by Rudolph Hertzog.<eos> All of it in luxury goods, beautiful Baroque chandeliers.<eos> Yes, and then... we lived in that house for 15 years, until it was bombed out in 1945.
We don't want money, we want Daniello.<eos> Your daughter's life for yours.<eos> We'll call you at Daniello's.<eos> I'm going there, I have to!<eos> They're torturing my daughter!<eos> I have to!<eos> No, Don Daniello, I can't allow it.<eos> They'd torture you before they killed you.<eos> That Calabrian might give information to the Anti-Mafia Squad.<eos> I have to look out for my family, it's been around for 40 years.
Do you swear to uphold the law of Baird, Texas... United States of America?<eos> And I ain't gonna forget your taking care of Billy Joe, either.<eos> He's a lot younger than my other boarders. But it'll be nice to have a young boy around again.<eos> I sure appreciate it.<eos> And if he stays, it'll be the first Cahill I've been able to keep under my roof.<eos> If he causes you any trouble, you just sit right down on him.<eos> And as for you, Billy Joe... What the hell are you whispering about?<eos> Don't you know that whispering ain't polite... except in church, or a courtroom?<eos> What he's saying ain't private, Pa. Billy Joe was thinking you ought to let the doctor see your shoulder.<eos> It's been took care of, bandaged, and...
It's part of my life.<eos> And that's what I want you to try and understand, Son.<eos> Your old man's life.<eos> Will you give it a try?<eos> Yeah, Pa. I'll try.<eos> I'm glad... 'cause even grown men need understanding.<eos> I'll be by tomorrow, Billy Joe.<eos> He has a high fever, J.D. How high?<eos> A hundred and three.<eos> - But it's not climbing, it's leveled off.
Well, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> I mean... do you have any ideas?<eos> Yes, sir, I do.<eos> Seems reasonably certain to me that your uncle was murdered.<eos> Oh, come on, Columbo.<eos> Come on!<eos> This melodramatic sleuthing is driving me crazy.<eos> I don't like being rude, Lieutenant, but I really must go.<eos> For instance, that upstairs bathtub...<eos> If somebody went in there and, let's say, dropped an electrical appliance in there, in that bathtub, during a time when it was occupied, I mean.
-Bullshit, Mr. Han-Man !<eos> Man, you come right out of a comic book.<eos> Been practicing, huh?<eos> -Williams is expecting me in my room.<eos> We will meet your friend Williams later.<eos> -This is my museum.<eos> It is difficult to associate these horrors...<eos> Sparta, Rome, the knights of Europe, the samurai.<eos> They worship strength because it is strength... ... thatmakesallothervaluespossible.<eos> Nothing survives without it.
The image became all warped.<eos> Did you try the buttons?<eos> -Which buttons?<eos> The controls.<eos> -No.<eos> I only ever used the on/off button.<eos> That's all.<eos> -Wrong!<eos> A TV wants attention, love and understanding.<eos> You shouldn't just look at it, but also look after it.
I'm gonna take care of you, too,<eos> Aw, look at you, look at you,<eos> Kinda silly, isn't it?<eos> You look so pretty with all that water on your face,<eos> live loved you for a long time, lady,<eos> Goldie, Goldie...<eos> Come here, come here, Dont do that,<eos> So you must first of all remember, this system was not originally... designed with Black people in mind,<eos> Right on, brother!<eos> And it definitely was not prepared for Black people to, in the end, begin to demand their rights and an equal share in this country which theyive died for,
Hell, I don't have nothing against the Kid saving maybe he killed J.W. Bell.<eos> I sure did like J.W.<eos> We'll meet up on the other side of the fort, at Pete Maxwell's place.<eos> I know old Pete.<eos> Hello, Pete.<eos> Heard you were back.<eos> Obliged.<eos> We'd like to bed down in your extra bunk.<eos> No reason not to.<eos> I got no need for it.
But that's vampire country!<eos> Haven't you heard of those blood sucking creatures?<eos> It's your forte.<eos> Eliphas, in his book of mysteries, describes them like this...<eos> Sine morte mortuus, sine vita vivens...<eos> Dead without death, alive without life.<eos> Aren't you frightened you might get bitten on the neck?<eos> I never exclude any possibility, so I shall go well protected...<eos> I found this amulet during my expedition in the Valley of the Kings.<eos> In Egypt it was worn in homage to the demon god Pazuzu...
I'm fine, how are you?<eos> You're worried.<eos> Marianne's mother called and she's worried as well, you say.<eos> Good Lord...<eos> No, Marianne and I are doing fine.<eos> We're healthy and cheerful and ecstatically happy.<eos> Nothing's wrong, I swear!<eos> Don't worry, Mother dear.<eos> Your intuition?<eos> It's led you astray.
He owes me.<eos> You understand?<eos> He's the most honest cop I know, Frank.<eos> Frank, trust me.<eos> Things like this were common practice in the bad old days.<eos> Hard to believe it's still going on.<eos> Serpico, don't you think it's kind of stupid... taking an envelope from somebody you didn't know?<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> I mean, give me...<eos> How would I know what was in it unless I took it?
- What kind of job are you looking for?<eos> - May we use the familar 'you'?<eos> But of course...<eos> This beer is warm!<eos> So... I'm looking for any kind of job.<eos> I could be a garbage collector.<eos> They say it pays well.<eos> That way, I could invite you to the cinema or take you out for pizza.<eos> - Is pizza good enough for you?<eos> - Yes, as long as it's made well.
That's a miracle of science.<eos> This is what I call a cosmic screwing.<eos> And where am I, anyhow?<eos> What happened to everybody? Where are all my friends?<eos> Understand that everyone you knew in the past has been dead nearly 200 years.<eos> But they all ate organic rice.<eos> You are now in the year 2173.<eos> This is the central parallel of the American Federation.<eos> This district is what you'd probably call the southwestern United States.<eos> That was before it was destroyed by the war. - War?
You sign it! If I close and somebody higher and hotter wants to know why, it's my job!<eos> Sign it. I'll cover for you.<eos> I won't put my job on the line for you, Hatcher.<eos> Hey, big shot. Hatcher says you're on riot control.<eos> Great. That really makes my day.<eos> This was once called Gramercy Park. Now it's the only tree sanctuary in New York.<eos> Governor. Sorry to disturb you this way, sir.<eos> Not at all. Your secretary told me where to find you. It's urgent...<eos> Now, what is it? I'm to inform you the board is determined to resolve... the Simonson investigation immediately, sir.<eos> - I thought it was resolved.
Could I have a light?<eos> Now she's disappeared, like Lause.<eos> Lause disappeared too, and everyone's forgotten him.<eos> Except me...<eos> He's in my head and he refuses to come out.<eos> My Eva... my darling little Eva.<eos> They'll forget you too.<eos> But in my head, she'll stay there.<eos> I mean... my head's a funny head.<eos> There are things in it that don't go in any other head.
Her name is Rowan Morrison.<eos> The photo was in this letter, posted here on Summerisle.<eos> No, no, never seen her before.<eos> I don't know the face either.<eos> Do you know her, Kenny?<eos> She doesn't belong to this island.<eos> No, I never saw her before.<eos> No, she doesn't belong here at all. Johnnie?<eos> The letter is anonymous.<eos> It was addressed to me personally on the mainland.
Show the Sergeant to his room, would you?<eos> ♪ Much has been said of the strumpets of yore<eos> ♪ Of wenches and bawdy house queens by the score<eos> ♪ But I sing of a baggage that we all adore<eos> ♪ The landlord's daughter<eos> ♪ You'll never love another<eos> ♪ Although she's not the kind of girl<eos> ♪ To take home to your mother<eos> ♪ Her ale, it is lively and strong to the taste<eos> ♪ It is brewed with discretion, never with haste
Thank you.<eos> Are you Mr Lennox, the photographer?<eos> Oh, I'm firstly a chemist, secondly a photographer.<eos> I understand you take the harvest festival photographs every year.<eos> - The ones I saw in The Green Man.<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's rather humdrum work, I'm afraid.<eos> What happened to last year's photograph?<eos> Isn't it there with the others?<eos> No, no, it's not. Apparently it's been broken or damaged in some way.
- Know what?<eos> That we have immobilized your ship worse than you have immobilized ours.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> Our instruments report nothing except some undue transporter activity and...<eos> Kirk?<eos> Tribbles?<eos> Tribbles.<eos> Kirk, Cyrano Jones took a Klingon genetic construct, an artificial creature from one of our planets.<eos> We must have it back.<eos> It was designed to be a tribble predator.
- Are you still alive?<eos> - Come in, princess Altoborghi.<eos> You've arrived before I had a chance to consummate my madness.<eos> Are you a necrophiliac, or a lost gravedigger... Who only moves if you smell the stench of death?<eos> - You scared me!<eos> - Did you come by car?<eos> Yes, in mine.<eos> Come.<eos> The car with this number plate belongs to the lady...<eos> - Looks like it's scratched, I'll have a look.
Five minutes we were silently looking at each other.<eos> Then he went away.<eos> He walked half an inch above ground.<eos> He had new boots on and didn't make any noise.<eos> Oh, tell me, dear son, I wanna be told if you will care for me when I'm old?<eos> I will, oh sure, until I get married then I will pay you back, dear mother, don't be worried.<eos> You will sit by the stove weeping and I, dear mother , at the table eating.<eos> This double bass is still alive.<eos> It's older than me.<eos> It' s married two hundred people, maybe more.
I've always been attracted to the science one calls occult.<eos> It has for me the colour of legend.<eos> Geomancy... is no doubt one of the oldest and most secret techniques of analysis and divination.<eos> It was born, a few thousand years ago, around the Mediterranean basin.

but that is impossible, it cannot be, are you not aware that this is impossible?<eos> Well, you see that it is.<eos> I refuse to believe such a thing.<eos> These prints have been placed here by some prankster, who stole the mummies as a joke.<eos> Many children come here, Inspector?<eos> Yes, as well as many field trips from schools.<eos> What are you examinining?<eos> something very strange.<eos> Look at this foot print, examine it yourself, inspector.<eos> There is nothing peculiar about it, it is from common footwear.
Oh, what is my...<eos> This is it.<eos> My theory that belongs to me<eos> This is how it goes.<eos> The next thing I'm going to say Is my theory.<eos> Ready?<eos> My theory, by a. elk-- Brackets, miss, brackets--<eos> This theory goes as follows and begins now:<eos> All brontosauruses are thin at one end Much, much thicker in the middle And then thin again at the far end.<eos> That is my theory. It is mine and belongs to me And I own it and what it is, too.
Come my honey, come, For my heart awaits you,<eos> Longing for you, longing for you. If you kiss me I'll be happy,<eos> Pretty girl is you see, The wind plays with her nice hair,<eos> Still until the following day It's unaware off all the chagrin<eos> But the flower will fade The girl must mary<eos> She will know sorrow Its happiness will end<eos> The charrette arrived And soon will teke it along<eos> But says the engaged girl I will never marry.<eos> A beautiful flower is married Its crown is of lily of the valley<eos> Happy is his engaged For which it is intended
There's no room for Germans here!<eos> Because behind us is Russia.<eos> Or to state it simple, our motherland.<eos> It's a great life, fellahs,<eos> Soldiering's a song, When the Sergeant likes you, Nothing can go wrong.<eos> Don't start shooting until the krauts are in the water.<eos> And until then you only breathe once in a while, so the birds go on singing.<eos> Got it.<eos> Here, but for shooting over the river, use the rifle, save the machine gun.<eos> When they begin to attack, you're going to have plenty of use for it.
Where are we?<eos> - We've got three different fingerprints.<eos> Not bad.<eos> Hurry up with the pictures.<eos> - I'm almost finished.<eos> Go next door after.<eos> Exactly the same as professor D'Angelo.<eos> Have you found the murder weapon?<eos> - No, only the victim's revolver.<eos> Find out if it was registered.
How many people had a connection to both victims?<eos> Too many, inspector, hence before we check all of them...<eos> Right.<eos> What I don't understand about this investigation is why the murderer didn't take the brooch.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Do you how much it's worth?<eos> Have a guess.<eos> 100...200,000?<eos> If only...<eos> It's valued at three million lire.
Come on.<eos> - Hey, Joe, you all right? - I'm all right.<eos> Come on, you can't crap out on me now.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> Drive, man.<eos> What happened up there?<eos> Shit, the truck.<eos> What's the matter, Henry?<eos> Can't you drive?<eos> - It's stalled!
It can't go on like this, men.<eos> The rations are almost finished.<eos> The terrain is so difficult, we're almost at a standstill.<eos> We cannot hope to reach a populated area for some time.<eos> In view of the situation we're in I have changed my plans as follows:<eos> Rafts will be built and manned by forty men.<eos> These men will have the task to get food and information about hostile Indians and the location of El Dorado.<eos> We have every reason to believe that both are near...<eos> The expedition must return within one week by water or by land.<eos> If it doesn't we have to assume it is lost and we have to march back the same way in the hope of reaching an area inhabited by Christians.
Loana and our people.<eos> Save them.<eos> So just like that, Loana, the daughter of Black Cloud,<eos> saved your life?<eos> I find it hard to believe, but it's true.<eos> Without that Indian, lieutenant Wilson would be dead.<eos> I can't say what happened, I was completely unconscious.<eos> How's your shoulder?<eos> Fine.<eos> It's healed.
I want solitary.<eos> - First you let go of that man, Valachi.<eos> - Like hell.<eos> I want a promise of solitary, or this knife goes right through his neck.<eos> I can't stop him going in the hole if he wants it.<eos> Okay.<eos> - You got your promise, buddy.<eos> - Come on. Come on.<eos> You don't like our cooking?<eos> Maybe you think it's poisoned.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?<eos> Joe, there are days you come in and there are nights I know your hands have been covered with blood.<eos> Does Mr. Genovese or Mr. Bender give you some kind of magical power so you don't feel anything?<eos> I never hit nobody that never deserve.<eos> Honest to God, Maria.<eos> We only hit the guys who cheat on the family.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> You want me to say, "Hey, Vito, I'm only gonna hit the following guys"?<eos> You can't do that.<eos> You see, if you believe in the family, then you fight for it.
This is my manor, and the villains in it are mine.<eos> You're welcome to them, so just run along and arrest a few.<eos> Missing persons are my concern, too.<eos> Yes, missing dentists, missing greengrocers.<eos> But this particular missing person, as far as you're concerned, Inspector... is no longer missing.<eos> I don't see him around anywhere.<eos> Do you?<eos> What a droll fellow you are.<eos> The Manfred case is closed.<eos> It was never opened.
Very well.<eos> Take her to my office.<eos> Will have to forgive me.<eos> The sheep has... sore throat.<eos> Mr. Milos, I am going to have to call the police.<eos> can we speak?<eos> Do not put it in my office, please.<eos> must not do that.<eos> is not it a beautiful Daisy?<eos> - Yes, it it is.
Why don't you take off your clothes?<eos> What?<eos> Take off your clothes.<eos> I wouldn't mind a bit of champagne.<eos> You're pulling my hair.<eos> - No, it's stuck.<eos> What's happening?<eos> - The zipper's stuck.<eos> You're hurting me.<eos> - Excuse me. I'm so sorry. It's the first time it got stuck.
Miss?<eos> I think you should come with me.<eos> Leave him?<eos> Oh, I can't.<eos> I can't leave my brother.<eos> He's all I've got.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Nonnie. ...your brother's dead.<eos> Did you like his music?<eos> I would have danced to it if I'd had somebody to dance with.
I'd like to very much.<eos> How should I pose?<eos> What's the best way?<eos> Different ways.<eos> Just pose in different ways.<eos> No.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Take your gloves off.<eos> That's it.<eos> I don't know what the idea of this costume is... but I'm glad you're getting a kick out of it.
Gariba' have you gone crazy? What you do here?<eos> Go back to the rest house.<eos> No, I ain't going back, because the nuns make us sing and do gym.<eos> Don't complain, you've even got heating.<eos> Who cares...<eos> Peppino has been promising me a hut for 8 years.<eos> Hit her! - Peppino...<eos> I am pregnant! - She has 12 children...<eos> Do you like the hut?<eos> - I like it a lot...
- I just wanna get down, that's all.<eos> You will.<eos> - You got any more of that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're my buddy.<eos> Say, who do you think's got that bomb?<eos> Oh, I thought you didn't care.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I was just asking your opinion, that's all.<eos> I think maybe you've got it in your cello case.
Poor Tea, eh?<eos> That's better.<eos> Do you know that's the first sign of sorrow you've shown... since you heard of her death?<eos> You wouldn't put it here anyway, or even upstairs among Marguerite's shoes.<eos> It's too obvious.<eos> - Such grief is touching.<eos> You really are the salt of the earth, you know that, Andrew?<eos> By the way, that's a clue, if you're interested.<eos> "Salt of the earth"?<eos> Earth? It's buried!
- Yes.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> The cat's realised we've come here about him.<eos> Bloody animal!<eos> I... I...<eos> I'm scared of him. Believe me, Inspector.<eos> No, don't bother...<eos> It seems to be coming from that door.<eos> Yes, the cellar.<eos> But it's always closed.
And the cult of the senses made the young Find in them new gods on whom any motion of their life should depend<eos> But man cannot be separated from his senses<eos> It is through them that Divinity expresses Itself Which, although in tiny parts, Is present within each man<eos> Divinity is not divisible in small pieces or parted among men<eos> How could infinity be divisible?<eos> Divinity is indivisible and in Christ became flesh<eos> It became Word of truth Light for each man<eos> And in this light man participates and lives in It<eos> Christians do not renounce to arts, to letters, to music<eos> They do not deny history They only say that through it Man must always see better the light within himself and God's Word that became flesh and dwelt among us
How are you?<eos> Mrs Williams, I think we can forget about the pen.<eos> - Would you like a flashlight?<eos> - I've offered him one.<eos> That last call was from the police.<eos> They've found your husband's car.<eos> - Was there any sign of violence?<eos> - None.<eos> - How did they stop it?<eos> - It was found near a stop sign.
Mrs Williams is to fly alone, north along this highway,<eos> - then she heads across the desert.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> There'll be a flashing signal and the money is to be dropped in a bag.<eos> Usual warnings - no cops.<eos> - When is the drop?<eos> - That we don't know.<eos> All I can say is they'll call us tonight.<eos> (Carlson) Listen, Miller - the victim's car has been picked up by the LAPD.<eos> They've got it in the downtown garage.
Give me that, face powder is $5 an ounce!<eos> It's not meant for dirty Negroes like you. Now get out of here!<eos> - Enough Mammy, I'm clean.<eos> - Let me take a look.<eos> You don't like the water, eh?<eos> You're worse than a Negro.<eos> Not so hard, you're hurting me.<eos> You know those Italian photographers that are here?<eos> Mammy, I want them to take my portrait in the pink dress.<eos> Is it cut too low?
It's Saint Galeone's day, a holiday.<eos> That's why I'm back.<eos> I've got a buyer for the big jar.<eos> Smile now, dear wife of mine.<eos> We'll have bread for a month!<eos> He'll pay five denari!<eos> Just think, five denari!<eos> That's why I'm angry.<eos> You're a man and you sell it for five.<eos> I'm a woman, I stay at home all day and I sold it for seven to a young man just before you came home. He's inside it looking it over.
What notes?<eos> The lady and I were joined in an "intimate" friendship.<eos> That's why I sent her flowers along with my thoughts, hoping she'd remember the good times, and perhaps decide on a nostalgic encounter.<eos> I hate you.<eos> The only thing I can't stand is indifference.<eos> Hate is a good feeling, it's fiery and violent<eos> like love, only more so.<eos> Mrs Wardh, you received a threatening phone call and that Carroll went to the appointment in your place thinking that you were dealing with your friend...<eos> Was it that man's voice on the phone?<eos> It was disguised, it could have been anyone.
Someone's after me.<eos> They're going to kill me!<eos> Nothing's gonna happen.<eos> - Yes it will!<eos> Please!<eos> Oh God, no!<eos> If I'm a nuisance, I'll go.<eos> - Don't be stupid; I'm delighted.<eos> Dalia, come and listen to this story.<eos> It's called 'The Rape of Frankenstein.'
Somebody has to stay here with you.<eos> But not now!<eos> Look, I can't explain, there's no time, you've got to get out of here, understand?<eos> In the morning, Nina, come back in the morning.<eos> - What's the matter, what's happening?<eos> Nina!<eos> Look, I'm waiting for someone.<eos> Now you go out that door, and you run.<eos> You run to my car.<eos> It's parked out front.
Do they now?<eos> Well, that's serious.<eos> I'll watch out.<eos> Honey, you've been dreaming.<eos> I wish I were!<eos> No. Uh-uh.<eos> Get someone else.<eos> Dr. Leavitt, I told you, there's a fire!<eos> My experiment's at the critical stage. I've been working around the clock.<eos> I want that new plate read as soon as it's developed. Yes, ma'am.
Talk, you fool, and we'll stop the phonograph.<eos> I'll talk. I'll talk.<eos> But please turn it off.<eos> Please.<eos> When is the revolution set for?<eos> The first week of July.<eos> You're a liar.<eos> That's only two months away.<eos> No... no.<eos> Esposito is timing it to coincide with the American Fourth of July, so as to imitate his hero George Washington.
It's the assistant stage manager's job to understudy everybody's part.<eos> Now, I told you that when I took you on.<eos> Now, hurry up and don't argue.<eos> You've got exactly 5 minutes.<eos> That's enough for fun.<eos> I want the best seat in the house.<eos> Let me see.<eos> You could have the royal box<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Except that it's permanently reserved for the princess Arthur of Connaught.
Calm!<eos> Always calm!<eos> You must endure every humiliation without rebelling, every injustice, without ever protesting.<eos> Calm, I says to you!<eos> Always calm!<eos> 'Cause, surveyor, you, a learned person, ...keep this in mind for ever:<eos> It's enough to turn your head once, only once, I says, and you, from the prison, you'll never get out!<eos> And now let me 'cause me wants to have a sleep.<eos> Excuse me, carabiniere, can I go to the toillet?<eos> - Can't you do without it?
Come, move it!<eos> Di Noi for the office!<eos> Di Noi for the office!<eos> Guardascione, are you ready?<eos> - All done, youngmaster!<eos> - Of course I am,<eos> Chief?<eos> Do you think it was possible I wasn't ready?<eos> - What's this, a brush?<eos> - Have you spat on it?
Then how can you not remember that on the 6/11/1970 the viaduct on the 57 th km collapsed?<eos> - Because I never knew it.<eos> - I've been living in S weden since 1963.<eos> - Professor, theoretically, ...I shouldn't even proceed because he doesn't know the reasons for his indictment.<eos> Listen to me carefully, Di Noi!<eos> As soon as you have reached the border they've arrested you.<eos> But what did they tell you when they arrested you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> But it'd have been your right and duty to ask for the copy of the warrant for your arrest.<eos> I did ask for it.
You must learn to bear your cross with Christian fortitude, my child.<eos> I'm frightened.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> How can I own the child?<eos> I am very frightened!<eos> And there was such bravery in love, wasn't there, Phillipe?<eos> All through those summer nights, how unafraid we were each time we huddled down together.<eos> Remember?<eos> We laughed as we roused the animal.<eos> - And now, it's devoured us.
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday...<eos> Here we are:<eos> Friday the 26th of April<eos> Thanks that's what I wanted to know.<eos> - Inspector, just a moment.<eos> That's the morning I found the milk from the day before.<eos> Therefore I think she must have left Thursday.<eos> How did you find the shirt after all this time?<eos> His wife hadn't threw it away or sent it to the cleaners.<eos> It was locked in a chest.
How should I know that?<eos> Anyway, you've got them covered now, so it's just routine isn't it?<eos> I can leave the rest to you, can't I?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No. Mr. Walcott!<eos> I'm going fishing.<eos> Good luck, Rourke.<eos> Well, what are we going to do now?<eos> You're familiar with this case.<eos> I want you assigned to it exclusively.
Tell you what.<eos> Why don't you... go out on the back of the motorcycle.<eos> And on the locker, you know, those big tall lockers.<eos> On the left... You open it up and there's a whole pile of stuff in there.<eos> And you see right on top of it, there's a map.<eos> You know what a map is.<eos> No.<eos> Well, it's a big piece of paper all folded up like an accordian.<eos> If you open it up you see all these red lines and different colored names of places.<eos> Right on the front, when it's folded up, it says Idaho.
I thank you, my father.<eos> If you cannot win on Jahil you cannot win on any horse.<eos> You were the greatest chapandaz in the three provinces but the Royal Buzkashi from all the provinces of Afghanistan is a different and somewhat larger matter.<eos> Even so your horse will win.<eos> For today's first Royal Buzkashi on the field of Bagrami here in the capital city of Kabul by order of His Majesty the King whichever chapandaz among you shall carry the headless calf around the blue flag and deposit it back here in the circle of justice shall receive the king's pennant thus signifying that he is the master chapandaz of all of Afghanistan.<eos> Uraz.<eos> It's Mukhi who calls. Your syce.<eos> What have they put on my leg?<eos> A box to hold it straight.<eos> It was broken.
Leave me alone.<eos> Why didn't you let me do it?<eos> I'll see you.<eos> Do you have a match, Doctor?<eos> You wouldn't be awake?<eos> - What time is it?<eos> - Almost 7:00.<eos> I swiped this for you out of the nurses' locker room.<eos> I'll make good on your dress.<eos> I'm afraid it was torn beyond repair.
-Half a billion, why?<eos> Do you know someone who's getting rid of half a billion?<eos> What you're dong on Saturdays?<eos> -Nothing, I'm always on my own....<eos> They all turned their back on me and I don't wanna see nobody...<eos> Why you ask? You wanna take me to dance?<eos> I meant Saturday 7th, 15 days ago.<eos> What you're talking about?<eos> We'll talk later at your factory.<eos> I wish... it's been occupied...
"Ruhenol."<eos> You're not a good judge!<eos> You are prejudiced against me!<eos> You wanna punish me for what I've done before!<eos> Not for this crime, of which I'm innocent!<eos> And you know it!<eos> On the contrary, your made up alibi proves your responsability in Silvana's death.<eos> You only want to destroy me!<eos> If I was different, with your same political views, you would see the proves of my innocence!<eos> If you hate this society, I hate it even more!
Of course, nipper is necessary to hold its row... and that costs rounds.<eos> Bill does not have a cane...<eos> He could take holds it.<eos> Give your cane to Bill, and take mine.<eos> Dad...<eos> I lost your cane.<eos> Y had a key, it fell to water.<eos> It everywhere was sought, with the oars.<eos> Nothing to make...<eos> it is lost.
We were very happy.<eos> Did he ever mention specifically, a girl or a woman in New York City?<eos> - Why?<eos> We recovered in his desk at the plant in one of the drawers a typewritten letter that was evidently written on the Friday before he disappeared.<eos> It was written to a girl in New York City and we contacted the police.<eos> They brought her in, questioned her and she said that she had received six or seven letters of this kind.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> Well, it's an obscene letter, Mrs. Grunemann.<eos> I would like to see it.<eos> I would like you to remember that it was written by a very disturbed man.
- is that your room is available again.<eos> - Your bed is back.<eos> It looks like it's going to be a hot summer so there'll be plenty of watering.<eos> What we're saying is whenever you get tired of the desert...<eos> We miss you, Pop.<eos> We really do.<eos> Thanks very much. I appreciate that.<eos> I really appreciate that, Wilma.<eos> But, you know, as a matter of fact, I'm thinking of buying this house.<eos> Going to have a word with the old lady who owns it.
Greater than both by the all-hail hereafter.<eos> Thy letter transported me beyond this present and I feel the future in the instant.<eos> My dearest love Duncan comes here tonight.<eos> -And when goes hence?<eos> -Tomorrow, as he purposes.<eos> Never shall sun that morrow see.<eos> Your face is as a book where men may read strange matters.<eos> He that's coming must be provided for. You shall put this night's business into my dispatch.<eos> We will speak further.<eos> Look like the innocent flower, but be the serpent under it.
It's that way, young man.<eos> - That way, Herman. There.<eos> That's what I said, Ida. It's that way.<eos> Come along.<eos> NEW BRIDGE QUAY<eos> What happened to the house that used to be here?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> - It was my house.<eos> I Lived there.<eos> It was demolished.
You don't seem surprised.<eos> Why you were fighting?<eos> Oh, my God, Albert's dead.<eos> How did you open the crypt?<eos> How did you do it? I didn't open it.<eos> Alan, it was already open.<eos> How can you think that I...<eos> It's the truth, I swear.<eos> A woman couldn't have opened it by herself.<eos> It had been walled up.
Captain Proctor, could you explain to us the results of the ballistic investigations.<eos> This is a Colt 32 that belongs to Mr. Sacco.<eos> This is a Harrington Richardson 38 that belongs to Mr. Vanzetti.<eos> The bullets are recognized by the caliber but also from when they were fired...<eos> They rotate from left to right, or from right to left, leaving grooves in the bullet.<eos> But the only type of American pistol that rotates from the left is a Colt 32.<eos> Thank you, Captain, please be seated.<eos> 3 of the 4 bullets from the body of Berardelli... have right rotation. The same for the two bullets taken from the body of Parmenter.<eos> But the fourth bullet, the lethal bullet, has left rotation.<eos> It was fired by a Colt 32.

- Is everything all right, sir?<eos> - Yes, Officer.<eos> I know him.<eos> I'm a doctor.<eos> He's hurt his hand.<eos> I'll see that he's all right.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, how are you keeping?<eos> Christ, my hand hurts.<eos> Do you think it's broken?
What was behind all that magnificence?<eos> - Love.<eos> QnIy Iove, Inspector.<eos> That sounds noble.<eos> By the way, there's a Chinese vase you put on display which interested me.<eos> An object d'art which ought to interest Danny.<eos> Late 17th century.<eos> A splendid piece.<eos> Pity, the heroine is gone.<eos> - You wish to enquire... about it's whereabouts?
Meanwhile, we rejoin Captain Steele and Dusty, counteragents, in another episode of "Enemy. "<eos> Does drinking give you a big, red, fat nose?<eos> - Why? - I was just wondering.<eos> I've only been over this road once before...<eos> Is that why Dad's nose is all freckly?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've got a fly without any wings in my cap.<eos> Did our car crash?<eos> You must look after your blazer.<eos> It's got to last.
That guy.<eos> Sir... Sir...<eos> My friend has a stain.<eos> Here's a lady with a nice stain.<eos> Pay close attention now.<eos> A few drops, a clean cloth...<eos> - Would you rather do it?<eos> - No need to be shy.<eos> - My dress...<eos> - Has it ever been dyed?
He isn't for you, believe me.<eos> If you insist upon seeing him, I have a right to express my feelings.<eos> - You can't control my life.<eos> - Your life, in this case, is tied in with a company employee.<eos> What difference does that make?<eos> He's an honest, hardworking...<eos> Yes. He's ambitious, intelligent.<eos> He's a good attorney.<eos> And he has a flair for the advertising business.<eos> And he's also smart enough to know a golden opportunity when he sees it.
Thank you very much.<eos> Now this is what I got to thinking.<eos> I hate to change bulbs outside my house because no matter how tight I put it in, they attract a lot of dirt and guck and they're full of dead bugs and I don't like to go up there and touch 'em.<eos> Would you get to the point?<eos> Uh... why is that bulb dirt and dust-free?<eos> That bulb is clean as a whistle.<eos> I think that's kind of strange.<eos> Hanging there long enough to burn out but not hanging there long enough to get dirty.<eos> We're a fastidious family.<eos> If the bulb is clean, it's because servants cleaned it.
It has only one enemy capable of killing it.<eos> Pepsis formosa, commonly known as the Tarantula Hawk Wasp.<eos> As you can see, it's always the wasp that attacks first.<eos> And, between the two, the wasp is the one that always wins the battle.<eos> The tarantula has no way out.<eos> Here. Observe carefully.<eos> See?<eos> The wasp won.<eos> The tarantula has been stung.<eos> It's been paralyzed by the wasp's sting.
There's got to be something better than that! He's pretty good.<eos> My kids watch him all the time.<eos> [CLOWN-TYPE MUSIC]<eos> TELEVISION ANNOUNCER: Now it's time For Uncle Willie's story of the week.<eos> We've missed your stories the last two weeks, Uncle Willie. UNCLE WILLIE:<eos> Thank you. Thank you so very much, children.<eos> And I want you to know that Uncle Willie certainly Missed you during his vacation.<eos> And I hope you all missed me too.<eos> Now today's story, children, is a story of excitement And of adventure.<eos> It's called, "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves."
As this creature first came in sight... I doubted my own sanity, and many minutes passed... before I succeeded in convincing myself... that I was neither mad nor in a dream.<eos> Estimating the size of the creature... I concluded it to be far larger... than any ship of the line in existence.<eos> I say "ship of the line"... because the shape of the monster suggested the idea.<eos> The hull of one of our battleships might convey... a very tolerable conception of the general outline.<eos> The mouth of the animal was situated... at the end of a tube some 6o or 7o feet in length... and about as thick as the body of an ordinary elephant.<eos> Near the root of this trunk... was an immense quantity of black, shaggy hair... more than could have been supplied... by the coats of a score of buffalo.<eos> And projecting from this hair downwardly and laterally... sprang two gleaming tusks... not unlike that of the wild boar... but of infinitely greater dimension.<eos> The body was fashioned like a wedge... with a point toward the earth.<eos> From it there were outspread two pairs of wings each wing nearly 1oo yards in length... one pair being placed above the other... and all thickly covered with metal scales... each scale apparently some 1o or 12 feet in diameter.<eos> But the chief peculiarity of this horrible thing... was the representation of a death's head... which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast... and which was as accurately traced in glaring white... upon the dark ground of the body... as if it had been carefully designed by an artist.
Well, yesterday when you couldn't make up your mind whether to go to Japan or...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> What yesterday?<eos> What happened to today?<eos> Well, today is really tomorrow.<eos> I don't know if I can explain this.<eos> Try.<eos> Well, you see, today is really today, but somewhere along the line, you lost a day.<eos> Where did I lose it?<eos> Well, it isn't exactly lost.
You have to think about yourself.<eos> Sam, you're a gem.<eos> - Real gem.<eos> - I don't believe my ears.<eos> Darrin, look.<eos> Here it comes again!<eos> A bat! A vampire bat!<eos> Cover your head!<eos> Okay.<eos> It's gone.
Well, it's sort of a dinner dance.<eos> - Sam, would you sort of get her out of here?<eos> - I'll try.<eos> That's the thanks I get for being sweet.<eos> Sure.<eos> The original Miss Nice Guy.<eos> Would you rather I handle this in my own way?<eos> Or would you prefer to be the hero and tell them that you will not use them on your television show, unless they sing my song at my cotillion?<eos> Sam, will you do something before I say something?<eos> It's called I'll Blow You a Kiss in the Wind.
- Don't be so smart.<eos> I think I've pulled you out of your slump.<eos> But don't bother to thank me.<eos> That's what managers are for.<eos> Hi, sweetheart.<eos> Hi.<eos> How were all the guys and gals in the cosmos?<eos> Fine.<eos> Did they sing Serena's song?<eos> And everyone loved it.
What happened?<eos> Your mother happened.<eos> That's what happened.<eos> - Well, I'll have a talk with her.<eos> - Never mind the talking. Just get the amulet.<eos> - Daddy has it.<eos> - Hurry back.<eos> This is it.<eos> Daddy used it throughout the centuries whenever Mother got out of line.<eos> - I'm surprised it isn't worn out by now.
- Inform Bayeux. Whose land is this?<eos> Maroilleur?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> - Clean them, Léon.<eos> - She is sleeping, the little one?<eos> - Mathilde is giving her her valerian.<eos> - That is strange. A car explodes on your land... - Oh no!<eos> - Pardon?<eos> - On the road, not on my lands.<eos> - It was set on fire.
There's something that you must do for me immediately.<eos> This letter's got to go to young Paxton, to Paul, you know. I want you to...<eos> Not you.<eos> The third.<eos> Master... did I do well?<eos> Did I please you?<eos> Wait.<eos> Please. Please wait.<eos> Please.<eos> As it was addressed to you, sir, I thought you might like to have it.
- Morning sir, can I help you?<eos> - Help me?<eos> Yes, I'd say you can help me.<eos> - Yes, sir?<eos> I came by your advert: "Small white pussy cat for sale. Excellent condition."<eos> - Ah, you wish to buy it?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Just for the hour.<eos> Only I aint gonna pay more'n a fiver cos' it aint worth it.<eos> Well it's come from a very good home, it's house trained.
Right-- that's it, we're going in!<eos> Release the vicious dogs.<eos> What a terrible way to end a series.<eos> Why couldn't it end with something like this?<eos> Smile.<eos> Smile.<eos> Smile.<eos> Smile.<eos> Now, there's an ending for you-- Romance, laughter...<eos> When this series returns, it will be put out on Monday morning as a test card- and will be described by the Radio Times- as a history of Irish agriculture.
39 Via Angiolieri.<eos> Hello?<eos> Anybody home?<eos> Look at the oscilloscope.<eos> Very well. Now let's hear the other phone call.<eos> Notice any differences between the tapes?<eos> Sure.<eos> The waves on the first machine were different from those on the second.<eos> Exactly.<eos> See... every human voice, no matter how well it's disguised... has a characteristic pattern of harmonic intensities in the vowel sounds.
You've got no right to take that from him!<eos> No! Stop!<eos> Stay where you are!<eos> Don't try to get any closer.<eos> Guerrero, listen to me.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Listen.<eos> They know about you on the ground.<eos> Your insurance is no good.<eos> It's cancelled. It's worthless.
Which means before you drink, you pay 10 cents.<eos> In advance. Cast thy bread upon the waters, let this man have his just needs.<eos> You talk like a man of God, all right. But I worked like hell for that there water.<eos> My poor, misguided friend, you are a sinner in need of redemption. I will redeem you.<eos> Ten cents, you pious bastard, or I'll bury you.<eos> What church did you say you was with?<eos> The Church of the Wayfaring Stranger. A church of my own revelation.<eos> Just like that?<eos> - Just like that.<eos> - Where's it located?
Unfortunately... Agua Branca will have to be wiped out from the map, for giving shelter to the cangaceiros.<eos> Like Paramirine and some other villages.<eos> Laws are sometimes very useful.<eos> They let us act legally in our own interest.<eos> A drink?<eos> We'll spend the night here.<eos> The soldiers will take over the houses.<eos> We'll leave early tomorrow.<eos> This town is bad luck.<eos> It's haunted by the ghosts of the miners killed in 17.
- You eat and drink too much.<eos> You're not so young.<eos> More like my lover, you look more like my uncle.<eos> I suppose he's your nephew?<eos> No, he's got his faults, too.<eos> I was just going to tell him.<eos> Wait!<eos> Zola, D'Annunzio, Nabokov, would be enough the two came to that which we'll call:<eos> The infamous night at the Hotel Molise.<eos> And who else, if not Adelaide, "includat iniuria verbis" supported the idea and put the seal on it?
Maybe we ought to phone a garage.<eos> You wouldn't believe it, but I don't have a telephone.<eos> Well, that's great.<eos> now what am I gonna do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You-you know, this is really a good idea.<eos> I don't even think I could drive if I had to.<eos> I'm sure you'll feel better in the morning.<eos> Oh, yes. yes.<eos> I'm sorry about this room, but it hasn't been used for years and years. Oh, no, no.
I have to be beautiful for the others.<eos> I need it!<eos> Come on!<eos> Talk!<eos> Joanna Reiher.<eos> We herewith commit your body...<eos> Franz Walsch... to consecrated earth.<eos> For from dust you come... and to dust you shall return.<eos> May the Day of Judgement... hold no horrors for you.<eos> Therefore... let us pray for his poor soul... that it may be cleansed in purgatory.
What about you Mrs.?<eos> When your husband does his research, what do you do?<eos> I think about my husband...<eos> Doctor, as a scientist, what do you believe in?<eos> I thought the laser beams were necessary...<eos> I managed to turn things nobody can normally see into visible objects.<eos> I made a revolution in the field of electronic engineering.<eos> The next revolution came soon after and was superior to mine. It was easier than crushing a baby...<eos> The life of new technology is now very short.<eos> From when it is born to its maturity... And then to its death...
My suggestion is ... this person should leave immediately ... tonight.<eos> Be careful.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> Do you have everything?<eos> -It's all here<eos> Let's see ... that was inherited from my great grandfather.<eos> He removed several hearts of those sinful creatures.<eos> As you know, it's all based on extensive research all about vampirism.<eos> Don't lose this map ...<eos> without it you'll be lost.
It's shot, Kelly.<eos> Maybe we can use the fuel pump from that Tiger.<eos> No, it won't work on this motor.<eos> Mechanical genius.<eos> Oddball, I can't make it work without the parts no matter how positive I think!<eos> This guy in the Tiger, the least we could do is get him on the radio and talk to him.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> He must be a full, fanatic freak! Or he would've split 20 minutes ago.<eos> All this guy is doing, is guarding the bank like he was told.<eos> But I wonder if he knows what's in it.
- And Burns Red?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Burns Red In The Sun?<eos> - Rubbed out.<eos> His wife, his children.<eos> - And many more.<eos> - Do you hate them?<eos> Do you hate the white men now?<eos> Do you see this fine thing?<eos> Do you admire the humanity of it?
I've not seen much of America.<eos> Oh, I've been to Philadelphia, but there's more to it than that, I'm sure.<eos> - Have you travelled around much?<eos> Doing what?<eos> A little of this, a little of that.<eos> I'm naturally nosy.<eos> Well, you know, we don't often get strangers here.<eos> You might try changing your reception committee.<eos> And what else do we know about this great nation of ours, the United States of America, whose 100th birthday we're soon to celebrate?<eos> We know it was founded by exiles, immigrants, people like many of you here, who came from across the ocean, seeking a better life.
- That's it, then.<eos> I declare this meeting adjourned.<eos> Good night.<eos> - Good night, Jack.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Stay a bit, why don't you?<eos> Unless you're bleeding to get back to your landlady.<eos> - How's the hand?<eos> - Better.<eos> Don't let on too quick that it's healed.
No, no. No misunderstanding.<eos> We're supposed to have Allied air cover and we don't.<eos> German planes are strafing my troops.<eos> If I may say so, general, I'm afraid your operation reports are inaccurate.<eos> Three days ago, the crowds took off after my command car... ran my ass into a ditch.<eos> My staff has assured me, we have complete air supremacy... everywhere in the Mediterranean.<eos> When I complained about air cover... you said our troops were not battle-worthy.<eos> You spoke of the discredited practice of using air force as an alibi... for lack of success on the ground.<eos> I have to wet-nurse Montgomery, I don't have to stand for that.<eos> I sincerely apologize for that remark, whoever made it.
Messina... is the heart of it.<eos> If they'd followed my plan, I'd be there by now. I'd cut off the retreat of every German on this island!<eos> Now, you know what I'm gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna go to Palermo.<eos> I'm gonna beat that limey at Messina if it's the last thing I ever do!<eos> Hey, what's all this talk about taking the Vizzini road away from 2nd Corps?<eos> General Alexander's orders.<eos> Road goes to Montgomery.<eos> Now, that road was assigned to me.<eos> How can I get north without it? You know the terrain there.
Letter-drops, wheelchairs, canaries...<eos> And what was all that about Jonah?<eos> And what do you suppose they're doing up there?<eos> And where is up there? My guess would be Scotland.<eos> Inverness, to be more precise. Inverness?<eos> Didn't you notice the paper at the bottom of their cage?<eos> The Inverness Courier.<eos> Mr. Holmes, this letter...<eos> What about it?<eos> It is addressed to you.
Look at that.<eos> Only a minute ago.<eos> Hold on, we may have something.<eos> is it the first contact they've made with you?<eos> Look, it's hard enough, leave us alone.<eos> How much do they want?<eos> Do they want to be paid in dollars?<eos> Can you tell us the contents of the letter?<eos> We just received a letter. Yes.<eos> No, it was delivered.
I think I know something about them.<eos> Are you interested in winged insects particularly?<eos> Yeah, winged insects.<eos> Dipteres, coleoptera...<eos> The insect I'm looking for looks like a cricket.<eos> Praying mantis, belongs to the isoptera kind, 12 centimeters long.<eos> Praying mantis got its name from the position of its tentacles over its head. Like a praying act.<eos> Discovery of a female mantis by the male, starts a tragic ceremony that disturbs natural laws.<eos> When the male gives itself to love, the female mantis strongly grasps and devours it.<eos> Welcome among us, praying mantis, after coupling... devours the male, she who ignores it will be a Goddess.
He said that one evening he forgot to put on his wooden wig... and that Paul cut his head off with his axe.<eos> My father was making it...<eos> Was Augusto, as invented by Albert, derived from an English concept?<eos> And the White Clown was making Francois look like Antonet?<eos> My uncle François was different, a nice dancer...<eos> They were telling us at lenght about Paul, Albert and François.<eos> About their great kindness.<eos> They would do free shows in trenches, in hospitals.<eos> Expelled from the arena from that point on, these old guys... hid themselves out in the suburbs.<eos> The city is unaware of these old ghosts living within it.
You're kidding?<eos> Try, will you. Hmm?<eos> Erica doesn't remember anything about last night?<eos> Not a thing.<eos> Then she must be in shock.<eos> I don't know, she called me a little while ago and said she felt dizzy, and was going to see Dr. Hayes.<eos> So, I guess we'll find out something.<eos> Tell me about the mud again.<eos> There's no more to tell.<eos> When we woke up this morning, it was gone.
Oh St Jude!<eos> Oh St Cecilia!<eos> I honor you with all my heart and soul, but at the same time I find it hard to bow down my head to you in prayer.<eos> My conscience is so immaculately clean that I fear I nitpick in trying to search my soul for any immoral acts I may have committed.<eos> I can only feel a sort of comradeship to all of you.<eos> I mean, yes, I realize you have lived entirely chaste lives But I myself have done practically the same thing since the days of my First Holy Communion.<eos> I realize that some more uneducated members of the clergy would be quick to point out that I have murdered, robbed and whored myself daily but they fail to realize the clear conscience I have done it all with.<eos> Even as I leave this church, I plan to murder the man who has been closest to me.<eos> It was about this time I realized my thoughts were not entirely on my own.<eos> Even as the picture of Christ's great miracle dawned on me, I felt it being sucked out by some unknown presence in this church.
Lay him down on the ground.<eos> Destroy me.<eos> Depend on no one.<eos> Cry, boy, cry!<eos> Cry so he'll have mercy.<eos> It's bitter.<eos> Moses found water in the desert.<eos> But people couldn't drink it, for it was bitter.<eos> They called the water "Mara".<eos> It's become sweet.
You don't like dimly lit rooms, do you?<eos> There are three weeks of my life that are in total darkness.<eos> It's beautiful, isn't it?<eos> All the things in this room have a distinctive textural quality.<eos> They produce very individual sounds.<eos> Well, now ...<eos> Well, now, Tara's given me her report.<eos> I've got to find out about those missing weeks.<eos> Our forensic people are checking your car.<eos> They'll be able to tell if it's been out of the country.
- I have a little surprise for you, Darryl.<eos> - Darrin.<eos> In honour of the arrival of my first grandson.<eos> - That really wasn't necessary, Maurice.<eos> Sir.<eos> That watch is waterproof, anti-magnetic and has built-in aircraft radar.<eos> Well, it's really very handsome.<eos> - It's shock-proof, too.<eos> - I don't know what to say.<eos> But, best of all, you can perform witchcraft with it.
This dress is gonna be very pretty on you, Tabitha.<eos> - It doesn't look like a dress.<eos> - That's because it isn't finished yet.
Head for sale!<eos> That head is sold!<eos> Do you want this one?<eos> Orthatone?<eos> Which will it be?<eos> Letgo! Let ltgo!<eos> Oh, such big snow flakes!<eos> I am Yui Shosetsu<eos> Give my husband back his head, please<eos> Kara Juro! It's my fault. It was stolen
We were just talking about you.<eos> Reliving our glory days...<eos> Take my place...<eos> I have to phone.<eos> I discovered I had a pioneer past, through you.<eos> The little workshop at Auvers-sur-Oise.<eos> My first backer.<eos> One day there'll be a plaque.<eos> The variable geometry aerofoil came out of there.<eos> - It's been improved on since.
Be patient. You can't worry about morphine with the Germans at the border.<eos> They've convened a conference. It may mean war, and Miss Carska ...was just about to get married.<eos> How horrible it is to lose so many loved ones in their prime.<eos> Frost burns flowers' flush cheeks, and the Angel of Death takes his toll.<eos> An educated speaker.<eos> They're playing Dvorak's Largo, Mr. Dvorak.<eos> In 75 minutes Miss Carska's ashes will fill and urn.<eos> But not her soul.<eos> That can't be.<eos> It will be reincarnated, liberated, as the Tibetans say.
They're Iron Corps.<eos> Five seconds.<eos> Away!<eos> Away!<eos> The pressure's dropping again.<eos> This is as far as I can get, lad.<eos> Down at the end there, by that car.<eos> - Hey, no you don't.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> There's a thousand-pounder down there... and it's not gone off.
No, to Germany!<eos> Do you remember what you taught me?<eos> That's all fantasies, my young friend.<eos> You won't go anywhere.<eos> You don't have to go anywhere.<eos> - why not?<eos> - You're a free man now.<eos> But what am I to do with my freedom?<eos> I know everything.<eos> Only two weeks ago you didn't need your freedom, but now you need it very much.
Go.<eos> You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!<eos> How's your new house, Fred?<eos> Very nice, Mr Bridger, thank you.<eos> Very nice.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Beckerman's done his homework very well.<eos> The getaway is possible, but not easy.<eos> For a start, the attack has to be made in this square.<eos> And it must be completed inside of three minutes.
-I know how it happened.<eos> You just got tired of working for $20 a month so you took advantage of that poor old man.<eos> You bushwhacked him, gunned him down, and took his map.<eos> I'm surprised at you.<eos> A marshal.<eos> -Hesh-ke remembers you.<eos> -I remember her, too.<eos> What I can't figure out is how you knew about this map.<eos> It's the only real one.<eos> It was supposed to be only in Prairie Dog's head.
That's Adams.<eos> -I see Adams.<eos> -I don't see any gold.<eos> -There's gold there.<eos> More gold than you ever saw.<eos> All the gold in the world.<eos> Yeah, tell him.<eos> Tell him the story.<eos> No.<eos> It's been told too many times.
There he is!<eos> Go down and get him!<eos> Ben!<eos> Where you going?<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> I think this place is crumbling.<eos> Be calm, my dear.<eos> Oh, Pardner, where's Ben?<eos> What the hell are you doing there?<eos> I didn't like that town, but it'll seem funny not having it there.

There's very little for me to say, Miss Mackay... in the face of your extraordinary prejudice and hostility.<eos> Miss Brodie, I am not asking you to say anything.<eos> I am asking... demanding... that you put your signature, your own signature... on a letter of resignation which I have prepared for you.<eos> I will not resign.<eos> If you will not resign, you will force me to dismiss you.<eos> I will not resign... and you will not dismiss me, Miss Mackay.<eos> You will not use the excuse of that pathetic... that humorous document to blackmail me!<eos> Mr. Lowther, you are a witness to this.<eos> Miss Mackay has made totally unsupported accusations against my name and yours.<eos> If she has one authentic shred of evidence... just one, let her bring it forth!
I must report to London.<eos> Do that, Mr. Shelton.<eos> I'll tell them how things are.<eos> Yes, I hope so.<eos> I'll have to inform them that the island has been completely burnt... and José Dolores has once again broken through the encirclement.<eos> Tell them that, Mr. Shelton.<eos> And tell them also that you make me sick.<eos> Sir William!<eos> Do you know why this island is called Queimada?<eos> Because it was already burnt once, and do you know why?
Hello, Boon.<eos> - Ladies, this is Lucius.<eos> - Well, hello, Lucius.<eos> Isn't he adorable?<eos> I want you to meet Otis, Miss Corrie's nephew.<eos> - How do you do?<eos> - I do just fine if I'm left to it.<eos> Our Mr Binford should be with us any moment.<eos> He doesn't like us to begin without him.<eos> He'll be waxing his moustache to keep it out of the soup.
It's Christmas already.<eos> I can't reach it.<eos> The bottle keeps going.<eos> Does it mean that New York still exists?<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Thanks.<eos> The bottle is going.<eos> Too bad.<eos> It was beautiful.<eos> Such a pity that it's gone.
But I can't.<eos> I'm not allowed to.<eos> I am the museum curator.<eos> Then go, if that is the case.<eos> It's over!<eos> The plague is over!<eos> We can return home.<eos> The whale disappeared.<eos> How?<eos> It got eaten.
Stringfellow's behaviour as parapsychologist suggests that perhaps his foremost post-operative research objective was to intuit which among his Category-A subjects was the one most capable of assuming the role of psychic dominant.<eos> This subject was then provided indirectly with certain historical and interpretive data concerning his fellow subjects.<eos> This data would naturally assure the immediate social dominance of the chosen subject within the context of the experimental, socially isolate gestalt.<eos> The function of the dominant would then be to select from among his fellow subjects the one psychically most vulnerable.<eos> And by the application of subtle, social intimidations followed by a careful series of potent symbolic gestures draw the subject into the field of his psycho-telepathic dominance.<eos> Once a true conglomerate exhibiting complete telepathic bonding has been established between this primary couple, the progression towards a larger and more complex conglomerate may begin.<eos> In psychic research the emotional distance between the researcher and his subject is inevitably diminished until it is no more than the distance between any two persons.<eos> The acquiescence of the subject of the demands of the researcher comes nothing more nor less, than an individual act of faith... of love.<eos> If there can be no love between researcher and subject there can be no experimentation.<eos> In conventional theories of scientific methodology, an experiment proves its validity when it can be universally repeated in every aspect.
- Very good, Sir.<eos> What was your name?<eos> Charity.<eos> Charity Hope Valentine.<eos> Do you like Brahms?<eos> - Huh?<eos> The music.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> It's got a...<eos> It's got a great beat.
- He might as well say hate is the greatest.<eos> What people want is hate.<eos> Hate and nothing but hate.<eos> ln the name of righteousness and love, ye shall have hate.<eos> - Out of love, throw nitroglycerine bombs. - Excuse me.<eos> And ye shall kill your brother, though it's the lie that kills.<eos> If people want hate, let them have it.<eos> Death, torture, destruction, let's have it.<eos> But not in the name of love.<eos> Oh, I abhor humanity. I wish it was swept away.
There's the mort.<eos> And there's the mort's henchman.<eos> Open up.<eos> Rouse him.<eos> You are the thief who talks to spirits.<eos> No. I'm a stranger.<eos> Where are you from?<eos> - An island.<eos> - What is this island?<eos> It's called Earth.
Lokai, I don't know what's normal for you, but if I had your readings I would be the most incredible physical specimen.<eos> We've never encountered a being like you.<eos> I'd like to know more about you and your planet.<eos> - l'm very tired.<eos> - And very evasive.<eos> - Or at least not fully responsive.<eos> Now... - l insist.<eos> I'm extremely tired, made so by your vindictive cross examinations.<eos> I will answer no more questions.<eos> Lieutenant Uhura, notify Starbase 4 that we've recovered its shuttlecraft and it will be returned along with its...user as soon as we've completed our mission at Ariannus.
At the moment, I seem to have no choice.<eos> So this is justice after Ariannus.<eos> You have signed my death warrant.<eos> I warned you what to expect.<eos> Will you continue to let this mockery of justice go on?<eos> If you are partisans of justice, prove it.<eos> Kill him!<eos> We are not killers.<eos> Do you carry justice on your tongues?<eos> You won't fight or die for it.
But nothing will happen mom.<eos> We will not let him out.<eos> Come here you.<eos> That's your example?<eos> Your courage?<eos> I am courageous.<eos> If you want me to, I open the door and I enter as before.<eos> Do not argue with your father.<eos> This thing will not always be there.<eos> Maybe it's left?
We'll fatten it up here.<eos> It becomes a beautiful cow that we can resell, and then you who are kind, you can dig me a little kitchen garden over there.<eos> At least, just to have some vegetables to hand.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Oh, but he's a trainer, the boss.<eos> He's not a farmer.<eos> I'll manage it myself, I know about farming.<eos> Well, we should perhaps ask him what he thinks, all the same.<eos> Not for the garden, because I've already bought the seeds.<eos> And the heifer, it's ordered.
The fresh snow of winter mornings. SÉBASTIEN AMONG MEN I could find you,<eos> EPISODE 11: THE 14TH JULY DANCE The beautiful bird chased by the wind.<eos> There's a tradition that's much respected... in this pretty little town called Val près de Villene, it's the horse race on 14th July.<eos> Every year on this day, M. Lambert and M. Maréchal enter their best horses in a race, which takes place on the practice track of the racecourse.<eos> This race isn't official, but it's become a tradition that's part of the celebration, and which enthralls the inhabitants of the town, just as much as the dance or the fireworks.
There's a girl snooping around.<eos> Name's King.<eos> She's checking a bullet fired from a FF70.<eos> Yes ... You'll deal with the problem?<eos> Right then.<eos> Identical. They're both FF70 bullets.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Gentlemen prefer blondes.<eos> They're an easier target.<eos> Well, it's passed all 52 tests positive.
You're a great referee.<eos> Any luck with your mother?<eos> Oh, she's just being obstinate.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> I was thinking about that between punches.<eos> We've got to try something drastic. Come on.<eos> Darrin, I'm not sure this makes sense.<eos> Why not?<eos> Your mother's counter spell only applies to our lawn.<eos> It won't stop you from putting that grass where it was supposed to go in the first place.
Is the maid coming tomorrow?<eos> Well, as far as I know<eos> Well, why don't you give her a call and check?<eos> Sometimes she forgets<eos> [Chuckles] All right<eos> Oh, say, did you see my blue dress? My blue wool?<eos> What?<eos> My blue wool dress...<eos> I was gonna take it on the trip, but I can't find it anywhere<eos> Maybe you sent it to the cleaners Oh, no It should be in the closet Where's that address book?
Return it to my wife.<eos> She'll want to thank you.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> She's a perfect mother, but she can't seem to understand me at all.<eos> You seem to understand me quite well.<eos> I've lost my ring.<eos> I guess it must've fallen off while we were playing.<eos> It's a souvenir, a man's signet ring.<eos> It's not worth much... but I do prize it.<eos> I may have lost it upstairs.
You have to hand it over.<eos> You took the oath.<eos> I stand by my protest beyond recall!<eos> And now I'm going to outline the operational plan.<eos> Come closer!<eos> According to the reports of the spies, the enemy is going to attack from two directions.<eos> From the Paul Street and from the Maria Street.<eos> All the wood-piles will act as fortresses stocked with sandbombs.<eos> Nr 1, 2, 3 will be the main fortresses and Nr 3A will be the spare fortress.<eos> It will be built of paraffin barrels so that it can hide Jano's hut.
I can feel it.<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> Good afternoon gentlemen.<eos> I am a HAL-9000 computer.<eos> I became operational at the HAL plant in Verbana, Illinois on the 12th of January, 1992.<eos> My instructor was Mr. Langley and he taught me to sing a song.<eos> If you'd like to hear it I can sing it for you.<eos> Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.<eos> Sing it for me.<eos> It's called "Daisy. "
"It won't be a stylish marriage<eos> "I can't afford a carriage<eos> "But you'll look sweet<eos> "Upon the seat<eos> "Of a bicycle made for two. "<eos> Good day, gentlemen.<eos> This is a prerecorded briefing made prior to your departure and which for security reasons of the highest importance has been known on board during the mission only by your HAL-9000 computer.<eos> Now that you are in Jupiter's space and the entire crew is revived it can be told to you.<eos> Eighteen months ago the first evidence of intelligent life off the Earth was discovered.<eos> It was buried 40 feet below the lunar surface near the crater "Tyco. "
Sit down.<eos> That's right out of Rincon Creek.<eos> Funny thing about gold, it doesn't look like gold until it gets to be money.<eos> - Have you read about Rincon?<eos> - Paper's full of it.<eos> If it ain't the strike, it's Fred Carson being drowned in a flour barrel.<eos> - Tomorrow it'll be Stoney Burough.<eos> - What about Stoney Burough?<eos> Somebody gave Stoney a new string tie.<eos> Only it was made of barbed wire and a little tight.
That's the inn, coach.<eos> That's Blackbeard's Inn. Did the old pirate really build it?<eos> Sure, he got killed in a battle right out there in the bay.<eos> I'll have to brush up on local history.<eos> Wait till you meet the little old ladies who run the inn. They're all descendants of Blackbeard's bloody crew, and they're proud of it.<eos> "Buccaneer bazaar tonight.<eos> Help save Blackbeard's Inn." What does that mean?<eos> Some guy is trying to have the inn torn down, but the old ladies are putting up a pretty good fight.<eos> Are you sure they haven't started to tear it down already?<eos> It's built mostly of odds and ends, timbers of ships that got wrecked in the bay.
I'm sorry, but there has been some medical complication as regard to my witness.<eos> I'm afraid I'll have to forego that bedside picture as much as it would've compensated for his inability to testify tomorrow.<eos> But, in all decency, I can hardly force the issue.<eos> Does this mean your surprise witness won't be able to make any statement?<eos> The man was near death when he was brought in here.<eos> In view of the attempt on his life I'm sure you can understand my reasons for secrecy.<eos> Can't reach Lt. Bullitt, either.<eos> Keep trying.<eos> I can't find Mr. Ross's medical chart.<eos> It's evidently been misplaced.
That will be fine.<eos> - How about you?<eos> - No, that's okay.<eos> - Would you like to sit down?<eos> - Yeah, I would.<eos> Grab a chair.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll sit in this chair.<eos> It's little, but it's good.<eos> I had a radio but it got busted.
But Mr. Coggins says if we asked you first...<eos> Asked me what first?<eos> He's a horrid, mean, old man.<eos> Mr. Coggins?<eos> No, the junkman.<eos> He's going to take it away and put it in a furnace.<eos> And burn it all up. lt's terrible.<eos> What are you going on about?<eos> Our car!<eos> Yes, well, what about it?
And there he'll be:<eos> Ziegfeld!<eos> Sorry to disappoint you, but the name's Arnstein.<eos> - Did you want to see someone?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You.<eos> Gorgeous. - I beg your pardon?<eos> - Oh, I mean, your shirt.<eos> It's absolutely the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen in my life.<eos> What's it made out of?
So they could just check their coordinates to aim missiles at all of our launching pads.<eos> If they had the film.<eos> The irony is that it's still here at Zebra.<eos> Somewhere.<eos> - And this is not the way to find it.<eos> - How did it get here?<eos> - The Russians ran into a little trouble.<eos> - That's encouraging.<eos> Initially academic, or so it seemed.<eos> The satellite was orbiting over North America, western Russia and Siberia but that darling little camera went right on taking pictures when it wasn't supposed to.
- This will not sell.<eos> What is it?<eos> - A magic key.<eos> What does it open?<eos> You bought a school for me? - Yes. Where?<eos> Where is it?<eos> At 16 km from Paris.<eos> It's beautiful. Tell me more seemed made for you.<eos> About 600 hectares.<eos> I jumped on it.
All nines.<eos> There must be a trick to it.<eos> You must have a second pack up your sleeve.<eos> Oh, that's a fine collection.<eos> Here is something for you.<eos> That's a souvenir, a little wooden owl. You can buy one in any shop.<eos> Look. The eyes and ears are moving.<eos> Maybe hydro-pressure has something to do with the movements.<eos> The tail moves too.<eos> Wait, it can be pulled out.
Daddy did it all for me.<eos> When can I have it, daddy?<eos> Not until we bury you?<eos> - I loved you.<eos> - You're a cold and bloody bastard, you are. And you don't love anything.<eos> I'm it.<eos> I'm all that's left.<eos> Here, father.<eos> Here I am.<eos> My life, when it is written, will read better than it lived.
I know nowthat though I look white, Anglo-saxon and protestant, I really am a southern negro.<eos> All Latin-Americans are negroes, discriminated against, oppressed, rejected, ignored, strangers in this new swindle which has pretensions of universality.<eos> The American way of life, the great white dream of the United states.<eos> Now it's the devil's advocate's turn, he who piles doubt upon doubt and who asks you: but don'tyou, guys, realize that the words you are using underdevelopment, underdevelopment are sick, or at least, sickly?<eos> Don'tyou realize that these words might be language-traps, accomplices of an already wasted culture, a stratagem, a linguistic alibi, a linguistic-ideological arrangement, that might lead us to the mental peace of formulas?<eos> It is useless to flee from the linguistic continents of underdevelopment and forget that the basic contradiction of our times is not the contradiction between North American imperialism and the three underdeveloped continents, but the contradiction between the impetuous development of the productive forces of all the world<eos> and the forms and the production relations of capitalism, between the socialist revolution and the capitalist system in its last imperialistic phase.<eos> For example, you speak of the basic contradiction between the proletariat and capitalism.<eos> I believe that whatyou have said is entirely abstract.<eos> The basic contradictions are verified in reality and when the basic contradiction is embodied, it is transmitted into war.
What kind of a father art thou, Louis Minsky?<eos> I will tell you this, Mr. Schpitendavel from Pennsylvania.<eos> I am not a father who would let his daughter work for Minsky's Burlesque.<eos> - You may use the same door out.<eos> - No, no. I need your help, Louis Minsky.<eos> My daughter will not be welcome in my home if she stays the night to dance upon your son's stage.<eos> There is a train in 51 minutes.<eos> You must tell your son to see she is on it.<eos> You see this chair?<eos> Tell it to dance.
We don't have very long to wait.<eos> We can leave.<eos> Or we better leave soon.<eos> It's ten minutes to three.<eos> You know anything about this area at all?<eos> I mean, is Willard the nearest town?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We were... Just trying to get to a motel before dark.<eos> You said those things turned your car over.<eos> You think we can get it back on its wheels and drive it?
I hope this unfortunate circumstance won't deprive me of my parochial office?<eos> My hope, sir, is that it will.<eos> But it was all Mrs. Bumble.<eos> I knew nothing till yesterday.<eos> No excuse.<eos> In the eyes of the law you are the more guilty of the two.<eos> The law supposes your wife acts under your direction.<eos> If that's what the law supposes, sir, then the law's an ass.<eos> If that's the eye of the law, sir, then law's a bachelor.<eos> The worst I wish the law is that it's eye be opened by experience.
What are you doing?<eos> I'm imagining...<eos> What are you up to now?<eos> There's something I don't understand.<eos> What?<eos> Come on, say it.<eos> - How come the door's open?<eos> - I asked myself the same thing.<eos> We locked it last night.<eos> It's not locked because you opened it.
Bronson's Garage.<eos> Yes, he's here.<eos> Well, I'd be glad to, Mr.-<eos> Munsch. Good-bye.<eos> Uh, Mr. Munsch over at the factory would like to see you.<eos> Dennis, he said he'd like to see you right away.<eos> What's the matter, Pitt?<eos> You so rich you can afford to walk out... without picking' up your final paycheck?<eos> Funny about that chute collapsing.<eos> It was inspected only last month.
Get it off me!<eos> Grab that tentacle there. Quick.<eos> It's trying to devour him.<eos> It's got his leg.<eos> Free his leg!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Come on.<eos> Pull him free. Hurry.<eos> Hans, help us!<eos> I can walk, unless it's broken.
Biles, why are you a freak?<eos> Biles, why are you a freak?<eos> Shag off, you creeps!<eos> Now listen. You've got to know all the seniors' names.<eos> Ask me who someone is.<eos> Brunning, damn you!<eos> Stop talking!<eos> This term I've just one thing to say to you.<eos> One rule.<eos> Follow it, and you won't go wrong.
- ? ...<eos> Stop the car Driver Turn around and go back.<eos> - I said turn around<eos> - Its against the law to turn here Monsiour.<eos> - Vola!<eos> - Good evening Madam<eos> - Good evening, May i have my key.<eos> Your husband is waiting for you at the bar.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello my love, I took care of the car they'll deliver it to neice in two days,
A little bird's nest soup never hurt anyone.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> I hope this holds together.<eos> I'm puttin' welds on top of welds.<eos> Mr Wu, the wiring is mostly all burned off. The cylinder walls are scored; the carburettor's a mess;<eos> This little car ripped itself to pieces trying to get us here.<eos> It gave us everything it's got.<eos> Now, maybe we can patch it back together. I don't know. But how can I send it back into that rat race tomorrow?<eos> It's got nothing left to give.
Now I want to hear your answer.<eos> When will we marry?<eos> What's wrong with you, are you blind, stupid or sick?<eos> - You put your glasses on?<eos> - I always do when I watch movies.<eos> You saw your sweetheart illustrate all the chapters of the Kama-sutra.<eos> I saw my sweetheart ready to make love with curious partners and in various positions, which, I agree, demonstrate a certain... imagination.<eos> And you hate imagination.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> I find it very important in sexuality, especially when it's applied to the bourgeois marriage.
I don't like being played for a sucker.<eos> Will Webster contact you, now that he has escaped?<eos> Probably.<eos> Suppose I tell you a secret about your friend Webster.<eos> Are you prepared to do business?<eos> - Go.<eos> - Webster killed George Corley for a piece of jewellery worth $10 million.<eos> What, this crown thing?<eos> This crown thing was worn by the Empress Theodora in the fifth century.<eos> Six months ago, it was stolen from the Athens state museum by George Corley.
No, I'd rather go alone.<eos> You'll do what I tell you.<eos> Drop it, Eddie.<eos> He said, "Drop it."<eos> I know you were a physician once yourself, Mr. Halder, so I'm not gonna beat around the bush.<eos> The stroke was brought on by primary vascular disease.<eos> It's not really that gloomy, Mr. Halder.<eos> Recently, a great deal of progress has been made in this area.<eos> There's a pill that's been developed called Dilatrin.<eos> With it, you'll probably live to be 90.

My name is Williams.<eos> I wonder if I might see Mr. Tomar on a matter of great urgency?<eos> Come in.<eos> Forgive my barging in this way, but I simply had to see you before the ship sailed.<eos> - What can I do for you?<eos> - I'm with Hastings and Fitzroy.<eos> The London jewellers.<eos> Some weeks ago, our firm was commissioned by a client to secure for him a particularly fine emerald which was to have been put on sale in Paris.<eos> Unfortunately, it was purchased before we could do so.<eos> And it is our understanding that you have it.
We manage live in peace and harmony.<eos> Whose harmony?<eos> Yours?<eos> Plato wanted truth and beauty.<eos> And above all, justice. My dear Mr. Spock, I admit that circumstances have forced us to make a few adaptations of Plato.<eos> But ours is the most democratic society conceivable.<eos> Anyone can, at any moment, be or do anything he wishes, even to becoming ruler of Platonius, if his mind is strong enough.<eos> And if his mind isn't strong enough, he gets torn apart like Alexander?<eos> Oh come now, we are not children. In your culture, justice is the will of the stronger.<eos> It is forced upon people by means of weapons and fleets of spaceships.
Warp factor 1, sir.<eos> Mr. Chekov, prepare to launch telemetry probe into that zone.<eos> - Direct computer feed to Mr. Spock.<eos> - Aye, sir.<eos> Probe ready. Switching data feed to library computer.<eos> - Launch probe.<eos> - Probe launched, sir.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - The telemetry probe, sir.<eos> There's no signal from it now.
These are precious.<eos> If I want something for a salad, I buy it.<eos> That's probably better.<eos> I buy the soil in little plastic bags.<eos> What do you think of it?<eos> I wouldn't like to be buried in it.<eos> You're hard to please.<eos> Earth is not something to joke about.<eos> It's serious.<eos> It's made me sweat for 30 years.
That is Mven Mas. - Excuse me.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Everything has been provided by you.<eos> Now the most serious matter remains, the danger of work.<eos> What scientist is afraid of risk?<eos> I did not talk about the personal, Mven.<eos> But experiment will include the external stations of Great Ring.<eos> Do we have the right to risk the greatest achievement of humanity, a window to the cosmos?<eos> I see billions of past human lives! Where instantly, as sand between the fingers, ran away theyr youth, beauty and happiness of life.<eos> They are asking to answer the great riddle of time and entering into battle with it!
You told Sir Andrew 5:30.<eos> Might be important.<eos> - 'Andrew. We're just leaving.'<eos> - Are you still running the old Bentley?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Will you be coming via Spout Hill?<eos> - That's the shortest route.<eos> Steed ... when you get to Spout Hill ... take it easy will you?<eos> Take it easy?<eos> Yes, the hill. Treat it, treat it with respect.
Yes, yes, they're all sceptical at first.<eos> That's why I insist on this trial run, so that you may see for yourself that it ... that it is possible.<eos> Well, I've always had a hankering for the 18th century.<eos> Gadzooks and stap me vitals!<eos> Now, where shall I arrive?<eos> Waterloo?<eos> You'll be travelling through time, not distance.<eos> You'll arrive at your point of departure, this house and the year 1790.<eos> - This house, hmm? - Yes.<eos> It's been in my family since the 15th century.
Eye surgery.<eos> And who is this?<eos> The one at the farm.<eos> Her name's Mrs Peel.<eos> Friend of Steed. (Primble) And what are we doing here, Mrs Peel?<eos> Well, I haven't come here for an eye test.<eos> And does Steed know you're here?<eos> I consider that a highly personal question.<eos> Martin. I think the scientific approach.<eos> It's held us in good stead.
But you've developed this project without ministry consent.<eos> That wasn't my idea.<eos> We're in testing, not a research department!<eos> When I suggested you work in secret, I was only thinking of you.<eos> You know these civil servants.<eos> I've suffered from them.<eos> They block you. You won't get a penny.<eos> This invention is going to put you among the greats.<eos> Do you really think so?<eos> Once it's perfected.
That taxi was parked outside Quilby's.<eos> The ingredients can be found in every home.<eos> How very convenient.<eos> - But I came here ... - Yes, I know.<eos> The invisible formula.<eos> Well, it had a base of silicon.<eos> Er, yeah, silicon.<eos> It had a soupçon of iridium. - No, no, no.<eos> Indium. - Uh-huh.<eos> And it was distilled in polython.
I made it, lover.<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> I miss the moustache.<eos> So do I.<eos> - You're a genius, Doctor.<eos> - I'm paid to be.<eos> Now for Mrs Peel.<eos> - I've checked on that gun.<eos> - And?<eos> You'll never guess who it was registered to?
Abner!<eos> Wait till you see this.<eos> Abner.<eos> When you see this you'll know that all the other times you thought I was just dreaming you'll know I was just dreaming.<eos> Oh, poor Mrs. Kravitz.<eos> Darling, it's delicious.<eos> Oh, you sure it isn't overcooked?<eos> No, it's perfect.<eos> The truth is, you usually undercook turkey.<eos> This is just the way I like it.
Now wait a minute.<eos> Now what are you going to do with her?<eos> Yes, what?<eos> I shall decide that later.<eos> Don't lose heart, Polly.<eos> Don't be afraid, girl.<eos> Life is very beautiful under the sea.<eos> Seventy percent of the world's surface is under the oceans.<eos> You are looking at our food producing areas.<eos> Without it, we couldn't survive.
Why are they racked with laughter?<eos> Why do the children scream?<eos> What are those heaps they fight over, those heaps with eyes and mouths?<eos> What kind of town is this hacked buttocks lying in the street?<eos> What are all these faces?<eos> Soon these faces will close around me.<eos> These eyes and mouths will call me to join them!<eos> Now it's happening and you can't stop it happening.<eos> The people used to suffer everything, now they take their revenge.<eos> You are watching that revenge, and you don't remember that you drove the people to it.
To Each His Own ("We Still Kill the Old Way")<eos> I kiss your hand!<eos> I don't like this letter.<eos> - Why don't you like it?<eos> It was posted here, in the village, last night or early this morning.
Okay.<eos> Pack it up.<eos> General, they are back.<eos> - How many men?<eos> - We await further reports.<eos> A determined enemy, no doubt.<eos> You have reinforced the listening posts?<eos> Yes, general.<eos> And the bomb room?<eos> It's been abandoned to avoid further attacks.
Now, what about my little proposition?<eos> All I want from you is something you probably don't even realize you have.<eos> I'm talking about your soul.<eos> Like you collect moths... I collect souls.<eos> I'd like to add yours to my collection.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Just a bit of routine mischief.<eos> Now, then, what about your soul?<eos> Well, uh, I don't know where it is or how to get hold of it.<eos> Exactly. And all I want from you is the exclusive global and universal rights to it.
Do you think I tried to twice cross you?<eos> - You mean double cross.<eos> I think yes. - How exciting.<eos> Do you want my fingerprints?<eos> Listen dolly, where are we going?<eos> My name is not Dolly. My name is Anya.<eos> And I'm taking you to Dr Kaarna.<eos> You like my island?<eos> - Your island?<eos> - My father owns it.
You win, and Le Chiffre will almost certainly be killed by his organization.<eos> But he'd try and avoid that, wouldn't he?<eos> - Lf you win, yes.<eos> - How?<eos> - By trying to kill you.<eos> - As in dead? Yes.<eos> But don't worry about that now.<eos> Let's go down there, and you play the game of your life.<eos> Yes, I better had.<eos> May not be too much more of it left.
When you want to go somewhere, you must go right away, or you'll never do it.<eos> You know what you told me, last night...<eos> Oh la la!<eos> What, "Oh la la"?<eos> Last night was nice, when it's nice, we say it.<eos> But as we like to make things complicate, we also say...<eos> "I love you", "Slap me", "I want a child from you"...<eos> It's what you say in certain occasions, just livening up rhetoric.<eos> Words that become meaningless once you've turn on the light.<eos> Or once you've turn it off if it's stayed on.
You think I'm seeing things, don't you?<eos> Let's just say we don't see what you see, Mr Pimm.<eos> There are certain unseen things that are more real than those which you can see and touch.<eos> I know that.<eos> In other words, Mr Pimm, you're suggesting that these deaths were not accidents, but murders.<eos> All those people flocking to see that monstrous statue.<eos> It's just ghoulish.<eos> It's the newspapers.<eos> I saw it.<eos> There's something uncanny, frightening about it.
What is it?<eos> There's some writing here on this robe.<eos> You can make it out if you look at it from this direction with the light bouncing off it.<eos> Have you made a rubbing of this yet?<eos> Well, we can do that later.<eos> Wouldn't that be the simplest part to fake?<eos> Oh, here's some more.<eos> It's in Hebrew.<eos> "Power bringeth destruction.<eos> Beware, lest it be unleashed."
That's strange.<eos> Yesterday, you seemed determined to prove that your father's death was not an accident, yet this morning...<eos> I feel the sooner that statue's on its way to New York, the better.<eos> Well, first of all, of course, it must be authenticated.<eos> Mr Perkins thinks it's authentic.<eos> You do.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I never said that.<eos> I merely said that...<eos> Well, I felt there was some strange power that lurked within it.
It's all a question of psychology.<eos> Now, one point leaps to mind immediately.<eos> Yes?<eos> - What reason could there be... for the murder of this girl?<eos> - No reason!<eos> You're missing the point.<eos> Nobody is ever murdered without a reason.<eos> There must therefore be a reason.<eos> - That sounds logical, but...<eos> She doesn't see it, Sir John.
I swear.<eos> You're lying!<eos> - Sometimes I could kill you!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Frank Conner was a thief.<eos> - I know that, Sir.<eos> What did lnspector Higgins say about his suicide?<eos> He was forced to accept it.<eos> - And the investigation in the prison?<eos> It's been withdrawn.
He seems to know Paris. He's prepared an itinerary of the sights of the city. I have endorsed it.<eos> I shall see you tomorrow morning at headquarters.<eos> Yes, general.<eos> Sergeant Kopatski is relieved as my orderly.<eos> This morning he smeared polish on my shoelaces.<eos> Fourteen days confined to barracks.<eos> Yes, general.<eos> We've just passed the Place Vendome, sir.<eos> The column is 142 feet high and was erected in 1810.<eos> It's made of bronze from 1200 cannon captured at Austerlitz.
Amen.<eos> Whatyouarenow watchingisthelargeststaging ofnationalism in the history of Great Britain<eos> Now is the beginning of Christian Crusade Week and praise be to God!<eos> Led by a section of the Durham Queen's Scouts detachments of Christian bodies from all over the country pulse with ear-tingling music and breathless precision into an unequalled expression of national solidarity.<eos> We calculate that the gate money from each of these performances will gross on average approximately £135,000.<eos> The coalition government of Britain formed because of the complete lack of difference between the policies of the Conservative and Labour parties has given both its blessing and a state subsidy to the mounting of Christian Crusade Week because, as the official pamphlet states<eos> "we need no longer have any disturbing political differences<eos> "When we are all of one faith and believe in one God and one ﬂag."<eos> This black card will be issued to you as you leave the Stadium tonight.<eos> On it there are three words.
Well, now, wait a minute.<eos> You're the one who told me.<eos> You said that Sam brought a doll back from Canada.<eos> You said it's the same doll that Roat described.<eos> You went right down the line and told me that it proved that Sam and Mrs. Roat were connected.<eos> And now Mrs. Roat's dead, murdered right next door.<eos> - Maybe I was wrong.<eos> - That doesn't matter.<eos> If you thought that way, the police will think that way.<eos> Without the doll, it's a lot of ranting and raving from those crazy Roats but with it, the police have a case involving Sam.
My name is Nunua.<eos> My hut is in the village of Chiz.<eos> Reveal to me your name as well.<eos> I'm Dzhokhola Alkhastaidze.<eos> My village is just within a stone's throw.<eos> If you're looking for a lodging, We'll go there, you and I.<eos> I don't know if it'll be to your liking, But you're welcome in my shack.<eos> After a good sleep you'll awaken And can set out on the road back.<eos> He's a fool who never sowed To hope to reap a harvest's wealth.<eos> You've cut the throat of the goat, And you should have it to yourself.
I was just wondering whether I'd ever see you again after this weekend.<eos> Well, maybe Erik will want me kept busy some other weekend, and I'll recommend you for the job.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Oh, come on, I'm sorry.<eos> - I didn't mean it that way.<eos> - Look, take this.<eos> Give it back to your husband.<eos> I didn't know I was gonna get this involved.<eos> What's the matter with the door?<eos> - It's locked.
Much better than I expected.<eos> You'd really like that 50 million all to yourself, wouldn't you?<eos> No, my dear.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> We're partners.<eos> That does it.<eos> Mr. Hagar now owns the world's most-expensive car.<eos> Yes?<eos> I've returned Mr. Hagar's automobile.<eos> It's been repaired.
- Herr Belzig.<eos> - Kutler, my security chief.<eos> - Herr Kutler.<eos> Comrade Zatopec, federal police.<eos> Herr Kutler, I'm very glad you're here.<eos> I've just arrested a man in the bank, a foreigner.<eos> He was making this sketch.<eos> It may be nothing, but I am taking him down to local police headquarters.<eos> This is correct, Mr. Gambia.<eos> Here's your key. The box can't be opened without it.
This painting, I see it's signed "MCM."<eos> Now, that's you, Mr McMillan.<eos> I dabble around a little in oils every now and then.<eos> I'm no Winston Churchill, but I like it.<eos> - It's very nice.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> When was it done?<eos> It looks fairly recent.<eos> I don't remember when I did that.<eos> It was done by memory, though.
- You really think it's good?<eos> - Why else would I say so?<eos> - Comrade Commissioner.<eos> - See to it, Lupesh.<eos> Well?<eos> A routine correspondence from the East Berlin police requesting data on petty criminal.<eos> Must I do everything in this office?<eos> - This letter is signed "Herr Browder."<eos> - We know Herr Browder.<eos> - It is dated two days ago.
I want you to move faster than ever now.<eos> Every man who opposes me must be behind bars before I take office.<eos> The jails are bursting at the seams now.<eos> They will be empty soon enough.<eos> - You relish the idea of killing?<eos> - And you?<eos> It makes me sick.<eos> If there were any other way, any way at all to rid my country of her enemies...<eos> But the decay goes too deep.<eos> It must be cut away.
That's all it takes.<eos> Knowing that we're not going to kill today.<eos> Contact Vendikar.<eos> I think you'll find that they're just as terrified, appalled, horrified as you are. That they'll do anything to avoid the alternative I've given you. Peace or utter destruction.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> As a third party interested only in peace and the establishment of normal relations, I shall be glad to offer my services as negotiator between you and Vendikar.<eos> I've had some small experiences in such matters.<eos> There may be a chance.<eos> We have a direct channel with Vendikar's High Council.<eos> - It hasn't been used in centuries.
Like a cloud of hydrogen, but with a strong electrical impulse.<eos> We've got it.<eos> - Helm does not answer, Captain.<eos> - Neither do the pods.<eos> Building overload.<eos> - Cut all power relays.<eos> - Cut, Captain.<eos> - Captain, what's happening?<eos> - You know as much as we do.<eos> Whatever that thing is, it's yanked us off course from the Enterprise.
He keeps some very rough company, including a man called Ken.<eos> - Ken? Kennedy!<eos> - What?<eos> - What do you know about Kennedy?<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> I'll answer your questions if you'll answer mine.<eos> This old police box was for a collector of curios.<eos> - It belongs to me!<eos> - Why is it so important to you?<eos> Because of what's inside it, and it's my property.
Not even Captain Kirk.<eos> See Caesar come.<eos> He is awed by your greatness.<eos> Your shining brightness.<eos> Bright as a blade before it is stained with blood.<eos> Bright as a blade.<eos> Come with me, both of you.<eos> Of course, after the play.<eos> The play is over.<eos> It's been over for 20 years.
If it hadn't been for my trusty hat...<eos> Really, the height of pessimism to have a hat lined with chain mail.<eos> Well, we solved the problem of what Mr. Reed would do next.<eos> Any further amusing speculations?<eos> Yeah, one.<eos> This.<eos> I found it in the staff office along with a very large telescope.<eos> Look, here's Orion. Here's Leo.<eos> And here is a star that doesn't exist.<eos> It's not marked on any of the charts. - New star?
- That's what I was gonna say.<eos> - Well, that's too bad.<eos> I'll just have to work it out somehow.<eos> Thanks for bringing the saucepan.<eos> You can put it down over there.<eos> Cute.<eos> Isn't that silly?<eos> I walked out with the saucepan.<eos> The chair shrunk.<eos> It wasn't Sanforized.
-The one you hate?<eos> -Oh, that one.<eos> -You don't wear that anymore.<eos> -I'd wear it today, but I can't find it.<eos> To the office?<eos> Well, don't you think it's a little noisy?<eos> Sam, this may surprise you, but I've chosen my own clothes for some time.<eos> Why don't you wear the brown one?<eos> It's nicer.<eos> I want to wear the houndstooth, and I can't find it!
-Oh, that one.<eos> -You don't wear that anymore.<eos> -I'd wear it today, but I can't find it.<eos> To the office?<eos> Well, don't you think it's a little noisy?<eos> Sam, this may surprise you, but I've chosen my own clothes for some time.<eos> Why don't you wear the brown one?<eos> It's nicer.<eos> I want to wear the houndstooth, and I can't find it!<eos> Now, have you seen it or not?
-She is?<eos> -Lots of experience.<eos> All with me.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Mother.<eos> Mother?<eos> Oh, boy, you're always around when I don't need you, but when I do--<eos> What is all that racket?<eos> That's Darrin.<eos> I had to tell him about the chair. He came home, and now he's in the study fighting with it.
The paratroopers were looking for someone less important than you.<eos> Can you tell us why you were in that apartment on rue Debussy?<eos> All I can say is I wish I'd never set foot there.<eos> That'll be all. It's late and we have work to do.<eos> So the show's over?<eos> Yes, it's over. Before it has the opposite effect.<eos> People of the Casbah, the rebellion is dying out.<eos> Ali Mohammed, head of FLN Section 2, was killed this morning.<eos> People of Algiers, turn in the agitators.<eos> Disassociate yourselves from the rebel organization. The army is protecting you. Trust in it.
And why you need so many guns to kill one single little disarmed Mulelist.<eos> you only need one shot.<eos> Africa continues to be an uncontainable sea of life. five come into the world with black skin.<eos> which is called "apartheid" here provisional dam.<eos> It is the hysterical reaction to the hysterical situation that threatens to darken the smile of the new generations into hatred.<eos> Soweto is one of the largest black cities in South Africa.<eos> The apartheid laws prohibit whites from entering.<eos> then it's a strange prison where the doors lock on the inside and open out.<eos> there's another big prison... that of the whites.<eos> It's called Johannesburg.
What I do understand is human bleeding nature.<eos> How do you know your missus ain't got a geezer outside?<eos> You say another word about my wife, I'll knock your bloody...!<eos> Don't get aeriated.<eos> Harry, sit quiet.<eos> Here, have a fag.<eos> The doc said not to smoke more than five a day.<eos> Take no notice of the doc.<eos> You've got to get yourself better.<eos> No, all I meant was, with a bird, you can never tell where it's been nor what it's done.
Don't look at me! Bow your head.<eos> I told you not to look... or you'll regret it...<eos> Now, would you like to see me.<eos> Answer!<eos> A kiss is like the heat of a fire. Isn't it, Victor?<eos> I warned you! Beast!<eos> Children! Quiet!<eos> If one of you makes a mistake ...that's not a reason to laugh.<eos> Umberto... It's true that a horse has a tail...<eos> But it's connected to the posterior.
Go on.<eos> You choose...<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes, it's Karl.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello, yes.<eos> Yes, it's altogether by chance.<eos> My eyes caught a cane that I didn't know.<eos> And it was fiddled with.
Nepal is all antiques.<eos> Is it?<eos> Perhaps I better try Morocco.<eos> - What?<eos> The propeller.<eos> You can have it for... - 8 pounds. - Right.<eos> - Have you got a van?<eos> - You can't take it now.<eos> I must. I must.<eos> - I can't live without it. - Hard luck.
Even when Judas hanged himself, there was a storm too.<eos> That could be cannon fire.<eos> Cannon fire or storm, it's all the same to you.<eos> You ever see this before, my friend?<eos> Throw it over the roof beam.<eos> That's it.<eos> Now get on that.<eos> That's right.<eos> Now make sure the rope is tight.<eos> It's got to hold the weight of a pig.
What do you think is the trouble with Ronnie?<eos> How would I know?<eos> But you're his mother. You must have an instinct.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Do you think it's a natural illness?<eos> I always took good care of him. Always.<eos> Why shouldn't it be?<eos> Mrs Dowsett, I don't know if this means anything to you, but yesterday I found a doll in the fork of a tree.<eos> - Doll? - Hmm.<eos> It was stuck full of pins, and the head was missing.
And neither will you.<eos> D0 you really believe you could make this work?<eos> I know it.<eos> - Summon up the devil?<eos> - Now, don't try to cheapen it with words.<eos> Call it a power or a force that we are going to release.<eos> Perhaps it's in yourself - something in you.<eos> What does that matter?<eos> You could touch an H bomb and say, "l know what's in there, uranium and stuff... that is all."<eos> But when it is triggered off...
You can't help it if you're in love.<eos> You're born losers, both of you!<eos> - What's the matter with her?<eos> - She's crazy about the wrong guy:<eos> I am a loser.<eos> But, if I had 20 bucks, I could be a winner.<eos> I hate myself for asking, but how?<eos> This gypsy fortune-teller, everybody who takes her advice is hittin' it rich.<eos> - So how come she lives in a wagon?<eos> - It's loaded with gold.
I'm giving the world an pleasure opportunity of studying and viewing the Cellini 'Venus'.<eos> Which is not by Cellini.<eos> Labels, labels!<eos> It's working with the Americans that's given you this obsession with labels and brand names.<eos> I wish you'd give up that ridiculous job.<eos> Don't you know you can't fake sculpture anymore?<eos> It's not like painting.<eos> I know about their so-called tests.<eos> Papa, they are not so-called. They are!<eos> One quick whiff of something called potassium argon and they can tell the age of the stone, where it was quarried, when it was cut and the name and address of the man who did it.
Did you find the van Gogh?<eos> - Easily. - And?<eos> It disturbs you, doesn't it?<eos> Not a bit.<eos> It's a great van Gogh.<eos> Of course it is, but who painted it?<eos> My dear Bernard, Bonnet has a Cellini sculpture on exhibition right now which is worth $1.000.000. He doesn't need to forge paintings.<eos> - Unless you think that's a forgery too.<eos> - No, not that!<eos> For one thing, it was first exhibited in 1910 when Bonnet was eight years old.
Your eyes are watering.<eos> Your thoughts are slowing down.<eos> Slower and slower.<eos> Stare inside yourself... until you find the point... where you feel only your inner self... free of all thought and sensation.<eos> You are now completely numb.<eos> Your body no longer feels pain.<eos> You see?<eos> He's in a trance.<eos> Your soul has departed for its next existence.<eos> It's no longer shackled by nature's laws, no longer condemned to inhabit a fleshly body.
Time flew. I guess I'll be running along.<eos> We were gonna go over the flight plan.<eos> Well, not today. I'm busy.<eos> See you tomorrow.<eos> Tomorrow?<eos> What do you mean, tomorrow?<eos> -Roger!<eos> Give me that bottle back.<eos> -What bottle?<eos> This is nothing to fool around with. There was a bottle and it's gone.
No matter how high up they go, they've got to come down.<eos> I've become a monster.<eos> Brother...<eos> There won't be a war for awhile, will there?<eos> Probably not.<eos> But who knows?<eos> We can't even be sure about tomorrow's weather.<eos> That's so.<eos> It's true of war, too.<eos> Most likely, we only know after it's begun.
Please, sir, if you'll just sign the register.<eos> Doesn't seem to me like business has been too good lately.<eos> Just dust from the street, sir.<eos> We can't keep it out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. Carlin, I have a fine corner room.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I didn't recognize your name at first.<eos> Now that we've got that settled, how about my key?<eos> About that corner room... I must confess you won't really like it.
Piano, victrola, Hawaiian steel guitar...<eos> Everybody playing on something.<eos> It's awful quiet now, though.<eos> - Is it empty?<eos> - Except for me.<eos> They got a big sign stuck up.<eos> "This property is condemned".<eos> - You ain't still living there?<eos> - I'm not supposed to be, but I am.<eos> Property's condemned, but there ain't nothing wrong with it.
Mr Fennan, we know it's idiotic, but when the Foreign Secretary finds that sort of letter in his in-tray, it's like London airport getting an anonymous phone call to say that there's a bomb on the Prime Minister's plane,<eos> and somebody's got to do a check.<eos> - Was the letter anonymous?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Was it literate?<eos> Oh, yes, properly spelt, properly punctuated.<eos> No cranky stuff.<eos> - Handwriting?<eos> - It was typewritten.
The police believe it to be a clear case of suicide.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - What I believe is not the point, Dobbs.<eos> The point is, the Foreign Office believe the police.<eos> It's unfortunate that in this distressing matter we are now answerable to the two public bodies with whom our current relations are most, shall I say, uneasy.<eos> Lf, of course, there are facts not included in your confidential report which point to Fennan's suicide for reasons other than his interview with you, I shall be happy to hear about them.<eos> Are there?<eos> - Have they opened his suicide letter?<eos> - They're photostatting the original.<eos> It was typed on Fennan's own machine and signed with what's indubitably his own signature.
The biggest bloody problem you've ever had.<eos> Contravention of the Road Traffic Act.<eos> Conspiracy to defraud the Inland Revenue.<eos> Offences under the Official Secrets Act.<eos> Conspiracy to murder, accessory to murder!<eos> Don't go over the bloody moon.<eos> Who the hell's talking about murder?<eos> I am, Scarr, I am.<eos> You heard that ambulance just now.<eos> There's a man dying in it, murdered by your Blondie.
Could we bluff them into meeting each other?<eos> Sonntag and Elsa?<eos> Come with me.<eos> I want you to type something.<eos> Mrs Elsa Fennan, 34, Merridale Lane, Walliston, Surrey.<eos> Wish you were here.<eos> Signed, S.<eos> It's an emergency rendezvous signal.<eos> How can you be sure you're using the right conventions, the right phrase?<eos> The postcard itself is the signal, irrespective of what's written on it.
Bravo, mama!<eos> Henpecked man!<eos> This slut in the home of your mother and your single sister!<eos> Get out!<eos> Don't ever come back!<eos> How pretty!<eos> Those eyes!<eos> What a doll!<eos> The room is also pretty, and large.<eos> Do you like it, precious?
- I'm notjoking!<eos> Come on, dear, what is it with you?<eos> Can't you see?<eos> We're either officers serving our Czar and Fatherland, rejoicing over our common success or mourning our common failure, or we're lackeys who don't give a damn about the master's affairs.<eos> Forty thousand people have died, our ally's army has been destroyed, and you are able to joke about it.<eos> Only silly kids can amuse themselves in this way.<eos> Isn't it charming how the Gascons show what they're made of?<eos> Three of them go and seize a bridge.<eos> The French cross the bridge and their army gets across the Danube.<eos> But if the French have crossed the Thabor Bridge, that means Kutuzov's army is cut off, it is doomed!
He's dead.<eos> Monsieur! I saw his body lying in the street by the Abbot's house.<eos> Before I could do anything Roger Colbert saw me and sent the guards after me again.<eos> Heaven knows what I'll do now.<eos> Return to England?<eos> I can't.<eos> I've got to find the key to the TARDIS.<eos> What Monsieur?<eos> The Doctor has a special key.<eos> Without it I can't leave.
Remind me to teach you a few tricks sometime.<eos> Remind me not to pick a fight with you.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> You won't get in.<eos> Doctor, you've been following me!<eos> For a time, yes.<eos> For a time. I've been glad to.<eos> You know, I don't think that I would have found my TARDIS without the help of that energy counter.<eos> Come in very handy, hasn't it.<eos> You know, Doctor if your machine would blend in with its surroundings people wouldn't be able to find it. And then we wouldn't have all this trouble.
Come in very handy, hasn't it.<eos> You know, Doctor if your machine would blend in with its surroundings people wouldn't be able to find it. And then we wouldn't have all this trouble.<eos> Yes.<eos> Like your machine, I suppose, hmm?<eos> Exactly, Doctor.<eos> Like mine.<eos> I could teach you a thing or two, you know.<eos> Well, you know, my way has its advantages.<eos> The Egyptians thought that it was a very good idea otherwise they wouldn't have brought it in here.<eos> As for your machine, well, it's probably disguised as a... what... a sort of... a block of stone? Hmm... Hm...?
One of the launchers has returned from Refusis.<eos> VENUSSA: Look!<eos> -Look at what?<eos> It's empty.<eos> -I know.<eos> And it was empty when we opened the door.<eos> Doctor, where are the Refusians?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I haven't seen one.<eos> You stepped out of the launcher, a moment later it was flown away.
No, why should I care?<eos> Because they're people and they're going to die!<eos> I do not understand you.<eos> There are people dying all over your world yet you do not care about them.<eos> Yes, but we could avoid their deaths...<eos> You will be wondering what has happened.<eos> Your astronomers will have just discovered a new planet.<eos> Is that not so? Yes, that's right.<eos> That is where we come from.<eos> It is called Mondas.
You were marvelous at dinner.<eos> That guy trying to piss me off.<eos> You salvaged the situation.<eos> And your next film.<eos> - At the same time, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love our complicity.<eos> It's been very useful, hasn't it?
- No messages?<eos> - None.<eos> - You've checked?<eos> - Double checked.<eos> - No Mrs. Peel?<eos> - No one of that name.<eos> What have you done to Steed's watch?<eos> The next time he opens it will be the last.<eos> Pretty, isn't it?<eos> It's dedicated to Steed.
Come here.<eos> Take a look at that!<eos> No, focus it.<eos> What do you see now?<eos> - Looks like a sponge.<eos> It's unbelievable!<eos> History in the making!<eos> What you see there are brain cells..<eos> This seed had an embryonic brain.<eos> What a disaster it was damaged!
But you promised me you wouldn't say anything to Samantha.<eos> Now look at the mess you've cau...<eos> - Oh, forget it.<eos> - I have an idea.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Why don't we all go out and celebrate?<eos> I'll buy that.<eos> You must let me try your wig on sometime later.<eos> I don't think it'll fit, Louise.<eos> It was custom-made for my head.
"This royal throne of kings<eos> "This scepter'd isle<eos> "This earth of majesty<eos> "This seat of Mars<eos> "This other Eden, demi-paradise<eos> "This fortress built by Nature for herself<eos> "Against infection and the hand of war<eos> "This happy breed of men, this little world<eos> "This precious stone set in the silver sea<eos> "Which serves it in the office of a wall Or as a moat defensive to a house

- What the hell are you doing?<eos> - What the hell am I doing?<eos> Sitting in the dark?<eos> Admiring the view.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Sorry I'm so late.<eos> The car got towed away.<eos> Did it?<eos> Bloody meters.<eos> - Had to go miles to get it back.
- Is anything wrong?<eos> The hand's gone! What?<eos> When?<eos> When did it happen?<eos> There's not a single drop of fluid left...<eos> Look for it again, all of you!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Dr. Bowen!<eos> It's dead!<eos> But it's grown very large!
It's him alright.<eos> And I see the hangman.<eos> He has an axe.<eos> An axe and a gallows.<eos> They're spoiling that Jolicoeur.<eos> "He will be hung after the executioner has cut off his hands."<eos> Executioner, remove the ring on my finger.<eos> - What?<eos> - It belongs to the Princess.<eos> It should not be stained with blood.
I locked him in here.<eos> - In that cupboard.<eos> - In that cupboard?<eos> Go on.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> - He's gone. - I hope so.<eos> That was 50 years ago.<eos> Come, the car will be here to take us to London.<eos> We're going to a new play about the Gunpowder Plot.<eos> The critics hail it as "explosive. "
- Rayon chafes, you know.<eos> Personally, I find it really quite abrasive.<eos> Well, then, I think, then, I'll take the Emperor model.<eos> Wonderful, Mr. Barlow.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Now then, Mr. Barlow, have you given any thought to exterior designations?<eos> I can give you our Eternal Flame in either perpetual eternal or standard eternal.<eos> What is the difference, actually?<eos> Well, with standard eternal, your flame burns only during visiting hours.<eos> It is shut down at night.
- Yes, sir.<eos> Praise be to hookers and drunks!<eos> The kingom of God is open to them.<eos> Long live rehabilitation!<eos> Long live love!<eos> And praise be to the sisters of charity!<eos> That's enough.<eos> You have to drink!<eos> You have to drink to escape death.<eos> The more you drink, the closer you are to it.
It is the dealers in vice and the purveyors of sex that the police must throw their force against, not just the killer!<eos> I tell you there can be no peace in Whitechapel while licensed dens like the Angel and Crown... cater to the dissolute and the debauched!<eos> Prime Minister - the Home Secretary.<eos> How's the battle?<eos> The Leader of the Opposition has found the culprit.<eos> Gladstone is in form.<eos> I was afraid of that.<eos> I could see you were in for trouble.<eos> Not just me.<eos> He'll demand that the Commissioner of Police resigns. If he calls for a vote of no confidence, he might get it.
- What did I tell you?<eos> - That's as far as it went.<eos> - Patience.<eos> He'll get there.<eos> He was a perfect gentleman.<eos> I had a couple of drinks.<eos> I got a little dizzy.<eos> So he brought me home, kissed me on the forehead and left.<eos> Could be he is an interior decorator.<eos> The author says life's like an onion not only because it's got skins, but also because it stinks!
- I only congratulated.<eos> - I'm not joking!<eos> Come on, dear, what is it with you?<eos> Can't you see? We're either officers serving our Czar and Fatherland, rejoicing over our common success or mourning our common failure, or we're lackeys who don't give a damn about the master's affairs.<eos> Forty thousand people have died, our ally's army has been destroyed, and you are able to joke about it.<eos> Only silly kids can amuse themselves in this way.<eos> Isn't it charming how the Gascons show what they're made of?<eos> Three of them go and seize a bridge.<eos> The French cross the bridge and their army gets across the Danube.<eos> But if the French have crossed the Thabor Bridge, that means Kutuzov's army is cut off, it is doomed!
I must!<eos> It's not far to the beach, if our calculations are correct.<eos> I hope this will run again.<eos> Don't worry, it will.<eos> Look, the cliffs are all in even rows. Like streets.<eos> I'll look around, just five minutes.<eos> Look. That's a shark's tail.<eos> Yes, but with the head of a dolphin.<eos> Found a cave.<eos> Only the entrance looked like it's been carved.
- But look at the magnificence!<eos> No one on Earth has seen such a sight.<eos> Hurry, we've got to move to higher ground.<eos> I am hurrying.<eos> Are you getting the spectra sample?<eos> Getting it now.<eos> That's enough.<eos> The lava is rising.<eos> We've waited too long.<eos> It's covered our path!
We will begin.<eos> Women have always been a big problem to me, Dr Fassbender.<eos> - Are you listening, Doctor? - Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Go on, go on, go on.<eos> The first woman I had a crush on was my schoolteacher. - Miss Marks.<eos> - That's a perfectly normal occurrence.<eos> Did you read the essay I wrote on my summer holidays?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I thought it was the most moving piece I'd ever read.<eos> I hope you noticed I dedicated it to you, Miss Marks.
Once upon a time in a mythical place called Cape Kennedy an astronaut named Tony Nelson went up on a space mission.<eos> The missile went up but something went wrong, and they had to bring it down.<eos> Captain Nelson landed on an island in the South Pacific where he found a bottle. At least it looked like a bottle. But it didn't act like a bottle.<eos> Because in it was a genie.

It is the atmosphere of this planet.<eos> Rest.<eos> I will watch for Zarbi.<eos> Are your wings healed?<eos> I shall never fly again?<eos> No.<eos> Why do they make us do.... (BEEPING)<eos> Why do they make us heap this vegetation into the acid streams?<eos> It is the raw material for the Carsinome where the Zarbi live.<eos> Fed into these pools, it is drawn to the centre through underground streams.
It was disaster.<eos> Vrestin, the others, we arrived in advance of the Spearhead.<eos> Our weapons proved useless.<eos> They were taken by the Zarbi, who were everywhere.<eos> The three of us you met in the cave got away with a communicator, but we could not contact our Spearhead.<eos> When is it due to arrive?<eos> Soon.<eos> And how will you overcome the Animus?<eos> With a new invention of our scientists.<eos> It has not been tested, but we have placed our faith in the Isop-tope.
Get back to your posts!<eos> Get away!<eos> Wait!<eos> Get away!<eos> Do not move! Answer my question!<eos> Come on, sir, come on!<eos> It's the Barbary terror!<eos> You're not going to take my soul!<eos> Is the earth time machine here?<eos> It has not yet been discovered.
Mary Celeste?<eos> Vicki? Any change, Doctor?<eos> I altered the curve we were travelling on.<eos> For one moment, I dared hoped we'd lost them.<eos> They must have detected the change and followed.<eos> They're close on our track.<eos> But surely we've got our twelve-minute lead still?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> It's down to eight.<eos> It will be reduced even further after our next landing.
But if our gods favour our survival, we must learn their lesson and use our brains and not our wings.<eos> This Earth woman we must trust for she can show us how to exist without wings, to survive and flourish.<eos> What should we do?<eos> Well... what would have happened if the Spearhead had been successful?<eos> Had.... Had we met with no resistance, we were to proceed to the centre of the web and destroy the Animus.<eos> -How? -HILIO:<eos> With this.<eos> Our wise men designed it for use against the intelligence.<eos> -A living cell destructor? -Yes.<eos> The web and the living thing behind it grows and spreads its evil around Vortis.
But surely we've got our twelve-minute lead still?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> It's down to eight.<eos> It will be reduced even further after our next landing.
For their friends?<eos> There are many strange things in the universe.<eos> I do not understand.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> But, despite that, you will obey orders!<eos> It may be that we shall kill neither the Rills nor these Earth creatures.<eos> Not with our own hands, that is.<eos> It may be better for us to escape in the Rills' spaceship and leave them here.<eos> And then... when we are out in space, we can look back.<eos> We will see a vast white, exploding planet... and know that they have died with it!
You have very little time left, Doctor!<eos> Oh, I'm quite well aware of that, but er I'm afraid this machine isn't going to work.<eos> You mean you're too frightened to fly it yourself.<eos> No, no, no, it isn't that, not at all!<eos> I've made a mistake in my calculations.<eos> A mistake?<eos> Yes, yes, I'm afraid we must face up to it, Odysseus er, man was never meant to fly.<eos> Wasn't he now?<eos> Well that seems to me a great shame.<eos> Now if your machine won't work, Doctor, I propose to fly you without it.
Great One, don't leave us!<eos> No!<eos> He said we had to...<eos> No!<eos> You can't leave him!<eos> He won't! We're going without him!<eos> We're going into countdown!<eos> What's that light?<eos> It's the outer door!<eos> It's not fully shut.
Well, who is she?<eos> Well, she's a... she's a friend of the old man's.<eos> Let me go!<eos> Come on, Steven.<eos> Hello, hello?<eos> What's up with you?<eos> Here... here, it's gone!<eos> What?<eos> That telephone box - it's gone.<eos> Weren't it meant for us?
"Whoever finds this, I love you.<eos> Please bring me another pencil."<eos> Samantha!<eos> Coming right up, darling.<eos> Sam.<eos> - I did it again.<eos> - What?<eos> Forgot to lock the back door.<eos> I didn't.<eos> It's locked.
Stop it, I never had anything with him.<eos> -I don't want him to love you.<eos> A man in love is so vulnerable.<eos> Are you here already?<eos> -I arrived yesterday evening.<eos> Do you want to dance? -Alright.<eos> Are you still buying that outboard motor from me?<eos> Yes, but only the motor.<eos> -What about the boat?<eos> Burn it.
- This door wants attention, Lurch.<eos> Dear Uncle Fester, is there anything I can do for you?<eos> No, I'm very comfortable.<eos> This feels so good.<eos> Thank you, Lurch.<eos> That's much better.<eos> I just love creaky doors.<eos> We both thought we'd rest up a bit before going on our spider hunt.<eos> That reminds me, have you seen little Pugsley's octopus?<eos> It's been running all over the house.
I know just how they feel.<eos> The joy of moving into a new house.<eos> I'II never forget my first night in this lovely house.<eos> -We thought it was haunted.<eos> -Well, you can't have everything.<eos> I only hope they'II be half as happy.<eos> How could they be anything else?<eos> With us right next door.<eos> Horrible house next door.<eos> You suppose anybody lives in it?
Our home has no boundaries beyond which we cannot pass.<eos> We live in music, in a flash of colour. We live on the wind in the sparkle of a star.<eos> And you want to trade it all for a quarter of an acre of crabgrass.<eos> Well, now, Mother, if Darrin's this excited, there must be something to it.<eos> Now, I'm going to take a look at that house.<eos> At least you can keep an open mind and go with me.<eos> You mean you're interested in my opinion?<eos> You said you wanted me to be happy.<eos> Well, all right, I'll look at it with you.<eos> But I won't like it.
Well, I didn't wham, pow or ring-a-ding up anything.<eos> These are bona fide dishpan hands.<eos> You could've whipped that up too, for appearance.<eos> - Are you calling me a liar?<eos> - Lf the shoe fits.<eos> Sam.<eos> Samantha!<eos> Samantha, listen to me.<eos> - Samantha, unlock this door.<eos> - It's not locked.
- Well, Chesterton?<eos> - Just as you predicted, Doctor, nothing but snow and ice.<eos> - Have you found the fault?<eos> Yes, yes, yes, but it's going to take such a long time... and time we don't have!<eos> Now the only chance is to try and get down to a lower a- altitude and, er... er... you know...<eos> Doctor... there are strange things on the mountain.<eos> - What's she talking about now?<eos> - Well, I only saw a print.<eos> What sort of print paws, hooves, what?<eos> To tell you the truth, I thought it was made by a fur boot
I am alone.<eos> But please... let us release your companions and then I...<eos> I'll try to explain.<eos> Good idea.<eos> Yes, yes, I want to know more about this planet.<eos> Your technology, you say, reached its peak over two thousand years ago?<eos> Yes and all our knowledge culminated in the manufacture of this.<eos> At the time it was called the Conscience of Marinus.<eos> Marinus, that is the name of our planet.<eos> At first this machine was simply a judge and jury that was never wrong and unfair, and then we added to it, improved on it, made it more and more sophisticated until finally it became possible to radiate its power and influence the minds of men throughout the planet.
That makes sense!<eos> Well, I think we all agree that Mr. Stark has been more than generous with us.<eos> I suggest, therefore, that we take a vote--<eos> Just a minute!<eos> I'd like to say a few words if Mr. Stark doesn't mind.<eos> Not in the least, Mr. Cunningham.<eos> After all, this is a free country.<eos> It's good someone remembers that.<eos> You know, folks, I haven't been here long. But it's home to me.<eos> And I believe in fighting for your home when it's threatened.
And you, mister, what do you go to do in Crete? With your permission.<eos> I have some land there. It belonged to my father.<eos> And you go to write?<eos> - Not exactly.<eos> - What, exactly?<eos> I haven't written anything in months.<eos> - On this land, there's an old mine.<eos> - Oh? - Lignite.<eos> - Lignitis.<eos> I know. - It's been idle for years.
She made them, didn't she?<eos> And why shouldn't it be me?<eos> - No.<eos> - Why?<eos> If you'd made them, she would not have brought me so many.<eos> A woman's mind can only be understood by men!<eos> Take off that shirt, Mr. Clever-Dick.<eos> Which shirt?<eos> The one you have got on.<eos> It's got a hole big enough that a grown men could get inside.
You've never done something stupid, eh?<eos> Me?<eos> Why ask me that?<eos> How is it over there?<eos> Detectives came.<eos> They interviewed everyone.<eos> You held your tongue, eh?<eos> - What happened?<eos> - My room...<eos> It wasn't locked.
Yes, sir.<eos> Do our Vindicator missiles have both infrared- and radar-seeking capacity?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Loud and clear!<eos> They've got to know we're on the level!<eos> It has both capacities, sir.<eos> Can the radar-seeking mechanism be overloaded... by increasing the strength of the signal?<eos> Tell them!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> It can be overloaded... but by increasing the power output... and sliding through radar frequencies as fast as possible... what happens is the firing mechanism... reads the higher amperage as proximity to the target... and detonates the warhead.
Why would you say that?<eos> You're so nervous.<eos> Mind you, after all that's happened...<eos> The statue's still safe?<eos> I want to see it.<eos> - You're joking.<eos> - Not a bit.<eos> I'll reassure you right now.<eos> Come.<eos> I repeat, it's well protected.
My honest advice is to refuse it.<eos> You know I won't, of course.<eos> I know.<eos> Ruined finery.<eos> That's all I have left.<eos> I'm stony broke - is that the phrase?<eos> It's a relief to admit it.<eos> But your policy with Lloyd's...<eos> Oh, you know how long it would take to process an old claim like that.<eos> By the time I received it, I'd be past needing it.
You know what I think?<eos> I think if she leaves with you, she ain't never gonna be seen or heard from again.<eos> Anyways, I take my orders from Miss Charlotte and not from you.<eos> It should be obvious even to you that my cousin is in no condition to run a household.<eos> Oh, is that so? Well, there's a whole lot of things that's obvious to me.<eos> The childish tricks you've been playing here are more than sufficient reason to dismiss you.<eos> Tricks?<eos> What are you calling tricks?<eos> It wasn't me who ripped your dadburned old dress.<eos> But you seem to know it was ripped.
"and the lower classes worthy of relief or commiseration..."<eos> Marie, look... would you mind if I touched your calf?<eos> You've absolutely nothing to fear from me.<eos> You don't mind?<eos> Keep reading...<eos> "The dreadful, bleeding head glowers,<eos> "scattering... clots... "of dark crimson<eos> "over the tips of its beard and hair.<eos> "Visible to Salome alone,<eos> "it neither embraces in its sinister gaze..."
But don't you love him any more?<eos> I'll spit on his coffin.<eos> So will I, but how do we get him into it?<eos> You are a man, aren't you?<eos> We are men, aren't we?<eos> Anybody here?<eos> Good folk.<eos> Even better, indulge a poor blind man with a sip of refreshing, strengthening CoIasup lemonade.<eos> Horace! Why the fancy dress?<eos> Because due to it, Joe will hideously suffer!
Don't they have beds in these cabins?<eos> Of course.<eos> I was trying out new equipment.<eos> - Trying out some new equipment?<eos> - Yes, for the store.<eos> And Miss Mueller just happened to come by and find you?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Isn't that nice?<eos> And she was helping you with your zipper?<eos> It was stuck before.
- The bowls!<eos> - Ah, the bowls...<eos> These are genuine antiques.<eos> Goodness, this wood is so smooth!<eos> - If I could only have them!<eos> - What would we do with them?<eos> What would we do with them?<eos> We'd have a rustic lunch in the garden, we'd hire a waiter, dress him in a monk's habit, and we'd be the envy of Florence!<eos> You like the table?<eos> It's got holes.
Is it the right amount?<eos> Yes, I fixed it just right.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> If I die, by mistake, you'll die, too, won't you?<eos> The same goes for you.<eos> Did you write the letter?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Read mine.<eos> It's addressed to your husband.
Good heavens.<eos> Very original.<eos> Very ingenious. Or perhaps not so.<eos> Oh, propel me please, Jim.<eos> Well, here we are.<eos> The Doom Box by J. Plantaganet Corby.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Now listen.<eos> "'And so, me lad,' declared Sefton Harricott:<eos> 'Jacob Rushton did indeed suffer a heart attack but it was induced by a noxious substance in his snuff.'"
- I'm cold.<eos> - Oh, dear me.<eos> There we are.<eos> That's better, isn't it?<eos> Tuck it well round.<eos> Now, what organization would be likely to keep a record of all professional theatrical productions?<eos> - The censorship people, I suppose.<eos> - To be sure.<eos> The Lord Chamberlain's Office in London.<eos> I should be obliged if you would go there posthaste and inquire into the history of this play where it was produced in 1951, who was in it, and so on.
Take off my dress!<eos> I paid $350 for that dress. I'll take it off myself.<eos> Those bonbons aren't there just to serve drinks, you know.<eos> I know.<eos> You had that coming to you.<eos> Candy said I could make $300 a week.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You know what's different about the first night?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing except it lasts forever. That's all.
That's a lie. A base lie.<eos> I was never defrocked. I was only locked out of my church.<eos> Spreading a story like that is libel. I could take legal action. And I will.<eos> These ladies are my witnesses. Repeating a story like that will get you...<eos> I'll show you.<eos> I'll show you all.<eos> You can't say that I was defrocked.<eos> Well, if you're not gonna eat him, I guess I'd better see about some food.<eos> What's this mess supposed to be? Soup.<eos> Well, it's burnt!
You are third policeman and should have no lines.<eos> Shut up and drive.<eos> - Do you know what this is?<eos> - The key!<eos> The key to our future.<eos> One million dollars in small unmarked bills' worth of happiness for the two of us.<eos> Inspector Gillette of Interpol here.<eos> Calling all voitures.<eos> Faster!<eos> Erm, the gate, sir, it is closed.
I'll use the other gate.<eos> She wants some cocoa and some potato crisps.<eos> We haven't got any, have we?<eos> - We have cocoa.<eos> - What about the crisps?<eos> Listen.<eos> Turn out the lights.<eos> Nothing.<eos> That's the garage door.<eos> Is it locked? Yes.
Peggy... and now, with Greta, that makes four.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Sweetheart, what's wrong?<eos> Kiss me.<eos> Are you worried, darling?<eos> What a mess.<eos> It's all because of that stupid idiot Isabella.<eos> Her blackmail had become unbearable.<eos> Money, money and more money.<eos> precisely because she unfortunately found out... that my husband's death wasn't an accident, she should have realised that it was both foolish and dangerous to push it. But no...
Let me in!<eos> Stop!<eos> Come back, you fools!<eos> Come back.<eos> Clouseau, stop them.<eos> Stop them.<eos> The bomb.<eos> The what?<eos> The bomb?<eos> It was meant for you.
Stop!<eos> Come back, you fools!<eos> Come back.<eos> Clouseau, stop them.<eos> Stop them.<eos> The bomb.<eos> The what?<eos> The bomb?<eos> It was meant for you.<eos> What do you mean it was meant for me?
I'm not a tramp!<eos> I have my job!<eos> I'm a registered citizen!<eos> What if someone starts a search?<eos> Illegal confinement's a crime!<eos> If I'm too slow, my house will be buried in the sand.<eos> Let it!<eos> Why involve me?<eos> The house behind would be in trouble.<eos> So let it get buried!
At this very...moment...<eos> Come into the little red lounge.<eos> It's more tranquil.<eos> No, I'm fine here.<eos> At this moment, an army of mercenaries commanded by the Prince of Grasillac.. is heading on Paris to strangle the revolution in the bud. Good!<eos> - Good, yes!<eos> We will have, for our part, the great privilege to host prince Grasillac,.. if, coming from the south at the head of his brave troops, he will stop.. for a few hours in our city, yes gentlemen,..<eos> Little bastard!<eos> Excuse me, my injury.<eos> - Oh, it is excused.
"Don't pay any attention to any news you may hear ..."<eos> "And don't leave Boston no matter what"<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Someone is trying to hide something.<eos> My presence is bothering someone.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Bogarde.<eos> I've made a mistake.<eos> I didn't know ...<eos> I mean, by the time I gave you the room ...<eos> It had already been reserved.
On the tops of their houses, and in their streets e veryone shall weep abundantly.<eos> Who do men say is the Son of Man?<eos> So me say John the Baptist.<eos> Others Elijah.<eos> Others Jeremy.<eos> Or one of the prophets.<eos> What do you say that I a m?<eos> You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.<eos> Blessed are you, Simon, son of John. It is not flesh and blood, it is my Father that has revealed this to you.<eos> And I tell you that you are Peter. And it is upon this rock that I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
- It's clear, sir, all the way through to New York.<eos> - Good evening, Mr. Anderson. - Willard, this is Mrs. Flint.<eos> - How do you do? - Mrs. Flint will be flying back with us.<eos> - Yes, sir. Her bags left on the 11:19.<eos> You have them picked up at Idlewild and delivered to...<eos> - Uh, the Montclair Hotel?<eos> - Is that your favorite?<eos> - Well, I've never, uh, been in New York. Only for a few hours en route.<eos> - You better make that my suite at the St. Regis, Willard.<eos> - Very good, sir. It's reserved for visiting executives.
- Wait a minute.<eos> Where's the Bible? - Right here.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I've got a super idea.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - I got it over on 3rd Avenue for 75 cents.<eos> What is it?<eos> The eternal flame of the garden of the gods.<eos> August flame of the 10,000 mandarins, hark your humble servants.<eos> Come on. Kowtow to it.
- Yes, sir. Very good, sir.<eos> Alright, lads, keep it moving.<eos> We're next, boys. This is the blind spot.<eos> Even if those flaming officers ain't seen it, I bet the Zulus have.<eos> - Howarth, put your money up.<eos> - Are you stupid? What bloody good will it do you if you do win?<eos> We're all goners!<eos> Well, it don't matter if you lose!<eos> There's brandy in Reynolds' medical cabinet. Borrow some.<eos> - It's locked up.
You won't convince me that you're cynical.<eos> I know what these paintings mean to you.<eos> You are a perceptive woman.<eos> We're removing the paintings.<eos> - Pack them carefully.<eos> - Where are you taking them?<eos> - To a safe place.<eos> - But no place is as safe as Paris.<eos> The city has been declared open.<eos> It won't be bombed or shelled.
- Then presumably, it must go.<eos> - Yes, but it's a very revolutionary engine. This very latest six cylinder they have is something quite new...<eos> - Harnsworth, how nice to see you.<eos> - And very good to see you too, my lord.<eos> As always.<eos> You're interested in our new Phantom?<eos> Yes, I bought it.<eos> I don't like that decanter, Harnsworth.<eos> It's a deplorable shape.<eos> It shall be changed.
Signor Maltese, it is a Rolls-Royce.<eos> The best.<eos> Of course it's the best.<eos> You don't know a lady when you see one.<eos> It's got 20,000 miles in it.<eos> That is nothing for a Rolls-Royce.<eos> The last owner was a Maharajah.<eos> He ruined himself gambling at the San Remo casino.<eos> That is how we got the car.<eos> How much do you expect to get for it now?
Look, whatever she wrote this with wasn't dry, I-I put my thumb on it and smudged it.<eos> And this is her writing?<eos> Yes.<eos> And that smudge must have means that it was written just before we got it.<eos> Are you implying that your friend Carol is being held prisoner in this Palace?<eos> I assure you she is not.<eos> Are there any other buildings in vicinity?<eos> None. Except the disintegrator room.<eos> Where's that?<eos> Below the courtyard, it is rarely used now.
Please find them Barbara.<eos> A very capable human being.<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> Gentle, yet with strong determination and courage.<eos> I was about to...<eos> I was going to...<eos> I...<eos> I-I was going to say: why do you trust your people?<eos> Why do you want to make me doubt them?<eos> But trust can't be taken for granted, it must be earned.
Stop!<eos> Why do you offer insults to our guests?<eos> Why do you not give them the same food and drink that I am given?<eos> Who ordered this, the city Administrator?<eos> You will bring them the crystal water, and take the other away.<eos> Tell me, what exactly is the difference?<eos> In the yellow mountains which surround this city I discovered a pure spring, very unusual in this planet.<eos> I believe the water holds special qualities, so I have flagons of it stored for the use of the Elders.<eos> And this one?<eos> It is very well refined, we are very proud of our aqueduct.
We should be up there - another time, another galaxy.<eos> - Oh, we'll think of something.<eos> - How? Ian's playing chess with Marco.<eos> - Grandfather's being rude and sulking by himself.<eos> - Oh, I don't think he's sulking, is he?<eos> Well, he won't eat.<eos> He won't even talk to me.<eos> Well, you know him better than I do.<eos> I'd have said he was just feeling defenceless.<eos> He has a wonderful machine, capable of all sorts of miracles, and it is taken away from him by a man he calls a primitive.
Yes, that seed over there by the chair.<eos> Take it over to the table so that we can all see it. And wrap that round it when you do it.<eos> Doctor!<eos> Er!<eos> Shh-sh. I think it's working.<eos> Splendid, I think it's working, my boy!<eos> Doctor, look at that seed!<eos> Yes yes, we've done it!<eos> Yes, ha-ha ha-ha, we've done it, yes!<eos> Doctor, it's incredible, that seed, it's completely vanished!
Ask Tegana what?<eos> - How many bandits were there here last night?<eos> - Twelve.<eos> It was a cold night.<eos> Didn't they light a fire?<eos> If they had Ian, the remains would still be visible.<eos> Doctor?<eos> - Well?<eos> - Barbara may have told you that we're leaving here tomorrow, so get all the rest you can today.<eos> You may use your caravan again, but before we leave in the morning, it will be locked, and the key handed over to me.
Oh, come now, Tarron, we're not dealing in magic here.<eos> It's obvious to me the key must have been taken from this room.<eos> No, every person that came in here was checked by the auzer-ray scanner as they went out.<eos> If anyone had the key on them, the scanner would've detected it.<eos> Supposing the murderer hid the key on the body?<eos> The body was searched, it wasn't there.<eos> Then would you mind telling us what happened after the alarm bell went, please?<eos> Well, the relief guard was the first to reach the outside of the door.<eos> He was joined almost immediately by the controller and a guardian who was on patrol outside.<eos> And when I reached the door, it was opened and, well, you know what we found inside.
Get out. Aydan...<eos> I don't want people prying into my affairs.<eos> Has she been asking questions about me?<eos> Not as many as my grandfather will ask when he calls you as witness.<eos> Get out!<eos> You heard me, get out!<eos> I thought you might like to know that we know where the key is hidden.<eos> But you couldn't know where it is, I...<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you know where it's hidden because Chesterton told you where he hid it.
Not there!<eos> We have no alternative.<eos> Is this what you saw, Susan?<eos> Yes, but they seem so like-life.<eos> These must be the demons that Vasor talked about.<eos> Well, they're certainly the stuff that make legends.<eos> Look, right in the middle of the ice.<eos> There's the key!<eos> Yes.<eos> It couldn't be better protected, could it?
You know what I mean! - You. Sir, are the one who's pretending.<eos> Let me explain...<eos> There is a statuette of Buddha called the Jade Statuette.<eos> - The Jade Statuette?<eos> - Centuries ago, it resided in an Imperial Temple in Siam.<eos> It's a statuette made completely of the greenish gemstone.<eos> Hidden inside is something that will seal the fate of the million-koku fief of Kaga.<eos> - Where is the statuette?<eos> - That I cannot tell you.<eos> It's been safely hidden somewhere.
- You're well informed.<eos> - What is it that you want?<eos> - Chisa's been kidnapped by Gohei.<eos> Sacrificing her?<eos> Hey! - It's got nothing to do with me.<eos> - You can't hide anything anymore.<eos> Chisa's a spy for you, and Zeniya Gohei is alive.<eos> - Zeniya...? That's ridiculous!<eos> - Don't bother to pretend ignorance, I know the whole story.<eos> The invoice that proves you were involved in smuggling, is a death warrant if the Shogunate gets it.
You may fall and hurt yourself.<eos> I wouldn't ! I'm a son of the hills, the wind, and a samurai !<eos> That's perfect.<eos> Did that Yoshioka's son, Denshichiro, hold the peony in his hand ?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And ?<eos> He just threw it back to me.<eos> He didn't look to see how the flower was cut ?<eos> Not at all.<eos> He didn't comment at all on how it was cut ?
We'll have no home we'll sleep under staircases and on the roadsides in the dirty ditches.<eos> We'll sleep in the streets but we'll always be together.<eos> Calm yourself, Michele.<eos> You read the letter...<eos> The one locked in the desk...<eos> The agreement they made...<eos> She can't sell the property.<eos> What if they don't come home maybe they'll have an accident?<eos> Let's not think about them anymore.<eos> What happens when a letter doesn't arrive and there's proof it was mailed and the person didn't get it?
My name's Miller.<eos> I'm the designer. This is Miss Little.<eos> How do you do, Mara Little? What can we do for you?<eos> Well, I was looking for Mr. Allen Marling's missing ceramic.<eos> Oh, yes, I heard there was a chap broke into the lab yesterday.<eos> Yes. He laid me out. Oh, but he didn't get the tile.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - It had been pinched already, another one substituted it in its place.<eos> There's, uh, another explanation, Mr. Steed, if you're interested. Of course, yes.<eos> It never was stolen and never could be. It just didn't exist.
Anyway, marvelous. How do you do?<eos> Call me, Bert, thank you, how do you do? So you what...<eos> Oh, what does he think? Do you know something about this letter do you?<eos> He thinks the same as you do, that Davis has no reason to kill himself.<eos> So you think that Davis was murdered, too? Yes, I do.<eos> Have you any idea who might have killed him? - No.<eos> - I'm off.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - To spray my throat.<eos> What's the matter with it? Nothing, I'm just gonna spray it.
Well, who would want to kill a man like him? That's what I want to find out...<eos> Why his notes were stolen, the tape recording he was working on destroyed.<eos> Now, he was making a very important observation last night. He went to the Ministry of Science six months ago and said that in 15 months, the white dwarf would re-enter our solar system.<eos> That give us nine months to go.<eos> Now last night, he was going to confirm or deny those calculations.<eos> Do you know what the return of the white dwarf would mean?<eos> It'd go for the sun, wouldn't it?<eos> A thimble full of white dwarf matter weighs a thousand tons, according to our standards.<eos> It has more gravitational pull than anything else in the universe.<eos> You're right, it would go for the sun, but it would take us with it.
Sure, it's their fault. Go to bed. It's late.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Thank you. Very kind of you.<eos> Blessed mother.<eos> Here are the keys. One for the apartment and one for the front door.<eos> Good. By the way, I couldn't open the bathroom door.<eos> It's a little tricky.<eos> Come and I'll show you how it works.<eos> When you open it, you have to hit it hard. Then give it a push, see?
What about that key?<eos> To the apartment.<eos> Matches mine exactly.<eos> I bet you don't really need those.<eos> You need them.<eos> This still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth a quarter of a million dollars either.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> - What?<eos> - The tooth powder.<eos> - What about it?
One hundred thousand men led by Marc Antony.<eos> Octavian is no fool. He won't fight.<eos> He'll have to, instantly, on the spot where they land.<eos> Rome will not declare war against you.<eos> I do not agree.<eos> I have not asked for your opinion.<eos> Not for some time. Not since I doubted the necessity of building 300 ships.<eos> The way to prevent war is to be ready for it.<eos> Have 300 warships ever been built for war without war?<eos> We shall have what we want without it.
The scar.<eos> You see, I know all about you from your file.<eos> You do?<eos> I hope you're not disappointed.<eos> I will tell you in the morning.<eos> We are now approaching the most interesting corner of St. Sofia including these two great red porphyry columns, stolen and brought from Egypt.<eos> In front of them the alabaster urn was brought from Bergama a famous historical city near Smyrna.<eos> It dates back from the Alexander the Great period.<eos> About 1 648 Sultan Murad iv brought it from Bergama.<eos> It was used as an ablution fountain.
Who then will feed the unhappy people whom the church still supports?<eos> What will be done to placate that desperate horde?<eos> They will be given one piece of your land, then another, finally all of it.<eos> Our Lord healed the physically blind, but what about the mentally blind?<eos> We're not mentally blind, dear Father. Just human beings in a world of radical change.<eos> What must we do?<eos> The church has been given an explicit promise of immortality.<eos> We, as a social class, have not. A palliative that promises us another hundred years is the same as eternity.<eos> Beyond what we can caress with our hands we have no obligations.<eos> The church must have obligations, because it is destined not to die.
Did you see the headlines in the papers today?<eos> Third victim of The Executioner Of London But Scotland Yard is baffled<eos> How far have you gotten in your investigations on the first 2 cases?<eos> These executions are carried out with such absolute perfection and ingenuity, sir That I'm completely bewildered..<eos> No clues no evidence, nothing we can use as a starting point..<eos> I'm disappointed in you, inspector Hillier<eos> There's one thing that I know for sure<eos> The executions were performed with the same rope, in every case..<eos> With the same rope, what rope do you mean?<eos> It's an executioners rope Stolen from our criminal museum, where it was displayed
There's one thing that I know for sure<eos> The executions were performed with the same rope, in every case..<eos> With the same rope, what rope do you mean?<eos> It's an executioners rope Stolen from our criminal museum, where it was displayed<eos> The rope was hanging here..<eos> Do you mean to say, that rope was stolen with the express purpose of hanging someone with it?<eos> Yes commissioner<eos> Then it's even more scandalous!<eos> Where is that rope?<eos> It's being brought here..
Do you mean to say, that rope was stolen with the express purpose of hanging someone with it?<eos> Yes commissioner<eos> Then it's even more scandalous!<eos> Where is that rope?<eos> It's being brought here..<eos> As I was going through the archives this morning.. I noticed that one of the window panes had been broken<eos> The iron bars had been sawn through<eos> Nothing was stolen,<eos> Only the hangman's rope, which was displayed there<eos> It was presented to the museum, as a historical item Because so many criminals were hanged with it at Tyburn and Pentonville
You cant use other departments failures, as an excuse for your own...<eos> That's not my idea, but I beg you, to give me another assignment...<eos> You're crazy!<eos> Why are you setting me, on the executioner?<eos> You took me off the girl-murder-case to chase this hangman-murderer...<eos> I cant get any further, chief-inspector...<eos> Give the assignment to some one else, and give me the girl-murders back...<eos> No way, you will stay on this case..<eos> And the rope stays here...<eos> Let's see if it gets stolen again...
Or what's worse, borrowed..<eos> Hillier, I'm counting on you, to see that this doesn't become public..<eos> They wont hear a word about this, from me..<eos> I might as well tell you now.. We've offered a reward for information leading to the executioner's arrest<eos> The largest reward ever offered...<eos> What do you think of that?<eos> It should have been done, long ago<eos> - Yes, perhaps you're right..<eos> What should I do with the rope, now?<eos> It mustn't be used again, to execute another man..
What's this "cut out" talk?<eos> -Out, baby. Out!<eos> -Don't call me baby.<eos> -Quit arguing!<eos> -Will ya come on?<eos> -What's that?<eos> -What was that?<eos> -That's it.<eos> -Sounded like a chest.<eos> I wonder what's in it.
All right!<eos> All right, you'll see. You'll see.<eos> Get on alphabetical.<eos> I'm Benjy.<eos> Quit stepping on my head!<eos> Get on the ladder.<eos> Don't leave me!<eos> Come back here!<eos> You can't leave me!<eos> There's too many men on it to control it.
- Oh... come here.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - It's your ear.<eos> - Stop it, darling.<eos> - The tea will get cold, darling.<eos> - I know.<eos> Come in!<eos> - A letter for you, sir. - For me?<eos> But that's impossible.<eos> No, it's addressed to you, the English gentleman, the Grand Hotel.
You do not want it?<eos> Do not take it.<eos> Step over it and go get another one.<eos> A piece of pie?<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> I wanted to build it myself.<eos> Those people help you and all is well.<eos> I don't want any help.<eos> I wanted to build it myself.<eos> That way it would be built slowly and carefully.
- Why didn't I think of that?<eos> - Looks like Birnbaum's is open.<eos> Maybe somebody in here will know.<eos> So there you are, Sheriff.<eos> I told you, you were headed for trouble.<eos> Trouble?<eos> I wanna know by whose authority you let those Indians stay in town.<eos> Those savages are wards of the government, and I am the representative...<eos> I told Sheriff Lord that he could put them up down by the clay slide.<eos> Because the town's named after him, he thinks he owns it.
I'm against it.<eos> It's dishonest, indecent. It's taking money under false pretenses.<eos> How much you gonna ask for ?<eos> Half a million dollars.<eos> Peanuts to the Americans.<eos> Prof. Kokintz appears to be opening another bottle.<eos> ¶ Would you have the goodness to rephrase that question, sir ?<eos> Forgive me, but I'm something of a new boy press-conference-wise.<eos> Has the rocket achieved its objective ?<eos> I'm happy to say we've landed on the moon where it's supposed to, target-wise.
Buy a beach pass, and rent a changing room for the entire season.<eos> Throw some big tips around.<eos> I need you to be on good terms with the staff.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Here is your key and your ticket.<eos> Make yourself at home.<eos> The window looks out right on the pool.<eos> That will be our emergency entrance.<eos> But what's most important is the plumbing inspection trap.<eos> Make sure it's not locked. If it is, open it.
I guess everyone has at least one redeeming quality.<eos> Yes.<eos> Good morning, Your Highness.<eos> Hair of the dog.<eos> - May I present Madame Clouseau.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - This is my Americanized nephew George.<eos> - Yes. We met at the bar last night.<eos> - How is your cough?<eos> - Oh, it's completely gone. Thank you.
I brung vittles for your stomach and a beverage to wet your whistle.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> I had a bad night.<eos> Well, I'm sorely troubled at the news, ma'am, but, well, you've just got to keep up your strength.<eos> Now, there be the juice of the orange and a bowl of porridge and milk for pouring onto the porridge, it being a mite too thick to drink and too thin to plow.<eos> I'm too sick to get it down.<eos> Well, now, you can't tell till you've tried.<eos> Pretend they're battercakes, the kind you favor, made with bread crumbs, buttermilk and soda.<eos> You know, it reminds me of the time I had my first battercake out of a box.<eos> Readymade, they called it.
Thank you, dear.<eos> It was made out of her pappy's hair.<eos> Her pappy's hair?<eos> Yes'm.<eos> When my grandma's pappy died, her ma cut off a lock of his hair and wove it into this keepsake.<eos> She made three teardrops out of that fine, black hair, then she bound it in glass and tied it with a silver cord.<eos> You know, she worked a whole year for a silversmith in Natchez to make it into this breastpin.<eos> And then she wore it the rest of her life as a mourning pin, to mourn her man that was gone.<eos> But my grandma said that the mourning's long since gone out of it and that it would bring good luck.<eos> Good luck because the only thing left in it was love.
I don't like the night.<eos> I want to be free of it.<eos> You are free.<eos> Only in here, in this holy place.<eos> No, everywhere with me.<eos> You must come away with me now.<eos> No, I can't, not until-<eos> Until what?<eos> The crypt.<eos> It must be destroyed, and with it the dead.
Let's go.<eos> We're done.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Have mercy!<eos> Mercy!<eos> So as soon as you heard screaming... you ran upstairs and broke down the door.<eos> Yes.<eos> But I wasn't alone, you know.<eos> The neighbors came running too.<eos> We tried pushing on the door, but it was locked.
I still swear at me I saw you play this song.<eos> It was indeed your face, you wear the same dress, your hands on the keys as I have seen.<eos> As if I had known dice your birth, or even before.<eos> Yes, I believe have felt the same.<eos> But without us ever being seen before tonight.<eos> We arrived there, Mr. Maule?<eos> you know that the house undergoes a curse?<eos> Hannah told me.<eos> you she also said that who voted against the Pyncheon,<eos> Matthew Maule, was buried beneath it?
- Thank you.<eos> You are the daughter.<eos> - I'll hang it for you.<eos> - No thank you.<eos> I'll do it myself.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - I can do this myself.<eos> It's good exercise.<eos> Your house was once a gambling place?<eos> Yes, of Yakuza, but 5 years ago it was taken by Sakichi's heir.
What's the verdict?<eos> No fracture.<eos> Oh, that's a relief.<eos> Well, there, you see? Everybody should have a little wartime souvenir in their head.<eos> Nothing like a little metal plate to prevent nasty fractures.<eos> Your funny husband has a funny way of joking about that plate.<eos> I wonder what a psychiatrist would say about that.<eos> He'd say overcompensation if he was any good, and he'd be right, too.<eos> Whole thing scares me silly.<eos> If it ever got jarred loose- well, there's not much chance of that happening.
Grandpa, mel's been a friend of ours for years.<eos> He and doug went to college together.<eos> You've met him. I've met lots of people. But i don't let them tinker with my head.<eos> Sam, no one's going to tinker with your head.<eos> All we're suggesting is that you see mel and talk to him.<eos> Well, why do i need to see a psychiatrist?<eos> Well, your preoccupation with the clock, for instance.<eos> I'm fond of my clock and that makes me crazy.<eos> My, what a strange world we live in.<eos> You have to admit you spend a lot of time with it. Sometimes half the night.
What is your name?<eos> - My name is Kanbei.<eos> - We haven't met before, have we?<eos> No, this is the first time.<eos> So I don't know you.<eos> But I've heard your name mentioned somewhere.<eos> The boss in that town is called Kanbei.<eos> That name sets me on edge.<eos> Ichi, I thought you'd already left.<eos> I stayed in this room last year, so I have a fondness for it and just wandered in.
Isn't that precisely what you're doing at this moment? I'm trying to forestall trouble for you.<eos> You think I'm going to give under the strain, so you want to buy me out yourself.<eos> Well, if you sell out now, there won't be any strain, will there?<eos> I feel I'm about to be made another proposition.<eos> You do like to get to the point quickly, don't you?<eos> All right, 45 shillings a share.<eos> The brigadier offered me 45 and 6 and a much better seduction scene.<eos> I think I can get the brigadier to agree to 46 shillings.<eos> It'll cost you a lot of money.<eos> We can raise it out of company funds.
The kind we can't get out of.<eos> Here is the deed to P3 and the house, already signed. Bank accounts, power of attorney and the schedule for the boys.<eos> What? I'm not gonna take that.<eos> Dad, you have to.<eos> We need you to.<eos> You're all we have.<eos> We can't explain everything.<eos> You just need to know this is our only choice.<eos> Please!<eos> For them.
It's.... Don't bother.<eos> You scared me. I thought we were busted.<eos> What are you gonna be if you don't change back?<eos> What are you doing? Apparently having an identity crisis.<eos> Oh! So it's ok for you to change your husband into...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> It's the jingling in my head.<eos> Does that mean the Elders know she's alive?<eos> No, they can't.<eos> We clocked ourselves from them.
I was gonna get back to you from the car.<eos> I have dinner plans.<eos> Oh, sounds vaguely familiar, doesn't it?<eos> Me waitin' to hear from you, you off with your wife.<eos> Different city.<eos> Different wife, but still...<eos> The FBI hadn't gotten back to me on our Jane Doe's prints.<eos> - That could take a week. - Maybe not.<eos> I got a lot of friends there.<eos> But not hearin' from them makes the firearm analysis more important.
Lollipop?<eos> Looks more like an all-day sucker to me.<eos> All right, I would appreciate if we could remember that this girl's a murder victim, and, unfortunately,<eos> Strawberry Lollipop is all we have to call her at the moment.<eos> Now, uh, inside her web site, she had a booking program, and on the computer from her house, we got a calendar.<eos> Now, in december, she had 65 clients. In january, 71, february, 68.<eos> Then in march, miss Lollipop moves into her new house and drops to 25 clients.<eos> She was down to her regulars.<eos> Which is why we have to interview these men first.<eos> 5 of them are over 6-feet, 3 of whom have been dubbed by the LAPD brass as VIPs.
I don't really need your permission, Jillian, but i was hoping for your support.<eos> Don't worry about Keith. He'll just be looking at a monitor.<eos> It's very important that we make sure we have the right man.<eos> Just promise me that if he gets upset, you won't make him continue.<eos> I promise.<eos> Now you stay close by and check in in a couple hours.<eos> That'll give me some time to see if i can't pull some strings at family court, maybe push up your custody hearing, ok?<eos> - Ok.<eos> - Ok. Thank you.<eos> Ok, so some men are gonna show up on the tv, and i want you to tell me if you've seen any of them before.
Do you remember her at all?<eos> I remember a girl but I thought she was my invisible friend<eos> Something a child makes up, I never thought she could be real<eos> Well we'll need to take a swab<eos> Test your DNA against our baby Jane Doe<eos> So the girl you found in the river,<eos> - she could've been my sister<eos> - It's possible<eos> What about your parents?<eos> Do you remember them?
Your mom have any trouble there?<eos> Talk about problems with anyone?<eos> Oh, no, my mother never complained.<eos> Especially in her up moods.<eos> Her world was sunshine and roses.<eos> I read on the internet bipolar people can have full-on hallucinations.<eos> So she might not have seen a dangerous situation for what it was.<eos> You know, the day we committed her, that was definitely true.<eos> What didn't she see that day?<eos> The lunatics crawling up the walls, she was sharing with them.
Roger, I wanna talk to you about a guy you were in prison with, Carl Burton?<eos> Wound up dead, shot Right after you guys got back<eos> I remember / Comin' home it had to be hard to adust<eos> It made me realize any day I wake up with a doorknob on the inside of the door, it's a good day<eos> Maybe someone else didn't see it that way, came back angry, wanting to settle a score?<eos> Everyone has a breaking point<eos> Carl reached his over there<eos> I didn't respect it but I understood<eos> Hard to imagine all the POWs did<eos> We were like brothers, John, one of them went after Carl, I would've know
And you're right?<eos> I'll prove it.<eos> I'm with your cousin.<eos> And he's with about 10 other girls, too.<eos> Don't you wanna be special?<eos> I wanna see Miguel.<eos> Probably up there with one of them now.<eos> You shut up, Jesus.<eos> Maeve Bubley was partying with the man who's killing off her kids?<eos> The same night one of them gets dead.
You four-eyed loser!<eos> That's what the jocks used to call you in high school!<eos> - Or don't you remember?<eos> - For real?<eos> I'm not talking to you, so shut the hell up!<eos> You think getting contacts changes who you were?<eos> makes you their friend now?<eos> their brother?<eos> You used to hate guys like this, guys who beat you up in gym class every day.<eos> You were better than them.
- Okay, I got it. I got it.<eos> - You know, we pre-shot that tag.<eos> Yours is the last scene. I'll come and get you.<eos> - Thank you. - Okay ?<eos> One for the money, two for the money, three for the money !<eos> - One more !<eos> - Wait, wait !<eos> We must have tequila !<eos> The least he could've done was keep the writers here to laugh.<eos> Sweetie, you don't need them.
Three,two,you're on,ma'am<eos> Good evening<eos> This morning I was informed that nine agents working for the drug enforcement administration were murdered in san pasquale<eos> We have accumulated compelling evidence that San Pasquale's dictator General Joseph Sanchez personally ordered the execions<eos> Using information provided by the D.E.A. Agents I have ordered our armed forces in conjunction with the D.E.A To destroy coca fields in san pasquale and all known cocaine labs in the country<eos> This will happen in the next few hours<eos> Our fight is not with the people of San Pasquale<eos> It is not my desire to destroy an agriculture that has many positive purposes so we will destroy 25% of the fields... looks like she listened to you ...For the time being<eos> We will not tolerate a government in our hemisphere that is complicit with drug lords... that's not in there ...A government killing our agents and killing our children with their poisonous drug trafficking<eos> Until there is a new government in san pasquale which fights drug lords instead of conspiring with them we will continue to act to protect our children
Really, Lily? That's so--<eos> Darling, did you read?<eos> The bastards are opening another nuclear power plant in West Orange?<eos> I know, mom.<eos> It's horrible.<eos> Not now, Olivia.<eos> I'm entertaining.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> They are popping up like weeds.<eos> But I am one step ahead of them now though.
I got trouble man.<eos> Serious trouble.<eos> Don't tell me to relax, damn it !<eos> I ran into a detective I know last night.<eos> Freddy saw it.<eos> I'll meet you at 8 :00.<eos> Nothing more we can do here until the third victim turns up.<eos> I'm guessing there's a connection to him.<eos> He doesn't want that victim identified.<eos> Have Garcia go through open files in Maryland, see if any of them involve this level of torture.
Secret groups?<eos> People you see you don't know much about people who stay to themselves mostly.<eos> This is a very religious area.<eos> Church on sundays, fellowship on wednesday, bible classes.<eos> If there was a secret group, I'd probably know about it.<eos> That's an inherent contradiction.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> He means if there was a group being secretive you probably wouldn't know.<eos> Look, people out here just want a quiet place to raise their kids.<eos> What I know is none of them are capable of doing this.
Bombings occurred within 3 miles of each other.<eos> First victim was a 74-year-old widow, Barbara Keller.<eos> 2 hours after that, Clurman got hit in his driveway, and 45 minutes later... well, we all saw that.<eos> Jill Swenson, 34-year-old housewife who lived across the street from Clurman.<eos> Of the 3, only Clurman survived.<eos> Was there any connection between the victims?<eos> One. Clurman was a partner in a $10-million condo development deal in which Keller was an investor, and a few weeks ago, the whole deal went bust.<eos> Went bust how?<eos> Geologists discovered that the land was on methane, the condos never got built, the land became worthless, and Clurman lost a lot of people and a lot of money.<eos> So maybe one of them was mad enough to take aim at Clurman.
Did your dad grieve when your mother died ?<eos> No.<eos> He was too angry.<eos> At God ?<eos> At me.<eos> Why was he angry at you ?<eos> Because he thinks I killed my mother.<eos> Is Marty in there ?<eos> Yes, he's just standing in her room, staring into space.<eos> It's hard on the residents when one of them passes.
- Don't I have rights?<eos> Like she's not gonna try to escape.<eos> Except I can never escape the Doctor so where's the danger?<eos> I wonder if you could do it.<eos> To sit with a creature you're about to kill and take supper.<eos> - How strong is your stomach?<eos> - Strong enough.<eos> I wonder.<eos> I've seen you fight your enemies.<eos> Now dine with them.
- Nancy sent me. - Nancy?<eos> That means you must have been asking about the bomb.<eos> Yes.<eos> What do you know about it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Why I was asking.<eos> What do you know?<eos> Only what it's done.<eos> These people were all caught up in the blast?<eos> None of them were.
- Come, march with us.<eos> - Oh, Glory!<eos> We need bodies.<eos> All of you, dead.<eos> The human race, dead.<eos> Gwyneth, stop them!<eos> Send them back, now!<eos> Three more bodies!<eos> Convert them!<eos> Make them vessels for the Gelth!
Thanks.<eos> GCS is up from 4 to 1 1 . He's blinking on command, starting to move his fingers.<eos> See, sometimes you're good and then sometimes you're lucky.<eos> -Which one is this?<eos> -This is " sometimes you're not sure. "<eos> morris: We're waiting on icu.<eos> Good, good.<eos> Hey. Why don't you go bring his kid in?<eos> You know, patients come and go.<eos> And some days, some of them don't even register to me.
Anything else?<eos> If we don't get our patient-satisfaction scores up we can't start pursuing HMO contracts.<eos> - Okay, who's low?<eos> - Ray, Neela, Morris.<eos> - Abby's the only one with a decent score.<eos> - Even Pratt's on the low end.<eos> Pratt's okay with the patients. It's the other doctors he has a problem with.<eos> Need the room for a brachial artery laceration, 10 minutes out.<eos> And Neela brings up the rear with a score of 2.21.<eos> If we wanna make our patients happier, we need to teach our residents to connect with them better.
-Eve was gonna give you the boot.<eos> Now she'll probably let you stay, just out of pity.<eos> Hold still.<eos> -Yeah, that's gonna burn a little.<eos> It got a little tricky, but he's a tough kid.<eos> He's gonna be just fine.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> I'll come find you guys when I have more details.<eos> -Got a thing for the boys in blue, huh?<eos> -Oh, no. I know half of them.
At least some things stay the same.<eos> We should really get back.<eos> Have you always been such a worrier?<eos> I've always had things to worry about.<eos> Do you think this was God?<eos> What?<eos> Me waking up.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You think it was science, don't you?<eos> I've seen deeply religious people come into the hospital. Prayer did nothing for them. And then I've seen plenty of skeptics...
Turner.<eos> What brings you to this dump site?<eos> -Change of scenery.<eos> -Yeah, that's what I was after, too.<eos> Only it wasn't the landscape I got sick of.<eos> At least there aren't as many of them up here.<eos> Seems like everywhere you go... humans are getting to be an endangered species.<eos> I know what you mean.<eos> Bad enough you can't walk down the street... without some freak show scaring the hell out of your kids.<eos> Now the government's making treaties with them.
Nice work, E.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I would rather quit the business than to do more shit that I don't love.<eos> I've done that.<eos> And you know what, it sucks.<eos> I was only partially joking about Neil Labute, Ari.<eos> I'll go do a play.<eos> I'd rather do a play than this bullshit.<eos> Don't forget, I came from nothing.<eos> As much as I love the toys, I don't need them.
Do you want somebody who's cute, funny and cuddly?<eos> Or somebody who's bitter, out of work and losing his hair by the minute?<eos> - I'm not losing my hair.<eos> - Yeah, you are.<eos> Guys, I believe in love.<eos> And love has no face, and no weight... definitely no receding hairline.<eos> Look, I want to talk to you both about something.<eos> Best friends should treat each other with loyalty and respect.<eos> They should never compete for the same woman.<eos> Because even if one of them wins, then they both lose.
Kind of random.<eos> You can have the kitchen back.<eos> By the way, I signed up for Valley Rentals today.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah. It's time I move out of here.<eos> I can be out of here within the next month if I find something.<eos> That sounds fine.<eos> No, I haven't heard from him yet.<eos> Well, look, he's got a lot of friends in this city.<eos> Maybe he stayed with one of them. I wouldn't be too worried about it.
I really was not expecting an open bar.<eos> Top-shelf booze, I tell you.<eos> And this guy knew his stuff.<eos> I don't think it's a gay drink.<eos> Mojito!<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Well, it's been great to meet you all. And I am looking forward to getting to know you while we're here.<eos> - Dude, put your pants on.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Well, I really like all the guys. But some of them seem a little too competitive.
Who wants to move on up?<eos> Hi, I'm Gavin MacLeod and I established the Church of Captain Stubing.<eos> Who wants to come on board?<eos> Hi, I'm Kirk Cameron!<eos> You here to convert people to the Church of Mike Seaver?<eos> No. I'm here to convert people to Christianity.<eos> Well, he was on Growing Pains.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Everybody's gone!<eos> People are always looking for the next voice to tell them what to do.
I got paged for the midnight to 8 shift, and i really... well, in that case, there is something that i have to do tonight that i forgot to tell you.<eos> Well, it's a little extreme.<eos> 3 little boys need my help.<eos> 3 dead boys.<eos> You're gonna spend the night in a haunted house... the bush.<eos> Your plant.<eos> A haunted house alone?<eos> I feel like i'm in a john carpenter film.<eos> I'll probably sleep better there than here with party boy.<eos> And if the inn is destroyed with them in it, they'll be earthbound forever.
What?<eos> Baby, you lost me at carrots... which, by the way, was the first draft of "You had me at hello."<eos> You had me at what?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I see we've entered the no-humor zone.<eos> Just relax. I'm gonna take care of everything.<eos> - The ducks!<eos> - The ducks will be fine.<eos> They're lying in a pan with their heads chopped off. So the worst part is behind them.
- Oh, come on.<eos> Not again.<eos> - Cowards. Oh, hey!<eos> Remember, people, only pet the dog with your non-watch hand.<eos> In case you don't remember, watches cause him to freak out, jump up on the counter and kick my once-working toaster across the room.<eos> - Your muffins.<eos> - My what? You left me an urgent message about needing muffins.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Muffins, boys.<eos> - These were for them?
Salad!<eos> Good boy, good boy.<eos> Oh, shoot.<eos> I'm out of treats.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Hey, you know those guys are here to work.<eos> You don't have to put a USO show on for them.<eos> I know.<eos> I just want them to have a good time.<eos> Half of them have seen you naked.
I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> It's called cobedding.<eos> Hospitals sometimes do it with twins when one of them is sick.<eos> And the other one gets... better?<eos> - It helps.<eos> - How?<eos> We don't really know.<eos> Sometimes babies get stressed in the I.C.U.S from all the activity.<eos> This way, there's someone there to comfort them, to be there with them.
If you could just... sign this consent form for the autopsy -- just a formality.<eos> The thing people forget is how good it can feel when you finally set secrets free.<eos> Whether good or bad, at least they're out in the open... like it or not.<eos> George, I want you to understand -- when we started dating, I was already kind of seeing someone.<eos> I didn't know how much I'd like you, and when I realized, I broke it off with the other guy -- Other guy?<eos> Who's the other guy?<eos> George! George, back off!<eos> Alex!<eos> George! Back off, Alex.<eos> And once your secrets are out in the open, you don't have to hide behind them anymore.
I'm head.<eos> Poor David.<eos> I think he had a soft spot for you.<eos> Yeah, well. I guess we'll never know.<eos> You're just like your father.<eos> What?<eos> Wise, witty and ridiculously good looking?<eos> No, macho, arrogant and very possessive.<eos> So, who's the weakest?<eos> We for having the flaws, or you for coming back to them all?
We are all finding Cassie's disappearance very hard.<eos> I mean it really feels like we're just not going to see her again.<eos> Not that that's what people are saying but I can't help but think, and it sounds selfish,<eos> ...but it could have been me.<eos> I understand.<eos> I knew you would.<eos> That's why is so important for me to see you.<eos> Do you talk to your friends?<eos> Yes, of course but it's not really the same.<eos> I mean... and I don't mean this in an arrogant way but I just... I feel that I am somehow older than them.
I know exactly what he's doing. He's using us to run clinical trials.<eos> Oh, shame on him, saving lives like that.<eos> It's unethical.<eos> Oh, are you coming in too?<eos> I thought I had you convinced.<eos> Clinical trials save thousands of lives.<eos> He's using patients as guinea pigs.<eos> Pharmaceutical companies do that every day.<eos> Are we a pharmaceutical company?<eos> We're gonna wind up pressuring desperate patients... into choices that are bad for them, good for us. We're gonna compromise patient care.
Hand-wringing? Torment?<eos> You want him to cry himself to sleep at night? Yeah!<eos> Yeah, I want some clue that he knows it's a big deal.<eos> That it scares him, that it matters.<eos> Whoa, whoa. What's that?<eos> It was a stroke.<eos> - Well done, Cameron.<eos> - House called it.<eos> The arm and legs are unrelated.<eos> Oh, you make enough calls, one of them is bound to be right.
Not unless she's been competing in the nude all these years.<eos> Then what are you thinking?<eos> What do the balloons mean?<eos> What if the rash isn't a rash?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Who gave her the balloons?<eos> Some of the girls from her team.<eos> They've been visiting her pretty regularly, but none of them are sick.<eos> What about the guys?<eos> None of them are sick either.
When someone asks you if you're a god, you say "yes!"<eos> And I'm saving the best for last.<eos> Do you want these?<eos> I hate olives.<eos> She hates olives!<eos> Awesome!<eos> The olive theory.<eos> The olive theory is based on my friends marshall and lilly.<eos> He hates olives, she loves them.<eos> In a weird way, that's what makes them such a great couple.
You were partly right.<eos> Gary Holt is attracted to vulnerability.<eos> Men, women, they're erotic for him as long as they feel powerless.<eos> They all seem to be into that stuff.<eos> But Gary was the only one to touch someone's scars.<eos> - That's significant.<eos> - A suicide fetish.<eos> I want Gary under 24-hour surveillance.<eos> Already got two undercovers en route.<eos> Join them, Danny.
That's ridiculous.<eos> No, it's understandable.<eos> They gave up.<eos> You fought like hell.<eos> You didn't need anybody to save you.<eos> - You didn't need anyone's help.<eos> - Should I be ashamed of that? No.<eos> You were brave, but the bravest thing these people ever did<eos> - That was their mistake.<eos> See how well it worked out for them?
All are in very short supply.<eos> I'm here with Terrence Gale from the Florida Department of Health.<eos> Can you tell me, in situations like this, should we expect things to get worse before they get better ?<eos> Well, with so much displacement, we're always concerned about disease.<eos> But that's why these relief centers are so important.<eos> Because they can provide a ration of hope for families who have been forced out of their homes and allow them to get food or medicine or whatever they would require.<eos> How do you keep up with demand ?<eos> Access is the greatest challenge.<eos> - I've visited most of these places...<eos> You're one of them !
Hey, Russ.<eos> What brings you out of the jungle at this hour?<eos> Did you authorize the military to enter the park?<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> A military vehicle passed by my place tonight, and I just found a guy out there that was pretty messed up-<eos> Air Force.<eos> I found his dog tags.<eos> I don't control the military, Russ.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> But you are working with them now, aren't you?
What is wrong with you?<eos> - No. You're not following.<eos> If Murray was looking for the weakest he could find, it wouldn't have been Charlie.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because Charlie was a bit of a psychopath.<eos> When he got excited, his face would turn purple and he'd start biting things.<eos> I don't think Murray would've put his dick anywhere near him.<eos> - What about the McPoyle brothers?<eos> - They were prime real estate.<eos> - I'm sure he went to town on them.
I just... but every time I get behind the wheel and I try to turn the key, I can't.<eos> I just keep seeing your face.<eos> It's ok.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> The guy died clutching the safe deposit box key.<eos> What was in the box ?<eos> My guess, cash, jewelry, you know, the standard stuff of murders.<eos> The DA's getting it tomorrow.<eos> And the brothers didn't know ?<eos> One of them is dead and they didn't even know why they were fighting ?
Sorry, we're just crew guys.<eos> I mean, that place is a little fancy for us.<eos> Really?<eos> Because beers are only, like, $22 over there.<eos> Movie sets are so weird. In TV, I'd always hang with the crew guys.<eos> That was my favorite part of the job.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm a crew guy, maybe I'll put in a good word.<eos> That'd be great.<eos> Let them know I'm a regular guy, just like them.
Let's see how many steps it takes to connect him to me.<eos> Uh, we did it on a boat.<eos> One!<eos> Well, let's go check these guys out.<eos> I'm a little nervous about this.<eos> Oh, no, you're going to do great.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, my God, there's so many of 'em!<eos> How do I know who to pick?<eos> I... I don't know anything about them.
He gambles a lot of money here.<eos> I'm afraid you're gonna have to set up shop somewhere else.<eos> Unfortunately, I have to do what's best for the casino.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> I usually work out of The Jubilee, but I have clients at all the hotels.<eos> Big-money clients.<eos> I convince them to gamble here, you keep track of how much business I bring in.<eos> I guarantee you, it'll be a lot more than Mr. James generates.<eos> And I'll stay with them, you know, even afterwards.
(announcer) ...different from your program.<eos> The track is fast, the turf is firm... the wind is calm, and we're currently at about 76 degrees.<eos> I need you to keep Bert and Betty busy because I gotta talk to the track officials... before the race begins, okay?<eos> Yeah, how?<eos> adies and gentlemen, five minutes to post.<eos> Don't forget the 8th race, an all-American... handicap with a $10,000 purse.<eos> Hi.<eos> This looks like a nice spot to watch the race.<eos> Race, Bert, not my breasts.<eos> We're gonna win this race because of them.
Well, all the girls in her grade were.<eos> But to be honest with you, I don't know which girls were doing it and which ones weren't.<eos> Well, who would know about Lisa?<eos> Ask Angela Agnelli.<eos> She was Lisa's best friend.<eos> The bracelets were just a stupid joke. We all wore them.<eos> I called them sex bracelets, and all of a sudden it was like this<eos> - big thing with the boys. - What boys?<eos> Just some guys in our class.<eos> They started calling us sluts because we weren't interested in them.
Practically every cute guy at school.<eos> The girl was on a mission.<eos> - And you weren't?<eos> - I'm more into girls.<eos> Lisa was for a while, too, when she got tired of boys.<eos> How long did that last?<eos> Until she started doing the older guys she met on the Internet.<eos> She wasn't scared of having sex with people that she didn't know?<eos> Why would she be?<eos> You chat with them online first, and you can check their profiles.
Aside from his anger issues, he's paranoid and unstable.<eos> Why is he in there without a parent?<eos> - They're on their way.<eos> - You're forgetting I used to be a cop.<eos> They're in there practically spoon-feeding him Self Defense.<eos> He's an underage suspect.<eos> You're manipulating the situation to get a confession out of an emotionally disturbed boy without an advocate in his corner.<eos> Captain, the kid's parents are here.<eos> Put 'em in my office.<eos> He needs them in there.
Mrs. Eldridge, how can we help you?<eos> I have the evidence that Carrie was raped.<eos> Is that a comforter?<eos> From her bed.<eos> That one has the bedsheets and the pillowcases.<eos> You can get all the DNA you need off them.<eos> And in this one, these are a bunch of emails that Carrie and Justin sent back and forth to each other.<eos> Did you read these emails?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> Do Carrie and Justin admit to having intercourse in any of them?
What bills could he have?<eos> Lawyers for his appeal, his storage locker.<eos> What storage locker?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> There's gotta be 100 baseball caps in here.<eos> Trophies.<eos> Each one from a different victim.<eos> You had no right to touch those.<eos> They gave 'em to me.<eos> To remember them by.
Not once. So nobody will ever tell us that they saw you talking to this girl, or even were in the same vicinity as she was?<eos> Why did you and Vanessa Serafino break up?<eos> Because you told her that I killed that girl.<eos> No, she called off the wedding long before I arrested you.<eos> I just can't remember why.<eos> Doesn't it have something to do with medical school? Yeah, that's it.<eos> You told her you were getting your medical degree at NYU.<eos> I was going to night school.<eos> You were pretending to be a medical student.<eos> I mean, how long did you think you were gonna pull that one off? You gonna pull people off the street, start performing surgery on them?
It was weeks before we found the radio tower.<eos> There's a radio tower on this island?<eos> Yes, up by the black rock.<eos> Some of us continued to search for the meaning of those numbers while we waited for rescue.<eos> But then the sickness came.<eos> When my team was gone, I went back, up to the tower and changed the transmission.<eos> - That distress signal we heard.<eos> - Yes.<eos> But the numbers...<eos> Did you ever find out anything about them?
Goodwin.<eos> I'm Ana Lucia.<eos> I heard that... you were the one who... pulled the dead bodies out of the water.<eos> Yes.<eos> Were any of them african-american?<eos> No.<eos> It's my wife... I can't find her.<eos> I will pray for her.<eos> Where the hell are the rescue planes?<eos> I will pray for them, too.
It's a big plane, Ana.<eos> Just because you didn't--<eos> No, I didn't see him either.<eos> And I'm pretty good with faces of the passengers, and I did not see him.<eos> Wait, you're not all serious.<eos> He never talks about himself-<eos> - Nathan.<eos> Every time I ask him anything, he just dodges.<eos> No.<eos> If he really were one of them, why would he still be here?
!<eos> - What do I pay taxes for?<eos> - No, the life of a crusader is not an easy one, but once that fire is lit, there is no putting it out.<eos> Feminism must be very important to your boys.<eos> Meryl, please!<eos> They're not my "boys." They're my children.<eos> If you feel the need to label them, I'm sorry for you.<eos> It's high time we showed a national audience...<eos> This is national?<eos> ... that we're still producing heroes in this country, and three of them are up there!
Dad, they're pupating.<eos> They need peace and quiet while they're developing their delicate new...<eos> We got to dump the bugs.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Sorry.<eos> Your mother wants them gone.<eos> No, you can't do this.<eos> They never hurt anyone.<eos> They have no protection, no one to watch over them.
We got to dump the bugs.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Sorry.<eos> Your mother wants them gone.<eos> No, you can't do this.<eos> They never hurt anyone.<eos> They have no protection, no one to watch over them.<eos> Oh, crap, I'm too late.<eos> You bonded with them, didn't you?
I requested Halloween off eight months ago, and suddenly, Marybeth becomes a Wiccan, so she can take it as a religious holiday.<eos> There will be more Halloweens...<eos> barring some tragic event.<eos> But this is the good one, you know?<eos> There's such a tiny window where the kids are still sweet and adorable, and you can dress them up however you want.<eos> Every year after that, Halloween's just another trip to the police station.<eos> Life is unfair, Lois.<eos> And, sometimes, it's cut horrifically short with no warning whatsoever.<eos> I think if I send Jamie out with the boys, I can catch up with them during my break.<eos> I mean, I'll only be able to do a couple of houses with them.
But I can't.<eos> Um...<eos> Thank you, anyway.<eos> Okay, I will triple your annual salary.<eos> Bring you up to $112,500.<eos> That's six figures.<eos> That's really nice.<eos> Just take off your clothes.<eos> But I can't.<eos> Why don't you ask one of them?
Joe Dubois-- our juries need citizens like you.<eos> Don't even say that.<eos> Someone might hear.<eos> Take that back.<eos> I will not.<eos> I am proud that you're summoned for jury duty.<eos> What's jury duty?<eos> It's a gigantic waste of Daddy's time, that's what it is.<eos> It's one of the things that makes our justice system great.<eos> When people get in trouble, they get to be judged by people just like them.
Well, that's absurd.<eos> I saw no phone.<eos> There certainly were no witnesses.<eos> This witness also says you stopped on the way to the hospital and threw something away.<eos> Again, there were no witnesses, there were no phones.<eos> Mr. Calley, this witness led us to the place where he says you deposited this trash.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Inside, two disposable cell phones-- the kind you get at a convenience store.<eos> Cheap, hard to trace.<eos> One of them has Mr. Oppen's fingerprints all over it.
He found out I was gonna go on a date with a black guy in high school... and he threatened to take away all my white blue jeans.<eos> Darnell's okay with this? He doesn't care that his wife's father is a racist?<eos> Darnell is fine with it.<eos> Not everybody is tryin' to change the world, Earl.<eos> Some of us are just trying to get our fair taste of a water bed business... when our parents kick the bucket.<eos> [ Earl Narrating ] Turns out Darnell was fine with it.<eos> While Joy's parents were in town, he was staying at a nativity scene... down at the local church since there wasn't room for him at his own double-wide inn.<eos> - I can't lie to 'em, Joy. It's bad karma.<eos> - Karma this, dummy.<eos> If you tell them the truth, they'll both get in their R.V. and drive home.
It's always about him.<eos> He called me at 7:30 last night, and expected me to drop whatever I was doing, just because he was available. Hi.<eos> No, I didn't have any plans, but that's not the point.<eos> I'm not crazy about his friends, either.<eos> None of them are married.
- No.<eos> - Purple and orange?<eos> Sometimes I feel like I'm a kindergarten teacher.<eos> Yeah, I'm familiar with the sentiment.<eos> So, Captain Lemay said you wanted to talk to me about Sergeant Turner?<eos> What kind of midshipman was he, Gunny?<eos> He put most of those kids to shame, sir.<eos> He would have made one hell of a Marine officer.<eos> The Captain said that he had problems with war protesters.<eos> You could say that, ma'am. One of them spit on his uniform.
It's a medical condition.<eos> I could get a note from the doctor.<eos> Abby, I said I'll take care of it.<eos> Don't ask.<eos> Can we get back to work now?<eos> Do I have to wear the shoes?<eos> The circuit board in the cell phone was damaged, but we managed to get it working again.<eos> The battery shut down on October 3, 2004.<eos> The last 22 calls were made to 911.<eos> None of them went through.
You'll stay at NCIS as much as possible.<eos> Other than that, one of us will be with you at all times.<eos> Jethro, my mother is 96 years old.<eos> She suffers from dementia. She gets very nervous when I'm not home in the evenings.<eos> Tony, you'll take the first shift. With his mother.<eos> Uh, doing what, boss?<eos> Whatever she wants.<eos> Yes, it would be helpful if you could assist with the dogs.<eos> Oh, gosh, I'm not really an animal person, Ducky.<eos> I just haven't spent a lot of time with them lately.
Marine Corps birthday.<eos> They're holding the ball there.<eos> Hosted by the commandant of the Marine Corps.<eos> Our top military leaders congressmen, and agency directors will be there.<eos> Including me.<eos> Tony and Ziva have taken their room reservations at the Barclay.<eos> They're there now pretending to be these two.<eos> They're working blind, Duck.<eos> We're counting on you to fill them in on some of the more personal details of our couple.<eos> Though it may be common knowledge that I talk to my patients, unfortunately, to date, none of them have ever answered me back.
Yeah, just a couple of beers.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I don't even recognize you anymore.<eos> That's funny, because you all look so familiar to me.<eos> Everything out of your mouth is some kind of snide smartass comment.<eos> What's happened to you?<eos> Well... let's see.<eos> In the past couple of months I've found out... that my dad's best friend is my real dad.<eos> My old dad beat the crap out of my mom and threw her out of the house.<eos> My parents ruined my relationship with the only woman I've ever loved... and then let it slip that not only was she a man... that one of them slept with her.
Before the divorce, my husband used to like to... spread his seed all over my face.<eos> It didn't do a thing for me sexually, but I did notice... how much better my skin looked afterwards.<eos> Well, I checked and it turns out... that sperm is chock-full of all these wonderful things.<eos> Amino acids, proteins, vitamin C.<eos> What do you do about supply, now that your husband's not around?<eos> Oh, that's not a problem.<eos> I get all I need from my sons.<eos> Your sons?<eos> You put your sons' semen on your face?<eos> It's not like I stand over them and watch.
How do you make it stop?<eos> ! Re making it worse!<eos> Ok, ok!<eos> Come on!<eos> Is she gonna be ok?<eos> It's nothing worse than a first-degree burn.<eos> You're lucky Matt brought you in as soon as he did.<eos> There should be no permanent scarring.<eos> Thank you by the way.<eos> So I guess plastic surgeons aren't the devil when you need them, huh?
Sorry.<eos> Dr. McNamara had another appointment, and he asked me to sit in.<eos> Hi, I'm Dr. Costa.<eos> I was just telling Dr. Troy how you've all been so amazing in the work you've done on the victims.<eos> Oh, well, that is the dirty little secret we doctors share.<eos> It feels good to help others.<eos> Oh, I couldn't agree more.<eos> After I gave my statement to the police, I picked up the phone and I called stand up.<eos> You know, the victims' rights group?<eos> You've heard of them?
Sorry to disturb you.<eos> You say your tenants moved out in the middle of the night?<eos> And then the kid who works here was killed the next day.<eos> What kind of operation went on here?<eos> They put out a newsletter, I think.<eos> Never read it, just saw therinting equipment.<eos> You knew them?<eos> You dealt with them face-to-face?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Actually, Chris dealt with them.
Know what he did?<eos> He started snapping photos of me.<eos> So I grabbed his camera and... he fell to the ground.<eos> And he grabbed my ankle and he wouldn't let go.<eos> So I picked up his tripod... and I hit him over the head.<eos> He was just laying there.<eos> He was just moaning, trying to move.<eos> I ran.<eos> These people try to justify what they're doing by claiming that it's the price of fame.<eos> Now one of them has to pay for a change.
- Charlie, don't erase that.<eos> - No, it's okay.<eos> It's an old case.<eos> I'm writing the equation here in abbreviated form.<eos> I've pinpointed the area most likely to be the perpettor's residence.<eos> - You got the guy's address?<eos> - Not the address?<eos> No. An approximate base.<eos> Um, okay, I'm using some of the same techniques that physicists use to find black holes, which can't be detected in any way other than the effect that they have<eos> - on objects around them.
for example, like, an electron.<eos> You know, you can't really measure it without bumping into it in some small way.<eos> Any physical act of observation requires interaction with a form of energy, like light, and that will change the nature of the electron, its path of travel.<eos> All right, all right, hold on, hold on.<eos> You know I got, like, a C in physics, so just take me through how this relates to the case.<eos> Don...<eos> you've observed the robbers.<eos> They know it; that will change their actions.<eos> Okay, so they change their MO, but we don't have to go back to square one.<eos> We know some things about them.
That's all you need for a rollicking good time, so my proposal is guys' night in.<eos> Guys' night in.<eos> So here we are, just us.<eos> Right.<eos> This is so much fun.<eos> So, what happens now?<eos> Well, we could walk by the bar, see if anyone checks us out.<eos> Hello! ?<eos> No boys tonight, that's the whole point.<eos> Okay, well, we can at least talk about them, right?
I have a question.<eos> Hmm. Well, where's your cutout?<eos> Or have they not made Super Bitch yet?<eos> Is this about Seth and Zach?<eos> You and your comic have turned those two idiots into complete... idiots.<eos> Graphic novel.<eos> And I'm trying to run a business.<eos> You have played one against the other, manipulating Seth, and then threatening Zach so you could end up with all of the power.<eos> I'm sorry that you feel that way.<eos> Well, you're gonna be, because I'm going to tell them both if either of them has anything to do with you, I'm never speaking to them again.
This is a really nice car.<eos> In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay ?<eos> - It's a - It's a very nice car.<eos> - So you're not going to freak out.<eos> Do I have a special someone ?<eos> Well, yeah. Of course.<eos> A bunch of them.<eos> My employees.<eos> If I had to choose between a one-night stand with some stupid cow I'd pick up at a bar, and these people, I'd pick them every time.<eos> Because with them, it is an every-day stand.
Dan, put it away and help me with dessert.<eos> Sure.<eos> But first a toast.<eos> To Jules and Keith.<eos> And to honesty.<eos> The foundation of every good relationship.<eos> Look at these people.<eos> They all know what they want and they manage to find it.<eos> Makes me kind of jealous.<eos> Okay, maybe not of them.
- Happy birthday.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Birthdays aren't usually a sore subject, that's all.<eos> Unless the celebrant is feeling her age, which I don't see how you could be.<eos> I'm 29 years old, Michael.<eos> I'm not feeling my age.<eos> It's just that out of those 29 birthdays, my father has actually managed to see me on precisely... six of them.
I finally have my life all to myself.<eos> So what's on our lady of leisure's agenda for today?<eos> Oh, a matinee, interplay... perhaps a piece of Mauler.<eos> A piece of what?<eos> Thank God hanging around Libery Avenue made you a sex maniac and not a showtune queen.<eos> I'm going to go buy some pajamas.<eos> All of mine seem to be disappearing.<eos> - That's because I took them.<eos> I should've known! It was too good to be true, a cross dresser!<eos> You're sexier without them.
Got him!<eos> I got him!<eos> Keep it coming.<eos> OK, got it.<eos> Got it.<eos> Get another one.<eos> Get me another one.<eos> Shame on you.<eos> You've all forgotten... the true meaning of fandom.<eos> We should take joy in our loves, not argue about them.
- A little demoralized.<eos> - Caesar demoralized?<eos> - Never.<eos> - His standard was stolen.<eos> How did he let a foolish thing like that happen?<eos> I don't know, but his manner and uproar about it... you know how plebeians can be about such things... desperate to come home, mutinous.<eos> I have heard there was some discontent, but mutinous?<eos> Hard to believe.<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> After all he has done for them, he is not sure whether they will... will fight for him anymore.
Things were amazing with Kylie, but before I could get more emotionally invested, I needed answers to some questions that were very important to me.<eos> Name 3 spin-offs of the sitcom Happy Days.<eos> Mork and Mindy, Laverne and Shirley, and Joanie loves Chachi.<eos> You marry her.You marry her now.You marry her!<eos> Ok, ok!<eos> We passed section one: "Sitcoms about or involving asian-american diner owners."<eos> Now onto section 2:<eos> Fat, tubby tv husbands and the crazy-hot women that would never actually be married to them."
You know what, why don't you just get the hell out of here?<eos> That's just not going to happen.<eos> No way.<eos> At first I was disappointed I wasn't sleeping at Kylie's, but it was good to be home.<eos> I'm home!<eos> Hello, fridge.<eos> Good to see you, lamp.<eos> Here I come, couch!<eos> You guys moved couch?<eos> It's always nice to let your friends know that you appreciate them...
Hit them hard.<eos> Fine.<eos> But I need Shane and Army.<eos> Not until they clear the polygraph.<eos> That's not until next week.<eos> I need guys now.<eos> Just let them work on who killed Carl and Scooby.<eos> Nothing else.<eos> They only work the cops' murders.<eos> Anything goes sideways with them, it is on you.
I got DEA to hand Antwon over to us.<eos> But that's where my juice stops.<eos> So now you're letting DEA buy my job?<eos> I'm sorry it ended like this.<eos> You'll fight for me, right, Roy?<eos> The chief too.<eos> Because you know that Farmington is better off now then when I found it.<eos> Because the seizures were working.<eos> Because I made sure that Antwon Mitchell paid for what he did to our two cops.<eos> I looked after them, now you'll look after me, right?
Where is he taking me?<eos> To his underwater palace.<eos> Just kidding.<eos> It's a lagoon full of bugs.<eos> Dad, I don't think we're going to find mom today.<eos> And I'm sick of eating at restaurant chains<eos> I've never even heard of like Skobo's and Dim Willie'S.<eos> Okay, kids, we'll stop for the day.<eos> I have cousins near here.<eos> We'll stay with them.
Madame Wu, these are... our children, Bart and Lisa.<eos> And this is Marge, our surprisingly hot nanny.<eos> Mmm. Thank you, Mr. Simpson.<eos> Don't mention it, Miss...<eos> October.<eos> But don't look at her passport-- it's different.<eos> These are the famous Shaolin Temple monks.<eos> They pursue spiritual peace through mastery of bare-fisted murder.<eos> I've heard of these guys.<eos> You can wave your arms at them and make funny faces, and they just have to stand there and take it.
Well... eat justice, Sideshow Bob!<eos> Chief, I tried to warn you.<eos> Sideshow bob hasn't lived here for months.<eos> Oh, god, am I sorry.<eos> Is that a penn state banner?<eos> 'Cause my cousin went there.<eos> Did you know him?<eos> Mark Wiggum, fat kid, played a lot of tetris.<eos> Mi amici, we are here to honor my old friends, the Simpsons.<eos> Tomorrow, they return to America, taking with them my gratitude, my friendship and my heartfelt wish that they never return.
Yes.<eos> Oh, I feel awful.<eos> Well, honey, those people are so depressing.<eos> mom, it's not that.<eos> It's...<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's-<eos> You know, it wasn't really the job for you.<eos> Yeah yeah, maybe not.<eos> You just don't know how to dress down like them.
- You never even wanted those kids...<eos> - That's not fair.<eos> ...and now you honestly think you can take care of them on your own?<eos> You're not up to being a single parent.<eos> Well, you're not up to being a parent at all.<eos> You are using this as an excuse to dump me, which you've wanted to do ever since Anthony and Durrell came here!<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> Come here!<eos> - God! - David, I love you.<eos> But I am those boys' father and right now I have to take care of them, because you can't.
Or if you'd prefer one of our other stylists...<eos> No, I'm here to see you.<eos> I think the last thing we need to do is buy a crematory.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - But I don't agree with you either.<eos> God, this whole business is so screwed up.<eos> Death used to be something that happened at home, It was taken care of by family And all the undertaker, did was build the caskets.<eos> We were cabinet makers.<eos> Okay, I'm not sure I know how to build a cabinet.<eos> It wasn't until the civil war. That they needed to transport bodies back home without them decomposing That they started embalming them.
Durrell, on the other hand, is a mess.<eos> But what can you expect? These kids come from a broken home.<eos> Their dad basically abandoned them.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Hey, did I tell you I found my own place?<eos> A two bedroom.<eos> I'm waiting to hear.<eos> Then my boys can stay over.<eos> I can't wait to wake up with them again.
- With the kids.<eos> Keith, it's not like they're slippers you can return to Neiman Marcus because they don't fit.<eos> That's the whole point of foster... so you can see whether or not it works.<eos> That's what the social worker said.<eos> And this is definitely not working.<eos> - We're just getting started.<eos> - No.<eos> It's been two weeks. That's more than enough time to know.<eos> We should stop before they bond to us.<eos> But I've already bonded to them.
You surrender only to your creator.<eos> I never really knew any muslims until I went to the Gulf.<eos> I fought alongside these egyptian guys in the 12th mechanized brigade.<eos> Oh, they were good soldiers.<eos> Then they'd stop five times a day for prayers, which I thought was cool, 'cause, hell... most folks I know, they hardly go to church five times a year.<eos> I just wish I'd, uh, asked them more about their religion.<eos> Look, I-I'm just A... simple guy, Tommy, but I'm trying to understand.<eos> Look, what I don't get is... you're an american.<eos> What are you doing with these people?<eos> I'm one of them... and I believe in our cause.
I don't think so, either.<eos> But if your homeland security overheard him boasting about such things, even though it was only idle talk, they would not hesitate in dragging him away.<eos> And his wife and daughter, too?<eos> We've heard worse things.<eos> Part of me prays that's what happened.<eos> If so, we hire a lawyer, and then we have a fighting chance.<eos> But if my cousin had any contact with real terrorists, whether he knew or not, then --<eos> then he'd be in worse trouble.<eos> Do you know any of his friends?<eos> are any of them extremists or criminals?
I'm sorry.<eos> This is hard.<eos> It's okay, ma'am.<eos> Take your time.<eos> I met this guy a couple of months ago.<eos> The problem was is that... there was something strange about him.<eos> His behaviors.<eos> Evasive.<eos> Disappearing for days on end and then popping up like nothing was wrong, you know?<eos> He was hanging out with these other men, and... one of them disappeared.
Chances are you won't need it, but there's no such thing as being too careful.<eos> Nice job, man -- looks real.<eos> "Darwyn Taylor" --<eos> You couldn't think of something a bit more original?<eos> If you want to maintain a false identity, it's best to create one as close as possible to who you really are.<eos> No shit?<eos> - Thanks for the advice.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look, we all agree these assholes should go away for a very long time.<eos> The question is, are we able to put them away after your agent cooperated with them in committing assault with intent to kill and then went one better by actually committing murder?
yeah, right.<eos> really ?<eos> i know. isn't that sweet ?<eos> oh, don't worry. you little snuggle bunnies can hop around all you want.<eos> i'm a heavy sleeper.<eos> i'm going for a dip.<eos> think she could sleep through me smothering her with a pillow ?<eos> don't stay in the sun too long. you're gonna get fried.<eos> so, i take it lana hasn't gotten a peek into the confidential files of clark kent yet.<eos> chloe, you think i'm happy about having my powers back and lying about them ?
Lana has no idea how much... you've been protecting her.<eos> And for what?<eos> For her to choose Clark over you?<eos> You know, I would never betray you the way she has.<eos> I wouldn't underestimate her, Genevieve.<eos> Don't forget...<eos> Lana Lang's ancestor... pledged that she would revenge your family.<eos> I would leave folklore in the past if I were you, Lionel.<eos> My ancestors burn traitors at the stake.<eos> Let's hope you're not one of them.
So you're exterminating a few meteor freaks by sacrificing the lives of innocent people?<eos> Innocent?<eos> Every single one of those mutants was innocent before the meteor showers.<eos> My dad warned me to stay away from the rocks because they turned people into mutants.<eos> Your dad?<eos> Were those his articles on the wall?<eos> He tried to warn people.<eos> He said the meteors were destroying the town.<eos> No one would listen.<eos> Then during the last one he became one of them.
I assure you, breaking and entering is not my style.<eos> You're lost treasure isn't here Mr. Teague, you'll have to look somewhere else.<eos> Good day.<eos> I'm not going anywhere, Luthor, until you give me that stone and you convince me that you didn't take it.<eos> You storm in here, you accuse me of some ham-fisted home invasion.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Is it an act? An elaborate diversion?<eos> Don't turn this around on me!<eos> I think we both know there's nothing stronger than the love between mother and son, and I'm sure Ms. Lang agrees.<eos> I knew you had talents, but I didn't think burglary was one of them.
Impossible!<eos> Well that's what I thought, but it's the only explanation.<eos> Gerak, they used both of us!<eos> Multiple contacts on multiple bearings, sir.<eos> What the hell are they?<eos> They're about ten metres long.<eos> But censors read no internal space, no lifesigns aboard.<eos> Rear guns to defensive fire mode!<eos> Stand by to launch fighters.<eos> One of them is on a collision course.
It wasn't mean't to keep us out, it was designed to collapse the planet into one micro singularity.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, this is how they can create a wormhole that can span such a vast distance.<eos> With a black hole at either end they can maintain an open wormhole indefinitely.<eos> Fine, fine.<eos> How do we stop it?<eos> I have an idea. If we could...<eos> The next idea that anybody comes up with, has to be outside the box!<eos> Ok, the gate is composed of individual blocks.<eos> There must be some sort of energy link between them.
I didn't think much of it either, at the time.<eos> But then this big meteor shower happened exactly on the date the stones predicted.<eos> Are you sure you're reading this correctly?<eos> My skills may not compare with Dr Jacksons.<eos> But over the years I've picked up a decent understanding of Ancient writing.<eos> As a result of my translations, I predicted a major flood would destroy the village unless I could convince the elders to move to higher ground.<eos> And of course you told them where these predictions came from.<eos> No. Well, not in so many words.<eos> Look, these are simple people.<eos> This stuff would mean nothing to them.
He doesn't know what he's dealing with.<eos> - If he retreats, where will he fall back to?<eos> - You're thinking of Teal'c and the rebels.<eos> They're counting on Baal's fleet being too busy to care about them.<eos> The Jaffa rebellion has already failed.<eos> We can't risk the fate of the galaxy on one long-shot chance to revive it.<eos> Is that Jacob talkin'? Or is that Selmak?<eos> Jack, I'm sorry, but the more ships Baal sends out to fight, the faster the replicators assimilate them into their own armada.<eos> Their numbers are growing exponentially.<eos> If we don't do something about it, by the time we do come up with a weapon to use against them, it may be too late.
Can you get life support up and running?<eos> I'm on it.<eos> They're all alive?<eos> The entire crew?<eos> Well... They're in a kind of suspended animation.<eos> Not entirely suspended, however.<eos> The pod has slowed their ageing considerably, but the bodies are virtually moribund.<eos> Teyla and Ronon are searching the rest of the ship.<eos> My guess is, there's hundreds.<eos> Is there anything we can do for them?

John.<eos> That was... not one of my better landings.<eos> Alright, let's go.<eos> Hi folks.<eos> I hope I didn't crash land on anybody.<eos> You should know our people are expecting us.<eos> If we don't show up soon, they'll come looking for us.<eos> Is that supposed to concern me?<eos> Don't go getting all full of yourself, Chief.<eos> A few canons are no match for the kind of fire power they'll be bringing with them.
He smears things onto furniture. Colonel Sheppard! Need you up at the control room.<eos> You still here?<eos> We're just leaving. Well, do say "hi" to the kids for me.<eos> Idiot. "Say 'hi' to the kids for me." You'll catch it from me.<eos> You are such an idiot.<eos> Two Wraith cruisers.<eos> How far away are they? A day, maybe day and a half.<eos> I've been tracking them for some time now, but good news is, it doesn't look like they're heading this way.<eos> - Just passing through the neighborhood?<eos> - Yeah, it looks that way, but I just discovered something rather curious... short but intense energy bursts passing between them.
Did you find what we want?<eos> Well, yes, but it's very complex.<eos> This interface controls the machine that dematerialises people, stores their information and then rematerialises them again when commanded to.<eos> Great.<eos> Command it to!<eos> I can't.<eos> From what we can tell, the materialiser is storing two lifesigns.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Which is good!<eos> Yes, but there is only enough power in the Dart's energy cell to successfully rematerialise one of them.
Good, good.<eos> Then if Sheppard tries anything offworld, you'll be nice and close for me to kill you both.<eos> Can't think of a better way of spending the afternoon.<eos> Move!<eos> Looks like he's asking you to go.<eos> Are those guards Genii?<eos> Yes.<eos> What exactly are we doing here?<eos> The Genii have spies all over the galaxy.<eos> For whatever reason, if one of them can't make it back to the Genii homeworld, their leaders have established safehouses.
Yes.<eos> What exactly are we doing here?<eos> The Genii have spies all over the galaxy.<eos> For whatever reason, if one of them can't make it back to the Genii homeworld, their leaders have established safehouses.<eos> When they need a place to unload on gear or a place to hide, they come here.<eos> That's useful.<eos> Yeah, we've found it to be an excellent source of information and supplies.<eos> How did you find them in the first place?<eos> I was a Genii spy.<eos> If you're one of them, why don't you just walk in there.
I have a weapons lock on the coordinates of the first enemy vessel.<eos> Got it!<eos> First weapon away, Colonel.<eos> That's a kill.<eos> Stand by.<eos> Alright, that's two.<eos> It's working.<eos> Stand by for coordinates.<eos> The other hive ships are altering course to intercept.<eos> - Take us right at them.
What if I told you there was a way around that, a way to protect the planet without worrying about all these royal bloodlines or any of that crap?<eos> That's impossible.<eos> What if it wasn't?<eos> Such talk is dangerous.<eos> He can't watch everyone all the time.<eos> Look, I know you serve these people, but if you're right, and eventually they lose their ability to control the chair, well, at that point, what good are they?<eos> What are you suggesting?<eos> A drug.<eos> Gene therapy.<eos> You give it to the people in the village, half of them will be able to control the throne chair, no problem.
Hmm.<eos> No. I mean, how desperate would you have to be?<eos> Hey, Kizzer.<eos> Ooh!<eos> Kizzer.<eos> Whoo!<eos> Hey, boys. OK, I may be desperate, but I'm not a freak.<eos> I mean, Rohypnol... who needs it?<eos> Especially when your parents are prescription junkies.<eos> Between them, Stella and Nathan had enough narcotics to knock out an elephant.
two brothers were on a fishing trip one of them was taken by a mysterious creature.
I mean,he's still in a comatose state.<eos> His brain is damaged, but functional.<eos> But you know those bullet holes you blew into him?<eos> - They healed.<eos> - What?<eos> You're kidding.<eos> Apparently,Gunneson's traded his genetic structure for strength and the power of regeneration.<eos> So the six missing crewmen are running around out there like Superman?<eos> I wouldn't say Superman, they just won't be making as many Blue Cross co-payments as you and I.<eos> Still haven't found any of them?
Jerry Dalton's been facilities manager longer than I've been dean.<eos> He worked hard,never caused a problem.<eos> We need to sequester the campus and interview the students.<eos> Well,that won't be difficult, this is a leave weekend.<eos> There are about 28 cadets and four faculty members on campus.<eos> We would like to get blood samples from everyone as well.<eos> All parents sign a release for regular,mandatory drug testing, including blood if needed.<eos> Good.<eos> Our cadets exhibit discipline.<eos> I would have a hard time believing that any of them are involved in anything illegal.
AmeriSky Flight 23 diverted from its path because of an air pressure pocket.<eos> Within a mile of theBig Horn.<eos> At 10:20 p. m.<eos> That's when the alien ship appeared.<eos> This must be our link to Molly's dead,deformed guy in Virginia.<eos> And this could mean we've got a planeload of alien infectees.<eos> I'm anxious to see our cadets cleared.<eos> Well,it shouldn't be long.<eos> We're rushing the samples back to our lab.<eos> Now I interviewed all the cadets, but one of them didn't show up to give his blood sample.
I mean novak should be in restraints.<eos> Look,caffrey,we're not exactly getting a wealth of information from these people.<eos> Novak and janklow haven't said a word since they were captured.<eos> Wh-wh... what are you suggesting?<eos> That we put them in a more secure facility.<eos> - Mckenzie air force base in nevada<eos> - No.<eos> In case you hadn't noticed, we're only eight blocks from the white house.<eos> - If one of these guys should...<eos> - I need them here.
Can it tell us anything about the suspects?<eos> Genetic profiling says definitely male, most likely asian.<eos> We've narrowed it down to two billion.<eos> Things are looking up.<eos> Xifukang.<eos> It's an herbal compound.<eos> It's believed to be an aphrodisiac.<eos> Chinese viagra.<eos> More commonly used to treat asthma.<eos> So,uh,one of them is asthmatic and in need of medicine.
It's been used daily until the D.A. Just captured him.<eos> I mean,till you captured him.<eos> Uh,he swiped in daily at rogers avenue station around 10:00 A.M.<eos> Between the morning and lunch hour rush.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> Gangbangers don't have regular commutes.<eos> Maybe he's not actually getting on the train.<eos> If he is building a signal emitter, what better place to set it off than a subway station?<eos> He could infect thousands of people in minutes.<eos> A lot of them federal employees on their way to D.C.
Reality scaring you a little ?<eos> Little more than a little.<eos> Look, I remember something that someone once said-<eos> "Focus on the task, not the fear of the task. "<eos> I can't believe you remember that.<eos> You wrote a hell of a thesis.<eos> It was the only "A" I gave out that year.<eos> Maybe the author should keep her own words in mind.<eos> The brown ones are from the ship.<eos> Each of them shows signs of cellular mutation.
I didn't hear anybody say anything.<eos> I'm just giving you my impression.<eos> I didn't want to look, 'cause even if they were clowning,<eos> I have this thing with heights.<eos> I can't even watch scenes like that in movies.<eos> So I didn't see exactly what happened.<eos> But you saw the men who were with him?<eos> Well, I saw 'em, but I didn't see 'em.<eos> I wasn't paying much attention.<eos> I understand one of them was... heavy.
So I didn't see exactly what happened.<eos> But you saw the men who were with him?<eos> Well, I saw 'em, but I didn't see 'em.<eos> I wasn't paying much attention.<eos> I understand one of them was... heavy.<eos> Not particularly.<eos> Not that I noticed, anyway. Hm.<eos> The other one was bald.<eos> - Pajaros. - Huh?<eos> Did one of them have birds?
I guess I could find a chair for you.<eos> MF?<eos> A young lady.<eos> Only name I have for her is Miami, so I figure her last name must be Florida.<eos> - You're in.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Call you when the table's ready.<eos> - All right, thanks.<eos> You'll like this.<eos> Two babies just showed up with five large between them.
Let's talk about this.<eos> He's 1 1, he'll get over it.<eos> I got over one-thumb Dinapoli.<eos> You asleep?<eos> -You can quit faking, I took her home.<eos> -Really?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -How come?<eos> It's part of the guy code.<eos> When two friends like the same girl, one of them has to step aside.
How about OxyContin replacing ecstasy as the drug of choice for high school students?<eos> Your parents don't wanna read about drugs... at the school where they send their little ones.<eos> I thought the newspaper was for the students.<eos> Where's your Pirate pride, y'all?<eos> Lots of good stuff happens here.<eos> Did you know that Madame Merceaux has been teaching French for 40 years now?<eos> Maybe someone could do an in-depth profile?<eos> A loving tribute to a sadistic crone.<eos> The janitors work so hard, and no one even pays attention to them.<eos> - Maybe we could do something on them?
Are you sure?<eos> Because it could be just a leftover hot flash.<eos> I mean, Ma, you hardly know him.<eos> Vicky, look, no disrespect to your father, but finally, here's a man who looks at me the way... well, the way Dave looks at you.<eos> That's great, Ma.<eos> I'm really glad to see you looking so happy.<eos> And young, right?<eos> Yeah, Ma, and young.<eos> You know, I still think I ought to get my boobies lifted.<eos> You kids sucked the sexy right out of them.
I-I-I can't even look at them.<eos> 'Kay, fine, I'll do it.<eos> You clean up the puke.<eos> Okay, I'm taking you ladies to bed.<eos> Hm.<eos> Last time I said that to two drunk girls, I was about to have a lot more fun.<eos> You know, I'm still so pissed at Hillary.<eos> Don't worry about it today's payback time.<eos> Do you think we're handling this right?<eos> Look, all I know is, when I was her age and my parents caught me drinking, my father beat my ass and made me stay at home every weekend with them.
And sponsors should really be the same sex.<eos> Why?<eos> So there's no emotional ties between the sponsor and the sponsee.<eos> What about gays?<eos> Are you gay?<eos> Would you sponsor me?<eos> Andy...<eos> Okay, look... here it is: when I was young, my stepfather, he...<eos> I can't talk to men.<eos> I have no trust for them.
Tusk.<eos> Nice to meet you, Tusk.<eos> What do you do?<eos> I'm a businessman.<eos> Are you now?<eos> Do you have any kids?<eos> I do.<eos> Two boys and a girl.<eos> I have two boys.<eos> I'm not with them enough.
- It violates Roe.<eos> - How important is Texas?<eos> - Pretty important.<eos> No.<eos> With Vinick's lock on California, this is the whole B.O.W.<eos> Ball of wax.<eos> Why wade into an issue that's not gonna gain us any voters?<eos> All it costs is people who weren't gonna vote for us.<eos> We don't need them to vote.<eos> We need them to stay home.
You're meeting with the Reverend Butler first thing in the morning.<eos> Do you think Bruno's right?<eos> That we shouldn't put Butler on the ticket?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But we need Butler, one way or the other.<eos> If he's not on the ticket, we still need a strong endorsement from him.<eos> Now, these energy types that will be there tonight they wanna hear how you're voting on the energy-deregulation bill.<eos> Well, it depends on what's in it when it comes out.<eos> It's a very bad message to the big contributors if you vote against it.<eos> Hey, if you can't drink their booze, take their money and then vote against them, you don't belong in this business.
What make-work job do they even have you doing over there?<eos> Media targeting for the Northeast and Pacific Northwest.<eos> Fine. We're still the ones with the gutsy education plan.<eos> The ones speaking the truth about the New Hampshire primary.<eos> - Know what Russell's speaking about?<eos> - I didn't know chipboard could talk.<eos> White Mountains preservation, MTBE, textile conversion, local issues.<eos> - You mean pandering.<eos> - I mean what voters want.<eos> "Campaigns are about them, not us. " You taught me that.
And that's why I wasn't able to profile her properly.<eos> You see, Weaving, he was... ..he was predatory. With him, it was almost certainly sexual.<eos> Abused at the age of his victims. Selecting from children who reminded him of himself.<eos> Goodness knows what he did with them. Specially given that he kept the bodies.<eos> Are you sure of that?<eos> I'm absolutely sure.<eos> She's different.<eos> She's resolutely ignoring Weaving's actual motivations in favour of her own construct, which rewrites the history as one in which they're saving these children, freeing them from their lives.<eos> That's why she places the bodies so reverentially. That's why she kills them with painkillers.<eos> She's not interested in keeping hold of them because she doesn't have the same notion over the relationship with them that Weaving had.
This sniper could strike again at any time. Effectively, Bradfield's under siege.<eos> - That's not the case.<eos> - With the help of the public and press we will catch this man.<eos> That's it, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> morequestions...<eos> Dr. Hill, still propping up DI Jordan?<eos> It's DCI.<eos> I thought you'd moved down south.<eos> Parents getting on a bit.<eos> Thought I'd come home and look after them.
Where's the risk?<eos> Haven't you got a revolver in there or something?<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on. Let's play.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Does it matter who pulls the trigger?<eos> Yeah, all those hostages to fortune.<eos> Men and women, they're taking their kids to school.<eos> And knowing you're out there. But they're getting on with their lives.<eos> Every single one of them has more courage than you.
Where's MacAvoy?<eos> Who?<eos> James MacAvoy.<eos> Where is he?<eos> What you asking me for?<eos> Didn't you two break out together?<eos> Hell, no.<eos> What I'm gonna pair up with that white power knucklehead for?<eos> Look, it was a yard fight, all right?<eos> Screws went in to deal with it, one of them left the gate open.
- I didn't say that.<eos> - Let's talk about you.<eos> - Let's not.<eos> - Let's.<eos> I think I can guess most of it, anyway.<eos> Young girl loses her father like that, how can life ever be the same?<eos> Your mother moves you out of the big house away from the mortgage and memories into a crappy apartment that's a long way from your private-school friends.<eos> The bitch of it is, the kids at the public school think you're a snob.<eos> Where does that leave you?<eos> You put a wall up. You put your head down and you work your ass off just to show those bastards that you don't need any of them.
Guess I should be moving on.<eos> That would be best.<eos> I'm an idiot, Momo.<eos> We're getting close.<eos> That wolf sounds so sad.<eos> It's probably wounded.<eos> No, it's been separated from the pack.<eos> I understand that pain.<eos> It's how I felt when the water tribe warriors had to leave me behind.<eos> They were my family and being apart from them was more painful than my wounds.
Hurry, go!<eos> Get inside, we have to close these doors!<eos> Come on, we've got to board up that last window. Seal up all the doorways.<eos> We must try to protect ourselves from the global warming.<eos> Mr. Garrison, are you alright?<eos> I'm in pretty bad shape.<eos> My leg is broken, and my left boob is leaking.<eos> Here you go, sweetheart.<eos> Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood.<eos> I know, but, I'm afraid it's too late for them, sweetie.
And what's she doing with a minger like you ?<eos> - Ow !<eos> - I hardly touched you.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> Bus.<eos> Do you know where we are ?<eos> Fuck knows.<eos> It's weird how you can live somewhere and not really know it.<eos> It's like... people.<eos> You live with them all your life but you don't really know who they are.
We were living a lie.<eos> A big lie.<eos> They told us that parallel universes couldn't exist.<eos> Let alone that you could travel between them. packaged and sold to us by the Vex-Cor Corporation.
What's on the last three minutes of Flight 93's CVR?<eos> These are vital questions that need to be answered.<eos> It's an interesting postscript that Flight 93 was spotted on April 10th, 2003 at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, by David Friedman, a United Airlines employee who records all of his flights.<eos> The tail number, N591UA was spotted on Flight 1111, a United Airlines 757.<eos> And according the FAA, both N591UA and N612UA, Flights 93 and 175, are still valid.<eos> But Flights 11 and 77 are listed as destroyed.<eos> Not to mention that they were not even scheduled to fly on September 11th. Next.<eos> What about the cell phone calls?<eos> For starters, the calls themselves are extremely peculiar.<eos> Most of them are only a couple sentences long, before the callers end the conversation, only to call back later.
- "Okay, Pertwee's ready..."<eos> - You guys listening to the game?<eos> "And fires ball three."<eos> Let's see what you've got.<eos> What's a game without a Ewski?<eos> "The crowd doesn't like it."<eos> Baseball is a sad game.<eos> - Is it?<eos> - Yes... a sad game played by sad men.<eos> One of them lived near here.
- Just this past year, I'm afraid. But the geologist, the key person the Kingdom had brought up from Boston... assures us that they'll stop soon.<eos> But you know geologists. With them, soon can mean five centuries.<eos> So how can I help you?<eos> As I told you when you interviewed, I'm here to help.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm having a serious problem with Hook.<eos> Now, he ordered an MRl-MRA scan... for Mrs. Druse without my permission... and then the scan was carried out this morning... and I was presented with it as a fait accompli.<eos> You know what my son would say? No, what?<eos> lllness sucks.<eos> Unfortunately patients come here, don't they?<eos> Problem with a hospital is we're surrounded by them.
They're simply addicted to cocaine.<eos> I mean, you... you read the article.<eos> "Dopamine reuptake site distribution in rat brains<eos> "using high-affinity, radio-labeled cocaine analogues."<eos> Rats in withdrawal, jonesing rats...<eos> They'll have to be exterminated.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> They have to be captured unharmed.<eos> I can't have rodent junkies wandering the hallways, searching for crack.<eos> The rats die, the study dies with them.
Osama came to participate in '85.<eos> When he was when he came as you know, he is He came from a rich family from Saudi and he had much, much money to spend.<eos> Sheikh Abdullah Azzam was a scholar, he can organize the Afghans but he is not a rich man.<eos> So when Osama came, he filled in this gap.<eos> So the main duty of Osama in that time was spending money.<eos> Beside his good personal qualities.<eos> But then, in 1985, a new force began to arrive in Afghanistan who were going to challenge Azzam's approach.<eos> They were the extreme radical Islamists who were being expelled from prisons across the Arab world.<eos> And then, very quietly, most of the governments in the Middle East, the Arab governments began to empty their prisons of their bad guys and send them off to the jihad with the very fondest hope that they<eos> would become martyred. Many of them were the people in Egypt that had not been executed after the murder of Sadat but were implicated in it and had been in prison. Off they go.
Forgive me, Father.<eos> I never said he was possessed.<eos> Only touched.<eos> So, "touched." What does that mean?<eos> In 1647, the Ursuline Convent in Loudon, France... was plagued by possession.<eos> Thirty-four nuns had been touched by the devil... committing unspeakable acts.<eos> Having orgies including goats doesn't make them possessed.<eos> Simply horny... and inventive.<eos> Four priests were dispatched to exorcise the demons.<eos> Three of them were possessed themselves and subsequently died.
I am the King, Lady Gaunt.<eos> I confer precedence.<eos> Well, are you happy?<eos> I said that I would make you queen of the night and I have.<eos> I'm certainly grateful, my lord.<eos> But not happy?<eos> Well, which of us is happy?<eos> Not you?<eos> Surely you take pleasure in your pictures.<eos> Yes. I can hide behind them.
I'm not a child.<eos> This wedding will happen.<eos> The sooner you accept that, the better it will be for all of us.<eos> I can't talk to you.<eos> Wait a second, sweetheart.<eos> And I'm not so sure Roz is a yoga instructor, either.<eos> Jack, you promised that you'd behave yourself.<eos> What you said to those people was really hurtful.<eos> I think you should go up and apologize.<eos> I'm not going to apologize to them.
- Yes. How does the clock wind up inside the crocodile?<eos> - He swallows it.<eos> - Ah, of course he does.<eos> Out!<eos> How was he?<eos> - Well done.<eos> - Good show!<eos> I finally get the courage to invite the boys to a game and we have to suffer this grave humiliation.<eos> It's perfect actually.<eos> Spend a good deal of time with them, don't you?
That's it.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> There have also been questions about how you spend your time with those boys.<eos> And why.<eos> That's outrageous.<eos> How could anyone think something so evil?<eos> They're children.<eos> You find a glimmer of happiness in this world, there's always someone who wants to destroy it.<eos> No. Thank you, Arthur, but I don't think many will give credence to such nonsense.<eos> Then why is no one sitting with them?
If my calculations are correct... we should be able... to make landfall in three days.<eos> Jonas!<eos> You're serious?<eos> Once we're close to shore we deploy the life-rafts... we evacuate the men and... we scuddle the boat.<eos> You understand I will not allow my boat to fall into your country's hands.<eos> In return for this, I surrender myself to you and ask for consideration for my men.<eos> - You can't just surrender.<eos> - It's my duty to save the men.<eos> Don't surrender us to them!<eos> - We can manage without them.
DeIiriousIy happy.<eos> "I see.<eos> Happy, is it?"<eos> "If you're so happy, why do you look so miserable?"<eos> miserable, you say?<eos> Why should I be miserable?<eos> I don't know. Maybe my two best pals in the world deserted me.<eos> They've headed off on some heroic mission.<eos> My friends are gone.<eos> And my Hakuna Matata went with them.
Then they got out of the train....<eos> They watered down the train.<eos> You know what, I have A Hard Day's Rut confused a little bit with Schindler's List right now.<eos> Hard Day's Rut was--<eos> It was like an advertisement, in a way.<eos> It existed as propaganda.<eos> It was there to celebrate these four characters.<eos> The music is, you know, what it is.<eos> It'll always be legendary, and those guys will--<eos> But A Hard Day's Rut was just, like, being with them on a personal level.
You come in in the morning, have a cup of coffee and talk about the Yankees.<eos> Then you go to your room with your pen and your pad of paper, always alone.<eos> You try and lock in, you crack out an ideogram.<eos> Son of Sam. John Wayne Gacy. Ted Bundy.<eos> He might be driving his car, having a beer, brushing his teeth, cutting someone's eyes out.<eos> If you did it right, you got it all.<eos> The way it sounded, the way it smelled.<eos> And those people were looking right up at you, begging you for mercy.<eos> It was like being God. But, of course, you're not God.<eos> Can't do a thing for them.
You're leaving.<eos> What? I should.<eos> - I should overstay my welcome?<eos> - But I like the way things are.<eos> - Here with you and Mel.<eos> You have a home, a family, a life.<eos> That mustn't be tossed aside because you're afraid of dying.<eos> I won't go back!<eos> Boy, the beauty of living is that you get to work all the world's myths.<eos> Let each of them tug at your insides.
Even the casino itself, that riparian Gomorrah, shall suffer no harm.<eos> It has an insurance company. A financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults.<eos> That is its function.<eos> And that insurance company has tens and tens of thousands of policyholders.<eos> So that - we have done the calculations, Ms. Munson - so that at the end of the day, at the final reckoning, each and every one of those policyholders shall have contributed one penny.<eos> One, single, solitary cent to the satisfaction of this claim. - One penny?<eos> - One penny.<eos> Think of it, Ms. Munson.<eos> One penny from those thousands upon thousands of people so that Bob Jones University can continue on its mission.<eos> Why, I have no doubt that, were those policy holders made aware of the existence of that august institution, each and every one of them would have volunteered some token amount for the furtherance of its aims.
Thank you.<eos> I do.<eos> You want a drink or something?<eos> Do you have any whiskey?<eos> I didn't think her sex was motivated.<eos> I saw it clearly the last night we were together.<eos> It wasn't sexy. It was just sad.<eos> Sorry, I thought there was more.<eos> The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her is to fuck them.<eos> Or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of them.
Let's continue where we left off.<eos> Book 18, page 25.<eos> Katey, just do your best to follow, all right?<eos> It's OK.<eos> I read it last year.<eos> Knock it off.<eos> Well, then perhaps you'd like to begin reading at line 342.<eos> "Now the suitors turned to dance and song...<eos> "to the lovely beaten sway...<eos> "waiting for dusk to come upon them there... and the dark night came upon them, lost in pleasure."
With the exception of Laramie's apology to me.<eos> I like reading the tabloids.<eos> I think they're fun.<eos> - I think you're drunk.<eos> - I think you're cute.<eos> Your pictures hurt people.<eos> Do they?<eos> The irony... - Marcy. - Marcy... is everyone wants to have steak, but nobody wants to date the butcher.<eos> My job is to provide a window of reality for society.<eos> It's up to them whether they want to look through it or not. Come on.
You fellas get some rest.<eos> - Hey, Detective.<eos> - Good m...<eos> How did you know it was me?<eos> 'Cause, uh, I can see your car.<eos> I - I'll let you in.<eos> You caught me. I was in the shower.<eos> - How did my guys do last night?<eos> Were they okay?<eos> - They were great. - I got a great night of sleep thanks to them.
Quickly, While it's fresh in my mind.<eos> Our parents just died?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Mr. Poe I Will raise these orphans as if they Were actually Wanted.<eos> And though you Would call it a burden, a sacrifice, you are mistaken, sir.<eos> And should be ashamed of yourself.<eos> The idea.<eos> Anyway, Where do I sign for the fortu--? I mean children.<eos> You Won't officially have guardianship until the hearing on Thursday morning.<eos> And What am I to do With them until then?
Home.<eos> This is our home now.<eos> This is not home.<eos> Home is Where your parents put you to bed at night.<eos> Where they teach you to ride a bike.<eos> Or Where they get all choked up on your first day of school.<eos> This is not home.<eos> How could they do this to us?<eos> They're just bad people.<eos> Not them.
It's a big softy.<eos> One of the least harmful and most friendly creatures in the animal kingdom.<eos> It's a misnomer.<eos> I only called him that to play a prank on those stuffed shirts down at the Herpetological Society.<eos> Uncle Monty, Why are We going to Peru?<eos> Just this morning I Was Wondering,<eos> "How are We all going to get out of town together?"<eos> And I thought, "Peru." They have snakes in Peru, don't they?<eos> But Why are We getting out of town?<eos> Violet, do you know snakes are more afraid of you than you are of them?
- Looks good.<eos> - Are they coming? It's deep!<eos> Damn, it's deep!<eos> I think it leads through all the mines.<eos> Come on, hurry!<eos> - Oh, my God, it's huge!<eos> - What are we talking about here?<eos> The disused mine building became what we later called The Temple.<eos> Freddie knew lots of other abandoned mine shafts.<eos> One of them emerged in what would become our living room.
The generals are upset.<eos> They question your obsession with Darius.<eos> They say it was never meant for you to be king of Asia.<eos> Naturally.<eos> They want only to return to their homes, rich with gold.<eos> But I've seen the future.<eos> I've seen it now 1000 times, on 1000 faces.<eos> These people want...<eos> Need change.<eos> - Aristotle was wrong about them.
I'm paying the price for being a Hindustani!<eos> The price for being an honest Hindustani!<eos> I will not do anything wrong<eos> It's necessary to conduct a post mortem on these three bodies again<eos> I cannot issue their death certificates right now<eos> Why not?<eos> The RMO's screaming at me!<eos> - They did not die in the riots<eos> They were poisoned to death.<eos> The bruises on them are misleading
But you turned me down<eos> You first wanted the file, before it fell into someone else's hands<eos> But you needn't worry.<eos> Ansari will be found<eos> Naidu, how did you get up here?<eos> I took the elevator.<eos> - And I climbed the staircase<eos> To reach this height, I have climbed every step of crime!<eos> I have walked over dead bodies to get where I am today<eos> A few of them were my own men.
As long as my heart beats, I rule and you hold your tongue.<eos> Or I'll cut it out.<eos> To represent the holy court, my trusted secretary, Horton...<eos> Horton?<eos> ...will accompany you on your quest.<eos> Jols, find him a horse.<eos> This way.<eos> Godspeed, as you fulfill your duty to Rome.<eos> My duty is also to my men.<eos> Then get them home.
I'm crazy for sure.<eos> Me too.<eos> I can't be without you anymore.<eos> I think about you all the time.<eos> I have to be with you.<eos> There's no otherway.<eos> Really.<eos> And his parents...<eos> They are so horrible.<eos> And he's just like them.
That's lying<eos> OK! ­ next time you'll see with your own eyes, then try to say I'm lying<eos> You'll never say it again!<eos> Let me introduce myself, I am Alexander Wolf<eos> You have something of great interest to me, Dr. Ho.<eos> Your artificial intelligence invention is amazing But it should have a larger use<eos> You see, this world is simply absurd<eos> We're selected from a class of stupid eggs and ruled by a class of more stupid idiots I want to return beauty to the name of "democracy"<eos> Mankind needs a leader with a clear and definite vision<eos> To only tell them what is best
Wouldn't you like that?<eos> Wouldn't you accept that gift?<eos> My friends are coming to kill you.<eos> Gonna be sorry you did that.<eos> Why?<eos> Nobody's coming for you, King Shit.<eos> Sure they are.<eos> See, one of the things you fuckheads need to know about us Nightstalkers..<eos> ...Is that when you join our club, you get all sorts of groovy little door prizes.<eos> And one of them is this nifty little tracking node surgically implanted in your body.
Pompey's no great warrior.<eos> I heard he's got so fat on the riches of his triumphs he can barely ride his horse.<eos> Disparage Pompey all you like but the man gets the job done.<eos> Victory over vermin-ridden Gaulish peasants is hardly the mark of military distinction.<eos> They say he will be consul.<eos> This grape is not to my satisfaction.<eos> The wealth of a man like Crassus could be seen in gold or silver but its true measure was in flesh.<eos> Thousands of slaves.<eos> They lived out their short lives in a world of suffering at the whim of their masters.<eos> No Roman citizen gave them a second thought.
Was it the guy my daddy's friends delivered a lot of weapons to?<eos> Was it that group of religious fundamentalists who visited my state when I was governor?<eos> Or was it the Saudis?<eos> Damn.<eos> It was them.<eos> I think I better blame it on this guy. "<eos> In the days following September 11 th all commercial and private airline traffic was grounded.<eos> The FAA has taken the action to close all of the airports in the United States.<eos> Even grounding the president's father, former President Bush on a flight forced to land in Milwaukee.<eos> Thousands of travelers were stranded, among them Ricky Martin due to appear at tonight's Latin Grammy Awards.
I admit I was a little nervous about the whole idea.<eos> I was scared, just like you.<eos> But it was the right choice, and it was my choice.<eos> So I grit my teeth, thought of the future, and once I came out of that doctor's office, well, honey, let me tell you, I have never felt so relieved, so good in all my life, as I did after I took care of little Henry.<eos> And I have never regretted it since.<eos> Honey you've got to be brave and do it.<eos> Just like Mum.<eos> Do it for me.<eos> Nutcases.<eos> Ignore them.
Potsdammer Platz. West: Tiergarten about 400 metres away from the chancellery.<eos> - How long can you hold out?<eos> - At most two days.<eos> - Including the government area?<eos> As a soldier I suggest we flee Berlin. It's surrounded.<eos> The battle of Berlin killed about 20,000 of our best officers.<eos> That's what young people are for.<eos> What you suggest is insane.<eos> Ridiculous. Think of the thousands of wounded.<eos> We can't help them.
'Are these people alive or dead? '<eos> 'We don't know.'<eos> Say something.<eos> Please.<eos> All right, OK.<eos> Put the guns down!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> He's a cop!<eos> Come on, put the gun down.<eos> I thought you were one of them.
In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful<eos> Allah is Great!<eos> Who is it?<eos> Hey, why so dark in here?<eos> My mother says it is important... to open the doors at sunrise and switch on lights at sunset<eos> Or the Angels of Benevolence pass over the house What are you staring at?<eos> It's sweets and bread... mother has sent it for you<eos> Know what?<eos> I got it married to Rehman's tomcat Now it has four kittens.<eos> I gave them all away One of them was very cute.
I didn't think you'd still be up.<eos> Just trying to get a jump-start on tomorrow.<eos> What about you?<eos> It's late.<eos> Yeah, I know it is, baby.<eos> We had a really good turnout at the restaurant tonight.<eos> Despite the bad press, people still showed.<eos> Good for you.<eos> A lot of my heavy hitters have backed out of attending the exhibition.<eos> Without them, no funding.
Stay quiet.<eos> Sacred burial ground.<eos> I thought you said that anaconda was the biggest you'd ever seen.<eos> It was.<eos> - Well, this one's...<eos> - Bigger.<eos> The males must've come through here looking for the female.<eos> Some bullshit.<eos> - They took their boats.<eos> - Good for them.
Only then, let's get this over with.<eos> What will you do?<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> - What do you think brought you here?<eos> Do not run away now.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I promise.<eos> We were not made to breathe in the dark corners of the world ... but to breathe between things real and beautiful.<eos> Stone walls only get stronger ... only come together even more.<eos> We are not meant to be within them.
Do you remember Kaveriamma?<eos> Kaveriamma?<eos> Your old maid servant, right?<eos> Please don't call her a maidservant.<eos> She was like a mother to me!<eos> I'm sorry. I had no idea.<eos> What about her?<eos> As you know, I was the only child.<eos> My parents brought me up with a lot of love, they provided me with everything.<eos> But along with them, Kaveriamma too had a special place in my life.
- You think of your wife, right?<eos> There you crazy.<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> - And wait until you find her.<eos> We must disappear.<eos> Not move, I said.<eos> - Back!<eos> Look at what we have here.<eos> These are not ordinary immigrants.<eos> - No, we are not like them.
Tell me something.<eos> How did the thieves get into the museum the other night?<eos> - Through the roof.<eos> - That's right.<eos> And at Duran's mansion, they just flew off of some cliff?<eos> How about the auction?<eos> They climbed down the side of the building.<eos> What does all this prove?<eos> It proves that they had the training and the ability... to pull something like this off.<eos> Daniel is using them, just like he's using you.
My back.<eos> And Americans everywhere.<eos> You'd never know there was a depression in that country.<eos> Please, something to drink before I faint.<eos> They don't shop, they pillage.<eos> And they speak loudly.<eos> Could the entire nation be hard of hearing?<eos> Something in the diet, perhaps?<eos> But we have American friends, mama.<eos> They don't need to know what we say about them.
- No.<eos> - But I've seen you.<eos> Oh, was that your foot?<eos> Wherever do you find shoes to fit?<eos> My feet are in perfect proportion to the rest of me.<eos> Oh, yes, of course.<eos> Though they have a habit of finding themselves in peculiar places.<eos> Those people are staring right at us.<eos> Who?<eos> Don't worry about them.
Upon the rack, Bassanio?<eos> Then confess what treason there is mingled with your love.<eos> None but that ugly treason of mistrust which makes me fear the enjoying of my love.<eos> Ay but I fear you speak upon the rack, when men enforced do speak anything.<eos> Promise me life and I'll confess the truth.<eos> Well, then, confess and live.<eos> Confess and love has been the very sum of my confession.<eos> But let me to my fortune and the caskets.<eos> Away, then.<eos> I am locked in one of them.
I have a friend who's been living with his girlfriend for seven years.<eos> His parents think there's a whole bunch of them who share a flat together.<eos> I couldn't live a lie like that, Casim. No way.<eos> It's easier for you.<eos> Nothing to lose.<eos> "Can't live a lie." It's a self-indulgence.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Do you want me to break with my family? I mean break forever.<eos> Could you do that with your mom?<eos> And what do you ask of them?
My father always believed in fate.<eos> Perhaps this is the way God wanted it.<eos> Kim!<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> We must harvest before the floods.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll mend your sampan too to go fishing.<eos> You don't want to herd buffaloes with your friends anymore?<eos> I hear they have a lot of customers.<eos> I don't want anything more to do with them.
- They're not happy. No.<eos> - They're not happy?<eos> No, they are.<eos> I don't know. I just mean French men.<eos> They drive me nuts.<eos> What is it? What about them?<eos> Well, they're very nice.<eos> They're great, you know, to be around.<eos> They love food, wine, they're great cooks.<eos> But I've had really bad luck with them.
I never fully recover.<eos> That's why I'm very careful with getting involved because it hurts too much.<eos> Even getting laid, I actually don't do that because I will miss of the person the most mundane things.<eos> Like I'm obsessed with little things.<eos> Maybe I'm crazy, but when I was a little girl my mom told me that I was always late to school.<eos> One day she followed me to see why.<eos> I was looking at chestnuts falling from the trees, rolling on the sidewalk or ants crossing the road, the way a leaf casts a shadow on a tree trunk.<eos> Little things.<eos> I think it's the same with people.<eos> I see in them little details, so specific to each of them that move me and that I miss and will always miss.
- A fair thing, don't I..-<eos> - You are a bastard -<eos> - This is what you are -<eos> - And I want this place back the way it was -<eos> - It can't be-<eos> - I looked to the Pub and I thought god..what I've been doing? -<eos> Thank you Lord I now see what i can do<eos> - Our room is not a Pub our room is a spiritual center where people can come and learn about Jesus Christ -<eos> because we will give this valley back to Jesus Crist<eos> -Because people live spiritual fullfilment - They need to know that the Lord is there for them
You shouldn, t be alone with her, then.<eos> Charlie doesn, t like that anyway.<eos> I know.<eos> Looks like she, s having fun.<eos> Leave her be.<eos> I wanted to go inside.<eos> Just for a look.<eos> May I?<eos> Hollywood people, they bring all this on themselves.<eos> It, s all sex and drugs with them.
Sooner or later you'll know.<eos> If you call back I'll hang up.<eos> While Nelson's in Hendaye, he'll stay here.<eos> This is for Nelson.<eos> All right.<eos> I hear you're planning something big and I'd like to help.<eos> All in good time, Loygorri.<eos> I don't mean just with the cell.<eos> Some architect friends of mine work in Spain.<eos> I've done some work for them.
Do you still remember...<eos> Do you still remember there was a woman,with a bag?<eos> Don't you guff!<eos> Wing,I really don't remember what happened that night<eos> Don't ask me again,OK?<eos> I quit because of this case<eos> If you came here as a friend,then I welcome you<eos> If you are here for the case,then I'm sorry<eos> Sam,I owe our brothers Help me please<eos> All I know is that one of them is a woman
I think your iron is getting cold.<eos> Good day.<eos> I don't like saxons.<eos> - I do once in a while.<eos> Yeah, i know...<eos> for sword practice.<eos> Look at that pale path of light... that's the road to valhalla... i wish i could see them sitting up there, all the great heroes... at table with the gods.<eos> And they are watching over us mortals.<eos> - But why do they care about us?<eos> They need us just as much as we need them.
Isn't it wonderful to make such things?<eos> - Do you have a talent or a craft?<eos> I'm a prince.<eos> I'm not allowed to work.<eos> It would disgrace my brother, the king.<eos> Don't you get bored?<eos> If it weren't for my sister, i'd go mad.<eos> - She's quite a pretty girl.<eos> Every nobleman in our kingdom wants her.<eos> She doesn't want any of them.
And finally betrayed as he betrayed me!<eos> Hagen of tronje, face the fate my gods have chosen!<eos> Your gods are dead!<eos> - Soon we will know!<eos> Return this ring to it's rightful owner.<eos> Take it back to the nibelungs.<eos> Arminius.<eos> Today the old gods live again!<eos> No, giselher.<eos> Today the old gods will die with them.
Hey!<eos> Weeber eggs?<eos> I hate them.<eos> Well, apparently babies love them.<eos> Actually, Rygel, what does it really feel like?<eos> Like having a parasite, a large parasite that's growing!<eos> Okay, what did we do to piss off the locals?<eos> - They're paranoid.<eos> - No, wrong, not paranoid.<eos> I've been talking to many of them.
Cary Grant was always Cary Grant but different textures of Cary Grant.<eos> Within his parameters and within that perimeter there's a lot of stuff.<eos> He had the great ability of being able to play everything from slapstick, fall-down comedy to dramatic stuff with a sense of danger.<eos> Director Howard Hawks casts Grant in his first dramatic leading role: 1939's Only Angels Have Wings.<eos> - There he is! - Joe! Joe!<eos> Pull her up!<eos> Pull her up!<eos> I've known a lot of flyers, and I've seen a lot of forced landings.<eos> They don't sit and moan about what will happen when they hit the ground.<eos> Doesn't do them any good to dramatize it.
This?<eos> I build bridges, hollow out tunnels, and make roads.<eos> Then... Are you a laborer?<eos> Well, sort of the same.<eos> They said it destroys the ecosystem so many animals are dying.<eos> So that's why there's an environment-friendly highway.<eos> Know what it is?<eos> When roads in the mountains are made, animals can't roam around well, right?<eos> The same goes for finding food.<eos> So we make an exclusive road just for them.
Can we come in?<eos> Police station North.<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> I live nearby.<eos> I thought I'd come along with my colleague.<eos> We were notified of a theft today.<eos> - Theft of what?<eos> Some games were stolen at the VD department store.<eos> A customer saw two boys from the Noorderhoek.<eos> We have reason to believe one of them was your son.
We're all old friends.<eos> I really don't know how to do this.<eos> I hope you can cool down for a while and reconsider.<eos> Thank you for the advice.<eos> Lily, I didn't want a divorce.<eos> Your keys!<eos> Mommy, why do you want a divorce?<eos> You'll understand when you get older.<eos> Men can't be relied upon.<eos> We can get by just fine without them.
Dozens have opened in the last few years<eos> University?<eos> I don't want to teach I want to make films<eos> You're right Make films<eos> So, you're not going to teach?<eos> Well... if a university in Seoul asks me to why not?<eos> I need to making a living<eos> Exactly, all these film students what will they do?<eos> Film isn't like Korean or English<eos> It will be hard for them I pity them
Let's go.<eos> Stop!<eos> Why attack these people?<eos> Deserter... why do you care?<eos> The war should be over now.<eos> There are terrorists everywhere.<eos> These people aren't terrorists.<eos> I don't give a damn.<eos> I just follow orders.<eos> As you heard, I was once one of them.
I'll fucking kill you!<eos> Quit it.<eos> That son of a bitch started it!<eos> I told you to stop!<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> What's the decision?<eos> Are we disqualified?<eos> The coaches agreed that it never happened.<eos> When word gets out, it won't look good for them either.
Ones not loved by anyone<eos> They exist in our world<eos> There's a legend If nobody loves the spirit of the deceased<eos> that spirit becomes a spider and gets trapped forever in this forest<eos> That's very interesting<eos> But spider-turned spirits...<eos> They don't know they're dead for all their memories disappear<eos> So those spider-turned spirits live here forever?<eos> No<eos> If anyone remembers them the spiders spirits will be freed
They said it was hellish, moving bodies...<eos> The last one was Jose's.<eos> They'd gone back to the hotel.<eos> Risking their lives twice over false information.<eos> They'd fooled us twice.<eos> We're not asking for money of anything like that. You can't buy what we want.<eos> We want justice, an investigation...<eos> It was the premeditated murder of people they had no control over.<eos> Isn't that what governments are for?<eos> You vote for them so that they'll support you but we just feel forsaken and scorned.
Hot enough for you?<eos> Why don't you do me a favor and kick it up a few notches, pops?<eos> You boys like your meat extra crispy?<eos> - Got to get me one of those.<eos> - Oh, man!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> - May I ask you a question?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Why dolphins?<eos> - Why do I work with them, you mean? - Uh-huh.
Thank you<eos> This is the final share of 20O<eos> You don't seem satisfied<eos> No boss, I was just thinking of something else<eos> Something else?<eos> You remember when you gave me the money to buy a car?<eos> I met a fine fellow, a straight man<eos> With noble origins<eos> Their parents are extremely wealthy<eos> I was beginning to think that all wealthy people are just rascals, dirty l thought that for them, the end justifies the means
I wanna become clean, respected l want out sir<eos> And how would you live, you respected fellow?<eos> Just like everybody<eos> You think that if you got yourself anotherjob, you'd be able to earn this amount of money?<eos> What are we doing?<eos> We're just taking the thieves' money investing it in huge projects for the best of the country<eos> And we're getting paid for that<eos> Tell me something<eos> You think that if you didn't have this amount of money You'd be able to hang out with these people?<eos> You're not gonna be one of them just by sticking together
- Like what?<eos> - Some things about my past<eos> - You were married?<eos> - Of course not<eos> - You have any kids?<eos> - Where would I get them from?<eos> - You're su_ering from AIDS<eos> Nour, this is serious<eos> All I wanna know is what I'm seeing in front of me<eos> - You don't get it - l've got news for you I spoke with my parents, you'd only have to set a meeting with them
No matter how hard I try not one...<eos> Not even one!<eos> I can't even find one beautiful memory<eos> All of this is my reality<eos> This is my reality This is my reality<eos> My reality is being th<eos> Also I can't be with you, either<eos> Marriage?<eos> Well be like my parents So I don't want it<eos> I never want to live like them
Forget her, boss.<eos> Τhere's one better than the other in Goa.<eos> Point out a girl. She'll be in your arms.<eos> It is my rule here. You just order me boss.<eos> Rani!<eos> - Rani!<eos> Αfter a nice cold bath.. Tommy will become a handsome boy.<eos> Ηe'll be good looking.<eos> Those dirty dogs in the lane..<eos> Don't eνer play with them, okay? Look how dirty you are now.
Hey, listen here!<eos> My daughter was playing there the other day and she saw him.<eos> She says that he is so thin that the wind could blow him over.<eos> What is so funny?<eos> There is nothing to laugh about.<eos> I will not let my daughter play there again.<eos> Me, neither.<eos> He must go.<eos> Your husbands are bringing it to you.<eos> Yes, we get it from them.
Imagine we had swapped and you were with Anke That would have been too planned All the petting and the excitement of flirting<eos> And we both know, now it is going to happen for real Just like a married couple, on Sunday morning<eos> That is too boring for me<eos> But you know it is going to happen some time, with Sandra<eos> She is not yet ready for that She has a problem with her breasts<eos> Please, no talk about breast sizes now<eos> I like her just the way she is<eos> Did you close the tent?<eos> Just in case the gays would pass by and... who knows?<eos> You think one could be friends with them?

As long as they do not want anything from me<eos> And what if one of them fell in love with you?
OK, thanks, I'll take good care of it.<eos> It's a cat?<eos> Right? It's a puma.<eos> - Yes, a puma.<eos> - Sure, a puma.<eos> And the dog?<eos> Walter took him, the big guy.<eos> He has space for him.<eos> I love dogs.<eos> But it's a problem to travel with them.
He was a lively ogre, but not a violent one<eos> Rather, he was a kind and considerate ogre<eos> The red ogre thought every day, 'l was born as an ogre.<eos> but I want to get along with humans ' 'l want to be friends with the villagers '<eos> One day he could no longer stop himself<eos> And he hurried and took a wooden plank to write on lt's OK 'l'm a kind ogre.<eos> Anybody is welcome ' 'l have good snacks and can make tea, too '<eos> The red ogre put up the sign by his house sis!<eos> Kaoru!<eos> Red ogre, please always be kind and sincere to humans and show them good times
- Wait here a second.<eos> - I already told you.<eos> Why's it always like this?<eos> Why didn't you report that I bailed out that day?<eos> It looks like you were working alone!<eos> You said three guys jumped you?<eos> Kwon Jeong-min isn't one man, but three.<eos> Kwon Chul-woo, Jeong Chan, Min Jae-il.<eos> That's what people call them.<eos> I'm sure it was them.
What happened here?<eos> Give me a cigarette.<eos> The neighbors, Mali... They've seen everything.<eos> Give me a cigarette.<eos> What happened here?<eos> Where were you?<eos> Where were you the whole day?<eos> !<eos> I had something important to check.<eos> Why did you leave me alone with them? !
But it will pass<eos> It won't be as simple as I thought at first<eos> Like opening one's chest and pulling out one's soul<eos> Like a stab of love"<eos> Open up a path!<eos> We're going in - just us.<eos> Cuando los satélites no alcancen It's okay, it's okay.<eos> Be calm.<eos> Yo vengo a ofrecer mi corazón Let's go over there, where there's no police.<eos> These workers have been helping my sister, who worked with them.
By seeing a mysterious creature defeated, anxiety will turn into hope.<eos> No matter what, you mustn't win.<eos> You'll torment the Japanese wrestler, but in the end, the people want to see you ultimately lose to him.<eos> Behind the scenes, of course, you're the star.<eos> In fact, it's so brilliant that you've become a squid.<eos> Assuming you're actually Kan-ichi Iwata, that is.<eos> Well?<eos> I want to be loved.<eos> People will love me if I win.<eos> For them, a hero is a winner.
It's a wound on my heart.<eos> My fires will be sated only when that woman and her children are dead.<eos> If pain could be expressed, every wound of mine would speak volumes.<eos> Shut up!<eos> First think of putting out the fires that rage in my heart!<eos> Only a widow knows the anguish of losing her husband!<eos> You lost your father, but I did not concede defeat to Angara!<eos> But today I realize that Angara's sons are true men.<eos> And my sons... are jackals that hide behind their wives aprons! Jackals!<eos> Yes, keep saying that to them, lawyer.
You're old enough to be my father and you're angling for me, rascal!<eos> Shameless man!<eos> Give that wedding necklace to me!<eos> Give it!<eos> What are you waiting for, morons?<eos> pick it up!<eos> Jai!<eos> Come here!<eos> Up there!<eos> None of them must get anywhere close to it.
God hating and striking?<eos> Oh, look, someone wrote about this! There was a strong contrast between illness and disability, in those days it was not called like that.<eos> "You are not ill but a guy with Polio sequels"<eos> "and you can have"<eos> experiences as anyone", it was like a leitmotiv.<eos> Well, in my case,<eos> everything was twice as much complicated.<eos> The movie was to be told to me and they did so,<eos> and today that looked natural but there was people who didn't want to do it then I missed the party<eos> not them, we played a video and they told me the film.
It's best to leave before dark when the hunt begins.<eos> Now, the silvertip sharks are especially territorial, meaning they guard their gulflike watchdogs.<eos> That's why Grandfather would always tell me,<eos> "When a silvertip's in sight, pull your head in and hide. "<eos> Hello?<eos> It's, like, a pretty huge ocean.<eos> You really donna crowd me like that?<eos> Now, down here, the sharks are the head honchos, the top of the food chain.<eos> That gives them a big responsibility for maintaining the balance of life in the oceans.<eos> But mankind has given them a bum rap as "ruthless, vicious killers".
You may do the same.<eos> Good.<eos> We'll leave as soon as Hector arrives.<eos> Yuri.<eos> Amador's on the move.<eos> - What direction?<eos> - East.<eos> Likely destination?<eos> There's half a dozen villages.<eos> It could be any one of them.
- Yeah.<eos> OK. And, Brian?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> - You OK?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Just call me.<eos> All right.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I have someone who can track the calls made from this phone.<eos> If any of them can be connected to Kelly, we have evidence that we can use against Alan.
There were three other people inside that pharmacy.<eos> Anne Schwartz has been going to the pharmacy for years, so they had her address.<eos> We've sent NHS people to her house.<eos> She has a husband and three children.<eos> - And the other two customers?<eos> - IDs unknown.<eos> They could be anywhere, spreading the disease to anybody they're in contact with.<eos> It gets worse.<eos> At the urgent-care facility there were six patients when Cole came in who left before the quarantine was put in place.<eos> We're tracking them down, but between them and the staff at the facility, we could be looking at up to 75 people just in their families.
- Dennis...<eos> Tom, put the gun away.<eos> - You should have let me pull the trigger.<eos> - I was tempted.<eos> But shooting Lytell won't get Kyle back.<eos> It'd make me feel a hell of a lot better.<eos> Why Kyle?<eos> Why didn't he go after Shawn?<eos> Our doctors went over Shawn dozens of times.<eos> - Kyle's new territory for them.
How the hell did they do that so fast?<eos> So much for your vile eggs, you disgusting vermin!<eos> Timing's everything.<eos> Call it a hunch.<eos> We tried comming you, but we didn't get an answer.<eos> Dylan, it was an ambush.<eos> The magog aren't that cunning.<eos> The lancers... they're dead.<eos> You saved them from something worse. Don't worry.<eos> We'll come back for them later, make sure they get a proper burial.
Slipstream event.<eos> It's a slipfighter.<eos> It's one of ours.<eos> Onscreen.<eos> You guys are a sight for sore eyes.<eos> I wasn't sure i'd find you in one piece.<eos> Happy to see you, too, Rhade.<eos> Status on theAndromeda.<eos> Andromedamade it safely out of the area.<eos> We were followed by several swarm ships, but took care of them... all except one, that is.
The paradine... without a doubt, he is right.<eos> Dylan, i always felt that your presence had this... timeless quality about it, that in some ways, you were much older than i.<eos> Now you're just trying to make me feel bad.<eos> The paradine witnessed the creation of this universe.<eos> Perhaps they even had a hand in its creation.<eos> Yeah, i think i would have remembered that.<eos> I'm just a smalltown boy from tarn-vedra.<eos> I'm having a little trouble wrapping my mind around all this.<eos> Reality is wider than a single mind.<eos> True... but i can't help these people if they let the magog make a meal of them.
Welcome to the Los Angeles branch of Wolfram Hart the oldest and most powerful law firm in the city.<eos> Founded in 1791 on ground deconsecrated by the blood of mass murderer Matthias Pavayne Wolfram Hart has put roots down in this glamorous city that grow deep and branches that reach into the heart of major corporations like Yo-Yo-Dine, Whelen-Utani and Newscorp.<eos> That captain of industry?<eos> We own his soul.<eos> That fabulous movie queen?<eos> She owes us her first-born. But times change, and Wolfram Hart is changing right along with them.
What do they do?<eos> Jeez, you guys always this slow?<eos> Starts with A, ends in "pocalypse."<eos> It's a well-oiled machine, the Circle.<eos> These people grease the wheels, keep the parts in place.<eos> Make sure man's inhumanity to man keeps rolling along.<eos> We thought the senior partners caused the Apocalypse.<eos> Senior partners are on a different plane.<eos> Down here players in the Circle make things happen.<eos> Hell, you get tapped by one of them like getting a key to the chocolate factory.
The law, the languages, the strategy.<eos> Acute Flowers for Algernon syndrome.<eos> - It must be sheer torture.<eos> - Well, fix it.<eos> Put it back.<eos> Well, no offense, counselor, but your insurance plan wouldn't cover what I charge to wash my hands.<eos> You got that upgrade because the senior partners wished it.<eos> And if you're losing it, well, they wanted that too.<eos> Why would they do that?<eos> You never know with them.
Well, technically it's the company's.<eos> But, yeah, I'm in charge of it.<eos> - Wanna see my office? ROGER:<eos> That's it, up there?<eos> - Come on, baby. TRISH: Ooh!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> - Visiting with my folks.<eos> - Illyria...<eos> Your grief hangs off of you like rotted flesh.<eos> I couldn't tolerate it from them as well.
Look.<eos> It's the hero of the hour.<eos> I'm not your hero.<eos> I'm your warden.<eos> It's all how you look at the glass.<eos> I'd have thought a few months' torture by the partners would've dug a little deeper.<eos> - Just scratched the surface.<eos> Turns out they can only undo you as far as you think you deserve to be undone.<eos> I wonder how Gunn's gonna make out.<eos> The senior partners, everything you know about them.
- Well, gravy.<eos> I'll menace, you talk.<eos> [SPEAKING IN GERMAN]<eos> LAWSON: Says it's research.<eos> - What kind?<eos> What about vampires?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's technical.<eos> Something about stimulation and control.<eos> They've been experimenting on them. Cutting into their brains.
You don't deserve that.<eos> You're smarter than them.<eos> What about macaroni...<eos> let me finish... salad?<eos> Gob, this is your time.<eos> With my help, knowing what I know... - we could take over the Bluth Company together.<eos> - Wow! This is a side of you I'd never noticed before.<eos> Have they always been that big?<eos> And the next day, Michael went to his mother's.<eos> I saw an exposé on the Iraq palaces last night... and I could have sworn that one of them was the Sea Wind unit.
Yes, thank you.<eos> I'm not a collector myself, but I...<eos> I am familiar with his work, and may I say... you really do have an excellent eye for art. Thank you.<eos> - Where's my Cylon detector, Doctor?<eos> - Oh, that.<eos> Yes, it's taking longer than expected, unfortunately.<eos> What's the hang-up?<eos> It's not working this time, Gaius.<eos> He can see right through you.<eos> There are a number of obstacles... none of them insurmountable, but they do tend to slow us down.
Strangulation.<eos> Fracture to the hyoid bone.<eos> What about these right here?<eos> Fractures to the zygomatic bone and maxilla, also to the left ulna, but no tool marks on any of the bones.<eos> So may be, she was punched in the face and tried to shield herself?<eos> Yeah, Walter Darian strangled a female caucasian 5 foot 4,<eos> - around twenty years old.<eos> - Yeah, but is it our missing waitress?<eos> Well, I did dental charts, X-rays.<eos> David's off and running with them now.
Ketoacidosis, fat stores are used for energy, and then rhabdomyolysis... when muscle is broken down for fuel.<eos> Think of the body as digesting itself.<eos> This took weeks.<eos> I have to admit, this seems especially cruel and unusual.<eos> When kids are involved, it usually is.<eos> It's 10-by-18-foot cell built for 25 people.<eos> We've got 35 mutts and no place to put the extras.<eos> Between the yo's, the cholos and the rednecks, it was bound to happen.<eos> 35 guys, that's a lot of men to fit in one room.<eos> Cops round them up, we process them.
If he's on the hook, so are you.<eos> Nina?<eos> - Chase said you wanted to talk to me about trouble at spa?<eos> - Yeah, that's true.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I understand that sometimes you go by the name Sandy.<eos> We know that two men fought about you at the spa.<eos> There was no fight.<eos> No fight?<eos> If there was no fight... how did one of them end up like that?
I'd appreciate that.<eos> You okay?<eos> / Yeah....<eos> When I heard... she was... in trouble I didn't hesitate because she's my little sister.<eos> I've always kept an eye on her.<eos> That's exactly what you did, Paul.<eos> Did I?<eos> That woman, I don't know who she is.<eos> She became somebody else when I wasn't looking.<eos> Paul... you can watch over people but you can't make choices for them.
A human?<eos> Are you talking about cannibalism?<eos> There's no other explanation.<eos> How is it that only the non-fishermen managed to elude the pirates?<eos> Dumb luck.<eos> I was on deck watch.<eos> Saw a boat approaching, lights out.<eos> Before I knew it, guys with guns were swarming the place.<eos> Yeah, there's still something I don't understand.<eos> Look, man, I wasn't going to alert the rest of the crew and get killed with them.
- Yes.<eos> Hey, Valera.<eos> Hey.<eos> You get anything out of our two castaways?<eos> Depends on how you like your data - raw or cooked?<eos> Fine Young Cannibals?<eos> Found human DNA in the stomach contents.<eos> Spectra's a match to our victim, Chip Manning.<eos> So they did eat their friend.<eos> One of them did.
I, I'm continuing with the investigation.<eos> Well, I saw everything. Don't you want my help?<eos> I do want your help.<eos> I'm smarter than people think I am.<eos> All right, have you... have you ever looked at mug shots?<eos> You know what? Let's go find out.<eos> Let's look at some, all right?<eos> Colton's not in here.<eos> All right, you konw, sometimes... sometimes people look different in pictures.<eos> Then how do you know it's them?
What's going on ?<eos> Oh, hi, Paige. we're packing up, closing down the school.<eos> What ?<eos> Since when ?<eos> Since Gideon died.<eos> Look, love him or hate him, he started this magic school, and without him, there's no one left to fight for it anymore.<eos> I'll fight for it.<eos> Against the Elders ?<eos> You don't stand a chance.<eos> No offense, but Gideon was the only one that could stand up to them and convince them he could keep it safe from demons discovering us or mortals for that matter.
"Harry Potter".<eos> Filled with juvenile delinquents.<eos> Even "The Wizard of Oz"?<eos> Disparaging to little people.<eos> Munchkins being persecuted.<eos> Filth!<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Seriously.<eos> It is the same story with all the books.<eos> None of them deserve to be banned.
Let this girl, Quick as a sneeze,<eos> Stop this snit and quickly freeze.<eos> That's better.<eos> Why is my daughter a statue?<eos> She's fine.<eos> She'll thaw out in a minute.<eos> How do I know she won't be this way forever, that it won't backfire like your last brilliant spell?<eos> Have you heard a peep out of those boys?<eos> No.<eos> Because the spell worked, pulled the rivalry right out of them.
What about the demons?<eos> Yeah, I couldn't find anything in the book to help identify them.<eos> But I did get to read up on the family history.<eos> Did you know that Beatrice Warren only had one leg?<eos> What is this?<eos> You making spaghetti sauce?<eos> No.<eos> That's, uh, demon blood.<eos> I got it from the salvage yard.<eos> I was gonna use it to scry for them after I make the vanquishing potion.
We know they're a threat.<eos> Why, because they have power?<eos> Yes.<eos> The kind of power that in the wrong hands could be a danger to us all.<eos> Ok, so, are we a threat?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Elders.<eos> I mean, we have a great power, but we're only a threat to demons.<eos> And your point is?<eos> My point is is that we don't know enough about them to fear them.
They would show themselves.<eos> This is no time to lose your faith in all that we're about,<eos> Leo, despite all that's happened in the past.<eos> We need you on our side.<eos> Have you seen Phoebe and Paige?<eos> Aren't they upstairs making potions?<eos> No.<eos> How are the boys?<eos> They're fine.<eos> Miss Donovan's with them.
One potion.<eos> That's all you have.<eos> You cannot get even with them all.<eos> Oh, the hell I can't.<eos> Their powers are all tied together.<eos> You kill one of them, it weakens them all.<eos> They become vulnerable.<eos> This is ridiculous!<eos> Leo did not kill your parents!<eos> If he's one of them, he did.
We came to you to help us get rid of them.<eos> This is the only way to get rid of them.<eos> When my parents uncovered this, they didn't just discover a potion.<eos> They discovered a battle that happened five thousand years ago over our very future.<eos> They fought the Avatars then, and we gotta fight 'em now.<eos> What happened in here?<eos> Piper?<eos> Upstairs!<eos> At least we know she's okay.<eos> Well, looks like the demons didn't wait for us to go after them.
When I started thinking about what my kids' lives would be like fighting the battles we've been fighting our entire lives.<eos> But it's what we do.<eos> It's what we were born to do.<eos> That does not mean we have to die doing it.<eos> Yeah, maybe you should try to talk to Kyle, hear his side of the story.<eos> I don't need to.<eos> I need to vanquish demons again.<eos> Now what?<eos> How is it you're the only one who still lives?<eos> I wasn't with them. I swear!
Nope.<eos> Lost Boys left earlier.<eos> Lost Boys?<eos> / Yeah.<eos> Danville had a group of young boys that worshipped him.<eos> Fed his ego. / From Collins Brothers, the firm where he worked?<eos> They wished.<eos> Danville's boys weren't Ivy League.<eos> They were wannabes.<eos> On the outside looking in, until Danville took pity on them about a month before he died.
Fifth day ought to teach her a lesson.<eos> Fifth day is right.<eos> Take that gleam outa that quiff's eye.<eos> Go on, Jonesy.<eos> You show her.<eos> Here's your milk.<eos> So maybe Jonesy was our evil milkman and not Pierce.<eos> No Jonesy listed as a victim in the fire.<eos> But all them fifth day guys got messed up in the fire, right?<eos> So how'd Jonesy get involved with them?
Really?<eos> When Adam gets home, it gets more interesting.<eos> He crossed state lines driving a "peace van" loaded with weed.<eos> Arrested for drug sales.<eos> Thought he was too disorganized for that.<eos> The case should have bought him state time.<eos> But then the feds took over jurisdiction.<eos> Poof.<eos> Case went away.<eos> He made a deal with them.
Yeah, it is.<eos> - You going trick or treating tonight? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> I'm taking half that candy.<eos> Don't say a word to her.<eos> You put it in the pantry, I'll divide it up.<eos> Understand?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Now listen, I've got some friends coming over this weekend to watch the ballgame, so be nice to them.
Pardon me?<eos> I said I object.<eos> Maria I need to talk to you.<eos> This is kind of a bad time, Sarah.<eos> Do you think it could wait?<eos> It's about Bryan.<eos> Maria... he's alive.<eos> Ten years ago, I was in your place.<eos> I was in love with two men.<eos> And I believed that one of them was gone forever.
- That's not how this is going to work.<eos> - No, no, no..<eos> Let her kill me.<eos> You think you can stop the future?<eos> Do you?<eos> You take down Eyetrap...<eos> And there's gonna be another program just like it on line before the new year.<eos> And you know why?<eos> Because the American public is buying what we're selling,<eos> They think our technology protects them and it's good for them.
Mr. Swearengen wants to see ya.<eos> I only hope you understand me being short with you<eos> - out in the street this morning.<eos> - You had a lot on your mind.<eos> I had a lot on what's left of my fucking mind, these new interests coming in.<eos> I only hope you understand and see my thinking in not selling you that lot outright.<eos> What's your thinking today?<eos> Gets dead set at the fucking point, which I like in most situations.<eos> Do you know these new saloon interests?<eos> - Are you acquainted with them at all?

Play some poker.<eos> Drink some whiskey.<eos> Thanks for your help.<eos> See ya later, Charlie.<eos> All right, Bill.<eos> Ready, lift.<eos> Oh, there we go.<eos> For having nothing to do with him, these hardware cocksuckers sure seem to be joined to Hickok at the hip.<eos> You made your judgment on that situation and I believe you judged correct.<eos> No connection between them and him?

Your boys work quickly.<eos> Well...obviously, they will be punished for this -- severely.<eos> I hesitate bringing this up, since you got so ugly about it last time... they don't have attention-deficit disorder, and I'm not going to drug my boys just to make your job easier.<eos> I'd rather change teachers.<eos> The boys are in my class because I'm the only teacher who can handle them.<eos> What if we separate the twins?<eos> Put them in different classes?<eos> They're much calmer when they're not bouncing off one another.<eos> We can try that.<eos> But if it doesn't work, we may no longer be able to accommodate them.
Vitals Q 30 minutes and CBC in an hour and set up a suture set with 4-0 nylon.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Doug, how are you feeling?<eos> - Better. Warmer.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Where is he coming from?<eos> - MRI. - I said he didn't need that.<eos> - Pratt thought otherwise.<eos> Look, it's not my job to make sure your residents listen to you.<eos> I'm getting tired of doctors thinking that we work for them...
E. R. 10x17 "THE STUDENT"<eos> Kertzenstein, Lester.<eos> Lester.<eos> Lester, Lester.<eos> - Very polite.<eos> - He should try Pathology.<eos> That way his patients die before he gets to them.
Maybe a family member can talk sense into him.<eos> Mr. Zeller?<eos> Sir? Can-?<eos> Mr. Zeller. Mr. -<eos> Hey, I've been here for four hours.<eos> Still haven't had a doctor check my foot.<eos> - You seem to be walking on it all right.<eos> - That's not the point.<eos> Well, you see all these patients?<eos> Chances are we're not gonna get to you until most of them go home.
I'll go home, have dinner with Chuck and Cosmo sing some carols, come back.<eos> - Chuck's been cooking, my dad's there.<eos> - All right, go home.<eos> - If we're busy, I'll call.<eos> Otherwise, stay.<eos> - Thank you. You're amazing. Thank you.<eos> - Come be amazing over here.<eos> - I'll check in later.<eos> - Did you call his primaries?<eos> - Rheum says he's too sick for them call Cardiology. Card says call Renal.
We owe you our gratitude.<eos> It's too early to speak of accomplishments.<eos> I'll reserve my gratitude for when the humans have been annihilated.<eos> I've analyzed every link in the grid.<eos> I can't find a single weakness.<eos> The grid is extremely sensitive.<eos> We'd be detected the instant we pass through.<eos> We could try disabling it.<eos> It utilizes thousands of satellites.<eos> If one of them goes out of commission... it fills the gap.
It's good to see you again, Captain.<eos> Damage report.<eos> We'll have impulse power in six hours.<eos> Aft torpedo launchers and one forward phase-cannon are on line.<eos> Have Hoshi and Travis start analyzing that pod.<eos> Its configuration suggests it's Aquatic.<eos> I was aboard one of their ships.<eos> That's the last thing I remember.<eos> Do you have any idea why they released you?<eos> I think I may have gotten through to one of them.
Hopefully, without any casualties.<eos> Set a course.<eos> - Can I have a word with you?<eos> - Not right now.<eos> If I had another option, I'd take it.<eos> We're no different than the marauders who attacked us when we entered the Expanse.<eos> We're a lot different.<eos> By stealing their warp coil, we could be condemning them to death.<eos> We're going to leave them a supply of trellium, along with some extra food.<eos> I'm not saying it'll be easy for them, but they'll stand a decent chance of making it home.
I find that hard to believe.<eos> It's the truth.<eos> I was a prisoner.<eos> Because of my transgressions, I spent my entire adult life inside a cell.<eos> One day, the guards offered me freedom if I would participate in an experiment.<eos> I agreed.<eos> That's all I remember before I woke up here.<eos> We found you drifting in a pod, hooked up to banks of monitoring equipment.<eos> You're telling me you have no idea why.<eos> The experiment was important to them.
Impressive.<eos> Archer's science officer believes the weapon is unstable.<eos> It nearly overloaded.<eos> The Vulcan ?<eos> I have no reason to doubt her assessment.<eos> She seems... competent.<eos> We'll review her data.<eos> Proceed as planned.<eos> General, the humans may yet become valuable allies.<eos> If your mission is successful, we won't need an alliance with them or anyone.
We'll face the Council together.<eos> I may take my seat at the Council table,... but I'll be at your side no matter what happens.<eos> Bridge to Captain Archer.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> We've picked up several Xindi vessels.<eos> They're closing on our position.<eos> Humanoids, Arboreals and Aquatics-- they're with us.<eos> When we reach the Council's location, we'll need their protection.<eos> Certain members have more influence than others.<eos> Anything you can tell me about them?
-Did you invite anyone else?<eos> -We masked our warp trail.<eos> I don't know how they found us.<eos> With the humans?<eos> I suppose the Council authorized these negotiations.<eos> No one authorized the development of a bio-weapon,... but that didn't deter your colleagues from creating one.<eos> Undock from the human vessel immediately.<eos> He intends to seize the human vessel.<eos> He'll destroy both our ships if we don't comply.<eos> We don't stand a chance against them, not in the shape we're in.
I'll drive.<eos> Hey, this isn't your fault, or Bright's.<eos> It's mine.<eos> You were just trying to talk to him.<eos> Yeah, you never had these-these kinds of problems before you started finding excuses to stop by the drug store.<eos> I told you then that you didn't want someone like me around and I probably should've bowed out a few weeks ago.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I didn't let my parents make my decisions for me and I'm not going to let you do that either.<eos> Bright was right.<eos> I did choose you over them.
- But you've taken the test, right?<eos> - No.<eos> And I'm not going to.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> I don't want you to think for a second that I know how I would deal with this situation and I'm sure that you've thought about it a gazillion times but the fact that there is an answer out there waiting for you, inside of you don't you wanna know so you can take it off the table?<eos> Move on?<eos> What if I don't have the option to just take it off the table?<eos> The way I was raised, there's this thing about destiny.<eos> It's a given.<eos> Our parents pass down this genetic makeup that's like a symbol of them in some way.
Sit down.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You okay?<eos> Look, what's important is what you do about this now.<eos> He's not a baby any more, Sara.<eos> He's growing up.<eos> He's getting stronger.<eos> Which means his outbursts are going to be increasingly dangerous.<eos> Well, I'll keep a closer eye on them.
No. You should go that.<eos> I've never met your friends from school.<eos> Yeah, I know and you're not missing anything.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I want to.<eos> After all the time we spend together, I think I should meet yours.<eos> If you don't mind.<eos> I would love for you to go.<eos> I can show you off to all my friends.<eos> You're like a goddess to them.
Listen.<eos> You gotta make Debra quit.<eos> What?<eos> Get her outta there.<eos> What are you talkin' about?<eos> You just said everything was fine.<eos> I lied.<eos> The guys at the lodge are... ogling your woman.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Is Debra really flirting with them?
It's true 'cause we usually let it divide and conquer us, but tonight it was you and me. We had the power.<eos> We beat her. Yeah. Yeah.<eos> And she's tough to beat.<eos> The guilt. - Yeah.<eos> She majored in guilt... with a minor in crazy.<eos> You know what?<eos> I got a buddy on the force, and his parents just moved to California.<eos> He sees them twice a year, tops.<eos> Oh, how great would that be?<eos> You know, it would be, like, us... America... - them.
We need your parents to move out.<eos> What?<eos> I'm sorry to be so blunt, but there have been a number of issues, and they need to go.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You're kicking them out? Yes.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Frank and Marie seem incredibly happy here.<eos> I assure you, they're the only ones.<eos> Your father's been tearing around on his golf cart endangering pedestrians.<eos> Oh? When our security guards warn your father, he turns his cart and aims for them.
How do you think that reflects on me?<eos> Hmm, do I smell something?<eos> It's a combination of Eau de Munich and jealousy.<eos> Well, I smell something, too.<eos> It is called Idiot Magazine und you're on the cover.<eos> And how do I look? !<eos> Fantastic!<eos> Be still, my Heinrich.<eos> Roy's heart is as soft as the lotioned hands that now caress you like a velvet wool.<eos> You just said 12 words and eight of them would get you shot in my neighborhood.
- I've worked with Joan Crawford.<eos> This is worse.<eos> I don't call that a "maypole." I'd call that a "maybe-not pole."<eos> What's with him?<eos> He's mad because I made Chrissy my dance captain over him.<eos> - Kirk has forty-three jobs.<eos> - Would you go talk to him, please?<eos> - I got my hands full here.<eos> - The Banyan boys?<eos> Oh! Lucifer tired of them in hell and dumped them here.
- Hey, Mom.<eos> - Yeah. - You sound happy.<eos> - I am, kid.<eos> What?<eos> Mr. Mailer, it's just such a great honor to be doing this interview.<eos> So I just want to thank you...<eos> - Can I give you a tip?<eos> I wouldn't start that way for a simple reason. I don't trust compliments.<eos> I've been getting them for years. Sometimes I deserved them, sometimes I didn't.<eos> But generally when people give you a compliment... there's one of two things wrong with them.
It's sort of a secret society, kind of Skull and Bones... kind of creepy group, dating back to the 1800s.<eos> This phrase was their motto.<eos> Now, that alone, not that interesting.<eos> But here. Look.<eos> I found this in a 1996 edition of the Yale Daily News.<eos> It's an article on whether or not this club actually exists.<eos> A life and death brigade.<eos> Yeah, I know these guys.<eos> - You do?<eos> - No, I've heard of them.
But here.

Luke's coming?<eos> - Is he not supposed to?<eos> No, no, of course he was.<eos> I mean, he was invited quite a while ago... before anything happened.<eos> I mean, I didn't know he was coming, that's all. Okay, so good.<eos> Luke's in room seven.<eos> Lucky number seven.<eos> Not that it's lucky for Luke, 'cause I don't know what's lucky for Luke, okay?<eos> Look at how he chopped these onions.<eos> I just want to shove a string through them and wear them around my neck!
Why can't we tell your parents about this?<eos> I just think it's weird.<eos> You're in business with my father and he won't like this.<eos> He'll get used to it.<eos> My father has never gotten used to anything.<eos> He still misses diesel fuel, for God's sake.<eos> You don't find it exhausting, keeping secrets?<eos> You have to watch everything you say.<eos> I always have to watch everything that I say around my parents anyway.<eos> Okay, how about we just tell one of them, just to see how that goes?
I've been up for one and a half days straight.<eos> I haven't done that since the "Petticoat Junction" marathon in '97.<eos> Right.<eos> Caught a little of that myself.<eos> Luke, turkey sandwich on rye, please -- lettuce, tomato, cucumber.<eos> Coming right up.<eos> We're gonna do it, Taylor!<eos> - We're gonna find those last twelve eggs!<eos> - Cole slaw, too.<eos> - Every last one of them!
Someone ralphed in there this morning.<eos> We cleaned it up, but...<eos> It's normal, Sister.<eos> I-it's just a few more minutes.<eos> I believe in a higher order, that can control what happens, but not one anthropomorphic entity called "God" that's concerned with the everyday workings of you and me.<eos> What else is there to control but the everyday workings of you and me?<eos> It's always about you, Foreman.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The trees, the fish?<eos> Should they be the ones that think it's all about them?
- You know nuns.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - I don't know nuns.<eos> You hate nuns.<eos> You can't hate someone if you don't know them.<eos> Know any Nazis?<eos> Maybe I hate them on principle.<eos> I have a theory about what makes good boys good.<eos> It's not because of some moral imperative.<eos> Good boys have the fear of God put into them.
If he's having night terrors, I want to see them.<eos> I usually don't move during night terrors.<eos> I'm not restraining you for them.<eos> E.E.G. revealed abnormalities in your brain-- caused nerve damage in your toes.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Can I talk to my parents?<eos> Oh, they know all about this.<eos> I'd really like to see them.<eos> Please.<eos> I'd really like them here.
You take what he tells you to take.<eos> No one believes me.<eos> I do.<eos> I thought he liked rationality.<eos> He likes puzzles.<eos> Patients are puzzles?<eos> You don't think so?<eos> I think they're people.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, he hates them, and he's fascinated by them.
Henley motors?<eos> A garage on the west side.<eos> Each of the victims there had a tune-up there a week before their death.<eos> Timmons got his brakes fixed Friday.<eos> Henley motors.<eos> So you're saying we have a psycho mechanic on our hands?<eos> Yep.<eos> The same name on all the paperwork at Henley.<eos> Charles Newcomb.<eos> My guess is he chats up his customers, copies their keys, and then pays them a late-night visit.
I want us to counter sue the Bakers.<eos> And you thought an egg salad sandwich would change my mind?<eos> Look Helen, I know you're a better person than me.<eos> I know you have all this faith in the goodness of people, but do you really think the Bakers are suddenly going to realize how selfish they are?<eos> Or the judge is going to see the light and throw the case out--<eos> Hey, don't patronize me, and don't use my faith to treat me like an idiot.<eos> You think I don't know how greedy these people are?<eos> We're gonna have to dig into the kids' college money.<eos> We may have to put the house on the market.<eos> I just hoped we wouldn't have to become like them.
How did you even get this information?<eos> Now it's wrong to try and protect my family?<eos> Dad, mom's right.<eos> If the Bakers are our moral compass, we're pretty lost.<eos> Counter suing, that's enough.<eos> I gave the computer to the church along with all the money I had, but I still feel like the bottom of a bird cage.<eos> Your mom freaks me out.<eos> She didn't call my parents.<eos> That's because she knows guilt is a much more effective weapon.<eos> Man, if my parents found out... they'd make it all about them, drag us back into family therapy.
Geez, Gina, I can smell your perfume from the top of the stairs.<eos> I'm not wearing any perfume.<eos> The, uh, the bottle said "unisex."<eos> How are you this morning?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm a little frustrated about my career.<eos> I came out here a couple of months ago with all these goals and I haven't achieved any of them.
I mean, I like L.A. and all, but being between projects and not knowing that many people yet, I'm kind of lonely.<eos> How are you supposed to make friends as an adult?<eos> Have you met anybody nice in the building?<eos> Well, there actually is this one guy, Jake.<eos> He lives across the courtyard. He seems really cool.<eos> Well, have you talked to him?<eos> Kinda, yeah.<eos> I've run into him a couple times by the mailboxes.<eos> He's always going out to play basketball with his friends.<eos> Man, if I knew him, I could play ball with them, too.
Shit, she's wild, Al.<eos> Oh, okay, please with the details!<eos> God!<eos> Why's my mom such a slutty, slutty, chicken-chasing pervert?<eos> I mean, god, you know, not to mention a liar, because she said you came on to her, and she was just being polite!<eos> She's wild.<eos> Uh, well, you can say your goodbyes because she is going back to Nelson's. I am not driving her to Palm Springs, they can do that. She put her name on the chart.<eos> Do you know that? I mean, what is that?<eos> I mean, who di ... where'd she come from?<eos> Okay, there's two guys staring at you, and I think one of them is Harry Samchuck.
I know that they know I'm gay, I just really don't want to talk about it with them.<eos> Oh, they're such pervs.<eos> Well, why are they pervs?<eos> Well, they have this cabinet that they normally keep locked in the media room.<eos> Anyway, one night they got drunk, and left some stuff out, and Consuela was cleaning the next day and just happened to push play on the VCR, and up pops my mom... buck naked, okay, riding my day... whipping him with a switch.I t was pretty gross.<eos> You know, but you gotta... you gotta give it to your folks, I mean... they want to keep their life interesting. And they... .<eos> - they still want to get it on<eos> You know. I've never met anyone like you before.<eos> Well that's - that's not necessarily a very good thing.<eos> Tell me more about your parents. Like, how come you didn't live with them?
The five seat is James Rollins.<eos> His wife sits at the sixth seat.<eos> They're here from New Jersey.<eos> Third seat here, we got Steve Collins, ski bum from Utah.<eos> What's your point, Mike?<eos> My point is, these people have absolutely no connection to each other whatsoever.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Positive.<eos> As far as we can tell... the first time any of them ever met is at this table.<eos> You run a background check on all of them?
I got him and his ex-widow parked upstairs right now.<eos> Got Mary riding shotgun.<eos> Sounds like a plum gig.<eos> How's everything going here?<eos> It's really quiet.<eos> - How about Sam's whale?<eos> - He's been circling the tables for hours... but he hasn't even nibbled at the bait.<eos> Danny, do you believe that certain people deserve each other?<eos> You wanna talk about us now?<eos> Not us, Danny, them.
I had such an array of interests, I had a hard time finding myself.<eos> Have you found yourself now?<eos> I suppose not.<eos> But, you know, I don't plan on doing this work forever.<eos> You're going to play to your other strength, picking up lonely women?<eos> A man has to nourish his soul.<eos> What are these?<eos> Food?<eos> Your fellow artists on Columbus Avenue said you were there the weekends before these four girls disappeared.<eos> Well, that means they were there, too. Any of them could have drawn these sketches.
Hospital security cameras recorded her walking out with Abraham.<eos> She didn't look like she was being forced. / She wasn't.<eos> This cult is all she knows.<eos> She went with Abraham because she wanted to.<eos> You find her mother?<eos> This woman says that her name is Sarah.<eos> She won't admit to anything, but listen to her voice.<eos> You're willing to go to jail for this guy's crimes?<eos> I'm willing to make a sacrifice in the name of God the father.<eos> Just tell me if one of them was a boy. Nine years old, brown eyes, brown hair.
We have her on tape.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> In that restroom. Yeah, we do.<eos> We talked to her.<eos> She won't say anything to you.<eos> Well, she has been getting a little weird lately.<eos> How so?<eos> She and my dad have been fighting.<eos> That's what married folks do.<eos> Yeah, but not them.
Maybe if dying is what Christina really wanted, it's okay.<eos> (Munch) She never told you she was suicidal, did she?<eos> Not once, I could have helped her.<eos> Allison, none of this is your fault.<eos> Why couldn't she have just talked to me?<eos> Well, maybe she didn't want to burden you.<eos> But now I'm all alone.<eos> She should have thought about that.<eos> People who commit suicide don't always consider the mess they leave behind.<eos> Or they think people will be better off without them.
Drinking with the detectives.<eos> They ever release the number of stab wounds in the second victim?<eos> No, that I charmed out of little cutie in the M.E.'s office.<eos> You mind lighting me up, sweetheart?<eos> No, not at all. You ever print that detail?<eos> Tried, damn editor came down with a case of ethics.<eos> So your notebooks at the paper, you left them there when you retired?<eos> Hell, no.<eos> Those get buried with me.<eos> But your research assistant, Humphrey Becker, he would have had access to them, right?
If I'm stuck in here, so is he.<eos> Anyone walks in or out that door, game's over.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm the final clue.<eos> Okay.<eos> Think you're smart enough to get it out of me?<eos> One way or another.<eos> I must warn you, I am going to be quite the challenge.<eos> I know every trick in the book.<eos> I've written 27 of them.
Britain, Britain, Britain!<eos> Opened by the Queen in 1972, Britain now attracts hundreds of visitors a year.<eos> But why do they come?<eos> Not just to discover how chicken nuggets should really taste or to take part in the great British tradition of dogging.<eos> No, they come in their drove to meet the people of Britain.<eos> And it is them what we now here look at now today.
- And I want that one.<eos> Right. See you in a bit, then.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> Catch me breath.<eos> What a kerfuffle.<eos> Come on, Louis.<eos> You can do this.<eos> At this jeweller's in Gristle, a robbery has just taken place.<eos> So, Viv, you were standing here at the time of the robbery when three men came in.<eos> One of them was carrying a gun.
Britain, Britain, Britain!<eos> I love Britain so much that every day I sacrifice a child in honour of it.<eos> So thank the Lord, who incidentally is British, for the great things he has brought to this land.<eos> Take A Break, Spearmint Rhino and Findus Crispy Pancakes.<eos> But also let us give thanks for the people of Britain and it is them whom we'll be doing looking at today.
Could you give it to me?<eos> It was part of the choir, it is possible that she wants to join us work her singing<eos> With great pleasure.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you host presenter PBS Frank Walston.<eos> Before receiving our guest of honor<eos> I'd like to tell you all a few words about courtesy<eos> I am aware that from time to time good ways seem to be a bunch of cans rules invented by our parents lectured us to better<eos> That you said!<eos> But the way it's so much<eos> Only human beings have a code reminding them to behave them
- What guys?<eos> The guys who beat me up in the parking lot.<eos> When was this?<eos> Couple of months ago.<eos> No, wait, it was... last week.<eos> You know, I was putting the promotional flyers all over the windshields and stuff. These two dudes came up from nowhere, just started pounding on me.<eos> Beat the bejesus out of me.<eos> - Did they take your money?<eos> - No, man. They were just beating me up. Wailing on me, no reason.<eos> And you're sure it was them.
- Wouldn't you rather pay cash?<eos> What's going on?<eos> I don't know. She just typed in their zip code without asking what it was.<eos> She knows them, but she's pretending not to.<eos> What do you know about her?<eos> That's Jennie silverman. She's the best employee we got.<eos> They just offered her a management position at the new store in Livingston, and she turned it down.<eos> - Why would she do that?<eos> - I don't know. Maybe she has friends here she's loyal to.<eos> Those two cops were married, and one of them had kids.

Okay.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> - That was Tony.<eos> - Fat Tony?<eos> He's not fat.<eos> You know, he asked me out on a date, and, uh... I told him I'd think about it.<eos> Sharona, you know what kind of man he is.<eos> Yeah, but that's what I like about him.<eos> Look, I, I know you always want to check out my dates and find out what's wrong with them, but at least with Tony, I already know he's a criminal.
- No. I'm sorry.<eos> I guess I never really expected him to.<eos> Never trust a Fed.<eos> I should've decked him.<eos> No. Don't worry.<eos> I got him back.<eos> Really?<eos> What'd you do? - See their vans?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> One of them is packed full. The other one isn't even half full.
Obviously, they're surveillance photos.<eos> Hottie.<eos> Don't you think she's a little bit too old for you, Tony?<eos> No.<eos> She's about my age.<eos> That's exactly my point.<eos> There's nothing on the card but candids.<eos> Based on the date-time stamp, they were all taken in the past two days.<eos> I interviewed all the workers.<eos> Nobody remembers seeing Pacci or anything unusual, but one of them did find this.
I don't understand.<eos> You're partners with Sean McNamara.<eos> Why is he not fixing it for you?<eos> The scar is gonna feel tight for a while, but otherwise you're healing nicely.<eos> What do you think, Jess?<eos> - I kind of miss it.<eos> - Miss it?<eos> It scared people.<eos> It was a part of you.<eos> I love you because of your flaws, not despite them.
And from what I've witnessed, you're a survivor.<eos> And survivors reinvent themselves.<eos> They rise from the ashes of their failures like phoenixes... and fly off to their next destination.<eos> Well, Julia, we've come full circle, haven't we?<eos> You're coaching me now.<eos> The truth of the matter is, Ava, you really were a good life coach.<eos> And if it wasn't for you and the truths that you forced... I wouldn't be able to stand up to you now.<eos> I'm not leaving that easily, Julia.<eos> If you want me gone, then you talk to your doctors.<eos> What do you want them to do?
I can't do this.<eos> I obviously don't feel comfortable operating on you.<eos> So long as Christian doesn't have a problem doing the surgery.<eos> No, Sean.<eos> You. I want you to do it.<eos> Julia, may I remind you that your mother was very happy with her face-lift.<eos> Nobody knows my face better than you, Sean.<eos> Nobody.<eos> And your breasts?<eos> You didn't come to me for them.
You can relax.<eos> We're not here to pressure you into any surgery.<eos> I want a facelift.<eos> I mean, choosing the two of you was a mistake.<eos> Before you jump to any conclusions, can I give you a list of our references?<eos> Save the spiel.<eos> The lady in your waiting room convinced me you weren't worth my time.<eos> I just wanted to see for myself.<eos> These butchers aren't interested in your feelings.<eos> You're just a literal pound of flesh to them.
- Cause you said he was just checking in. - Yeah... nah...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean,<eos> - Seth's still angry. I guess he blames his parents.<eos> - For you leaving?<eos> I can't imagine what he thinks about me.<eos> - So you gonna go to Portland?<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> - You should go if you want to go.<eos> - It's for them to figure out...
No, I'm just looking for a cork screw.<eos> Well, you better find one or you'll never get me drunk.<eos> Dan?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sure you're a great person, Carrie.<eos> But I have a wife I love very much.<eos> That's sweet, but also a coincidence.<eos> Since I have a husband I love very much.<eos> But then again, our spouses aren't here, are they?<eos> Or maybe one of them is.
You know, I'm not sure how to describe it.<eos> -Put it this way, are you two getting....<eos> -Peyton.<eos> Because if you were, I'd describe it as pretty lucky.<eos> He's a fox.<eos> So, how was your other date with the cancellation? -Why?<eos> You wanna ask him out?<eos> -No.<eos> I just didn't know you were seeing other people.<eos> If you're one of them, I'd shut up.
-Stop it.<eos> There she is, smoking crack and sleeping in the gutter.<eos> Did you know... that my parents forbade me to marry you?<eos> -Why?<eos> -Because they thought we were too young.<eos> -Why didn't you listen?<eos> -Because I loved you.<eos> In the end we got married all the same.<eos> We've made quite a life together.<eos> But I always loved them less for not seeing what I saw in you.
That spot's yours.<eos> It will be there when you're ready.<eos> Yeah, I know but...<eos> If we lose a game or two along the way then so be it.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> But we both know you need another shooter.<eos> If that means that you've got to fill my spot, then I'm asking you to give someone else a chance.<eos> Look the guys are undefeated.<eos> That's important to me.<eos> It's important to them.
We get to hang out with our friends, get all dressed up and slow dance.<eos> -How can you not be excited about this?<eos> -Because my parents are chaperones.<eos> Okay, there's that.<eos> So what? Safety in numbers.<eos> I got your back.<eos> Do we really have to go to this stupid dance?<eos> AII right, maybe not.<eos> I mean... once I get you in that tux maybe I'll decide we should stay in.<eos> -Just don't leave me alone with them.
- Worse!<eos> Yeah.<eos> You see, then a funny thing happened;<eos> Haley.<eos> She showed me that you can find the good in everybody, if you just give them a chance.<eos> The benefit of the doubt.<eos> Sometimes, people disappoint you.<eos> Sometimes they surprise you.<eos> But you never really get to know them... until you listen for what's in their hearts and that's what Haley did with Nathan.<eos> That's what we should do for them.
Well, selling the shop really couldn't be avoided.<eos> I'm curious why you quit so soon after they hired you on.<eos> Well, the new management was taking things in a different direction.<eos> And you had a problem with that?<eos> The new management was my brother. And he's an ass.<eos> I see.<eos> Mr. Scott, you may be qualified from a technical standpoint, but teaching teenagers is a whole other thing.<eos> Why do you want this job?<eos> To me, it's not about teaching them to change a spark plug.<eos> It's about giving them the confidence to do something that maybe they think they couldn't do before. And once you do that, you've earned their trust.
I'm sierra, Drew's fiancée.<eos> Oh, congratulations.<eos> Uh, h-he's quite a guy.<eos> Yes, it seems I landed the big one.<eos> You certainly did.<eos> Well, it's nice to see you again.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Drew would be so disappointed if you didn't stop by the locker room to say hello.<eos> I-I'd love to, but w-we're with friends.<eos> So bring them along.
You stopped giving us allowance so you could buy a motorcycle?<eos> All right!<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> What is this?<eos> It's called "thunder and lightning", and I look awesome on it, and I'm not giving it back.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - That's right.<eos> I deserve it.<eos> Ever since the quints were born, every cent I've earned has gone into raising them.
Get her on the phone!<eos> - I haven't seen her all morning.<eos> - Find her!<eos> It's good to have you back, David.<eos> You'll get over that in a day or two.<eos> Hira, you're employed by a lab that handles everything from toxic mould to P-strain 872, where--<eos> Don't patronize me, Caroline.<eos> I know what it is.<eos> Do you recognize these men?<eos> Some of them.
They have some great stuff on there.<eos> They are lunatics, Mayko.<eos> Just hear me out.<eos> In the Iraq war this company, Battle Support Services - the Pentagon outsources a lot of the grunt work so it doesn't look like it has too many soldiers overseas, right - so Battle Support Services hired a group of poor, mostly minority Americans<eos> to do clean up work at the base in Kirkuk.<eos> One team, CC3 was sent to do hazardous waste removal at a bombed out site in the south.<eos> I read about this somewhere.<eos> Various members of the crew came down with lots of different ailments.<eos> Yup.<eos> Almost a third of them.
You're a pussy, and there ain't no room for pussies in the FDNY.<eos> What are you laughing at, shit head? Huh?<eos> What's so goddamn funny?<eos> - I just...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You speak when spoken to.<eos> You pussies better pray you don't get assigned to my firehouse because I have seen it all.<eos> I knew 60 men who gave their lives at Ground Zero.<eos> Sixty.<eos> Four of them from my house.
Carrie, why aren't I with him?<eos> Because I am?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - What?<eos> All right, I'm sorry.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> He's my age, and you've got him.<eos> And I am in no-man's-land, literally.<eos> No man anywhere.<eos> Men can date anyone, any age, but let's be frank... most of them prefer the bimbos.
-You have any idea how tough it is?<eos> Aren't you worried the killers know you can identify them?<eos> -They don't know my name.<eos> -It's on the news, right?<eos> -But they won't know where I live.<eos> -Are you in the phone book?<eos> Y'all are gonna protect me, right?<eos> -Edixon?<eos> -All right. Ronnie says the Decoy Squad brought in some other witnesses.<eos> Aceveda's definitely auditioning them to replace us.
Bad car.<eos> Apologize to the poor little boy.<eos> This shirt is humorlarious.<eos> Let's see what else you've got.<eos> Amazing, trailblazing, insightful, delightful, hysterical, a miracle!<eos> The kids'll go cuckoo for these.<eos> My name's Goose Gladwell.<eos> Of Goose's Gags and Gifts? !<eos> That's right.<eos> I've got 20 stores in 30 states, and I want to sell your shirts in most of them.
Yeah, but it's not a good life.<eos> Gina, before we get any closer, there's something you need to know about me.<eos> I think girls are icky-pants.<eos> Took a lot of courage to say that.<eos> Courage I'm going to pinch out of you.<eos> ( Grunting and laughing )<eos> wiggum:<eos> Say, cletus, have you seen a couple of kids go by?<eos> I don't have such a good memory since I drank my thermometer... but I whittles what I sees.<eos> Is this them?
Gimme some more of that.<eos> ay yay yay !<eos> What do you think ?<eos> I just remembered the first time I ever realized what dad really did in this house.<eos> I had this dog, yippie, and I found him underneath my bed and he was already dead, so... I wrapped him up in a blanket and I brought him downstairs to the prep room.<eos> I thought maybe dad could fix him, you know, bring him back somehow.<eos> Then I realized there were all these bodies down there... and they were all dead.<eos> And dad was fixing them, but he wasn't bringing anybody back.<eos> He was just making them more... presentable.<eos> I always thought they were so sad and alone in the dark down there, they just needed someone to come and sit with them.
If I could find him!<eos> Look Rico, he's a speed freak and a deadbeat, we're better of without him, believe me!<eos> And if you come to the club tonight, don't call me Sophia!<eos> - My club name is Inf...<eos> - Infinity!<eos> Infinity, I know.<eos> Alright, let's get this thing hooked up!<eos> Wanna help me?<eos> i just figured nobody knows more about crazy people than i do,<eos> I was raised by them, I am one of them and really am way to old to be rubbing on strangers.
Yeah, they're from before I was working at the club.<eos> I can afford food of course !<eos> It's just if I get the food stamps, then I can save the cash, for something else.<eos> Hey, you're ok ?<eos> I don't want Nicole to see me cry.<eos> It's just that I'm a little freaked out lately because I'm completly exhausted.<eos> I think it's because I have lupus.<eos> Oh shit are you serious ?<eos> It's caused by leaking implants.<eos> Seriously I feel like one of them ruptured and this is like poison.
Sorry.<eos> Sorry. We were making art.<eos> So, Nate, how's the new job?<eos> It's amazing.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Really? Working at a kennel?<eos> It's not a kennel, it's a canine retreat.<eos> What's so great about it?<eos> It makes me feel like I'm 25 again and life is simple and nothing horrible has ever happened to me.<eos> The great thing is that the dogs seem to care as much about me as I care about them.
At least with the whole farm boy plaid thing - as lame as it is -it completely belongs to you.<eos> In the future, let's restrict our conversations to "hello" and "goodbye. "<eos> And those thighs?<eos> 1, 2, 3...<eos> - No!<eos> - No!<eos> Yeah, so the party'sgonna be way kick.<eos> Where are we - some kind of freakish feminist parallel universe?<eos> Hey, chloe, have you seen the way these football players are acting?<eos> Yeah, and I noticed one of them unloaded a shotgun in the boys' locker room.
Don't say it.<eos> Not on the phone.<eos> I know, I won't.<eos> - What should I do?<eos> - I'll tell you what not to do.<eos> - That's come back around here.<eos> - I know.<eos> I know, but... my kids, my boys.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll look after them.
Thank you all for coming.<eos> As you all know, about five months ago our planet suffered a horrible tragedy.<eos> Over two thousand American servicemen and women were killed when a meteor shower disrupted global communications and hit a United States naval carrier group on manoeuvres in the Pacific Ocean.<eos> I'm here today to challenge the facts of that incident as they've been conveyed to the general public.<eos> On the day in question, none of our satellites detected a meteor shower.<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> Now I don't know how many governments around the world are in on this, but I do know we are being lied to and the truth is being covered up.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, there is life beyond our world.<eos> There are aliens out there, and they have a technology far beyond ours, and they have been intervening in our existence for quite some time.<eos> I have proof... and I am giving the governments of all the nations that are aware of this twenty-four hours to reveal the truth... or I'm gonna do it for them.
Careful with your fire we need him alive!<eos> Brooks.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> We've got a small problem here.<eos> Take a locator beacon and go down to Hoskins' last position.<eos> What happened?<eos> We've got an uninvited guest.<eos> Speak.<eos> My Lord Zaren, two enemy Jaffa have been captured near the Gate.<eos> One of them is the shol'va Teal'c.
Don't worry.<eos> The machine was designed to mine naquadria.<eos> In the terms of our alliance, information relating to naquadria is to be shared. We were misled.<eos> We intended to tell you once the prototype was fully operational.<eos> Do you take us for idiots?<eos> It was you that created this disaster.<eos> And now you expect to benefit by acquiring alien technology?<eos> It was unfortunate the Kelownans didn't reveal this information sooner.<eos> However, regarding the Tok'ra crystals, you really have no choice.<eos> Without them we won't reach the naquadria vein in time to save your world. It's that simple.
Where is she?<eos> Is she transcended?<eos> - Or ascended, or something like that?<eos> - No, retired, actually. But... you never know.<eos> So I'm just reading your file here. It's fascinating.<eos> I should ask you immediately here...<eos> You're an alien?<eos> I mean, well, not to you. To us, you would be...<eos> Anyway, you were the highest-ranking officer in the service of our alien enemies.<eos> And you turned against them.
They don't get along so good.<eos> The Rand Protectorate and the caledonian Federation, have been locked in a state of cold war for decades.<eos> Each nation has enough weapons to wipe each other off the face of the planet.<eos> Sounds depressingly familiar.<eos> There's actually a third element that has me a little more concerned.<eos> A group of religious fundamentalists, led by a man named Soren.<eos> Now these people think that all life on the planet was created by ancient Gods, and that these Gods will some day return and reward them for their faith.<eos> And by coming through the Stargate, we've confirmed their beliefs.<eos> Because the gate was activated in a public place, the Rand Government has been unable to prevent the rumours from spreading.<eos> Now before we made contact with them, these people were considered zealots who took the ancient text too literally.
But he won't hear me.<eos> Waste of time.<eos> Waste<eos> Sir, I think the fact that he hasn't left yet, could mean he's still willing to deal.<eos> He has no need for humanitarian aid.<eos> The chaos in his country has only served to strengthen his position.<eos> Well we can't just give up.<eos> Yes, I know that.<eos> We're continuing to monitor countless radio signals coming from the planet.<eos> One of them could be from Daniel.
They have already begun replicating and infesting our systems.<eos> Control of the city is in jeopardy.<eos> Should you not consider evacuating people.<eos> That is no longer possible.<eos> There are too many.<eos> We carried numerous stored minds aboard the computers of our ships, when we fled our home world.<eos> When Orilla was finally found, we were able to replace those minds into cloned bodies, so that we could build our new colony.<eos> The replicators have already infected systems needed to save those minds.<eos> If we lose this battle, they will perish, along with their bodies.<eos> Taking with them, the hopes of the Asgard race.
How could you say that to Steven?<eos> He doesn't want your money.<eos> I want your money.<eos> How could you think that anybody here needs your money?<eos> Look at this place.<eos> Glass grapes, pizza rolls, an organ..<eos> It's like carnegie hall.<eos> I stand by what I said.<eos> What else was I supposed to think?<eos> You're supposed to look at me and know that I raised fine young men, even though one of them is at a feminist rally.
Is that a new muscle?<eos> Well, hello, new muscle.<eos> Welcome to kelso town.<eos> Kelso.<eos> Kelso!<eos> What?<eos> You weren't even listening.<eos> How do you know?<eos> 'Cause you were staring at the ceiling with your tongue hanging out.<eos> Kelso, when a woman talks, you have to look her in the eyes and pretend her words are like oxygen and without them, you can't breathe.
She wanted to get you cookies, but I know how much you like the sauce.<eos> - Red...<eos> - Toyota!<eos> Did you see that look she just gave us?<eos> Was that,<eos> "please don't tell anyone you saw my boobs"?<eos> Or, "please come over and see my boobs again"?<eos> Do you have to keep saying that word?<eos> Let's just call them...<eos> "them."
Donna's back on the radio.<eos> Maybe she'll mention my shop again.<eos> Okay, now it's time for a new segment on my show...<eos> "What's on your mind, Hot Donna?"<eos> When I agreed to promote the Forman and Son calendar, I had no idea it was just pages of half-naked women straddling drive shafts, Which is wrong, wrong, because cars get very hot.<eos> So if they were to do these things, they would easily burn their thighs.<eos> That's right, Forman and son mufflers is promoting the burning of women.<eos> What is she talking about?<eos> Now I would call for a boycott, but girls never go down to these places.<eos> So I call for a going-down-there-and-yelling-at-them... cott.
- You've got a future as a highly paid... Ivy League-educated executive of some sort... who never thinks about private investigation again in her perfect life.<eos> Now, let's do something normal fathers and daughters do.<eos> - I was thinking I'd watch TV... and you'd rub my feet.<eos> - Yeah, that's normal.<eos> - Have you seen my keys?<eos> - You're not leaving, are you?<eos> No, Sarah, I'm not the one who's always running.<eos> Look, I spent the past two hours making small talk with your parents.<eos> - They didn't come 2000 miles to see me.<eos> - I told you, I don't wanna deal with them.
Now, let's do something normal fathers and daughters do.<eos> - I was thinking I'd watch TV... and you'd rub my feet.<eos> - Yeah, that's normal.<eos> - Have you seen my keys?<eos> - You're not leaving, are you?<eos> No, Sarah, I'm not the one who's always running.<eos> Look, I spent the past two hours making small talk with your parents.<eos> - They didn't come 2000 miles to see me.<eos> - I told you, I don't wanna deal with them.<eos> Yeah, well, you're gonna have to deal with them sometime.
The Sea Stallion will then fly them east 200 miles to the USS Cowpens.<eos> So your SEAL team, they'll be armed.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - And if they run into resistance from the North Koreans, they shoot?<eos> - You want them unarmed?<eos> Mr. President, if the North Koreans find armed American soldiers on Korean soil...<eos> - We go get them.<eos> - Mr. President, there are...<eos> We don't leave our people in harm's way, Mr. Barrow.<eos> We bring them home.
I'll be fine.<eos> You should get some rest.<eos> I'm not sure I could sleep.<eos> I'm gonna get dressed.<eos> Yes, Mr. President.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Shut the door.<eos> B-2s have taken off.<eos> Their targets are five uranium enrichment sites in Iran.<eos> We've confirmed it was them?
What's it look like I'm doing ?<eos> Turning tricks for Tootsie Rolls ?<eos> I was kicked out of my place, so I'm moving in here.<eos> Thanks for walking me, Stuart.<eos> The streets are really tough out there for a boy alone.<eos> Ironically, they're tougher for two boys together.<eos> I'm really impressed you're working with patients already.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> As a student nurse, I can't technically touch them, treat them, or care for them.<eos> But I can look kindly at them and be thankful I'm not them.
I'll leave you alone... forever.<eos> Out of my way !<eos> Will, stop him !<eos> He's getting so far away !<eos> Jack, stop !<eos> Jack, no one has ever done anything that romantic for me before.<eos> And in front of all these people.<eos> - So you'll forgive me ?<eos> I've always dreamed of two men holding each other tenderly in my office.<eos> I just always hoped one of them would be me.
Because, if MI5 take over, they can shut us down when they like.<eos> So, why haven't they?<eos> Because Brandon won't let them.<eos> But now Harrison's here, we haven't got much time.<eos> See, that's why you're a DCI and I'm a soon-to-be-unemployed lecturer.<eos> It's the usual political bullshit, Tony.<eos> Just hold your nose and swim.<eos> I could do with some swimming lessons.<eos> So, what are you going to do, Carol?<eos> Are you going to listen to them or listen to me?
A lot of them have been cut loose by the dealers.<eos> It's like one of those nature shows.<eos> Mess with the environment, some species get fucked out of their habitat.<eos> Did you just use the word "habitat"?<eos> I did.<eos> - Letting your lookouts go?<eos> - My runners too.<eos> Shit, what's the point?<eos> Here you are making money hand over fist and you're too greedy to take care of your workforce.<eos> - I don't need them.
"but said the department was awaiting approval...<eos> "of a federal training and education grant before scheduling the program."<eos> Burrell can talk some shit, can't he?<eos> Downtown in the house.<eos> - Hey, Kima baby.<eos> - Hey, Ellis.<eos> Herc.<eos> So, what do we owe the pleasure?<eos> Cruising your district, seeing what's up since the Towers fell.<eos> We see Barksdale crews on a few corners, but no one seems to be beefing with them.
You must be tripping.<eos> Home, James.<eos> I'm gonna tell you, boy, you better keep your head back in the game... or you gonna land us both in the pokey.<eos> - What you looking at?<eos> - You.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I like your eyes.<eos> They're like cat eyes.<eos> - Who you here with?<eos> - Them.
You wanna share a cab?<eos> I live uptown.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I don't want you to move to Chicago with us.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't wanna be married to you anymore.<eos> My parents wouldn't even be together if it weren't for me.<eos> Like they're doing me any favors.<eos> If they want out, they should just do it already.<eos> You have to consider that all of this has been hard on them too.
Financial Aid.<eos> Three employees share that line.<eos> Okay, can I ask you something?<eos> When did Westport install these phones, 1888?<eos> Why can't we get one simple printout that tells us who called and when?<eos> We can.<eos> I just thought that would make finding this woman too easy.<eos> All right.<eos> I ran Westport boosters through Vice.<eos> One of them, a Tom Garagus, a big-time gambler in Atlantic City... gave $200,000 to the football program last year.
- Did he say how? - No.<eos> And I didn't ask him.<eos> Andrea, why didn't you tell us all of this before?<eos> The truth?<eos> No matter what my son did, I don't want him to die.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's take a look at this.<eos> A week ago, he's ready to give up. Doesn't leave his house for two days.<eos> Then all of a sudden, four days ago, he's back at it.<eos> Gets a list of witnesses from the lawyer... and the next day beats the crap out of one of them.
I'll let you jump right into my cracks.<eos> While their lives may appear aimless and desultory... there's nothing random about the choices the Gen-Ynonwinner makes.<eos> Everything they do is for a single purpose.:<eos> to avoid engaging with the world around them.<eos> - So, why retail?<eos> Doesn't customer service force you to interact with the public?<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> Wonderfalls caters to tourists. Tourists are either coming or going.<eos> They're not fixtures.<eos> So you're never in any real danger of developing a rapport with them.
Ha.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I'm not sure I get it, either.<eos> So, I like your new place.<eos> It has a certain hobo charm.<eos> I don't know about charm, but it does have rats.<eos> The old expression about mice and "quiet as"<eos> doesn't apply to rats.<eos> Let's just be grateful they're not keeping you up at night with incessant chatter.<eos> I think they heard us talking about them.
Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too.<eos> So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky?<eos> Kentucky, yeh.<eos> I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.<eos> No, theh, they're ignorant.<eos> That's ignorant.<eos> What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson?<eos> Oh I'm retired now, but, I was in... pharmaceuticals<eos> Well our boys have really taken a liking to you.<eos> You seem to really have a way with them.
Yeah, I guess.<eos> - Hey, guys.<eos> - Hi, I'm Paris.<eos> - Nicole.<eos> - Nicole, nice to mee you.<eos> - Hey, I'm Noelle.<eos> - Hey, Noelle.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Right now, we're staying with this family.<eos> Those two boys over there-- we're staying with them.
Jamie, I need to talk to you outside for...<eos> Okay. I'll be right back. Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - I'll give you one. - Nice. Just lay on your stomach.<eos> Will you wipe your sweat off your neck first before I touch it?<eos> I'm sorry. I apologize.<eos> Play ball!<eos> Welcome to Dell Diamond stadium.<eos> And tonight's a great night for baseball as the Round Rock Express take on the New Orleans Zephyrs.<eos> You have two jobs. One of them's to go get the bats and the balls, and the other is distract the other club. We can, we can handle that, right?
What is it? Our scout rapidturtle has an urgent matter for us.<eos> Fine, come on in.<eos> What is it?<eos> She says an exchange of hostilities between the bandits and Kanna Village has begun.<eos> Kanna Village?<eos> Oh, got it, got it, got it, got it!<eos> Have you forgotten? That is the village where the peasant girl, Kirara, is from.<eos> Ah! Kirara-kun! So, Kirara-kun's village is at war with the bandits...<eos> Then, that means those samurai have arrived there.<eos> We sent Hyogo and Kyuzo after them, but have not heard anything from them since.
Unfortunately it also shows you're unable to command.<eos> You're an individualist, Maltese.<eos> You're a subversive.<eos> That's not bad, but isn't good either.<eos> Corto, you'll stay on the island with Cranio.<eos> Slütter, get ready to set sail.<eos> We'll leave in two days.<eos> That's all.<eos> The Monk said nothing about the youths.<eos> Don't be worried about them.
A universe of surprises.<eos> That is what I pray for.<eos> Is such a universe possible for someone like you?<eos> Possible?<eos> Yes.<eos> But is it desirable?<eos> I have a difficult decision to make, Grandmother.<eos> Do I accept the Atreides mystique?<eos> Dress myself in our myths?<eos> Live for my subjects and die for them... or do I chose another path?
- No, Bill, I...<eos> - You guys stay here.<eos> There's no sense in everyone getting drenched.<eos> Returning to the news, local authorities still have no lead in the mysterious disappearance of the five cheerleaders from Ruggsville.<eos> The girls were last seen leaving a cheering competition...<eos> It was loud enough to wake the dead.<eos> That's an idea.<eos> What is?<eos> Wouldn't it be dramatic?<eos> Supposing the people inside were dead, all stretched out with the lights quietly burning about them.
There's a carnival at Mall Road.<eos> People are dressed like aliens.<eos> C'mon, Rohit. Wear something unusual.<eos> - All right. I'll be back in a moment.<eos> - l'm making eyes and a mouth on this pitcher.<eos> What for? - l'm going to dress up like an alien... and go to the carnival with my friends.<eos> Like an alien...?<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> Why not? All my friends are going, Ma.<eos> There's a difference between the rest of them and you....
"Would she not, in all honesty, have done the same as Chuck and Vera and Ben and Mrs. Henson and Tom"<eos> and all these people in their houses?<eos> Grace paused.<eos> "And while she did, the clouds scattered and let the moonlight through"<eos> and Dogville underwent another of little changes of light.<eos> "It was as if the light, previously so merciful and faint," finally refused to cover up for the town any longer.<eos> "Suddenly you could no longer imagine a berry that would appear one day on a gooseberry bush," but only see the thorn that was there right now.<eos> The light now penetrated every unevenness and flaw in the buildings... and in... the people!<eos> And all of a sudden she knew the answer to her question all too well:<eos> "If she had acted like them, she could not have defenced a single one of her actions" and could not have condemned them harshly enough.
Lord knows I wants to die free, and I wants my children to be free.<eos> Heaven help me.<eos> May God bless you all.<eos> Damn it, Tom, you scared me half to death.<eos> Lawrence, I thought you was with the beyond.<eos> Mother?<eos> I was able to secure the aid of a good spyglass and could ascertain beyond all doubt that our house is still standing.<eos> Oh, I pray to God for Martha and her dear ones.<eos> But, Mother it is a pitiful sight on the fields below Marye's Heights.<eos> I should feel rancor in my heart for those invaders but all I feel for them is sorrow.
But it's gonna be hard to finish the story now.<eos> But we all know how it ends.<eos> Shanti blinks her big, beautiful brown eyes at you, and you follow her into our village.<eos> - I did not.<eos> - Did so!<eos> - Something was in my eye. - Both of them?<eos> Well, you were so ugly, you made my eyes water.<eos> Well, you...<eos> Now, now, we give thanks for Shanti's beautiful brown eyes.<eos> Without them, Mowgli would never have come into our lives.
Those poor schmucks.<eos> They drive Chevrolets, shop at Wal-Mart never miss an episode of Friends.<eos> These are Americans.<eos> The idea of slaughtering Americans it just turns my stomach.<eos> But I'll do it.<eos> I'll do it because it needs to be done.<eos> So if we start at 2, we can be done by 2:30.<eos> And it's all behind us.<eos> Except for the dreams.<eos> Yeah, except for them.
Peace that at this moment is being threatened by a group of people that is threatening our nation.<eos> People like Armando Barillo.<eos> I invite you to gather our forces in order to prevent the destruction of our unity ...and our peace.<eos> EL Presidente, history teaches us no matter how great your armies are you will always need the favor of the inhabitants to take possession of a province.<eos> How can you compete with a man like Barillo?<eos> He owns Culiacan.<eos> He doesn't own its people.<eos> Barillo purchased hundreds of homes and ranches in the northern part of Culiacan.<eos> And then he has turned around and given these homes to the people.<eos> -He's a folk hero to them.
What have you had, Betty, like, one beer?<eos> I'm just sa...<eos> I'm just saying, you know, frogs start falling from the sky, who do they come to?<eos> We'd be world-renowned.<eos> Make any parents proud.<eos> I bet they would be.<eos> They actually did want me to be a scientist.<eos> I mean, your birth parents.<eos> Guess we'll never know.<eos> I don't understand why you don't want to find out about them.
- I'm going to finish med school.<eos> - I also have big plans.<eos> - Which include me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> What?<eos> It's a secret.<eos> Tell me.<eos> We'll buy some sheep.<eos> That holy night, shepherds stood underthe heavens, taking turns watching their flocks.<eos> A great light suddenly appeared, and a mighty angel of the Lord stood before them.
- No.<eos> - Here. - No!<eos> You're crazy!<eos> Hope we can see each other again.<eos> I'll call.<eos> I was a Iong way from BeuzeviIIe now. Before, I was always on my own. Now I had a family.<eos> When you choose a path, you go all the way.<eos> This shitty avenue's usually a damn nightmare.<eos> You can't take two steps without some sIeaze-baII giving you shit.<eos> But with them, I felt good... sort of protected.
- I don't know.<eos> I don't know how a light bulb works.<eos> - And where did it all go?<eos> - Away.<eos> - But away to where?<eos> - I don't know. Where the socks go?<eos> - Or maybe we're on pause.<eos> - What?<eos> - Like a video game.<eos> You hit the pause button, and everything just stays in that one place... and to the characters... that one moment becomes their whole world, because it's the only thing that exists to them.
So you're a writer.<eos> You're not really a writer unless people are reading your shit.<eos> I'm an aspiring writer.<eos> What do you write about?<eos> Did you hear about that kid?<eos> The one who stabbed that retarded kid?<eos> I'm gonna write about him.<eos> I'm gonna write a book about Leland P. Fitzgerald.<eos> Maybe God's there because people get scared of all the bad stuff they do.<eos> They figure that God and the devil are always playing this tug-of-war game with them.
I love sunflowers.<eos> You know that.<eos> Why?<eos> Why do you love sunflowers?<eos> Because I always thought that... when God was making beautiful things... he messed up with sunflowers.<eos> How?<eos> Well, 'cause they look like...<eos> I don't know.<eos> They look like crooked teeth around a mouth that's too big, kind of.<eos> But... just when he was about to start over... he realized that's what made them beautiful.
It's over.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's over.<eos> How many?<eos> No one knows yet.<eos> How many?<eos> Some say 50,000.<eos> Some 100.<eos> 100,000... dead peasants.<eos> There were knights among them.
So that's it, huh?<eos> That's it.<eos> We're closing up shop.<eos> You guys know what to do, right?<eos> Jesus Christ, Jake, I can't believe you're gonna just...<eos> Miles.<eos> So much for honor among thieves.<eos> You were going to cut loose your friends, your girl...<eos> What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> I was doing it for them.

I have no one to discover.<eos> I have no hope.<eos> We are not in the same boat.<eos> We should find shelter and rest.<eos> It will be dark soon.<eos> The woman is following us.<eos> Where?<eos> I don't see her.<eos> You're blessed with 5 senses, Hale.<eos> Sight is only one of them.
Just ducks and lizards.<eos> What, no women?<eos> It ain't natural.<eos> How extraordinary.<eos> What is, sir?<eos> Those birds.<eos> They're a species of cormorant, but they are flightless.<eos> Do you see their underdeveloped wings?<eos> By all that's holy, I think that's unknown to science.<eos> The dragons don't seem to bother them.
Mr Pullings, defaulters at eight bells.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> Bring Hollom down to my cabin.<eos> A man pushed past you, yet you said nothing. Why?<eos> I intended to, sir, but the right words didn't...<eos> The right words?<eos> He was deliberately insubordinate.<eos> I've tried to get to know the men, sir, and be friendly, but they've taken a set against me.<eos> Always whispering when I go past and giving me looks.<eos> I'll set that to rights. I'll be much tougher on them.
Happy Thanksgiving.<eos> Let's go.<eos> 'Cause... Once, there were people here called "Indians."<eos> Native Americans, whatever.<eos> Then a boat came called the "Mayflower."<eos> Landed on a big rock carrying people just like me.<eos> The first year on their own was hard.<eos> It was... really, really hard.<eos> Let me start again.<eos> This was long ago... before we stole most of their land, killed most of them, and moved the rest to reservations.
- Where is she going?<eos> - Wait! Back!<eos> Keep your head down!<eos> - Let us go! - Dr. Lena!<eos> - Wait! Get back!<eos> Answer me! You never planned on taking all of us out, did you?<eos> I simply follow orders! My orders are to get you out!<eos> Get on the helicopter!<eos> - What about my people?<eos> ! - I'm not here for them.
Welcome back, lieutenant.<eos> This is Dr. Lena Kendricks, captain.<eos> This is Arthur Azuka son of the late President Samuel Azuka.<eos> - I have men down in the field, sir.<eos> - We'll take care of them.<eos> - The doctor needs medical attention.<eos> - So do you.<eos> Get them in here.<eos> - My men also...<eos> - Take care of them.
It's a wonderful thing.<eos> No matter how filthy something gets, you can always clean it right up.<eos> There were so many, I just gave them all what they wanted.<eos> Yeah, but since when... does anyone have a clue about what they want?<eos> So what do I do?<eos> Parting your soup is not a miracle, Bruce.<eos> It's a magic trick.<eos> A single mom who's working two jobs... and still finds time to take her kid to soccer practice, that's a miracle.<eos> A teenager who says no to drugs and yes to an education, that's a miracle.<eos> People want me to do everything for them. But what they don't realize is they have the power.
He ain't worth a damn.<eos> Get them all up!<eos> Sobered up!<eos> Ooh.<eos> I got a feeling there's gonna be a new marshal in town.<eos> All right!<eos> It's time to settle these free grazers.<eos> Oh, you leave your horses.<eos> We're walking down to their wagon.<eos> When we get there, you better empty your guns in them.
She likes music.<eos> Over the months, I learned a lot about the woman I would marry... but not her name, and not where to find her.<eos> That time had come.<eos> I couldn't wait any longer.<eos> It's Edward Bloom.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> That night, I discovered that most things you consider evil or wicked... are simply lonely and lacking in social niceties.<eos> Didn't kill anything, did I?<eos> A few rabbits.<eos> But I think one of them was already dead.
-Of course.<eos> But after only a week there she feels nostalgic for her studies.<eos> Does that seem believable?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> -What you feel for my daughter... -is just human sympathy?<eos> -Yes, very much so.<eos> -Nothing else?<eos> -Are you joking?<eos> Her specialty is making men fall in love with her.<eos> -so she can enjoy leaving them.
Don't ever underestimate Will Graham.<eos> He's a fierce man who'll go the distance.<eos> You should never have left him like that.<eos> It was wrong, Will, and you know it.<eos> He never had no family, no one.<eos> He was just a kid.<eos> You was always buying him stuff. Always giving him things.<eos> When you left, we had noth...<eos> So he went for the soft money. Started dealing, started getting himself whacked up with them wanks, them...<eos> I'm telling you, if Davey was raped, it was one of them who did it.
The New Republic Magazine was first published in 1914. it has been a fixture of American political commentary ever since.<eos> in May of 1998, its staff was comprised of 15 writer/editors.<eos> Their median age was 26.<eos> The youngest among them was Stephen Glass.
Double Whiskey.<eos> What kind?<eos> McIntosh Okay<eos> Okay, I want everything to be authentic.<eos> My actors need to understand How a séance is conducted.<eos> Mira is the assistant director He's Adrian and...<eos> Gordon is the writer...<eos> Ahhhh<eos> I see some actors are missing they should be here now.<eos> But you already met most of them and you know what I expect.
I love you, Britta.<eos> See you.<eos> "Darling Britta.<eos> We haven't written to each other in a while, and maybe I changed.<eos> Gone is the time when I'd write you five letters a week.<eos> FOUR YEARS LATER<eos> I stayed in West Germany... and I'm studying German, History and Political Sciences.<eos> Oddly enough, I kinda like it.<eos> I've made some new friends.<eos> One of them is called...
I began to study in earnest out of pure boredom.<eos> With Gisela, everything was fine.<eos> I liked to look at her and I liked It when she'd stroke me.<eos> We didn't fight and, most of the time, we had the same opinion.<eos> In bed, she was different from Britta.<eos> She didn't mind trying new things... but she didn't have any ideas of her own.<eos> However, Gisela had definite ideas about other things.<eos> I'm looking forward to our first Christmas together.<eos> On the 24th, we're gonna visit your parents.<eos> Then we'll introduce you to mine and we'll have dinner with them.
- What?<eos> When he was there with his first girlfriend... on that Christmas, 15 years ago... he had a divine moment.<eos> They happen.<eos> They don't happen very often, but they happen.<eos> Everything was perfect.<eos> It was just his moment.<eos> The girl just happened to be there.<eos> He didn't understand that.<eos> Tragic, but men are like that.<eos> It's all about them.
No.<eos> I've seen all I need to see.<eos> Wait!<eos> No, you haven't. You haven't.<eos> You can't take them away.<eos> Please. Dogs mean so much to the world, and you haven't seen any of that yet.<eos> They protect us, and they keep us company, and they always warn us if something bad might happen.<eos> Some dogs even work with police and firefighters, and do amazing things... things people could never do on their own.<eos> Some dogs even help people who can't see by guiding them.<eos> We rely on them for so much.

All right.<eos> Dig it up.<eos> UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY<eos> Language is a signaling system that uses sounds to convey thoughts and emotions.<eos> What makes humans unique is our ability to introduce into language... thoughts about the past, present, or future... at any point in time and space.<eos> He'll call you back.<eos> Not all language is based on sound.<eos> We communicate in other ways... that are much less overt than the spoken word.<eos> So do animals.<eos> The only difference between them and us can be summarized in one word: novelty.
I can't imagine why I should be brought here.<eos> What we're about to tell you, Dr. Bachman, is truly beyond your imagination.<eos> - You believe it's ETI in origin, don't you?<eos> - Everything certainly points to it.<eos> I hope you're wrong, Jules.<eos> Nobody's called me that for a long time.<eos> Why do you hope I'm wrong?<eos> Because if you're right, we could be Neanderthals in comparison.<eos> That may not be so bad.<eos> Think of what we might learn from them.
Buongiorno.<eos> I see you have survived the storm.<eos> I'm alive.<eos> But the washing machine is dead.<eos> Yes.<eos> It was electrocuted.<eos> I'm happy to see that you were not.<eos> You came to check on me?<eos> You're meeting the contractors today, and I came to help you.<eos> I believe one of them is here.
Anxious might be more accurate.<eos> We've never met your son.<eos> You'll get to meet him.<eos> Rudy and Sam would like to meet him, too.<eos> Better bring them in from the car.<eos> They've been cooped up for hours.<eos> For heaven's sake.<eos> You brought your sons?<eos> Our dogs.<eos> We never travel without them.
You will have a key.<eos> Keep the door open outside.<eos> Starting at 8 am.<eos> Will look at the mail, do the cleaning.<eos> I start at 10.<eos> Patients developed ushers in the room. They offer tea, coffee ...<eos> I know .. "Be well-come."<eos> Very good!<eos> Something important ... .. our patients need of trust and discretion.<eos> Do not worry, madam, no need to talk to them.
Know his real name or where I can find him?<eos> - I'd like to ask him a few questions.<eos> - K-Ro.<eos> No, I don't... I don't even know the guy's real name.<eos> I mean, most of these kids have some badass names.<eos> They all think they're thugs.<eos> For most, it's just an act.<eos> Bunch of mama's boys.<eos> First they're down with a brother, then they're ungrateful asses.<eos> Half of them would be dead or in prison if it wasn't for me.
That guy showed up across the street.<eos> There...<eos> I know.<eos> - Look, I gotta go.<eos> I'll talk to you soon.<eos> - Take care.<eos> We got two more black and whites on the chase.<eos> In pursuit of a silver Mustang, black Escalade, Sunset Boulevard.<eos> Doing about 50 miles an hour.<eos> Who are they chasing, me or them?
Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> How are you?<eos> Phoenix in July.<eos> Apparently, the people that book these things don't get the Weather Channel.<eos> It's been one of those years for me.<eos> In February, I was doing a show in the northern part of Minnesota.<eos> It was so cold- - Beautiful place. It was so cold.<eos> It was like 1 5 below zero.<eos> After the show, we were talking to some guys backstage and they were trying to talk us into going ice fishing with them.
After losing my memory... I am also moving in a new direction I some times wonder what my past was like<eos> Was it better than what I have now?<eos> Or did I lose something precious?<eos> And then, I laugh it off<eos> What is lost, is not coming back<eos> And what I have, I don't want to lose<eos> You have come to terms with yourself in this situation, Tia<eos> But there are people in the world who would want to live their lives again... if they are given the opportunity<eos> Jai, do you also look forward to starting a new journey... giving up the past like these oceans?<eos> - Yes. I'm one of them too
- I didn't think you were gonna call me.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because of the stupid way I acted last time, bawling my eyes out like an idiot.<eos> I don't think you acted stupid.<eos> Hey.<eos> How did your meeting with Christofaro go?<eos> Don't ask.<eos> That good?<eos> It's funny, you know?<eos> No matter how much I blame my parents for my neuroses all my happiest memories are with them.
I'm willing to pay for her.<eos> These animals aren't for sale, ma'am.<eos> They're the legal property of this facility.<eos> What kind of facility is this?<eos> Mr. Livermore, I'm so sorry!<eos> Elle, this VERSACE is a cosmetic testing facility.<eos> -Oh, no! -Bruiser's mom's a test subject.<eos> I want her out of there immediately.<eos> Animal test subjects can only be surrendered... on a voluntary basis, and they're not volunteering.<eos> After I get through with them, they'll be begging.
- I recall you later.<eos> - OK, amuse you well.<eos> Call me when you will be back, OK?<eos> Bye!<eos> Bye.<eos> Today, at the fitting they had all these rock and roll clothes, but the band wasn't tough at all.<eos> The boys of the stamp don't stop to say" Lock more "Loll and,<eos> But it would be better if they remained skinny and skinny as they began.<eos> They make them wear these clothes to the Keith Richard, it is so ridiculous.<eos> Rather one has to let them be themselves, don't you think?
Why're you looking at me like that?"<eos> "You have to agree, whatever we are today, it's on our own steam"<eos> "ln any case, what have you done for us?"<eos> "that your sons had the ability, the skill and the talent..."<eos> "with which they paved a way for themselves and achieved their goals"<eos> "And built this house.<eos> That's not all, dad"<eos> "With my presence, I have also secured my future..."<eos> "so that I don't have to beg before anyone when I grow old"<eos> True... what have we done for them?
- What's that mean?<eos> - Very hard to translate that.<eos> Try it.<eos> It means "shit for luck."<eos> - Is that right?<eos> Chiricahua value family very highly.<eos> A man doesn't live with his family, he's not considered particularly enviable.<eos> I don't have any Indian brothers or sisters?<eos> None that lived.<eos> What did you see in them you didn't see in us?
- And when was that?<eos> - Here... November 15th 1993.<eos> I was selling newspapers that night.<eos> I couldn't come to your table and say, "I'm a policeman.<eos> Let me sit with you and listen to what are you talking about."<eos> - I don't remember anything.<eos> - Of course. You were dead-drunk.<eos> I say, "What's up, pigs?<eos> What do you want?"<eos> One of them jumps all over me, hits me with a club in the head.
I've seen you.<eos> In the pool.<eos> You saw too.<eos> I've come for you.<eos> It's too late.<eos> The gods decree it.<eos> Aphrodite herself.<eos> Then the gods torment me.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> When I'm there with them, I feel nothing.
She just has a cold.<eos> So you had something to tell me, sir?<eos> I got a call from the Military Hospital, And they said that Blue River died this morning.<eos> If he had been alive, We could've gotten more out of him.<eos> But even so, he never would've talked.<eos> You may be right.<eos> But from my own experience, most Commies always gave in.<eos> While being an officer at the DMZ, I admired the North Korean guards there.<eos> They looked more like real soldiers compared to ours.<eos> But after interrogating some of them who defected, That thought completely disappeared.
Are you still dragging Prisoner 160 around with you?<eos> Prisoner 160 I mean 'Terada'...<eos> No.<eos> He said how beautiful some dandelion was.<eos> He did.<eos> Now you mention it.<eos> I wonder where it was...<eos> Mr Nango murder is murder.<eos> The people in here aren't the same as you and me.<eos> Considering what they've done, killing's too good for them.
Everybody just be screaming, and I get uncomfortable.<eos> It's similar to a deer caught in the headlights.<eos> It's like a battle to find the right words to say at the right time.<eos> I got to speak to young black males all over the country about this new idea called "Thug Life" which is a new kind of black Power.<eos> When I say, "Thug Life", I mean that shit, because these white folks see us as thugs.<eos> I don't care if you think you a lawyer, a man, an African-American.<eos> If you whatever the fuck you think you are, we thugs and niggas to these motherfuckers!<eos> until we own some shit, I'II call it like it is.<eos> How you gonna be a man and we starving?<eos> walk about five different houses, there ain't a man in either one of them motherfuckers.
- Yes.<eos> Will you have time to see the mammoth?<eos> We specialize in short-term cover certificates.<eos> We do limited cover pour specific tasks.<eos> Maybe a parachute jump, maybe a medical procedure.<eos> People only buy fakes if we won't grant legitimate cover.<eos> If we won't grant legitimate cover, believe me, there's a reason.<eos> The Sphinx knows best.<eos> Fake cover is a ticket to avoidable suffering.<eos> I worry about them, you know.
This is not about your finger.<eos> I need to speak to Miss Gonzalez alone.<eos> You have no authorization.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm investigating an incident at your place of work.<eos> Fraudulent papeles issued from your printer.<eos> In the last 14 days, three people have died... while traveling from papeles... issued from your printer at the Sphinx.<eos> The people who come to us, they're all doing something dangerous.<eos> You have to expect that, unfortunately, some of them won't make it.<eos> One of them...
Adi, I know it's hard, but you have to be brave.<eos> Don't tell me how to feel.<eos> You didn't love her.<eos> She was only your stepmother.<eos> You wouldn't know how to love anyone.<eos> You're just a lump, a peasant.<eos> God for nothing but breeding more bitches like you.<eos> I'm sorry. Herr Hitler. You don't have a style.<eos> Your people are like buildings.<eos> There's no life to them.
This way, I'll show you the room.<eos> I'd like to know who orders these inspections.<eos> The Minister of Health.<eos> And what are you, a lawyer?<eos> Come in, please.<eos> -A psychiatrist.<eos> -Good. This is the room.<eos> As you can see, everything's clean. Everything's in order.<eos> -Where are the patients?<eos> -I sent them on a field trip, to the sanctuary at Oropa, because I care about them.
Can I drop you back at Simla?<eos> "No, I am not going back to Simla." "I'm headed home, Dehradun."<eos> It's on the way.<eos> Karan dropped me right here.<eos> When the copter landed... all the boys came running to "greet us.<eos> Manjit, Anurag, Raman..."<eos> everyone was stunned.<eos> "When I thanked Karan, he said," Won't you at least... offer me a cup of coffee for dropping you here?<eos> I borrowed Manjit's cycle to take him home. You seem to be the boss around here. - They're all my friends.<eos> Is there a special friend among them?
I mean you don't even know us...<eos> I just don't understand why?<eos> I did all this for you<eos> I did all this because of you, Naina<eos> Isn't that what you wanted to hear?<eos> No... no... even I was saying it just like that<eos> Aman<eos> - Naina...<eos> Eyes... have you seen your mother's eyes?<eos> There's a lot of pain in them
What else were you thinking?<eos> That she's forgotten about me.<eos> And that...<eos> She might meet someone...<eos> notice someone else.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now we ask ourselves:<eos> "Does one thing necessarily lead to the other?"<eos> Rational response:<eos> "Dealing with men every day doesn't mean falling in love with them. "
Very well.<eos> You may go now, Gail.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You did right.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> John's study.<eos> No wonder why the oil business is doing so well.<eos> He's been spying on his associates.<eos> Them and who else, Miss Ellen?
Dear fellow Surak citizens don't elections make you angry everytime?<eos> They sure make me angry<eos> We have a candidate that will go to Buddhist temples as if he's Buddhist when the next day he'll show up at a church to pretend like he's a Christian<eos> Religion isn't musical chair, you know<eos> And how come these candidates never show up at our forefather's ceremony?<eos> Are they not proud Koreans?<eos> If not, what are they?<eos> Are they the offsprings of comfort women during the Japanese reign in Korea?<eos> If that's the case they should change their names<eos> If they don't have the time for it I'll make one for them
Well, whoever it was, they kidnapped the Bad Omens.<eos> Kidnapped?<eos> Not again.<eos> The Bad Omens can't be kidnapped.<eos> They need to win the contest.<eos> It's a good thing you weren't here.<eos> Those vampires would have flown off with you, too.<eos> I wish they had.<eos> Now I'll be plagued by guilt.<eos> I should have stayed with them instead of going back to my trailer.
My mind is on 'Goku-Nyo'.<eos> (No one has said you got the part!<eos> You must be busy in your love life.<eos> - No, I don't get a chance.<eos> - (She's unpopular! ) Really?<eos> The head tells me to avoid work-related love.<eos> (I need a clean image as a new STAR!<eos> (Yes-girl!<eos> ) How about the staff at the agency?<eos> - Many of them are single.
What do you mean?<eos> Don't adjust your life to mine.<eos> Enjoy yourself while you can before you get old.<eos> Remember, I won't age.<eos> Not this again!<eos> Mallepa is full of immigrants... different races,<eos> all coming and going, minding their own business.<eos> And that's how we get along...<eos> I've fed on some many evil men...<eos> I'm becoming like them.
I want to apologize.<eos> I know exactly how you feel.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> You're just like me... we're the victims of all this.<eos> You should have seen those two... your friends' fathers.<eos> Two peas in a pod. They belonged to the same party:<eos> the ones who know how the world works.<eos> Their daughters, your friends... come from the same mould.<eos> They're identical.<eos> Privileged people... we're nothing to them.
They know that, deep down, no one really cares. But they want people to know they're suffering, dammit.<eos> And others will go along with them, making faces, hoping someone will notice, so that when something awful happens to them, they can get some of this fake pity for themselves.<eos> And now Michael's daughter Agnes will quickly sing his favorite song.<eos> Skip, skip, skip to my loo<eos> Skip to my loo, my darling<eos> Don't fall on me!<eos> Mrs. Burnjones, I'm Chester Kent, a producer of musical spectaculars in New York.<eos> I was very moved by your daughter's performance... we all were.<eos> It struck me that more people should have the chance to hear her... and the other sad music that soothed your husband.<eos> If we could mount a musical tribute to him on international radio, people would be reminded of what he meant to them, and listeners who didn't know about this wonderful banker's life and great spirit...
What about the pigtail?<eos> I don't know what to tell you.<eos> That's the crux of it.<eos> When I was a baby my daddy laid me in my cradle and caressed it softly, softly till I slept.<eos> Street urchins pulled it like a cat's tail or teased me:<eos> " Urraka has a tail<eos> " hanging from her bum.<eos> " In the bum, she gets it.<eos> "The shit of Beelzebub!"<eos> I threw myself on them and scratched them with rage.
You guys ok?<eos> Get away!<eos> Ok,where's master?<eos> Yu Haiyang,long no see.<eos> Master,how's your wound?<eos> Master, you shouldn't come<eos> If we don't come,who can save you?<eos> Shut up<eos> 4 taels more.<eos> Boss, we needn't fear them
Sometimes when I painted, I made the hair, there, my touch was very light, without harshness which would have shown a lack of respect.<eos> Having come to that point, you had to show respect, light touches.<eos> And you had to paint the face with a pink tint, showing a skin smooth and fine,<eos> beautiful like the skin of a young virgin.<eos> Then he was happy, he accepted the picture.<eos> Busts in plaster that came out of the mold were sometimes cracked.<eos> They didn't destroy them, you had to bury them.<eos> It wouldn't have been good to see them being broken.<eos> You had to bury them in the pit out back.<eos> I know there were many painters that came to work for them.
We put in some jars full of water, to give to the detainees to drink and to wash the floor.<eos> And there's barbed wire, six or seven rows of it, out of fear that the detainees could jump over.<eos> Look at this photo.<eos> There, a kramar, and there, the same thing.<eos> He wasn't dead of illness or exhaustion, he still had some flesh left.<eos> He'd been tortured, look at the marks.<eos> When he died under torture, they photographed him, for the report to the leaders.<eos> This detainee died during the day, he was put in the hallway, and after dark he was buried behind the prison.<eos> There's one thing that I don't understand.<eos> When they brought detainees here, we had to create a document on them, interrogate them in detail on their personal history.
Yes, sir!<eos> Of course<eos> Congressman Choi has brother who is geology professor<eos> I know Duk man's in-laws have a mind in Busan<eos> But you don't know anything about this, right?<eos> Yes, sir<eos> I'm the chief detective at Miryang police station<eos> I got to put anyone behind bars for this<eos> If I mess with the rich guys, people in upper ranks will keep bothering me with calls<eos> Smart guys have someone sacrifice for them, which makes me easy to work
"Uncle, you promised.<eos> He's one in a million"<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I heard it from the horse's mouth.<eos> - Ajay told you?<eos> No. The broken-hearted one...<eos> Why doesn't Ajay marry that one?<eos> He wanted to<eos> But couldn't hurt his parents<eos> "He sacrificed his love for them
"Mom, look at all the fish..."<eos> There's so many!<eos> - What if something happened?<eos> Look - What if you'd fallen in?<eos> Raj's my friend - we've met before<eos> You know my son?<eos> "Don't tell her where we met. That's our secretr"<eos> Come home and we'll see who keeps secrets from whom!<eos> What happened with the birds?<eos> He traps birds and spray-paints them!
- You're the black one!<eos> I'm black, but I'm not one of the family and neither a sheep.<eos> Why won't you come with us?<eos> It's long since you've been home.<eos> I'll strike it rich soon.<eos> Geraldo has offered you work in town so many times. - You'd be near your family.<eos> - It's just for awhile, laiá...<eos> If dreaming makes you feel better.<eos> Well, I left my men at work.<eos> Not that I don't trust them, but diamonds are diamonds.
Elbows never!<eos> Forearms perhaps.<eos> One should rest only one's wrists on the table.<eos> Ritinha is a notorious chicken-thief in Cavalhada... and she makes my life hell.<eos> The way she talks...! I used to tremble in fear when I was little.<eos> Let's dance around this circle To and afro and back again<eos> The diamond ring you gave me Was just glass, broke into pieces<eos> She wouldn't let me play with my coloured friends.<eos> Don't play with these girls.<eos> You ain't the kind of girl to play with them.
Thanks.<eos> Ugna, come on.<eos> Does it work?<eos> Yes, if you plug it in.<eos> How much does it cost?<eos> Look at the price tag.<eos> Does this one also work?<eos> Odgoo, I can see two camels on the horizon.<eos> Take a look and see if it's our boys.<eos> Yes, it's them. But they are coming alone.
Where will you find pros who want to play a bunch of amateurs?<eos> I made some calls and everyone was enthusiastic:<eos> the Football Federation, the media and... the stars.<eos> They all want to be a part of it.<eos> Don't forget, they were all amateurs once.<eos> Very interesting concept.<eos> In theory... very interesting.<eos> But no one will come and watch, no one will be interested.<eos> We'll invite all the amateur clubs, they'll come and support the amateurs.<eos> Because they are people like them.
It's with two kids.<eos> -My stuff's with two kids?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -Okay, listen...<eos> -You two!<eos> Stop! Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Did you call me, sir?<eos> My stuff's with two kids.<eos> I don't fucking care about them.
This is only the first round<eos> Nice and fresh!<eos> Sir, how's your dad?<eos> He's fine but he got me into so much trouble<eos> He kept a grenade<eos> Those dudes faint we can get nothing from them<eos> Take your time You can get nothing at all tonight<eos> Why?<eos> They dare come to my home and mess about<eos> What can you get from them?
No... not even a shadow of suspicion.<eos> At this point, i don't think we have any more to say.<eos> - Inspector Shankar?<eos> - Through here.<eos> I only wanted to make the parents of the child happy.<eos> Who are you talking about?<eos> ...<eos> Which parents?<eos> They were so happy when they found out about the adoption...<eos> Apu Tagore was to go and live with them in France... but a week before his departure,...
Comrade Ernesto, a little revolutionary enthusiasm!<eos> You were gone for 5 minutes.<eos> You sound like my mother at the gas station!<eos> I want to be sure he's still there, that this isn't a dream.<eos> - Seeing him there makes me feel reassured.<eos> - Would you rather this be a dream?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I solved the problem:<eos> Oh God, grant the serenity of saints on our departed brothers.<eos> In all your graciousness, give them eternal peace and let shine on them undying light.
Maybe someone placed the water there.<eos> You kind of go out for your lunch break you're sitting in the park and people are kind of out there, talking in the park and, bang, all of a sudden you hear another message.<eos> By the time you go to bed you've probably received 8 or 9 different undercover messages.<eos> People are always thinking, well, oh I know product placement; that's when they put stuff in movies! Well, yes, kind of.<eos> I mean that's definitely traditional product placement.<eos> But real life product placement is just that: Placing stuff in movies, but the movie's actually your life.<eos> Well take a group of attainable but still inspirational people.<eos> They are not supermodels, they are kind of people just like you, they're doing something for us, whether they are having a certain kind of drink, or they are using a certain laundry detergent, whatever it may be.<eos> They are kind of the roach motel if you will.<eos> People are going to come over to them and they are going to give them this little piece of brand bait.
I was invited to Washington D. C. to attend this meeting that was being put together by the National Security Agency called the Critical Thinking Consortium.<eos> I remember standing there in this room and looking over on one side of the room and we had the CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI<eos> Customs Secret Service and then on the other side of the room we had<eos> Coca Cola, Mobile Oil, GTE and Kodak.<eos> And I remember thinking, I am in the epicentre of the intelligence industry right now.<eos> I mean the line is not just blurring it just not there any more.<eos> And tome it it spoke volumes as to how industry and government were consulting with each other and working with each other.<eos> As 34 nations of the western hemisphere gathered to draft a far reaching trade agreement, one that would lay the groundwork to privatize every resource and service imaginable, thousands of people from hundreds of grassroots organizations joined to oppose it.<eos> Canada's top business lobbyists and its chief trade representative discount the dissent in the streets.<eos> For them the Americas 800 million citizens speak with one voice.
What was supposed to be a short Hawaiian vacation would soon stretch into a three-month tour of Asia.<eos> Back home, people began to wonder if Charlie and Paulette were actually married.<eos> They later claimed that they were married though there's no record of the nuptials, somewhere in Asia.<eos> Still later, when their relationship began to come apart they found themselves denying rumors of divorce.<eos> For the moment, though they were obviously delighted with one another's company.<eos> And Chaplin was beginning to plan his biggest and most problematic movie to date.<eos> The Great Dictator opens on the Western Front during World War I.<eos> It is Chaplin's first all-talking production.<eos> In it, he would play two characters.<eos> One of them would be a Tramp variation an innocent Jewish barber serving bravely, if ineffectually in Tomania's army.
-2 years ago, I went to night school.<eos> You sure you're 17?<eos> -Want her to show you some l.D.?<eos> What do you care?<eos> -You should be a secret service interrogator.<eos> See how he talks back to his mother?<eos> She's new, I wanna get to know her, so butt out.<eos> Where are your parents?<eos> -At their house.<eos> Why aren't you with them?
- Tell me how it sounded.<eos> - Let's go comrade.<eos> Comrade Cirilo, hurry.<eos> Now!<eos> Light them up!<eos> Some day it'll be your turn Cirilo.<eos> Wait till Modesto tells you how it was.<eos> Why do you leave people in the dark?<eos> Because some people don't want to listen and so we take off the light, so they'd listen to us.<eos> We need them to listen so we all can have light.
Come, O come<eos> Kindle with fresh fire that ardour that inspires me.<eos> Kindle with fresh fire that ardour that inspires me.<eos> Thy charms alone ensure the mighty power of love.<eos> O come, and to my soul reveal<eos> The treasures promised to my flame.<eos> The very prospect offers bliss.<eos> O come, sweet hope, and triumph here,<eos> Kindle with fresh fire the ardour that inspires me.<eos> My rivals' birth gives favour to them before the law;
That won't work.<eos> They're no match for Gedo Baseball.<eos> Gedo Baseball?<eos> What's that?<eos> Gedo Baseball is baseball... with no rules, and it's outside the Iaw.<eos> No rules!<eos> ? Police can't do anything about what happens.<eos> I'll never forget when we played them.<eos> The scum had free reign, and we got pummeled.<eos> For them, Koshien's a playground to kill legally.
- Let's go, bitch.<eos> - Stop calling me that.<eos> We meet again.<eos> Remember us?<eos> I don't want to, but I can't help it.<eos> Thanks for the show yesterday. Where's the other girl?<eos> She's Na-ra, isn't she?<eos> What are you, stalkers?<eos> How'd you find that out?<eos> Don't deal with them.
Marie left here five minutes after Reza was taken to your office.<eos> What about Kate?<eos> What? Has something happened to Kate?<eos> She's with one of our agents. One of your agents?<eos> Why?<eos> You're gonna have to trust us, Mr Warner.<eos> She's gonna be fine, all right?<eos> Trust?<eos> This is where the men pray, in front, closest to the entrance.<eos> You walk by them as you pass through here down to the women's prayer area in the back.
And where does the boss man sit?<eos> Well, the secretary-general sits right here.<eos> - He sit 'ere? - Yes.<eos> - Wicked.<eos> Can we sit here?<eos> - Definitely.<eos> I has just written that Saddam Hussein is a bell end.<eos> Yekshemesh.<eos> American national sport is called baseballs.<eos> It's very similar to our sport, shurik, where we take dogs, shoot them in a field and then have a party.
"Shipman" could refer to the airfield in the Mojave desert.<eos> We've surveilled it before.<eos> It's operated by a transatlantic smuggling cartel.<eos> Ex-military, dishonorably discharged after the Gulf war.<eos> They're well-armed, highly organized.<eos> And they do have a C-123 in their fleet.<eos> I could have a tactical team there in three hours.<eos> Once these guys understand their legal options, they'll be inclined to tell us where Sloane went.<eos> Interrogating the employees could take days.<eos> And Sloane doesn't just let hostages go when he's done with them.
They were all made on a Monday night at the same time.<eos> - And they all lasted one minute.<eos> - Where did the calls come from?<eos> - I need to talk to you.<eos> - Is it Neil?<eos> Before Neil's abduction, three calls were made to your house over the last year at odd hours.<eos> We traced the number to a reporter named Grigory Ivanov.<eos> - Does that name mean anything to you?<eos> - No. We ran a background check. He was a journalist working out of Los Angeles for Itar-Tass, a news service known for giving cover to Russian intelligence agents.<eos> This man, Ivanov... we think he's one of them.
You're in quite a spot.<eos> Many on this drift want you dead.<eos> I'm managing.<eos> All right.<eos> Let me put it this way... don't join me, and your time here is up.<eos> A bit of advice, eight... never threaten a man who could cut you in two.<eos> You can't touch me.<eos> I'm too important to the commonwealth.<eos> I'm rebuilding all their ships.<eos> One of them is yours.
I am the avatar of a sun, a star.<eos> All things come from the same thing.<eos> All from me.<eos> You are elements of the sun.<eos> As i make you, i am able to destroy you.<eos> As i destroy you, i am able to create.<eos> You had me at avatar.<eos> Awareness is where we travel.<eos> No path.<eos> I am all gravity, and it exists in all universes, between them.
Listen, Angel, don't worry about a thing.<eos> This is my forte.<eos> And I ran Caritas for years, a nightclub with an open-door policy.<eos> The good, the bad, the hideously ugly, they all bellied up to my demon bar, but they all played nicely together while they were there.<eos> - And this is exactly the kind of ethical tightrope you've gotta walk now, Angel.<eos> Which brings up another point... your employees.<eos> - Also evil.<eos> Here's your blood, bossy. Ahem.<eos> Boss.<eos> - Some of them, yes, but all of them work hard for this firm, and Halloween, well, around here it's like Christmas.
Just know she's alive and, well, comatose.<eos> And under constant guard much as our guests downstairs are supposed to be.<eos> Thank you, Connor.<eos> Shut the door on your way out.<eos> HIGH PRIEST: What is it you think you fight for?<eos> Valor?<eos> What you call justice?<eos> Your friends are dead, most likely.<eos> Or so you believe.<eos> So it's not for them you fight.
Just keep running?<eos> I hear good things about Belize.<eos> If we could get out of the sphere of her influence, we could warn people prepare some form of resistance.<eos> Look at them.<eos> They're all so happy.<eos> Yeah, they'll be happier when they're gouging out our eyes and stomping us.<eos> - That's why we have to do this fast.<eos> - Fast works for me.<eos> Gunn, they're just under her spell.<eos> But if it does come down to a choice between us or them...
After my brothers were killed, I tried to carry on tried to help people. But after a while, the phone stopped ringing.<eos> The people went away... until one night when a man walked in.<eos> He said his company could use a young man with my abilities.<eos> - Wolfram Hart.<eos> I needed a job.<eos> They needed muscle.<eos> I knew that Wolfram Hart was everything my brothers despised.<eos> But what did I care?<eos> Nothing mattered after I buried them behind San Gregorio.<eos> Every year on El Dia de Los Muertos, I prepare this altar for them.
No wonder your brothers' spirits never come to visit.<eos> Listen to yourself.<eos> You've quit.<eos> Why'd you stop caring?<eos> - It was not hard.<eos> I will show you.<eos> - This is how my brothers are remembered, what their good deeds earned.<eos> They sacrificed their lives as heroes, and it is played out as a farce.<eos> - Maybe you expect too much from people.<eos> - Is it too much to expect them to remember their past?
I'm just saying your heart's not in the work.<eos> Well, yeah, you know, I've been feeling a little bit, uh...<eos> - Disconnected.<eos> Yes, I've heard.<eos> But I think it's more serious than that.<eos> You blame your melancholy on your new position, but I don't think it's about the type of work.<eos> I think it's because you've lost hope that the work has meaning.<eos> Of course it has meaning.<eos> We save people's lives.<eos> - I'm not talking about them.
I just don't worry about it anymore.<eos> So you don't worry that it's possible for someone to send out a biological or electronic trigger that overrides your own sense of ideals and replaces them with an alternative agenda that reduces you to little more than a mindless meat-puppet?<eos> People used to think that I was paranoid.<eos> I mean, don't get me wrong.<eos> I've still got the implants in my head.<eos> The CIA is still listening in.<eos> It just doesn't bother me anymore.<eos> Instead, I beam Jasmine's love up to their satellite.<eos> Share the love with those MK-ULTRA bastards.<eos> That'll teach them.
Huh?<eos> You may know him as Rocky Raccoon?<eos> You think my costume killed rocky?<eos> We think it may have incapacitated him.<eos> Rocky was... skritching me.<eos> That's one I haven't heard.<eos> Skritching is like grooming.<eos> It's friendly scratching.<eos> People who don't know each other can't just nuzzle and trade tummy - rubs, but for animals, skritching is perfectly normal.<eos> Well, killing is perfectly normal for them, too.
Mr. Kirkwood, I'm sorry.<eos> The other day, I thought you were saying that you "wouldn't" help me, and now I realize that you 'couldn't'.<eos> I never got a good look at them.<eos> We're ready.<eos> Can she come with me?<eos> I already cleared it with the Public Defender.<eos> She's 16.<eos> I only had two jobs left -- teach her to think for herself, keep her safe.<eos> Here's how this works: There are five guys in a line.<eos> We're going to ask each of them to step forward, turn to the side, and then face forward again.
I followed the leakage back to its original position.<eos> Two in the hood, one in the windshield, Lockwood.<eos> High power, long range.<eos> I'll take any part of those bullets.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Near decapitation.<eos> The wire is still around his neck.<eos> The driver became a liability after the heist.<eos> No honor among thieves, I guess.<eos> Tells us something about them.
I already spoke to building security.<eos> Cool.<eos> Night shift started at 6:00 p.m.<eos> And since then, four people have entered the building, and nobody left.<eos> Three of them are still breathing.<eos> Hey, David. Nick.<eos> Cool enough in here for you?<eos> I'll manage.<eos> Most computers dissipate over two thirds of the energy they consume as heat.<eos> AO's here for them, not the worker bees.
Got a category two hurricane, and we get sent out to a traffic incident.<eos> What's up with dispatch?<eos> They're slammed with t housands of calls, so we take 'em one at a time till order's been restored.<eos> I hate to see what a category four looks like.<eos> So would dispatch.<eos> You get something?<eos> / Hi,<eos> I heard a cat crying.<eos> Shelters won't take animals.<eos> People had to leave them behind.
I'm already there.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - Piper, don't.<eos> Oh, my God, you're not pregnant anymore.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Leo, what are you doing here?<eos> It's me, your sister.<eos> Paige?<eos> Look, if this is some lame attempt from the Elders to try and lure me back, you can forget it. Tell them to shove it.<eos> I have no loyalties to them anymore.
Okay, liverwort and a pinch of dragonroot.<eos> - Dragonroot.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - Wait,<eos> - shouldn't we be talking about this?<eos> - What is there to talk about, Leo?<eos> It says right here that they expel evil spirits.<eos> Still, that doesn't mean they're good.<eos> Witch doctors are kind of a wild card, that's why the Elders don't want us working with them.
- (continuous beeping)<eos> - He's in v-fib too.<eos> Call another code blue and get a team in here stat.<eos> - I guess it's been a pretty good run. - A great run... a great life!<eos> So what happens now?<eos> I've always wondered.<eos> - I guess we all have, right?<eos> - Words can't describe it.<eos> Six of the best years of my life I spent with these guys.<eos> You don't have to leave them, Walt.
My son doesn't know who I am.<eos> Everything has changed... including me.<eos> One touch and I can see things... things that happened, things that will happen.<eos> You should see what I see. Narrator:<eos> Previously on "The Dead Zone"...<eos> I like you, Johnny.<eos> I've always liked you.<eos> My vision followed the heart back to Kate to an accident sometime in the near future.<eos> I have two friends.<eos> One of them's gonna die.
Good.<eos> - Wanna come in?<eos> - No. I'm on my way to work.<eos> Remember that place where you used to practice medicine?<eos> - I told you I needed some time off.<eos> - And you've had it.<eos> Rumor is you quit, but I've seen nothing official.<eos> - So I've scheduled you to work today.<eos> - I still have some things to do.<eos> One of them is to decide whether you still wanna be a doctor.
I wonder if there's anyone else who thinks they have a claim on that ship.<eos> May I join you ? Please.<eos> I found another nucleotide sequence in the pilot's genome.<eos> It appears to be Rigelian.<eos> That corpse is full of surprises.<eos> I didn't realize how late it was until my stomach reminded me it was time to eat.<eos> Ah, you seem to be engrossed in your work as well.<eos> The Captain asked me to perform a metallurgical analysis of the vessel's hull.<eos> Anything noteworthy ?<eos> I have discovered several unusual alloys one of them is in a semi-fluidic state.
This is what we were afraid of, Mac... they'd try to take over again.<eos> It's time to put an end to this.<eos> You have something in mind?<eos> I say we ride out there tonight and burn them out.<eos> I guarantee you there'll be plenty of volunteers.<eos> Now you listen to me.<eos> I'm not going to murder those people... just because some stranger spooked you with a parlour trick.<eos> Now if I get some proof that the Skagarans are up to something...<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> You've always been too soft on them, Mac.
If you're talking about a funeral, it's pointless when there's nothing left.<eos> - I guess I was talking about a memorial.<eos> - My sister wasn't big on memorials.<eos> I read there was a day of remembrance for the victims a couple of months ago.<eos> I'm sorry you missed it.<eos> Why are you so obsessed with memorials?<eos> - I'm not obsessed.<eos> - She's dead.<eos> So are seven million others.<eos> She was no more important than any of them.
This was not a conversation I was looking forward to.<eos> It was Admiral Forrest.x<eos> The Command Council had reviewed the doctor's report on your condition.<eos> They relieved you of duty and granted me a field commission.<eos> Forrest made you Captain.<eos> I suppose congratulations are in order... even if they are belated.<eos> I guess... these parasites weren't so easy to remove after all.<eos> Phlox discovered that the organisms are from a domain outside normal space-time.<eos> They exist in a state of interspatial flux.<eos> None of his treatments had any effect on them.
Less than 6,000.o<eos> We're on the fifth planet in the Ceti Alpha system.<eos> It's far from the Expanse.i<eos> What happened to the crew? i<eos> Most of them are still aboard the ship.m<eos> It's in orbit, patrolling this system.<eos> How did... all these people get here?<eos> Survivors from human colonies realized they needed a place to take refuge.<eos> Several convoys headed for this system.<eos> One of them was led by Enterprise.
We're not going to get to change your dad's mind.<eos> Screw my dad.<eos> He can't stop this.<eos> At the end of the day, the only person that can... is you.<eos> All right, let's say we convince him.<eos> I mean, what about everybody else?<eos> Your friends, my friends, the government...<eos> Well, Bush has his hands full at the moment.<eos> And as far as my friends go, I only got two.<eos> You're one of them, so... as my friend, how would you feel about me dating Madison?
Do you know where it is?<eos> Yes, we know where it is.<eos> Be there in four arns.<eos> That's too long.<eos> Our deal... our rules.<eos> Take these tokens and enjoy yourselves in the meantime.<eos> Do we trust them?<eos> Of course not.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Just keep an eye on them, Chi.
The very existence of Homo Sapiens may be under threat.<eos> It's hardly surprising the hysteria's rising.<eos> Hysteria?<eos> In what sense?<eos> - The presence of these alien creatures...<eos> - No thanks.<eos> ...has induced various forms of societal hysteria...<eos> Holt says it's bad on the political front.<eos> Every nation's demanding equal access to the aliens and<eos> - all the information we get from them.
Got a good discount on account of my intimidating manner.<eos> This one's addressed to you and Zoe, Mal.<eos> - I don't remember ordering any parts.<eos> - The little one's for Cobb.<eos> I got post?<eos> Might we all wanna step a few paces back before he opens that?<eos> It's from my mother.<eos> So, do aliens live among us?<eos> Yeah.<eos> One of them's a doctor.
Yeah, maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.<eos> But you're finally doing something that you love.<eos> I mean, I can't ask you to give that up.<eos> Although it would be nice if the thing that you loved was finding gold.<eos> You know, I think we're making too big a deal out of this.<eos> We'll pay our bills late this month. Next month we'll cut back on a few things.<eos> And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change.<eos> You're a chef. What can you make out of baking soda and beer?<eos> Worst-case scenario is, we borrow some money from my parents.<eos> Or, you slipped on ice at their house last month. Can we sue them?
Did somebody sign your bra?<eos> So I got it when I was 13.<eos> So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl?<eos> Are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off?<eos> What is that?<eos> Come on, a piece of paper?<eos> It's actually a million-dollar prize.<eos> Go, Charlie!<eos> But my point is..<eos> okay, so she dated them, but she also broke up with them.
Stop going through my stuff!<eos> I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind.<eos> I'm gonna do it.<eos> I'm gonna kiss Joey. No! You can't!<eos> Friends hooking up is a bad idea. Please!<eos> What about you and Chandler?<eos> That's different.<eos> I was drunk and stupid.<eos> What about all the guys that you got the phone numbers from?<eos> - Why don't you just kiss one of them.
- And the boardwalk...<eos> - Oh, I've always wanted to see the Atlantic City boardwalk.<eos> - I'll save you a trip.<eos> Tip an overflowing trash can on your front porch and walk up and down on it.<eos> It was actually quite a successful outing.<eos> - Maybe not to our taste, but the clients loved it.<eos> - The clients were too plastered to know better.<eos> - Kind of the point. - Two of them stayed up all night and smelled like it.<eos> - That was a tad gross.<eos> - One of them - a married man - had a long conversation with... how shall I put this delicately?
- Okay.<eos> Luke, could you sit for a second, please?<eos> I could.<eos> Could you do it soon?<eos> Okay, listen, if I sit down, are we gonna have the conversation?<eos> - The conversation?<eos> - Yeah, you know, the conversation.<eos> Luke, please.<eos> Here comes the conversation.<eos> My parents are coming into town and I am going to have lunch with them and I thought maybe you'd like to join me.
Sorry, did I miss something?<eos> Did I dance around saying "nyah, nyah, nyah" when I gave her the check?<eos> No.<eos> Did, did I not thank her – genuinely thank her for everything?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did I not credit your getting into Yale with them giving us that money?<eos> - Yes, but...<eos> - No buts.<eos> Listen Rory, I'm not sure if you're aware of how hard it has been for me these past three years to be indebted to my parents.<eos> I decided a long time ago that I was gonna live my life without their help, but I went to them and I took their money and I'm not sorry I did, it was the right thing for you,
Fine, but you don't have to just throw it in their faces like that.<eos> I paid back a loan.<eos> You're supposed to pay back a loan.<eos> I have Polonius and then entire banking system on my side.<eos> I just think you could've done it differently.<eos> How?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Take a shot.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Rory, my relationship with my parents is very different from your relationship with them.
That'll keep you in microwave popcorn for a week.<eos> I'll just have to move something around.<eos> And I'll have to work Grandma in.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Grandma called and asked if I could come over and help her pick out a dress to wear to my graduation.<eos> - No. - I have to.<eos> Rory, my mother's been dressing herself for years and she has yet to show up at a function with her bra on the outside of her clothing.<eos> She asked, I can't say no.<eos> Tell her about the koala bears. She'll understand.<eos> Please stop making fun of them. We need every cent we can get.
Okay, we're out of Chinese completely, so we know Chinese is popular.<eos> Freddy's Happy Tokyo Takeout is a bust. That's the consensus, so let's lose the Freddy's menus, although Ang the delivery guy was a solid nine.<eos> If you're gonna go to Baja Bill's, you must get the cheese quesadilla, and ask for Stan or Tommy.<eos> If you don't get Stan or Tommy, go to Paco's Tacos.<eos> The delivery guys are butt ugly but the food is better.<eos> Look at all these girls together in one room having fun.<eos> We should dance and sing a Motown song into our hairbrushes.<eos> So, do you like your adoptive parents?<eos> I think it's good to be adopted.<eos> If you get sick of them, you just dump this set and go find the originals.
I need a maternal dispensation.<eos> For what?<eos> To drink coffee.<eos> Our agreement was no coffee until you could shave.<eos> My trimathelon is this afternoon.<eos> Waiting for the relevance.<eos> Caffeine is a proven smart drug.<eos> It opens up the vascular system in the brain.<eos> Mom, none of the other competitors have to ask their mom if they can drink coffee.<eos> Of course, most of them are seniors who shave.
I am just contemplating all the possibilities. What harm can that do?<eos> Plenty, You think this is good for Kevin?<eos> Dragging him around to Quacks instead of letting him get on with his life, the way it is? He's driving now.<eos> He's looking for a job.<eos> This is what we wanted.<eos> What you wanted.<eos> I'm not looking for magic.<eos> It's more like.<eos> What, miracles?<eos> I was raised to believe in them. So was I.
Come here.<eos> Aren't these the kids who were trying to rip us off?<eos> They're not trying to rip us off.<eos> They're from MIT... and they all have PhDs in high-speed data matching. ED:<eos> They look like the Three Stooges.<eos> We're running four million comparative calculations a second.<eos> These guys can accelerate that by 10.<eos> And they all have the latest technology in facial recognition.<eos> Why again, exactly, is it that they're trying to help us?<eos> I kind of made a little deal with them.
Curiosity is sort of a sine qua non in the "professor" business.<eos> How could your father go from being one of the most notorious cheats in Europe... to working for Ed Deline in the CIA?<eos> He made a few mistakes.<eos> Is he really dead?<eos> I wish I knew.<eos> Given your connection with Mr. Deline... I'm sure you can understand why any proposal you might make... must be met with scepticism.<eos> The Montecito's hosting a blackjack tournament.<eos> The finals are this Friday.<eos> Six play at the final table, two are wild cards.<eos> I can arrange for you to be one of them and I can make sure you win.
What are you doing with guns?<eos> Please don't hurt him.<eos> Please. Wait.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know, he was just here.<eos> I guess that's one window he could get out of.<eos> Elliot.<eos> School gym.<eos> Two bodies on the floor.<eos> Shooter standing over them.
Who was it?<eos> Patient line.<eos> I know by now not to ask.<eos> She went out right after that.<eos> How many of your patients live or work in Washington Heights?<eos> I'm not sure any of them do.<eos> We're gonna need a list.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Doctor-patient confidentiality.<eos> Honey, you do enough for them.
So, where are you going?<eos> Denver.<eos> He's already killed four people in five days.<eos> Danielle Franklin's probably next, and she hasn't returned my calls.<eos> Paul, this is crazy!<eos> You have no idea who is doing this or why.<eos> For all you know, you could be on his list too.<eos> Maybe I am.<eos> You know, whether I like it or not, I'm linked to these people.<eos> I feel like I need to be with them.
Well, no.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> We met last year.<eos> - Gail, I can't help you here.<eos> - All right, Gail. Why don't we go...<eos> She's scared to death.<eos> I gotta go in there.<eos> Sharona, you can't.<eos> Okay. There are two knives onstage.<eos> One of them is real.
So what are you going to do while I'm finding poison in a health snack?<eos> I'll wait.<eos> There's a futon by the cabinet over there.<eos> Oh, bless you.<eos> What are you, my priest?<eos> Curse you?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> My neuropathology examine indicates that our victim succumbed to a cerebral embolism here in the parietal lobe.<eos> I also found a number of clots.<eos> Most of them centered in the renal artery.
If I go to prison, they'lI kill me.<eos> Did you really think you'd get away with it?<eos> There was no other way.<eos> After all, aren't you in the business of lies?<eos> I want to stop.<eos> I do.<eos> But when I see the boys... I feel things.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I want them.
Cut me some slack here.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> You really miss her, don't you?<eos> Megan.<eos> I can't even grieve in private, because Julia knows who I'm grieving for.<eos> I have to go into the bathroom to....<eos> You should have seen me at Annie's party this weekend.<eos> I scared the kids.<eos> They had never seen a clown so sad.<eos> One of them came up to me and offered me a cookie.
Well, well, well, Agent Taylor,<eos> - are you here to visit me?<eos> - Fuck you, Keller.<eos> Aww, G-man, don't get grumpy.<eos> You're the one who made the deal with Heekin.<eos> You're the one who got him to fib.<eos> He saw you dump the body.<eos> Wasn't it J. Edgar Hoover who said, "Cheaters never prosper"?<eos> Careful there, sir.<eos> You killed two other men, Keller, and I'm gonna get you for one of them.
- What?<eos> - I'll cover my tracks, pay off the C.O.s. And if I'm caught, I'll take sole blame.<eos> I can kill him.<eos> I will kill him if you promise me an upgrade.<eos> Done.<eos> My son Harry is coming here today.<eos> It's the first time I'll be seeing him in six years.<eos> Six years?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And Genevieve's parents, they took Harry the baby to live with them in San Diego.
You asked to see me, Father?<eos> Yes, come in, sit down.<eos> What's this about?<eos> Your being pregnant.<eos> I'm not trying to insinuate myself into anything.<eos> I just wanted you to know that if you want to talk.<eos> What I tell you remains between us, right?<eos> 'Cause I could lose my job.<eos> I promise.<eos> My relationship with men in general has been disastrous, yet here I am surrounded by them.
I promise.<eos> My relationship with men in general has been disastrous, yet here I am surrounded by them.<eos> Which is why--<eos> Father, since coming to Oz, I have fucked a lot of men.<eos> Yeah!<eos> A lot of prisoners.<eos> - You're shocked.<eos> - In a way, yes.<eos> And, um, in a way, no.<eos> Now, I'm pregnant by one of them.
I mean, Keller is guilty.<eos> Yes, but it hasn't been proven.<eos> Your saying that he said something he didn't say is not proof.<eos> Tobias, we live in a nation of laws, some of which are inspired and some of which are just lousy.<eos> But we can't abandon our moral code whenever it's convenient.<eos> Then we might as well just open all the gates of all the prisons.<eos> I want to be with my children.<eos> My dear Tobias... in all my years sitting across that desk,<eos> I have learned one thing-- Most people who come to me with a problem have already made up their minds how they'll proceed.<eos> They're just here hoping I'll agree with them, hoping I'll make them feel better.
I had an inspiration.<eos> Now just wait a minute, wait a minute, back up.<eos> You want to start your own company?<eos> Yes, bookbinding.<eos> I've done the research.<eos> Perfect size business to run from Oz.<eos> I presume you're not looking to the state for money to start this little venture.<eos> No, we Muslims will pool our bank accounts.<eos> It's a small risk.<eos> My publishers have agreed to let me produce Augustus' book for them.
I think that's a deer.<eos> After being blackmailed, I decided to check in on Jordan.<eos> You tell me, Donna. Do I look like I need more drugs?<eos> Ow, my face!<eos> Then again, I have other problems.<eos> I know some windshield hush money won't keep the karma gods from coming after Turk and me.<eos> Q-tip, Dr Murphy called.<eos> They need you to cover his call tonight.<eos> Dude, Dr Wen's doing a stomach stapling and he wants you to be there to hold back the guy's fat flap.<eos> Apparently, my face is scaring my patients, so you're gonna take them off my hands for about a week.
It's a little early in the interrogation to be showing all your cards.<eos> Where do you go now when I say... "I don't know who the Toros or Los Mags are"?<eos> - Our house, our rules.<eos> - Oh, this hasn't always been your house.<eos> This used to be Mexico.<eos> And I've been reading about your rules.<eos> Yes, we saw the law books at your place.<eos> You could only keep me here for six hours without charging me with a crime.<eos> You're a prime suspect in the fire murders of two men last night. - We can hold you for 24 hours.<eos> - And I can provide many people... who will be happy to say I was with them... when this awful crime took place.
Speaking in tongues, what great kids.<eos> Full house. Jacks over twos.<eos> Ha, ha, read them and strip, Barn.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Make me forget my troubles.<eos> Oh, I hate this game.<eos> Look at all this. The great food, the party, the sunshine. Pfft!<eos> Hard to believe one God came up with all this.<eos> Well, there's probably a lot of gods.<eos> Yeah, and some of them's gotta be chicks.
So my dinner can be from six to seven or from seven to eight.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Which do you want tonight?<eos> I'll take seven.<eos> Actually, I'll take six.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> I had a late lunch.<eos> Just use that pen there to initial it.<eos> Of course, other people also use the kitchen.<eos> If you want to make a schedule with them, feel free to use my system.
- Dreadful things.<eos> - He made that young one cry.<eos> - Little Edward.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - You can't drink here.<eos> - Oh, hello, Ellen.<eos> Where's your boyfriend?<eos> Cub Scout meeting?<eos> You're upsetting everyone.<eos> You know, I remember a day when the actors would've been thrilled to have the artistic director joined them at the bar.
They're in the lobby, they're on the program, they're on the back of the tickets.<eos> - Oliver.<eos> - We're sold out.<eos> Who's this?<eos> Actors.<eos> Michael Gerning, wife and child.<eos> Trevor McKinnon, wife and mother.<eos> Actors?<eos> Actors do attend the theater every now and then, Richard.<eos> They've been in the company for over twenty years between them, but there was nothing for them this season.
Well, we at Cosmopolitan- Lenstrex disagree. Life, anyone's life, regardless of race...<eos> Well, I must find a new Vice-President of Customer Care, mustn't I?<eos> Guess so.<eos> So tell me about the new gift shop expansion.<eos> Well, it was like pulling teeth to get them to do anything.<eos> I mean, do you know, when I showed up at this festival, they had a table over there with four t-shirts on it.<eos> All smalls.<eos> Four pathetic t-shirts.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Now, 81% of the people that come to this festival go through that store and 41% of them buy between twenty and thirty dollars worth of merchandise each.
I thought you'd understand.<eos> You owe me, Lana.<eos> I saved your life.<eos> I know. But Lex didn't do anything to you.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened to your father. But going after innocent people won't bring him back.<eos> These freaks aren't people, Lana. No matter how much they seem like it.<eos> Look at Jake.<eos> All right, he was best friend for three years, and I had no idea.<eos> - And you're being fooled just like I was.<eos> - What do you mean? Clark Kent is one of them.
Every opening in there is wired with alarms.<eos> The kidnappers control the security system. They've threatened to shoot hostages if anyone so much as sets a toe inside.<eos> Come on, hero. You're coming with me.<eos> Move it!<eos> So, what are we gonna do?<eos> They saw you kill Kern.<eos> They can ID us, Pyne.<eos> And I for one am not going down for murder.<eos> Understand me?<eos> We will deal with them when the time comes.
But I'm pretty sure I know who did.<eos> All right, Lex... what's so urgent that you insisted I fly in for a face-to-face.<eos> I'm missing Domingo's La Bohème.<eos> Well, consider this a curtain call on our own private opera, Dad.<eos> Would you ask your Seeing Eye dog to wait outside?<eos> Anything you have to say, you can say in front of Dominic.<eos> A representative from an offshore shell company... who bears an uncanny resemblance to Mr. Santori here... has been quietly approaching LexCorp employees and buying their voting shares.<eos> Is that so?<eos> I was under the impression they had no intention of selling.<eos> What'd you get on them?
Go! Go!<eos> Go!<eos> I gotta get up there. My parents are coming.<eos> Your parents died. In the meteor shower.<eos> That's ridiculous, my parents aren't human.<eos> Hey, I think his neck's broken.<eos> Cyrus, you can save him.<eos> They're here. I can't, I'll be stranded on this world forever.<eos> - You have the power to heal.<eos> - Why do you care about them?
The account is held in the name of Victor Shvitkoy.<eos> Why did you allow us to come into this without knowing that one of the most powefful psychopaths in the Russian mafia was involved?<eos> Did you know he has an agent working in your bank?<eos> Not Maxime Baxter.<eos> She's one of our best.<eos> Birth certificates, passports - everything's false.<eos> We believe she's Victor Shvitkoy's daughter.<eos> Dear God.<eos> (Tom) I have two officers in the field.<eos> One of them is going to meet this woman in two hours' time.
I thought you were a lot cleverer.<eos> How's Tom doing?<eos> - Tom's fine. - Really?<eos> I thought Harry would take a dim view of inter-agency liaisons.<eos> If you want to discuss Tom, organise your next rendezvous with him.<eos> Let's talk about Rafa.<eos> - You'll never turn Mariella Hernandez by playing happy families.<eos> I have clients in Spain who know a lot about Rafa.<eos> They have information that will have her dancing to your tune.<eos> All they require is that you allow them to dispose of Rafa at the end.
I don't know.<eos> Is it?<eos> Yes, we do this kind of thing all the time.<eos> Oh, well, good.<eos> That's- that's comforting, then.<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> Lord Yu can no longer be permitted to command the opposition to Anubis.<eos> His Jaffa will follow your orders in his name, but others will not.<eos> And we need the combined force of the system lords.<eos> None of them can be trusted.
- What is this place?<eos> - It's one of our medical isolation rooms.<eos> Could you be less specific?<eos> In a military facility on a planet called Earth.<eos> Earth.<eos> The ship was bound for Ardena.<eos> How far are we from Ardena?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The other passengers... they will be concerned for me.<eos> As I am for them, of course.
He'll even arrange a visit.<eos> It might only be once but he'll want one final confirmation that Cochran is guilty.<eos> There. Do you see him?<eos> He's the one locked up not me.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> He did.<eos> Our man's dealing with his guilt by transferring it on to Cochran.<eos> What guilt?<eos> These men were dealing in drugs and prostitution.<eos> One of them... possibly Steve Harvey,
Right.<eos> - You're getting laid, right?<eos> - Come on. Of course.<eos> You're still a virgin, aren't you?<eos> Okay, now, you said he was benched from the soccer team?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's when we started hanging out more.<eos> - His parents never told us about that.<eos> - Maybe they didn't know.<eos> Any problems with them?
- That's so much better.<eos> Unfortunately, I have to wipe it off.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too<eos> - Now get out of here.<eos> This is bad luck. - Okay, sorry.<eos> I can't believe this is happening.<eos> I and you should see my parents.<eos> - How guilty they look.<eos> I feel so badly for them.
The car that hit Scott's was a silver-gray BMW.<eos> Gus drives a red Honda.<eos> Jack, I got the information on that warehouse.<eos> It had been on the market for almost a year.<eos> Asking price dropped to $2 million, still no bites.<eos> The insurance policy pays $3 million.<eos> - That's pretty convenient for the owner.<eos> - Owners. It's a real-estate group.<eos> Six different partners.<eos> One of them wouldn't happen to drive a silver BMW, would he?
Greetings, superheroes.<eos> Remember me?<eos> I don't remember much, buddy! And you're no looker.<eos> Professor, isn't it time for your nap?<eos> Zookeeper, how did you know our real identities?<eos> Let's just say a little bird told me.<eos> Leela told her parents. Leela's parents blabbed.<eos> Leela? Ls the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy?<eos> Yes. My parents were so hurt, I couldn't help it.<eos> But I distinctly told them not to tell anyone.
Ray?<eos> What?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I told you yesterday I was going to pick out paint colors for the bedroom today.<eos> I told you I wanted to go golfing.<eos> Yeah, and I said, "Too bad."<eos> I thought that meant for you.<eos> Ray, I'm going to the hardware store.<eos> You only have to watch the boys 'cause Ally's at Molly's.<eos> I'll spend the whole day with them tomorrow, okay? I promise.
Forces that could erupt easily to produce the frenzied mob which had the power to destroy even governments.<eos> It was this they believed had happened in Russia.<eos> To many this meant that one of the guiding principles of mass democracy was wrong; the belief that human beings could be trusted to make decisions on a rational basis.<eos> The leading political writer, Walter Lippmann argued that if human beings were in reality driven by unconscious irrational forces then it was necessary to re-think democracy.<eos> What was needed was a new elite that could manage what he called the bewildered herd. This would be done through psychological techniques that would control the unconscious feelings of the masses.<eos> And so here you have Walter Lippmann, probably the most influential political thinker in the United States, who is essentially saying the basic mechanism of the mass mind is unreason, is irrationality, is animality.<eos> He believes that the mob in the street, which is how he sees ordinary people, are people who are driven not by their minds but by their spinal chords.<eos> The notion of animal drives, unconscious and instinctual drives, lurking beneath the surface of civilization;<eos> and so they started looking towards psychological science as a way of understanding the mechanisms by which the popular mind works specifically with the goal of figuring out how to understand and how to apply those mechanisms to strategies for social control.<eos> Edward Bernays was fascinated by Lippmann's arguments and also saw a way to promote himself by using them.
Freud arrived in London as Britain was preparing for war and he settled with his daughter Anna in a house in Hampstead.<eos> But Freud's cancer was now far advanced and in September 1939, just 3 weeks after the outbreak of war, he died.<eos> The second world war would utterly transform the way government saw democracy and the people they governed.<eos> Next week's program will show how the American government, as a result of the war became convinced there were savage dangerous forces hidden inside all human beings.<eos> Forces that needed to be controlled.<eos> The terrible evidence from the death camps seemed to show what happened when these forces were unleashed.<eos> And politicians and planners in post war America would come to believe that hidden under the surface of their own population were the same dangerous forces.<eos> And they would turn to the Freud family to help control this enemy within.<eos> And ever adaptable Edward Bernays would work not just for the American government but the CIA<eos> and Sigmund Freud's daughter Anna, would also become powerful in the United States because she believed that people could be taught to control the irrational forces within them.
And this was the vision psychoanalysis brought.<eos> That you could really change people.<eos> And you could change them almost in limitless ways.<eos> In the late forties a vast project began in America to apply the ideas of psychoanalysis to the masses.<eos> Psychological guidance centers were set up in hundreds of towns.<eos> They were staffed by psychiatrists who believed it was their job to control the hidden forces inside the minds of millions of ordinary Americans.<eos> At the same time thousands of counselors were trained to apply psychoanalysis to marriage guidance,<eos> and social workers were sent out to visit people's homes and advise them on the psychological structure of family life.<eos> Behind all this was the fundamental idea of Anna Freuds' that if people were encouraged to conform to the accepted patterns of family and social life then their ego would be strengthened.<eos> They would be able to control the dangerous forces within them.
Bernays had manipulated the American people but he had done so because he, like many others at the time believed that the interests of business and the interests of America were indivisible.<eos> Especially when faced with the threat of communism.<eos> But Bernays was convinced that to explain this rationally to the American people was impossible.<eos> Because they were not rational.<eos> Instead one had to touch on their inner fears and manipulate them in the interest of a higher truth.<eos> He called it the engineering of consent.<eos> He was doing it for the American way of life to which he was devoted, sincerely devoted.<eos> And yet he felt the people were really pretty stupid.<eos> And that's the paradox.<eos> If you don't leave it up to the people themselves but force them to choose what you want them to choose, however subtly, then it's not democracy anymore.
- Diego, let's go home.<eos> - We have to fight these bastards.<eos> The painting is up here.<eos> I'll do it again and use his money.<eos> We haven't enough money to go to Chicago.<eos> We're not going to Chicago.<eos> They canceled the commission.<eos> - It's time to go home. - What?<eos> My tail between my legs?<eos> I am tired of these people and I'm tired of who you are around them.
No, you're not dead yet. Just paralyzed temporarily.<eos> You're an amazing creature, Spider-Man.<eos> You and I are not so different.<eos> I'm not like you.<eos> You're a murderer.<eos> Well, to each his own.<eos> I chose my path, you chose the way of the hero.<eos> And they found you amusing for a while, the people of this city.<eos> But the one thing they love more than a hero is to see a hero fail, fall, die trying.<eos> In spite of everything you've done for them, eventually, they will hate you.
Yeah, if you look at it like that.<eos> I mean, look at me, I show up here, see the same people, take shipment to the stores, see those same people, eat at the same places, see those same people...<eos> See. I like seeing those people.<eos> Well most of them anyway.<eos> If I want something different, I can make it different, go a different way.<eos> Eat at a different place, do an interstate gig.<eos> See I never went to high school...<eos> Look at them.<eos> In the morning they will get up, and go to the store.<eos> And the paste will be on the shelves where it always is, and not one of them will give a moment's thought as to how it got there.
The photon milk acts as both a nutrient supply and conductor.<eos> It enhances the images they receive.<eos> We call the female Agatha. The twins are Arthur and Dashiell.<eos> We scan by way of optical tomography.<eos> White-light pinpoints pulse along the length of the headgear and are reread after absorption through their brain tissue.<eos> In other words, we see what they see.<eos> They don't feel pain. We keep their heads stocked with dopamine.<eos> Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels.<eos> Don't want them to drift off into too deep a sleep. - They can't be kept too awake either.<eos> - Don't think of them as human.
Not yet.<eos> We haven't found your lawyer yet, Stu, but we're getting close. Ok?<eos> I'm offering you a chance to redeem yourself.<eos> Come on, Stu. Humble yourself in front of your loved ones and millions of strangers and me.<eos> It's do-or-die time.<eos> What, you couldn't find anyone worse than me?<eos> I'm not, not a murderer or a child molester but a publicist who has fantasies about pretty little actresses, who spends all his money on Italian suits and dry-cleaning so people will think he's important, who doesn't waste his time being nice to people<eos> who aren't any use to him. These are my crimes?<eos> Stuart, I know your crimes.<eos> Tell them.
Take it back?<eos> Johnny, I ought to kill you!<eos> Get out of the Points and don't come back.<eos> Where are you going, boil?<eos> Come along.<eos> Come on.<eos> Tell us John, what's the trouble?<eos> No trouble, Bill.<eos> Still hiding out with your friends?<eos> No, I'm not with them, Bill.
I can't take that.<eos> No, it's not what you think.<eos> This is my pager number.<eos> Take this bag and hide it where he can't find it.<eos> When you know he'll be there a while, page me, then leave.<eos> Why?<eos> Some guys will take care of him. You won't see him again.<eos> - I don't want to do this.<eos> - They're cops.<eos> I work with them. I messed up.
Right.<eos> We kill these people, then we spend the treasure.<eos> No, we will study them, learn their weaknesses.<eos> Why not just kill them?<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I'll run up to Paris...<eos> bam, bam, bam, bam! I'm back before week's end.<eos> We spend the treasure.<eos> How is this a bad plan?<eos> Death is too good for them.
Everything's really OK... just as long as he knows what happened here.<eos> As long as there's somebody to tell him.<eos> How far could I get anyway?<eos> A colored man running through the German countryside?<eos> It'd be target practice.<eos> It started with a noble idea.<eos> Letting colored men join the fight.<eos> But no one in the Air Corps ever considered what might happen... if one of those Tuskegee men ever got shot down.<eos> No one ever asked what would happen... if a colored officer was suddenly captured... and sent to a stalag like this one.<eos> But Lincoln Scott was shot down and he was sent to a stalag... and once here, he wasn't just thrown in... amongst white enlisted men, he was quartered with them.
No, he not gonna get us.<eos> I'm not going to stay here.<eos> They're up to something.<eos> I'm going to take a look.<eos> I lost one. I lost one.<eos> To Constable Riggs, police station, Nullagine.<eos> At present we lack the funds to pursue the missing half-caste girls Molly and Daisy.<eos> I would ask to be kept informed of their whereabouts so that at some future date they may indeed be... recovered.<eos> We face an uphill battle with these people - especially the bush natives, who have to be protected against themselves.<eos> If they would only understand what we are trying to do for them.
What's the matter with you all? Hu? Hu?<eos> It's not funny.<eos> you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.<eos> What are you talking about my tie? What's my tie got to do with anything?<eos> -I need the tie for my work. -Your work?<eos> I work.<eos> Playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto.<eos> They don't give a damn about people's sufferings.<eos> You blame me for their apathy.<eos> I do because I see everyday they don't even notice what's going on around them.
I have had enough.<eos> I mean, how do you people live like this?<eos> That's it, that's it.<eos> Did you know there's a world out there that has nothing to do with chitlins and children or beer?<eos> I liked her better when she was crazy.<eos> Jake.<eos> Why do you treat them like something you stepped in?<eos> - You asked for it!<eos> - I asked for it?<eos> You show up, steal my money then insult my friends, acting like you're better than them!

I risked my life for it.<eos> Lost a baby.<eos> did you kill those people?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I have to.<eos> That was what I was trained to do.<eos> They lied to me.<eos> They told me they were terrorists.<eos> Want me to interrogate them.<eos> So, I do? what you have to do to get information out of them and...
Especially after this...<eos> Four geneticists killed in different countries.<eos> Why did you do it?<eos> These scientists were killed before I even got to them.<eos> My enemies have a list of genetic engineers like you.<eos> So they are after me now?<eos> Don't kill me!<eos> - Where's your car?<eos> - Behind the building.<eos> I'll take care of them.
Can I have a<eos> - bourbon, straight up?<eos> Can I have a twist, please?<eos> I'm not a partner here.<eos> That actually doesn't bother me.<eos> Partners have to bring in business.<eos> I just gotta do my job.<eos> If I don't like it here, I can leave.<eos> - What's not to like?<eos> - Watching you become one of them.
Yes!<eos> You will be in my report for leaving your post.<eos> And you will be in mine!<eos> You needlessly endangered this boat and its crew.<eos> Two hundred million Soviet citizens are depending on us.<eos> On us, Captain Vostrikov, to save them from nuclear attack.<eos> You risked them as well!<eos> I took this boat and these men to the edge because we need to know where it is.<eos> These 120 men are a crew now because they achieved something together that they did not think they could do.<eos> Next time, when it is not a drill, they will go to the edge and past it and die, if necessary, because that is what their duty demands of them.
Look, we're not lost.<eos> I've done this a million times.<eos> When everything is killing me, I just say, "Screw it," and go straight ahead.<eos> Sundial.<eos> I'll just set this up, we'll wait a few minutes and then we'll be able to tell which way the sun's moving.<eos> We should be headed southeast.<eos> So, you collect anything?<eos> Not really, no.<eos> Yeah, well, you know it's not really about collecting the thing. It's about being able...<eos> The thing about computers, the thing I like is that I'm immersed in them but it's not like a living thing that's gonna leave or die or something.
I can't go back.<eos> I've got pages of false starts and wrong approaches.<eos> -I'm way past my deadline.<eos> -I'll tell you a secret.<eos> A last act makes a film.<eos> Wow them in the end, and you got a hit.<eos> You can have flaws, problems, but wow them in the end and you've got a hit.<eos> Find an ending. But don't cheat.<eos> And don't you dare bring in a deus ex machina.<eos> Your characters must change and the change must come from them.
The criminal? !<eos> Did he force you to bring him here so he could molest you?<eos> His home just went up in flames.<eos> So I invited him to stay with us for a while.<eos> Okay, but I'm making an inventory of every single item in this house.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> Look!<eos> He already stole something. He's hiding it in his jacket.<eos> I didn't steal this. It's a card my parents gave me.<eos> So why don't you go stay with them?
So, Davey, did you play the hockey when you were a child?<eos> No, hockey players get up too early.<eos> This guy's sport always was and always will be basketball.<eos> Back in '81 he was the star of what is still known to this very day as the JCC miracle game.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> The JCC was down by 2 4 points.<eos> The bad news is we stand no chance of winning this game.<eos> The good news is it's Chanukah, so you'll all get presents tonight anyway.<eos> Speaking of presents our parents come to all our games even though we always lose.<eos> So I was thinking maybe tonight we could try to win one for them.
You know what, it has to be.<eos> You know I wasn't happy and that was fine.<eos> But this is where I hit the wall. Cause I've seen you like this before.<eos> I was willing to put myself through it, but I can't do it anymore.<eos> We didn't get them.<eos> We didn't get the guys that did it.<eos> We fucking didn't do it... cause we... I lost him.<eos> I lost him.<eos> You know, you're running at this for all the wrong reasons.<eos> What, you think catching him is gonna make you less like them.
It's a good car<eos> It's all electric<eos> Look<eos> -The windows...<eos> -They're automatic<eos> It's got an alarm<eos> Guys, have some Arabic coffee<eos> Ronen!<eos> Go on home.<eos> I'll deal with them
One's a woman, eh?<eos> Hey, look lively.<eos> Woman onboard.<eos> Hey, Hoag, spread the news... three tea bags, and I hear one's, uh, bazooma.<eos> We got ourselves a filly?<eos> Sweet holy Jesus.<eos> You're gonna wanna hear this.<eos> Hey, boys... here's the news.<eos> Front page... we got three redcoats, and guess what.<eos> One of them's a bleeder.
I'm... I'm sorry that we couldn't save more.<eos> I...<eos> Now this... the third member of your party, he's...<eos> One of my patients.<eos> Well, under normal circumstances, I'd be able to drop you at the nearest port in England, but, uh, it's a 300-mile detour for us.<eos> So I'm sorry.<eos> It seems as though we're stuck with each other.<eos> Oh, uh, last thing.<eos> Just try not to fraternize with the men.<eos> Most of the men are fine, but some of them get a little strange about having...
How are those hydrogen levels?<eos> It's almost 3% .<eos> Chief says we need to vent before long.<eos> All right.<eos> We'll ride surface tonight... 2100.<eos> Is there something else?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just can't believe it's one of our own hands doing this.<eos> I've been on the boat seven weeks now, and I know most of the guys.<eos> I just don't believe it's one of them.
Attention!<eos> At ease, gentlemen.<eos> Welcome to the new cavalry.<eos> We will ride into battle.<eos> And this will be our horse.<eos> You don't have to catch it.<eos> You don't have to feed it.<eos> But I can assure you that neither the new technology, nor your status as officers... will keep you above the danger.<eos> Sergeant Major Plumley and I come from the paratroopers, where the officer is always the first one out of the plane.<eos> Because to follow your instincts and to inspire your men by your example... you have to be with them where the metal meets the meat.
I know God has a plan for me.<eos> I just hope it's to help protect orphans... not make any.<eos> Well, why don't we ask him?<eos> Come on, let's go ask him.<eos> Our Father in Heaven, before we go into battle, every soldier among us will approach you each in his own way.<eos> Our enemies too, according to their own understanding, will ask for protection and for victory.<eos> And so we bow before your infinite wisdom.<eos> We offer our prayers as best we can.<eos> I pray you watch over the young men like Jack Geoghegan that I lead into battle.<eos> You use me as your instrument in this awful hell of war to watch over them.
She finished ninth that year.<eos> I came in 19th.<eos> After the race, I...<eos> I tried to find her... but she'd already gone.<eos> That's it?<eos> Afraid so.<eos> It's all I know.<eos> Well, a bargain's a bargain.<eos> I guess the dogs are yours.<eos> Oh, well, I'll take good care of them.
He was really tiny.<eos> He'd spin a lot and make lots of turns... and suddenly he'd lift his leg up... and hit me right here.<eos> But I wouldn't stop, I'd just go on.<eos> I liked dancing with him, but it hurt.<eos> It was just a stylie of dancing.<eos> It was his stylle.<eos> An aggressive stylle, wasn't it?<eos> Maybe it's that he was tiny, and I was taller... so he'd kick me right you know where.<eos> I'd dance with guys who came from work... with dirtyl collars and spotted suits.<eos> But I didn't care because all I wanted was to dance... not to go out with them.
- What is inside there?<eos> Out of the way.<eos> - Officer down!<eos> Help! - Send backup now!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Break the lock!<eos> This is Li Yun-chan at the scene of the massacre that took place inside the Central World Building.<eos> Nine officers and 24 members of the True Sage cult are listed as dead.<eos> It has been confirmed that Huang Yi-feng was killed.<eos> - Among them are professors, doctors police officers and even politicians.
Have him dead within an hour.<eos> Hail Caesar.<eos> The ranks here are depleted.<eos> My men will be joining you.<eos> How shall we explain to the people That these men have become senators ?<eos> They haven't been selected by the provisional leaders .<eos> The law is changed.<eos> And keep in mind the people trust my jugement.<eos> You will be joined by my finest men.<eos> I've spent eight years with them in Gaul.
The poor guy just had a fucking seizure.<eos> Hold on.<eos> There was this thing on Nova.<eos> They discovered a totally isolated clan of people in a remote region of Greenland.<eos> They were living in a technologically medieval microculture.<eos> The Untladhavns.<eos> Yeah, no kidding.<eos> And when they sent in this cultural anthropologist he discovered that these people never lied.<eos> They didn't even have a word for it.<eos> That's great for them.
I was at the 120 bus stop today but with Juliet.<eos> My friend.<eos> She's a girl, and we weren't kissing or anything for God's sake!<eos> - Swear by Babaji.<eos> - I swear on Babaji's name.<eos> Sometimes these English girls have such short hair...<eos> You just can't tell.<eos> They must have made a mistake.<eos> His parents are just making an excuse.<eos> We were never good enough for them.
You wouldn't even be going out if it wasn't for me.<eos> You'd still be sitting home with your kid.<eos> I'm just trying to be everybody's friend... and I don't see anything wrong with that.<eos> You are really belittling yourself.<eos> Belittling?<eos> -Big word, Deb.<eos> -You are.<eos> You throw yourself at every guy you see.<eos> My God! You should talk!<eos> You've been with most of them.
Maybe it's Stalin<eos> It's Lenin. Look, he's a bit bald<eos> Look, he's a bit bald<eos> I'll kill you, scumbag!<eos> We'll get you!<eos> The inhabitants calmed down again<eos> Despite the arrival of the revolutionary army nothing really changed<eos> I have a problem<eos> The village hooligans?<eos> It has nothing to do with them
I'm getting in a bad mood.<eos> All this fucking show.<eos> He isn't there.<eos> Hey, you bastards! If we're not going to start, take me down!<eos> Cheyenne!<eos> Niente.<eos> He isn't in the saloon, or in the bank.<eos> I even checked the stables.<eos> What about the camels?<eos> Sometimes he sleeps in with them.
What about the indians?<eos> They're not getting out yet.<eos> This country is like that.<eos> The judge wants to ask them about some radio cassettes...<eos> Are we having the party without them?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> There are some really shitty moments in life.<eos> A lot more than you'd think.<eos> Nobody can prevent them.<eos> You have to make the most of the time in between them. Not enjoying yourself when you can is the greatest sin in the world.
They depend on you.<eos> How will they take this?<eos> Badly.<eos> Your duty is to fit in.<eos> I'm trying to, sir.<eos> You're trying to stand out.<eos> To be liked.<eos> -I've been watching you.<eos> -What if we'd saved those men?<eos> Even one of them?
Alright.<eos> Where are those men who fill the airplanes?<eos> Where do they go?<eos> With their wives, children and dogs?<eos> Where do the ones on land live?<eos> It could be anyone.<eos> All of them.<eos> Anyone who'd want to... and had a few minutes to listen to me.<eos> One grows fond of patients.<eos> You spend so much time with them... patients become relatives.
Shoot, Sakamoto!<eos> One of us has to die!<eos> Shoot!<eos> Now, Shoot!<eos> Sakamoto!<eos> If you don't shoot I will!<eos> Sakamoto!<eos> Excuse me... 2009, The Independence Memorial Hall<eos> These people are the ones who gave their lives to reclaim our country<eos> Without them you wouldn't be here
Anything like that. You don't know.<eos> [Fiske] When we were getting close to the beach, then you begin to feel, "God, this is real."<eos> Then as soon as they drop that ramp, and you're exposed, you feel like the nakedest person in the world.<eos> And you knew darn well they'd start shooting, which they did.<eos> [Merrill] Soon after that, all hell broke loose on the island.<eos> [Snowden] There was tremendous fire coming from the offense's positions.<eos> I had never seen anything like this in my life.<eos> Absolute hell.<eos> There were about 6 to 800 ships out here.<eos> I was on one of them.
Martial arts and music are different but they share the same principle<eos> Both stress attaining a supreme state<eos> Sky and I faced each other for a long time<eos> Neither of us moved We fought the battle in our minds<eos> How swift thy sword!<eos> I thought I knew everything about my Kingdom I didn't know that Leng Meng County held a talent like yours<eos> Broken Sword<eos> Flying Snow<eos> By order of His Majesty!<eos> Flying Snow and Broken Sword have teamed up for assassination He who kills either of them will receive gold and land and be allowed to drink within 10 paces of His Majesty
Ridiculous! I wonder who would make such a terrible crank call.<eos> Just wait till I find out.<eos> -Mr.<eos> Chow, Mr. Yeung.<eos> -You're still here at this hour?<eos> Officers are investigating the case. They're in Chairman Chow's room.<eos> You stole Chow Lui's fingerprints from the coroner's laboratory?<eos> This will very soon prove whether my theory is correct.<eos> Sorry, Mr. Chow.<eos> I was with them originally, but....
I look at these people around me, and I'm thinking, "These are my friends?<eos> I don't even know these people." You know, and...<eos> and Naturelle, even.<eos> do I really know her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's all...<eos> The only people I trust are you, Jacob, and Frank... the guys I grew up with.<eos> I miss those boys.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I'm supposed to be meeting them.
I think he'll be okay.<eos> If it were me, I... I'd never last a day, but... Monty, he's different.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> You believe that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You don't fucking get it, do you?<eos> What don't I get?<eos> You want the simple version, Jake?<eos> Guys who look like Monty don't do well in prison, all right?<eos> Man, he's got three choices, and none of them are good.
That's all I can do is think about it.<eos> - I'm not gonna make it, Frank.<eos> - Yes, you will.<eos> There's a thousand guys up there who are harder than me.<eos> I mean, in a room, some junkie doesn't want to pay me, and Kostya behind me, I'm pretty scary.<eos> Up there, I'm a skinny white boy with no friends.<eos> Those guys are gonna use me up and end me.<eos> No, they won't, man.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because you're smarter than all of them.
Oh, how's that?<eos> Well, the prints.<eos> Look.<eos> Converse. High-tops. Chuck Taylor.<eos> You get it, right?<eos> You don't know who Chuck Taylor is?<eos> Basketball coach.<eos> Stanford Cardinals.<eos> We got the remains of two or three people.<eos> One of them could be a midget.
If it's privacy you want, Iet me give it to you.<eos> But I'II have what I want and wait no more.<eos> I have a genuine interest in Shakespeare. Mother, may we go?<eos> It was delightful to see you.<eos> -Mother, please.<eos> -Is something wrong?<eos> Uncle...<eos> I have been wounded past all healing... and by your friends.<eos> What can you mean? I have no friends.<eos> If they are not your friends, then more shame on you for bringing me among them.
She'll be playing with us all the time<eos> Won't have to go to school<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> It's summer vacation<eos> But think about it from parents' point of view<eos> They'll be so happy to see her again<eos> They'll love her more and the family will be closer we'll ask for exactly 26 million won<eos> How conscientious is that right?<eos> That money's nothing to them but for us it's a matter of life and death
- Yeah, you've never been a victim of crime, you haven't been assaulted.<eos> - You haven't been, you know... Why would you... So why not...<eos> Why don't you unload the gun? - Because the second amendment gives me the right to have it loaded.<eos> - I agree. I totally agree with that. I'm just saying...<eos> I mean, the second amendment gives me-- - Let's say it's a comfort factor.<eos> - It gives you comfort to know that there's a loaded gun.<eos> - Yeah. - Comfort meaning that it allows you to relax and feel safe?<eos> - Not worry about it.<eos> - Not worry, not be afraid. - And I'm not really, but, uh... I'm exercising one of the rights passed on down to me from those wise, old, dead white guys that invented this country.<eos> If it was good enough for them, it's good enough for me.
Nothing.<eos> Let's go someplace else.<eos> I know a nice pizza place near here.<eos> Pizza place?<eos> Let's go to a nightclub!<eos> What nightclub?<eos> The Why Not.<eos> There's a party sponsored by a toothpaste company.<eos> Can we get in?<eos> Sure, I made a commercial for them...
My favorite thing was the candy.<eos> New Year"s Eve... was probably the most joyous children"s holiday.<eos> Before the war... the relationships between different people were fairly normal.<eos> There were some incidents... where drunkards on the streets... would call us kikes.<eos> But they were drunks... so we did not pay too much attention to them.<eos> And as for decent people...<eos> Raisa Dashkevich ...we had many Russian friends, without discrimination.<eos> This is how they lived their lives in the Soviet Union:<eos> Children from Moscow, Kiev, and small towns... very poor and not so poor.<eos> Many of them did not even think about... what set them apart from other children.
- How have you been Wonny?<eos> - No one's home?<eos> - Wonny's mother went to get her hair done.<eos> What brings you here?<eos> You never come home without calling.<eos> You must be hungry.<eos> Let me fix you some lunch.<eos> Are you getting along with your friends okay?<eos> I can beat them all.<eos> You're supposed to be friendly with them.
You listen to this since you're kids.<eos> How can you not believe in ghosts?<eos> But try and remember what happened in the last 30 years.<eos> Have you heard of any news reporting a ghost killing a man?<eos> No.<eos> Because it's only stored information.<eos> Useless information playing tricks in your brains.<eos> So I hope you will not mention the word "ghost" again.<eos> Dr Law, you really do not believe in ghosts?<eos> If I say there are ghosts, you'll be reminded of them.
Will you live with me?<eos> Here come the others.<eos> Who's that man walking with O-Shin?<eos> She's in love again.<eos> With him?<eos> Yes.<eos> I see.<eos> Yes, you can see that from here.<eos> I keep telling her that people with bad luck... will only make her unlucky, too.<eos> But she's always so nice to them.
A woman is watching her.<eos> Yes, this woman, It's me.<eos> This little girl isn't me.<eos> It's my child.<eos> This child, I would've wanted her to drown.<eos> I'm a woman who wanted kill her child.<eos> Despite that, Do you still want to see your mother in me?<eos> I discovered something.<eos> I found documents about the American prisoner's camp.<eos> According to them, a Japanese translator accompanying a prisoner was irradiated.
Don't take this for a joke.<eos> I would like... to adopt you.<eos> I'd like to have you as adopted daughter at our home.<eos> You don't have to answer now.<eos> I though, you could think it over.<eos> I've just spoken to those people.<eos> Those who could've been my parents.<eos> They have the DNA test results...<eos> It seems they're not my parents.<eos> I'm sorry for them.
My father won't let me.<eos> I'll have to help my mom.<eos> Keep on growing, I'll talk to your dad.<eos> No, I don't want to grow up.<eos> They're coming for her.<eos> - Who?<eos> The soldiers.<eos> I'm not going.<eos> - It's for questioning.<eos> The others were dressed like them.
Are you able to see?<eos> What uniforms!<eos> Luxury, empire... power....<eos> Look over there.<eos> Higher.<eos> Can you see?<eos> Yes, I see now!<eos> One must not trust this world. You are right.<eos> Beware, court officials are cunning.<eos> Some of them are mediums.
I'll read to you until you fall asleep, tomorrow you go on. A kiss.<eos> "I know what we can do, said a flamingo, we'll put on red and black socks, and coral snakes will fall in love with us.<eos> My sister in law, the owl, has red and black socks said the armadillo who was mocking the flamingos.<eos> It would certainly be a pleasure, said the owl.<eos> And in a while she came back with the socks, but they weren't real socks, they were coral-snake skins.<eos> Beautiful snake skins that the owl had just taken off, the snakes it had caught.<eos> Don't you worry about a thing, the owl said, only remember you must dance all night long, don't you ever stop, not even a moment, if you do, instead of dancing you'll cry.<eos> The flamingos, mad with joy, put on the snake skins as if they were socks, and they flew to the party.<eos> All the animals envied the flamingos when they appeared in their beautiful socks.<eos> The snakes wanted to dance with them only, and since the flamingos didn't stop moving their legs, they couldn't see clearly what those beautiful socks were made of."
They're coming to protect Islam, to maintain peace.<eos> Why would they kill people?<eos> Why should Muslims kill Muslims?<eos> What should we do now?<eos> Other villagers are fleeing.<eos> Some students raided the police armory, they've taken position on the bridge.<eos> They're planning to resist.<eos> What's the point of resisting?<eos> If you resist, you'll just provoke them.<eos> They say your brother is with them.
You should come out.<eos> I want men to yearn for my affection.<eos> Darling.<eos> Honey.<eos> I want men to go crazy for me.<eos> To fight each other...<eos> FOR ME!<eos> Have you had enough?<eos> Come out!<eos> No, I want to flirt with men and party with them!
Give her some time.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> Since you changed your number you've had 2 calls.<eos> Your friend Ho Jung and me.<eos> That's not right.<eos> I've had three strange calls since then.<eos> There are two possibilities.<eos> The phone company's records are messed up... or the stalker knows... how to block the calls from showing up.<eos> Those sex scandal guys. Will be on trial in a few days.<eos> It's probably one of them.

Will be on trial in a few days.<eos> It's probably one of them.<eos> But be careful.<eos> Here's a present.<eos> You really think this is going to help?<eos> Hit them once and they're out.<eos> The men involved in the underage sex scandal have been identified.<eos> It's shocking that one of them.
- I don't want any donation.<eos> - Get out.<eos> Driver, throw her out.<eos> - Excuse me, wait a minute.<eos> - Please wait. - Get out.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Got her.<eos> Sorry..<eos> Mr. Khanna, please try to understand.<eos> The people of Palampur are eagerly waiting for you or Mr. Dev Khanna to do something for them.
- What does 'damn poachers' mean?<eos> Well, damn means that...<eos> - No, poacher. Poachers?<eos> They're people that kill animals while it's forbidden.<eos> That's why the deer died<eos> For a few stupid banknotes.<eos> Are you sad?<eos> You know, death is part of life.<eos> But it never knocks first.<eos> Many people live like they have an eternity ahead of them.
You never know how long a goose needs.<eos> Some geese don't need much time.<eos> They're always ready.<eos> You work magic in the kitchen.<eos> The sauce is delicious.<eos> What's Mangi up to these days?<eos> He was landing fish at our quay.<eos> His wife's dead.<eos> Both his sons are at sea, and they're doing well.<eos> You should've screwed them instead!
Go on, Eliska. Go, go, Eliska.<eos> Hi, Ms. Maria do Céu.<eos> How do you do?<eos> -Fine.<eos> Welcome.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Before Sergio's tenure, at the wee hours... that lobby there... became the hang out place for us, ladies... to drink with the doormen all night... every night.<eos> About 1 am, I'd get insomniac, so I'd go down, too.<eos> We all ate, the doormen drank... got drunk, then one of them would go to sleep... on a foldable beach chair out of sight... and the lobby would then be deserted.
HIS SIZE HELPS HIM.<eos> GO, GO, GO!<eos> Ted: THERE ARE A COUPLE SMART KIDS IN MY GRADE, BUT...<eos> OUR CLASS ONLY HAS, LIKE, 40 KIDS IN IT.<eos> THEY JUST LIKE USING SIMPLE WORDS, WORDS THAT YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.<eos> A LOT OF THE TIME, THEY JUST TALK ABOUT THE SAME THINGS.<eos> A KID IN MY CLASS, ALL HE TALKS ABOUT IS TRUCKS.<eos> SO ANYTHING YOU SAY TO HIM THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WITH AN ENGINE OR HOW THE TRUCK RUNS, BESIDES REAL BASIC ENGLISH, HE WON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.<eos> HERE'S THE PEACOCKS.<eos> Ted: ONE OF THEM IS THE FIVE - YEAR-OLD MALE.
I've to sort it out with him<eos> Then... we'll send them over too<eos> Leave them once they finish their tasks<eos> What if they report to the police?<eos> I mean... kill them after they finish the tasks<eos> Kill those two cops first<eos> Yes<eos> Wait<eos> You stick with them two<eos> If anything happens, take care of them
Right.<eos> Nowhere else to go.<eos> I had a best friend, called Xi-Huan.<eos> We grew up together.<eos> Causing mischief, thieving, fighting...<eos> One day, I came back to find... all my friends rounded up.<eos> I was too scared to help.<eos> It was Mizoguchi.<eos> He gutted them, sold their organs.<eos> Xi-Huan was one of them.
I love your guys' movies and everything...<eos> But...<eos> No...<eos> Okay, I'm digging a hole here, so...<eos> Just deep.<eos> - It's like 13 years.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You don't have to be a connoisseur to know that, though.<eos> I met him through my friends Bryan and Walter at the Rec Center.<eos> I worked with them for a year and then I left.
Taiwan<eos> A country mesmerized by Japanese culture.<eos> Be it automobiles, comics or movies... everything in Taiwan... has a trace of Japanese culture.<eos> And much like Japan,<eos> Taiwan has many social problems.<eos> One of them, is juvenile delinquency.
- Jack!<eos> Jack! - I'll transfer you now.<eos> Not now, Milo.<eos> - Jack, you gotta see this.<eos> - What?<eos> Look. These are surveillance shots of all three backup shooters.<eos> I cross-referenced the files that Ellis sent us with our Interpol records.<eos> - How long ago?<eos> - Just now.<eos> Any or all of them could still be targeting Palmer.
My sons are soldiers.<eos> Then they will die for nothing.<eos> We know about the rescue plan. It was scheduled for 7.20.<eos> We stopped it.<eos> We've called in for backup.<eos> If they try again, sir, they will die.<eos> Then you have nothing to worry about.<eos> - Call it off, Victor.<eos> - How can I?<eos> The same way you've been communicating with them this entire time!
Friends of mine... who were doing their best to protect the citizens of this country were murdered today... probably by the same people you're funding!<eos> That a good enough reason for you?<eos> I told you before...<eos> I don't know anything else.<eos> Your parents.<eos> All right, stand up, Reza.<eos> Place your hands behind your head.<eos> It's a shame.<eos> It's gonna breaktheir heart.<eos> I have to walk you right past them.
New York, that's it.<eos> Patsy knew, yes.<eos> My son is gay and in New York and you knew!<eos> My son is gay and in New York.<eos> I'm going to New York. I can see him!<eos> He won't want to see you.<eos> - Of course he will, darling.<eos> Gay people love me. Oh, yeah.<eos> All my friends are gay.<eos> I laugh with them, I cry with them, darling.
He controls more assets than the Russian Mafia and, thanks to his old Cold War connections, he has the legitimacy of a fledgling government.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> And sorry that I have hives.<eos> I'm developing a dermal pigmentation capsule and...<eos> Not quite right... react...<eos> Never mind.<eos> Should be gone in a couple of hours.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> For five years we've had two deep-cover agents in the Russian embassy in Vienna.<eos> One of them is this man, Kyle Wexler.
You claim to have learned the truth about SD-6 when?<eos> It wasn't a claim, it was the truth!<eos> After Danny I refused to return to SD-6, which they saw as a betrayal.<eos> It was that night that I learned that my father, who I was never very close to, was also an officer with SD-6.<eos> Get in!<eos> Daddy?<eos> And I learned who I was really working for.<eos> A decade ago, some agents went freelance.<eos> The Alliance of 12.<eos> - What do you know about them?
So what happens to these kids at the end of the month?<eos> Triad sends them home with the intent that when they're grown, they will contact these kids and send them out in the field.<eos> There was a rumor the KGB began developing a similar program in the '80s, but we never confirmed it.<eos> Before these kids are sent home, their memories are reset?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> They remember nothing except that it was satisfying.<eos> Someone forged my wife's name in the registry at her favorite bed and breakfast weeks after her death.<eos> My concern is that it's intended to be a message.<eos> You have enemies, Arvin.<eos> Clearly, one of them is trying to leverage your grief.
If Claire Otoms were a beautiful young woman...<eos> ... wewouldn'tbe hererightnow.<eos> But we are here...<eos> ... becauseClaire looks the way she looks.<eos> That's status discrimination, and the law does not permit that.<eos> The irony is, Claire Otoms is a beautiful woman.<eos> She's older, but the last time I checked, that wasn't a crime.<eos> She's also lonely.<eos> And if that's punishable, well, they should start building bigger prisons.<eos> When you're alone and people aren't coming to you, you go to them.
It's just a uniform they make us wear.<eos> I think that's nice, wear a tie.<eos> Maybe you're gonna be President, huh?<eos> I'm not gonna be President, I'm just going to--<eos> You're just what?<eos> Just let me ask you this, Mr. Catholic School President.<eos> Where you gonna sit tonight?<eos> You gonna sit with your new friends, the white boys?<eos> Yeah, figures.<eos> I mean, you dress like 'em, go to school with them.

- Oh, my God!<eos> Go, Cynthia!<eos> Go on, get out of here.<eos> - Get the girl.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Outside.<eos> What are you doing here, and what happened to your arm?<eos> Look out.<eos> So you, like, kill things now.<eos> Last time I saw you, you just kind of fainted in front of them.
His energy centres are misaligned.<eos> - And you're feeling like this because...<eos> I feel like this because he never thinks of anyone but himself.<eos> - Fran, I've made something for you.<eos> It's your favourite - rum and chocolate.<eos> - Oh, yes, kissy-kissy. Ugh.<eos> I can't really have any.<eos> - I'm avoiding all stimulants.<eos> - Oh, listen to you!<eos> You're becoming one of them, going to the other side.
- They both had a lot of...<eos> - Off the top of your head.<eos> My dad.<eos> He cheated.<eos> I think he cheated.<eos> So, of all of these relationships of yours that you knew subconsciously were totally doomed, whose fault is that?<eos> It's incredibly different.<eos> I was just wondering.<eos> is it possible, even a little bit, that the reason you have trouble connecting to guys is because you think maybe they're not worth it?<eos> Maybe you think you're better than them.
Go where? Your place?<eos> Yeah, I suppose.<eos> - That was the idea.<eos> - Yeah. - Evil.<eos> - Of course.<eos> But I won't... or...<eos> I'll just go. Give my best to whatever... the happy couple.<eos> I will.<eos> It's nice to watch you be happy.<eos> For them, even.
He got out of the cab to see what happened and... then he freaked and he got back in and he reached for his radio.<eos> That's when the guys attacked him.<eos> His radio?<eos> He wasn't fleeing the scene? No.<eos> He was calling for help. Okay.<eos> What can you tell me about the men who attacked him?<eos> You always think you'll be a great witness but... (all yelling)<eos> There were so many of them, and it happened so fast...<eos> He was just begging for his life.<eos> I couldn't see their faces, but I know it was them;
Solo.<eos> See you around.<eos> Solo?<eos> So, does this mean when I come in on my day off I get to work solo?<eos> Process.<eos> I got what looks like two sets of prints.<eos> Ballpark in a size ten from the house.<eos> And what looks like a... size 12, possibly from the pool.<eos> There were definitely two guys here, Griss.<eos> Now we just need to figure out if one of them was Mr. Newman.
Come in.<eos> My queen, it's time for your tonic.<eos> Can you do anything about this thunder?<eos> Because it's making me nuts!<eos> I have no sway over the weather.<eos> I do have a friend who works with wind, but she's out of town.<eos> What about demons?<eos> Any sway over them?
- I don't know. I don't know.<eos> Look, try and stabilise him.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Going to help those men.<eos> - What?<eos> - Wilkinson will take care of him.<eos> No, you're gonna take care of him!<eos> That's Nathan on that bed!<eos> There's men dying and nobody to take care of them!<eos> You're gonna choose them over us?
That is not true.<eos> Your powers must be tied to your emotions, like ours.<eos> That means you can get them back.<eos> You just have to pick yourself up.<eos> Don't let them defeat you.<eos> You are not responsible for their actions.<eos> Aren't I?<eos> They're ghosts because of me.<eos> Their rage comes from something that I did.<eos> If I can just give myself to them...
He took millions from the city in renovation money, but instead of fixing up the buildings, he's trying to kick the tenants out.<eos> Well, how is he able to do that?<eos> I don't know, but that's why I'm trying to get an injunction to stop him.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You?<eos> What's with all the red tape?<eos> Why don't you just turn him into a fountain pen?<eos> Believe me, I'm tempted, but, I've decided I'm not going to use my powers, no matter what.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since I tried to strangle you with them.
Okay, you know what's really getting me mad?<eos> My boyfriend, my fiance, the man who, against all my better judgment, i actually love, chatted up a woman in a bar.<eos> And, on the very same day, the very same day, i chatted up a man.<eos> Do you see?<eos> Do you get it?<eos> I'm equally at fault.<eos> How can i ever forgive him for that?<eos> Well, of course, I'm not going to forgive him because, because men--and i don't mean to generalize-- are crap!<eos> They're the human race's only failed gender.<eos> Who needs them?
- I don't understand.<eos> - Tried to go outside with outside people.<eos> - Made delivery for Alec. - What?<eos> Alec?<eos> Have you been smoking?<eos> Got baked with dudeheads.<eos> - Ah... - Ate winged buffaloes.<eos> "My hero, my hero." Lying hottie!<eos> These dudeheads...<eos> Did any of them try to follow you home?
She'll use any excuse to avoid lessons and practice.<eos> - Daddy!<eos> - Be firm.<eos> Your father seems nice.<eos> He's great.<eos> It's just been the two of us, though, since my mom died.<eos> - Are you close to your parents?<eos> - No. It's just me.<eos> They died a long time ago.<eos> I don't remember them.
Today, we announce this to the press, and on Saturday, we share it with the members of the Interfaith Festival.<eos> Reverend, what's your association with the psychic Johnny Smith?<eos> Johnny Smith is a very dear friend of mine.<eos> I have known him since his birth, and, in fact, for the last five years,<eos> - I've been his legal guardian.<eos> - Do you believe in his tricks?<eos> - Do you really believe in him? - (questioning continues)<eos> Please, please.<eos> I believe in miracles of all shapes and sizes, and Johnny Smith deals in the realm of big miracles.<eos> I have been privileged to witness some of them for myself.
You trust me to get you out of trouble, and I'll trust you to get me out of trouble.<eos> That's a good one.<eos> That's a good deal.<eos> Okay, take my hand.<eos> Concentrate on the touch of my hand.<eos> Let's go.<eos> We have to find my friends.<eos> They're chasing me.<eos> Shh. I think you mean they're chasing me.<eos> No. See, I stole a car, then I knocked one of them over some garbage cans, then my old girlfriend, who's married to the sheriff, is tracing me by satellite through my cell phone...
I think we should discuss this in your Ready Room.<eos> Well?<eos> Do you recall the stand of trees outside the Hall of Diplomacy?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They're Alvera trees. Over 300 years old.<eos> That's fascinating.<eos> Did you apologise for whatever we did wrong?<eos> Are we going to get our plasma injector?<eos> The Kreetassans consider the Alvera trees cultural treasures.<eos> Apparently, Porthos urinated on one of them.
ventricular fibrillation induced by an isolytic shock.<eos> The vascular system appears to have functioned as a conduit for the discharge.<eos> The musculature shows extensive necrosis along the conductive pathway.<eos> There are subcutaneous burns over approximately... 12 percent of the body.<eos> The right phalanges and metacarpus exhibit signs of multiple thermal fractures. Computer, pause.<eos> Ensign?<eos> This is not an ideal time.<eos> I wanted to say good-bye.<eos> You may find this disturbing.<eos> I've seen a body before. 15 of them on that alien ship.
You've been to other colonies that trade deuterium, haven't you?<eos> - Several.<eos> - Are they all this rustic?<eos> - Not usually.<eos> - Their equipment's falling apart.<eos> Half these structures look like they're about to collapse.<eos> Phlox tells me they don't even have basic medical supplies.<eos> Deuterium is a highly valuable commodity.<eos> You'd think these people would be better off.<eos> We're here to trade with them... not judge their living conditions.
I'll try shifting the phase variance.t<eos> Lieutenant Reed to Bridge.<eos> I've opened the outer hatch.a<eos> Wish me luck.a<eos> I'm detecting something in the gamma spectrum, phase variant point zero-zero-seven-five.a<eos> Its surface is pockmarked.i<eos> Probably micrometeorite impacts.t<eos> Seems to have been in orbit for some time.u<eos> The spikes are magnetic.n<eos> Two of them have locked onto the hull.
They wanted to rehabilitate me... bring me home... flatten my forehead and re-point my ears.<eos> They wanted to teach me to forget... the life they had taught me so carefully how to live.<eos> They assumed I had become corrupt... and that, left to my own devices, I would remain corrupt.<eos> Three years in a Vulcan clinic.<eos> Rehabilitation.<eos> Can you blame me for running?<eos> I'm not a thief.<eos> I'm not a smuggler.<eos> I worked with smugglers.<eos> I worked very close with them for a long time.
I wasn't looking for a fight.<eos> Always do seem to find one, though.<eos> Do I have your attention?<eos> Kind of going to extremes here, ain't we?<eos> There's times I think you don't take me seriously.<eos> I think that ought to change.<eos> Do you think it's likely to?<eos> - You got something you don't deserve.<eos> - And it's brought me a galaxy of fun.<eos> Six men came to kill me one time. The best of them carried this.
I'm back.<eos> Coffee?<eos> Everyone always says that!<eos> This is my speaking voice.<eos> This is its natural volume! Fine, fine!<eos> - Short-sighted morons.<eos> - What now, Paris?<eos> We went to all this trouble to set up this stupid seminar.<eos> I say we, but let's face it, I did most of the work, and Mr. Hunter won't let me do it the way I want.<eos> The panelists are up there. We sit across from them and ask questions.
- I'm sorry, are you Carol?<eos> - Yeah, why?<eos> - I don't know, I just didn't expect... - What?<eos> - Well, you.<eos> - Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Your parents just made it sound like...<eos> Like I was holed up in the Chelsea with a needle sticking out of my arm screaming Sid at the top of my lungs?<eos> - Kind of.<eos> - Well, to them, this is pretty close.
Listen, I think it might be a good idea to consider getting behind this hemline issue.<eos> - You're kidding, right?<eos> I mean, if girls want the option of making their skirts a little shorter, then who cares, right?<eos> I care.<eos> I'm building a legacy here, Rory.<eos> You want the first stand I make against the faculty to involve a fashion choice?<eos> It would be my 'gays in the military.'<eos> I just think it would be really smart to establish some goodwill among the other class presidents.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because you have to work with them, and you might even need their support on something in the future.
- Well, as long as you find this amusing.<eos> - Mom.<eos> Come on, there has to be something else.<eos> - Something small.<eos> - Like what?<eos> Where are you going? Lorelai, come back here.<eos> You don't just walk out on a person. That's rude.<eos> - That's a robe.<eos> - Yes. This is my robe.<eos> And I want you to go into your room and get your robe. And then, exactly at the same time... we're gonna shove these robes in our suitcases... and we're gonna walk out that door and leave with them.
So now do you know him?<eos> I did, a long time ago. But I'd lost contact with him.<eos> This was an intimate relationship?<eos> It was very short-lived.<eos> I was slumming.<eos> But he wrote you from prison?<eos> He wanted my help, to talk to the right people, get him a better lawyer.<eos> He thought you had those kinds of connections with influential people?<eos> Well, friends, husbands of friends.<eos> You went to school with those people, grew up with them?
How you've been caught up in the... tentacles of circumstance.<eos> Everything has been done to you.<eos> None of it has been your fault.<eos> Like when you were at Columbia, you missed your finals-- you were tired, you were sick, or maybe you just didn't want to be an economist after all.<eos> It was too late.<eos> You were carrying the burden of your parents' expectations.<eos> You couldn't disappoint them.<eos> So you lied to them about graduating.<eos> It wasn't your fault.<eos> You did it for them.

Who has all her hopes pinned on you.
The FBI sting netted a number of associates of the Genovese crime family, including popular night club owner, John Hampton.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> United States versus Vincent Russo, Francis Ventura, John Hampton, et al.<eos> The predicates include assault in aid of racketeering, money laundering and extortion.<eos> How are we pleading, gentlemen?<eos> Not guilty.<eos> - Not guilty.<eos> - Not guilty.<eos> We ask for remand, Your Honor.<eos> The defendants all have previous records and the evidence against them is substantial.
No, really, go ahead, laugh.<eos> I've never heard that joke before.<eos> I suppose you can drive yourself crazy trying to figure out why things happen the way they happen.<eos> For what reason.<eos> If there is a reason.<eos> It all seems so random.<eos> And you can't always know why.<eos> But one thing I do know... is that my babies still need me.<eos> These precious sweet souls... still need me.<eos> But I am not lost to them.
I'm sure the name calling will get much worse.<eos> - Looking forward to it.<eos> - Likewise, I'm sure.<eos> Nice try.<eos> Hey, you want to play some pool?<eos> Still torn up about that bus accident?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just talked to Carrie's parents.<eos> They're in town for the funeral.<eos> They said they're taking Jewel back to Montana with them.
- Nice to meet you.<eos> Please, continue.<eos> Having inmates care for and train these pups has been a perfect match.<eos> 60% of the dogs qualify for placement, 90% of the prisoners demonstrate a better attitude after their participation in the program.<eos> Aren't there certain skills necessary to train a guide-dog?<eos> Of course, but the skills are teachable.<eos> And the prisoners don't harm the animals?<eos> Well, we were worried at first, but what's happened here is the dogs bring out the best in their trainers.<eos> Inmates go from having nothing to nurturing a life.<eos> It means more to them than you can know.
That is not why.<eos> It reflects the subject of the course i'm teaching:<eos> A survey of gay aesthetics In post-modern american art and literature.<eos> Wow, say that 10 times fast while Holding your breath.<eos> And because it's good.<eos> You mean it? Mm-hmm.<eos> It may look like a comic book, But it says something important about gay people.<eos> You know, the value of friendship, Of loyalty, courage.<eos> And your characters, they aren't just cartoons. You know, they're real.<eos> I care about them.
I changed the name and i gave it a new look.<eos> Quite attractive. If i do say so myself.<eos> And, they can't sell 'em fast enough.<eos> Oh th... This is your idea?<eos> Yeah, it's going to save your ass.<eos> I don't want my ass saved.<eos> Two more pool boys.<eos> Not by these people.<eos> I think you do.<eos> In fact, you should've been marketing to them in the first place.
I have a headache, can we talk tomorrow?<eos> I backed off boarding school because you promised to get your life together.<eos> Harvard's been your dream since you were, what, 6?<eos> Five.<eos> And that's because you put a poster of Cambridge over my bed.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You've got more brains in your little finger than all the kids at Roswell have in their entire bodies.<eos> - Dad, please.<eos> - I am serious.<eos> How many of them are even thinking about going to college?
And we don't look back.<eos> LIZ: Maria.<eos> MARIA: What?<eos> No, wait!<eos> Maria, what is your problem?<eos> What's your problem? !<eos> I have risked my life.<eos> I have given up everything. Every other friend I've ever had, I've blown off.<eos> My mother doesn't even know me anymore.<eos> And now that it's all over, you're one of them.
Soprano.<eos> Married with two kids.<eos> - Dying old...<eos> - Look, I get it, OK?<eos> OK. OK, Mike.<eos> That's all that matters.<eos> Victor.<eos> Victoria.<eos> I mean, the kid thinks he's Evil Knievel.<eos> Gosh, I'd love to attend your safety camp this summer, I would, but my parents are making me go to Maine with them.
That ought to be easy to remember.<eos> Terry, with her terrycloth towels.<eos> Samantha had the distinct feeling she was being Kubla-conned.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Samantha, you're not actually jealous of a casino cleaning lady, are you?<eos> No.<eos> I just find it impressive that you know the name and cup size...<eos> - of every woman who works here.<eos> - I know the male employees' names as well.<eos> It doesn't mean I'm gonna sleep with them.
It was my operation. I called the shots.<eos> What could you have done differently?<eos> Terry asked me to move him up.<eos> - He was part of your team.<eos> - He wasn't ready for this.<eos> Eight years on the force, a stint in Robbery, two commendations. Sounds like he was ready.<eos> - Strike Team's different.<eos> - Really?<eos> We knock down the doors other cops don't want to.<eos> My guys accept the risks because they know I will take care of them.
-Oh, God, I think I've seen him around.<eos> -What's up?<eos> -kyle.<eos> -Nate.<eos> Never caught your name.<eos> -Brenda.<eos> -Right.<eos> This is the kind kind.<eos> Both my connections totally dried up.<eos> One of them got arrested, and the other I had to blow off... 'cause he was an actor and made me go to his one-man shows if I wanted to buy a bag.
I thought it was brilliant.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I can send you a copy of the new one, if you'd Iike.<eos> I would.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I read Charlotte Light and Dark.<eos> Oh, dear. Why?<eos> In grad school, I had this idiot professor... who insisted that it was the perfect profile of a classic borderline personality.<eos> You've heard that before, right?<eos> I actually went to the library, and looked up the symptoms... and started behaving like that to fuck with them.
It's just a change.<eos> You like it?<eos> I think the operative word is "gulp."<eos> Listen.<eos> I know things are rough, but you can't let them get you down.<eos> It's kind of hard not to.<eos> The key is to keep your mind off it.<eos> Let your friends be your friends.<eos> Let them distract you.<eos> Trust them.
Why the big change of heart?<eos> Well, I was never hesitating 'cause of you.<eos> I just had to get my head into a place... where I felt that I could really commit, you know.<eos> To lavish all the care on you that you should have.<eos> I don't see why I have to do anything I don't want to.<eos> This is Green Grove.<eos> Here the senior citizen is king and queen.<eos> I know, but they told Charles that this was just a warning.<eos> These people don't fool around.<eos> You're afraid of them.
I spy...<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> I'm sure it's him.<eos> Mark Develeaux of Green Action.<eos> Rock and roll.<eos> Let's not lose him.<eos> Tango X, what's happening?<eos> - Tango X, are you receiving?<eos> - A group broke the cordon.<eos> - Stay with them.
You're going to have to tell me... once.<eos> In detail, all of it, just once.<eos> Then maybe we'll be in with a chance.<eos> - Where are we, then?<eos> - Why do you think that?<eos> A sense of geography goes with my trade.<eos> The English secret pig policeman.<eos> The looney anarcho enemy of the world order, I presume.<eos> Agents of state security have attempted to penetrate our group before.<eos> - We have dealt with them.
- They're bad. They have to be stopped.<eos> - You want to destroy me!<eos> - No.<eos> Yes, you do!<eos> You think that my father made me wrong.<eos> You hate me!<eos> SG-2 has been unable to contact the Asgard from the Katal hall of wisdom.<eos> - Nothing?<eos> - I hope they're OK.<eos> It would be unfortunate if the Asgard lost to the replicators at a time when we may have the key to stopping them in our midst.
Conrad's scientists were studying this symbiote to create a kind of superdrug.<eos> Maybe this is what they came up with.<eos> Well, if that's true, then a lot of people would kill to get their hands on it.<eos> We won't know anything for sure until we send a sample of this back to base.<eos> Tomorrow we'll talk to other people at lmmunitech.<eos> We need to figure out what was going on at that lab.<eos> As some of you may already know, we have three uninvited guests in town.<eos> They are asking questions.<eos> The chances are they won't find anything.<eos> But if they do, then we will have to deal with them.
When are we expected?<eos> When you become hungry.<eos> - That one's different.<eos> - No kidding.<eos> - He comes across as almost human.<eos> - Well, he's not.<eos> - So what do we do?<eos> - Can we leave?<eos> The ship will fly, but I don't know how far we'll get.<eos> Sir, if this is the next evolution of the replicators, we should find out as much as possible about them and report it back somehow.
Okay, boys. I brought cheese samples from work.<eos> What's wrong with them?
I mean, her parents didn't even come to parents' weekend.<eos> So lizzie turns to drugs and men to fill her empty void.<eos> I do.<eos> You're so lucky to have a friend like my rachel.<eos> That was a water sprinkler, right?<eos> That's a regular one, but what would a water sprinkler sound like at charlton heston's house?<eos> He's the real deal.<eos> Now, y'all think y'all here just at a regular talent show, where y'all really are is at a wild safari.<eos> Ok, uh, I'm gonna go backstage 'cause I got some friends back there, and they're gonna perform tonight, and I just wanna wish 'em luck, you know?<eos> It's, uh, it's a real big moment for them.
The speech to the teachers this morning?<eos> 24 years in professional politics I have never seen anything like it.<eos> You would have been proud.<eos> - We're gonna win this election.<eos> - I do know.<eos> - Leo?<eos> - They ruled for Sullivan.<eos> - They ruled for Sullivan?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> C.J., when you guys vet your judicial candidates, do you go so far as to meet and speak with them?
They say I got the bug.<eos> The bug?<eos> They checked me when I was in the hospital--<eos> Are they sure?<eos> Where you been at?<eos> Here and there, I'm at it.<eos> I'd have come past sooner, but I been on kinda like a mission.<eos> -A mission?<eos> Them hoppers that beat you down... they got problems now.<eos> Them and the people they sling for, even.
-A mission?<eos> Them hoppers that beat you down... they got problems now.<eos> Them and the people they sling for, even.<eos> What?<eos> I put the police on their ass.<eos> Police?<eos> -What, you get locked up or something?<eos> -No, come on.<eos> No, I'm not working for them.<eos> I'm working with them.
I lied about going home early.<eos> We went to the party room, just like Goran had promised. I mean, we had a good time.<eos> I think there was some X around.<eos> - Was Eve doing drugs?<eos> - No, she was drinking.<eos> I mean, we all were.<eos> Was Victor Fallon there?<eos> No, but Goran wanted us to go back to his suite.<eos> And when we got there, it was weird.<eos> I mean, there were all these guys in suits, and women all over them.
I think Gabe found out he was adopted, and he's the one who initiated all this.<eos> There's a bunch of these "find-your-parent, find-your-child" websites.<eos> Most of them aren't regulated. Like Danny was saying, any John Q. Pedophile... who wants to lure kids into his lair... puts one of these on the Net and he's in business.<eos> These kids log on, give them their names, they ask for help.<eos> These guys go along with it and pretend they're doing this research. And say, "I found your father. Here's his e-mail address."<eos> Except it's not the father's e-mail address. It's the pedophile.<eos> And the pedophile convinces the kid... to communicate using instant messages...<eos> - so that it's their little secret.<eos> - Makes sense to me.<eos> And I ran background checks on all these websites... and one of them is registered in Amarillo, Texas.
One more hit and we're done for!<eos> Let's take him out with us. Do you have a self-destruct code?<eos> Like destruct sequence 1<eos> -A, 2-B, 3--<eos> Thanks a lot, Takei. Now everybody knows!<eos> If I can 't have the original cast of Star Trek, no one will.<eos> Prepare to die!<eos> Wait! If they mean that much to you, why would you kill them?<eos> Because I.... I....<eos> I don 't know what I'd do without them.
If she ever get married.<eos> Dad!<eos> Gleesh!<eos> Don't say that when you meet my boyfriend.<eos> Oh, that right.<eos> We get to spend time with this Mr. Kif.<eos> I hope he's a nice man who can make grandchildren.<eos> This not a parallel universe where you get younger.<eos> Remember, the quickest way to a girl's bed is through her parents.<eos> - Have sex with them, and you're in.
This is about your father.<eos> You're just trying to finish something he started.<eos> MAN: Charlie and Lisa, both taken on September 8th of this year.<eos> They're breeding him with a girl who's... 1/4 alien already.<eos> ERIC: WOMAN:<eos> The people you were hiding from know where you are.<eos> They're not gonna bother me.<eos> Why? Because beings from other world, they're looking out for you?<eos> Yes, that's exactly why.<eos> Your father was very important to them.
It's just not possible.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> I'm gonna tell Julie about us.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Leave Ronnie and come with me.<eos> Maine?<eos> The trucks are leaving Groom Lake tomorrow night, sneaking out across the desert to avoid your brother and his friends by the mailbox.<eos> What is it?<eos> Your work.<eos> Tom says you've been taking people, experimenting on them.
One of these people happened to be a doctor.<eos> She's in there with her right now.<eos> Good.<eos> This might be a little beyond my medical capabilities.<eos> Can she travel?<eos> Look, I'm a multiple abductee myself.<eos> I've been taken repeatedly since I was seven, but I...<eos> I still don't even really know what we're dealing with here.<eos> This might be something better suited to their medicine than to ours.<eos> No! No way in hell is she going anywhere near them.
I swear, I didn't.<eos> How can I tell anyone else?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Who knows?<eos> I don't know who they could be.<eos> Albert must've mixed in with something terrible.<eos> She's hungry and cold, poor thing.<eos> I've got to take her to them.<eos> I've got to take her to Ann's parents.<eos> You go. Leave baby Alice with them.
He'll never make it!<eos> Hold on, Frodo.<eos> Gandalf!<eos> Look, Frodo.<eos> It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.<eos> Mr. Frodo?<eos> He's going cold.<eos> Is he going to die?<eos> He's passing into the Shadow World.<eos> He'll soon become a Wraith Like them.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Well, good luck.<eos> You too, mate.<eos> What's up, Hoobs?<eos> These men have been through the Army's toughest training. Under the worst circumstances.<eos> And they volunteered for it.<eos> I was just shooting craps with them--<eos> You know why they volunteered?<eos> So when things got bad, the man next to them would be the best.
And this is... It doesn't take too many days of that and you change dramatically.<eos> We had no food, didn't have ammunition.<eos> It was cold.<eos> We didn't have clothes. If you built a fire, something would shoot at you.<eos> Everywhere you look, you would see dead people.<eos> A dead soldier there, here. Ours, theirs.<eos> Then civilians, besides... .<eos> Dead animals.<eos> So death was all over.<eos> You don't have a chance, when your friends go down to really take care of them as you might.
One thing you don't want in your house, it's a human teenager.<eos> Any one you'd like, sweetheart.<eos> That one.<eos> Oh, isn't she pretty.<eos> I'll get that for you, sir.<eos> And I have a pretty new collar just for you.<eos> Compliments of the house.<eos> You stink of humans.<eos> It's disgusting the way we treat humans.<eos> It demeans us as much as them.
I cannot wait for this shit to be done.<eos> Four more days.<eos> You know what I read?<eos> Bill Gates has more money than Peru.<eos> He needs someone to fly his jets.<eos> We ought to fly for him.<eos> I bet Bill won't let you fly upside down.<eos> Or fly for a rock star.<eos> Those guys need good pilots.<eos> Every day we lose a band to some shitty hack they got flying for them.
I need an update.<eos> Census Bureau reports target crossing your location 20 seconds ago.<eos> Target heading south.<eos> Lieutenant, take your men 1,000 meters south from here.<eos> Go!<eos> You told me the hospital would be clean.<eos> Just wait.<eos> In and out, right?<eos> Why don't we just do what you did?<eos> Bump up against them and ask them to dance.
Thank you very much, Dr. Grant.<eos> Now, does anyone have a question?<eos> Fine.<eos> Does anyone have a question that does not relate to Jurassic Park?<eos> Or the incident in San Diego which I did not witness?<eos> Yes, sir?<eos> Your theory on raptors is good and all, but isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?<eos> Once the U.N. and Costa Rica and everyone decide how to handle that second island, scientists will just go in and look for themselves.<eos> Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.<eos> What is left of them is fossilized in the rocks.
Put the gun down, Jezzie.<eos> Would you kill another partner?<eos> You're not my partner.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> You're a very brave girl, Megan.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm a policeman.<eos> My name is Alex Cross.<eos> I'm a friend of your parents.<eos> Can you take me to them?
-Fantastic!<eos> Keep going!<eos> -Couldn't be better. There's a bit up there.<eos> That's it.<eos> How do I look?<eos> Fantastic. It's brilliant, mate.<eos> Fucking brilliant.<eos> Off you go.<eos> I'm just a regular guy who grew up with the posters of these guys on my walls!<eos> And now I'm one of them!
Sitting in front of a half-eaten steak and kidney pie.<eos> Very harsh, man.<eos> She came to see the show a few years ago. She hadn't changed at all.<eos> She married my best friend.<eos> A doctor.<eos> They have three gorgeous little kids.<eos> Yeah, she's very happy.<eos> Very happy.<eos> You know, I'm just a regular guy who grew up with posters of these guys on my walls.<eos> And now I'm one of them.
Well, we like each other.<eos> What is the big damn deal ?<eos> It's me and him, not us and other people.<eos> Black people, Sara.<eos> Black women.<eos> Derek's about something.<eos> He's smart.<eos> He's motivated.<eos> He's for real.<eos> He's not gonna make babies and not take care of them, or run the streets messing up his life.
Papa!<eos> Stephen and Danny have something they want to tell you.<eos> I'll get right to the point, Padrone.<eos> It's about my--my parents.<eos> Yes, how are they, Stephen?<eos> Good, good, they're good.<eos> You know, I'd like to meet them.<eos> When do you think that'll happen?<eos> Soon.<eos> The thing is, Padrone, I haven't been totally honest with them.
Suzanne, the owner limps a little but never spills a drink.<eos> A former bareback artiste, she likes athletes who cry with disappointment.<eos> She dislikes seeing men humiliated in front of their kids.<eos> Georgette, the tobacconist, is a hypochondriac migraines one day, sciatica the next.<eos> She hates the words, "fruit of thy womb."<eos> Gina works with Amelie. Her grandma was a healer.<eos> She likes cracking bones.<eos> She brings a kir to Hipolito, a failed writer.<eos> He likes seeing bullfighters gored on TV.<eos> Scowling at them is Joseph, Gina's rejected lover.
How interesting.<eos> Are you able to see?<eos> What uniforms!<eos> Luxury, empire... power....<eos> Look over there.<eos> Can you see?<eos> Yes, I see now!<eos> One must not trust this world. You are right.<eos> Beware, court officials are cunning.<eos> Some of them are mediums.
There's a Vauxhall Vectra parked up the street.<eos> Sorry about the headlights.<eos> Heathrow Airport, please.<eos> You going away or meeting some lucky sod?<eos> Going away.<eos> Got your passport?<eos> I only ask because you'd be surprised at the number of idiots I've taken out to the airport who've forgotten them.<eos> Yeah. Did I say that I need to go via Neasden?<eos> This is a security announcement.<eos> Passengers are reminded to keep their bags with them...
If you're dead, leave us in peace!<eos> Leave us in peace!<eos> In here.<eos> Get inside.<eos> And suppose we do leave you, do you think they will?<eos> - Who?<eos> - The intruders.<eos> - There are no intruders.<eos> - They took the curtains down. - There are no intruders.<eos> - Yes, I assure you it was them.
It's really heavy.<eos> We got a lot of schoolbooks.<eos> It would be my pleasure.<eos> We'll be right there.<eos> Come on.<eos> Bye-bye!<eos> You guys are federal marshals?<eos> If we're not, we'd better give these fuckers back.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Not for them it isn't.
But cats, they're another story.<eos> -Start with ancient Egypt.<eos> -We've seen that 5 billion times.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Here goes.<eos> Ancient Egypt.<eos> See these hieroglyphics?<eos> Humans think it says ancient people worshiped cats.<eos> But in reality, they were ruled by them.
I think Wayne was trying to set us up on a date.<eos> Oh, yeah. He's got some crazy ideas.<eos> Yeah. Well, now that I know that you're unavailable it makes this easier.<eos> We can just be friends.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Friends.<eos> So how are your parents?<eos> Oh, great.<eos> They're making a fortune on the lnternet.<eos> Wow, good for them.
Do you intend to present evidence?<eos> We have an eyewitness.<eos> Your Honour, can I address the court for a minute?<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - Sir, we have an eyewitness who'll testify that they heard a gunshot, then they saw a truck backing up to where the shot was fired.<eos> Is that witness here in the courtroom?<eos> No, not in the courtroom with us because he's...<eos> He's a weasel.<eos> Order.<eos> Your Honour, I know this is unreasonable, but I can talk to animals and one of them came forward with this information, sir.
- Bushido? .<eos> - Their kind of chivalry.<eos> Respect and obligation.<eos> Ifyou don't respect them, they feel obligated to bash you.<eos> - Nothing personal.<eos> - Well, it sure as bloodywell feels personal.<eos> Yeah, well, it works both ways. They do the same to their own.<eos> - That's a comfort.<eos> You must understand, these monsters truly believe we're an inferior race- less than human.<eos> Now, beating a prisoner to them is like beating a disobedient dog, and the fiercer the beating, the fiercer their dedication to the emperor.
You'll be DNR.<eos> Now, you can think about it.<eos> But I just...<eos> I just wanted to present you with both choices... before Kelekian and Jason come in and talk to you.<eos> - They don't agree about this?<eos> - They like to save lives.<eos> So anything's okay as long as the life continues.<eos> Doesn't matter if you're hooked up to a million machines.<eos> Kelekian's a great researcher, he is... and the Fellows like Jason, they're really smart.<eos> It's an honor for them to be working with him.
All prepare their shot.<eos> -What are you doing?<eos> -l'm handling this!<eos> Don't fuck with this guy!<eos> you'll get these people killed!<eos> We got two teams on the roof. We got a team over there.<eos> Don't talk. Just listen.<eos> Each of the 22 hostages is wrapped with 20 pounds of C-4 explosives.<eos> They're also taped with 1 5 pounds of stainless-steel ball bearings.<eos> Which makes them the world's largest claymore mines.
She has the Sight already.<eos> Three months later the High King summoned all the great chiefs to London to name his successor.<eos> And he invited my mother as an honored guest.<eos> But the Saxons will never forget the blows you dealt them.<eos> You and I, Gorlois.<eos> We dealt them together.<eos> But I think I shall be fighting no more Saxons.<eos> Of course you will. it'll be many years--<eos> That is why I have called this council. it's why you're here.<eos> I must tell you, Igraine my priests don't like it that your priestess of Avalon has been placed on an equal footing with them.
The old religion embraces yours, Bishop but your priests deny the power of Avalon.<eos> Perhaps people no longer believe in it.<eos> Perhaps it's because you tell them not to.<eos> -Igraine!<eos> -Your wife speaks her mind, Gorlois.<eos> I honor her for that.<eos> Back, you hounds from hell! Back!<eos> My lord, forgive me.<eos> You are forgiven, but get those dogs out of here!<eos> Can't you go anywhere without them?
Uther took us to his castle at Camelot and made my mother his High Queen.<eos> All the unhappiness of the past seemed to be swept away when I saw my little brother, Arthur, for the first time.<eos> Help me.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> They're praying to the Goddess for a good harvest.<eos> The Goddess?<eos> The one Father Cuthbert doesn't like?<eos> And now she'll look after their seeds, and make them grow all through spring.<eos> So these people don't like Jesus Christ?<eos> Some of them do.
Fight!<eos> My men tell me the invasion will come before the next full moon, my lord.<eos> We are ready for them.<eos> Except in one respect.<eos> And that is?<eos> If you were to die in battle, sir.<eos> Well, you would fight on.<eos> Lancelot would fight on.<eos> All my brave companions would fight on.<eos> And which of them would become High King, sire?
And this is our car. And it's got Louisiana plates.<eos> Hell, yeah! I'm going to Louisiana!<eos> So I cruised down to New Orleans and found a base of operations for my search at a local grade school.<eos> I was going to be a janitor.<eos> Mostly mopping.<eos> Once in a while, you got a problem with the boiler.<eos> You have to hit it with a hammer. But it's a good job.<eos> Yeah, it's all right. I appreciate this job, man.<eos> This'll be a good base for me while I look for my parents.<eos> I got a picture of them.
When I refused to have sex with him,... ..the warden ordered my sister Esther shot... ..right in front of me.<eos> Everyone considered it my fault, so after that, of course,... ..I did anything he wanted.<eos> Wouldn't wanna fuck her anyway.<eos> One more remark like that and we go back to court for resentencing. Sit down!<eos> Please.<eos> He was a pig like you, so,... ..perhaps he had no taste.<eos> Thank you,... ..Mrs Frankel.<eos> The man was afraid... ..to let us hide on his farm any longer,... ..but he agreed to take us to a more remote place.<eos> But... ..on the way, he was stopped by a checkpoint.<eos> When the soldiers found us in the hay,... ..one of them tried to take my son out of my arms.
Here, Father.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Becky went to the hairdressing academy after high school.<eos> Of course, after she got married... she decided she wanted to stay home with the boys, you know.<eos> She still loves doing hair, though.<eos> Where do you go, Father?<eos> I just go to Supercuts.<eos> You can't request the same girl at Supercuts.<eos> The boys are having a great time.<eos> It was good of you to do this for them.
Ah, what the fuck?<eos> - Hey, I saw that!<eos> - Sit down, Rando.<eos> That's it!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!<eos> All right, all right!<eos> - Cut it out, you turkeys!<eos> - He fuckin' started it!<eos> I'm sorry, Bruce.<eos> These boys get that syrup in them... they get a little antsy in their pantsy.
Come on, let's go, you little wimp! Hurry, let's go!<eos> [Cocks gun] What do you want, bitch?<eos> I just thought that I can get some heroin... and then we can all go out and commit some hate crimes.<eos> -We lost transmission.<eos> -Are we going in? No.<eos> Pissant's been in this situation before. I'm sure he can handle himself.<eos> [Crying] I've only been with the FBI for, like, two days!<eos> Take him to the warehouse at pier seven. [Barking]<eos> You know, bad dogs aren't born, they're made.<eos> He must've disengaged his own wire and left with them.
We should do her too.<eos> Fucking pendejo.<eos> Do his ass again.<eos> - I run to the window.<eos> - You see the Uzi twins - waste the cop.<eos> - Our friend! Gone!<eos> - Annihilated!<eos> - You want to kill them!<eos> But I can't, 'cause they're running away, scared.<eos> So you yell something at them!
- How do you know about it?<eos> I only know he died.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tell me about your parents.<eos> And their marriage?<eos> - I think you know about it.<eos> - I know how it ended.<eos> There must have been good times.<eos> Moments of affection among them ...
That's 'cause he's from my sperm.<eos> See, I knocked up this hot woman friend of ours... who I fuck on the side... so I'm not to be all the way gay... he loves the cock.<eos> Well, he certainly looks insatiable.<eos> -Bye-bye.<eos> -Bye-bye.<eos> Well, it's not my way, but I'll be damned... if there doesn't go one happy family.<eos> WlLLENhOLLY: All right, gang.<eos> Let's just shoot some tear gas into the diner... and then, when the guys come out with the monkey--<eos> Fuck beans!<eos> That was them, wasn't it?
Poor Stanley.<eos> Didn't know what he was getting into, huh?<eos> - Those Stein women are tough to please. - Yeah.<eos> It'd take a better man than me, clearly.<eos> - So how's your writing coming? Oh, you know.<eos> Not.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I decided that I didn't really wanna be a writer anymore.<eos> I'm much happier tearing down the work of other writers... who are not as talented as I am, but also not as paralyzed.<eos> Any artistic frustration I have now I just take out on them.
Hey, it's Jess.<eos> Leave me a message.<eos> Okay, we did it.<eos> Hannah Claire Levine. Eight pounds, six ounces.<eos> I'm sorry we didn't call sooner. It was 3:00 a.m. and it went sort of fast, thank God. Because it's the worst pain one will ever know.<eos> You can't imagine.<eos> I'm in room 325 at Sinai. Oh, my God.<eos> Can you believe?<eos> Come by soon. Where are you?<eos> The only woman that loved me not just in spite of my faults, but because of them somehow.
Tell me how it went.<eos> If you get Eddie and Gwen back together, you can have your job back.<eos> -Where are we booked?<eos> -Four Seasons, Beverly Hills. Cancel.<eos> We need to get these people in the middle of nowhere.<eos> Once they know there's no movie, they can't escape.<eos> We need a hotel like the one in The Shining. Isolated.<eos> The new Hyatt in Nevada?<eos> It's in the desert, and it's just opening. Book it.<eos> We have to keep the press entertained and on the go. The best junkets are when the press thinks it's not about the movie, but them.
- That's awful!<eos> - Isn't this fantastic?<eos> - It's totally absurd.<eos> - Let's go up.<eos> - Are you the groom's friend?<eos> - We went to university together.<eos> He, Adriano and I, do you know him?<eos> - Are you from Florence?<eos> - Near Florence. My parents moved here three years ago.<eos> I came with them.
Who wants an attorney who hiccups when she's nervous?<eos> Like I always said, honey, it's all up here.<eos> It's so good to be home.<eos> Dad, what is it?<eos> -Oh, my God. Did somebody die?<eos> -Well... ... somewhattheopposite,actually.<eos> Look at you! Look at you!<eos> Great to have you back, son!<eos> Luke! Remember the time, you and me, we were playing with firecrackers?<eos> One of them went off too soon and singed all the hair off my head?
Not one.<eos> Both should've been killed.<eos> Tina should've... been strangled like this!<eos> And my head should've been smashed!<eos> You think you can do anything just because your mother is back?<eos> Just wait and see what I do to you!<eos> - Don't scream!<eos> Mummy hates screaming help.<eos> Tomorrow Samir's parent are coming<eos> In front of them, behave like well-mannered servants.
I'm a little hazy on the subject matter.<eos> Look, what happened here today happens all the time, sir.<eos> - Let me get this straight.<eos> You mean there's violence?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - In a prison packed with violent criminals.<eos> - That's not what we're saying.<eos> No.<eos> There's been-- How many this year, Doc?<eos> Um, 13 men down, 11 of them were critical injuries--
The old "Fastest Gun in the West" routine.<eos> Let's find the locations of all the slaughterhouses in the United States.<eos> I mean, how many can there be?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We eliminate the ones in or near big cities and we concentrate on small towns, rural areas.<eos> Places where you can see the stars.<eos> Joyce, we only have six days.<eos> In this scene the light in the ward is really full twilight with the light obscured by the patterns on the windows and the patients are much more interactive than they were in the first scenes, when they seemed to be in their own worlds.<eos> Now they're very much acting as a group.<eos> In a way the rivalry between them could be seen as...
What's that?<eos> A space truck was found near one of the asteroids.<eos> The driver was dead and the cargo gone.<eos> A truck hijack?<eos> The truck belonged to Cherious Medical but they didn't report it missing.<eos> Rumor has it that it was carrying some sort of contraband.<eos> -Soon after, the terrorists struck.<eos> -Smells fishy.<eos> Cherious guards their secrets far too well.<eos> Why don't you investigate them?
What?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Yes.<eos> Apparently they read... that last article about you in the paper... you know, about how you said you wanted to find... the one girl so that you could date... every desper ate woman in the Windy City... which I think was masterful-- masterful, Gibbons.<eos> But Reebok, they got cold feet... no pun intended.<eos> How can an article have anything to do with my work?<eos> Ah!<eos> Well, Gibbons, clients are funny that way.<eos> They said they didn't want someone on their team... who would say one thing and do another.<eos> It's an image thing for them.
Well, obviously we'll have to check these figures, Bill, but it looks OK at the moment.<eos> Um, just on more general note, how are things going here?<eos> I mean, is everything on schedule?<eos> I thi... Yeah, I think so.<eos> D'you, er... D'you think the men are on board?<eos> Er... well, yeah. I mean obviously they're... they're a little concerned about the way things are going and...<eos> - Have we met all the troublemakers yet?<eos> - What troublemakers?<eos> The union men. You know what I mean.<eos> Er, well, we... we've got the, er, the union reps, of course, but... Usually they follow the agreements and... I don't normally have any trouble with them.
- Haven't seen her for ages. - Jolly good... nice.<eos> Takes all sorts.<eos> Not that I we're all men at St. Anthony's.<eos> Do you like women?<eos> I mean, do women like you?<eos> - You mean lesbians?<eos> - Would it bother you if they did?<eos> - Oh no, the same thing happens with me.<eos> With homosexuals.<eos> - And do you go to bed with them?
After you ran away from home and came to me...<eos> "You did the right thing. "<eos> "Let's become gangsters and ruin our lives together!"<eos> - You thought I'd say that?<eos> - It's not that...<eos> Do you know when I realized my home was really screwed up?<eos> When I was a kid, it was great having a lot of uncles.<eos> My mom went to the hospital, and I came back home after running away.<eos> The guys I called my uncles, not even one of them punished me. Damn it...<eos> If only one of them beat my to a pulp, then maybe I could've gotten my life straight then.
My star performer Waen...<eos> she's always up for it<eos> Let yourself go!<eos> This room is our harem!<eos> Let's have a look over there!<eos> I want to tear this down<eos> Let me think about it...<eos> Is there Anything else?<eos> Some of the materials can be reuse<eos> But most of them have been worn out...
When I was a kid.<eos> In my old man's bar.<eos> My old man had one of the best cabarets in Montevideo.<eos> Until someone killed him.<eos> A partner.<eos> But I took his revenge.<eos> It took me a while to set up a gang.<eos> A couple of friends...<eos> Today, they're my brothers.<eos> I have a similar business with them in Barcelona.
The fourth week rolled by and she had completed only a few days of work.<eos> Many scenes were shot in her absence including sequences with the children.<eos> Kathleen and Michael went to the ponies.<eos> My horse bit...<eos> You don't have a horse!<eos> She doesn't have a horse.<eos> Good.<eos> Except you didn't grab it early enough.<eos> Child actors Alexandra Heilweil and Christopher Morley had difficulty remembering their dialogue and staying focused.<eos> Cukor shot take after take with them, occasionally losing his patience.
And she had permission.<eos> Mr. President, Marilyn Monroe.<eos> Her legendary tardiness was made a running gag through the night.<eos> Here she is.<eos> I'll introduce her anyway.<eos> When she finally appeared, she was wearing a silk gown that revealed more than it hid.<eos> Mr. President, the late Marilyn Monroe.<eos> That night, her memorable performance was caught on camera.<eos> Fox executives were livid.<eos> She didn't have any sense of responsibility or any respect for them.

What do you mean?<eos> We shall pretend that you killed the Python-God.<eos> You will be "the emperor who dethroned a god".<eos> But it's not true!<eos> I've already told you, the people need heroes.<eos> You are a good soldier, a fine master of arms, but your political education is wanting.<eos> I will take care of it.<eos> Some secret!<eos> All my men know about it!<eos> Don't worry, I'll see to them.
The thing is, you meet people, talk to them, laugh...<eos> But there's a world within you full of dreams, of fantasies that you don't share with anyone<eos> I wonder if those, who claim to know you really know you at all<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> The door is not open...<eos> Entry is forbidden...<eos> The box is tightly bound...<eos> No one can steal anything...<eos> And who can tell what feelings reflect behind those shut eyelids...<eos> I wonder what other secrets your paintings hide within them...
How soon can you make 100 million won that way!<eos> We have notjust one, but four kids.<eos> eEven without the medication, it's hard to make a living.<eos> Do you realize how much it takes to raise the kids?<eos> Jioh's mom never contributed a dollar.<eos> That's enough.<eos> The kids can hear us!<eos> Where are your buddies?<eos> Where are your school friends when we're struggling like this?<eos> You've done so much for them!
At the end of Bound, when we were totally exhausted... n<eos> ""Pope, you wanna do $1 00 million movie next?""<eos> I said, ""I don't think you should do $1 00 million movie.s Even if you do, I don't wanna do it. ""p<eos> The more money you have, the more heat rains down.g<eos> How are these guys gonna make the jump from a $5 miIIion movie... ... toa $ 65millionmovie? And I was afraid for them.<eos> I kept saying, ""Let's do a $20 million movie, a $1 0 million movie.<eos> Let's work our way up. "" They didn't listen to me, thank God.<eos> I thought, ""That's a Iot of money. "" I know Bound was so great...<eos> ... butlotsof times,thatdoesn't happen. Studios aren't that trusting.<eos> After spending an hour with them, going through the storyboards... ... Iunderstoodwhy someone would trust them.
No one to see it... still it's just as beautiful Or even more so.<eos> What ideal solitude...<eos> Perfect, cold...<eos> Who watches me over there?<eos> Watching me from behind that tree... Someone cold, lonely and bored.<eos> soldiers walk along a path...<eos> A row of houses...<eos> L tried to concentrate and to recall at Least one face of those who had Lived here.<eos> people once Lived here.<eos> L knew them. L believe L Lived among them, too.
The sun rose, and when I came down,<eos> I had a high fever.<eos> Red spots covered my entire body,<eos> and I couldn't even speak.<eos> I guess I was sick for two weeks.<eos> And then, strangely,<eos> my singing became wondrous.<eos> Clear and high...<eos> People wanted to listen to my voice, and they started taking note of me.<eos> I sang in front of them.
A thick fog covered all the villages on the coast.<eos> You couldn't tell the difference between the sky and the sea.<eos> It lasted for many long days.<eos> All the villagers were anxious, and talked about the end of the world.<eos> The fishermen didn't got out to sea anymore, and there were no fish left.<eos> The old people were worried, they called a witch doctor.<eos> At that time I was a kid and didn't understand.<eos> Rama, what is that noise?<eos> The villagers are making an offering to clear away the fog in Timbering.<eos> Is Mbanick with them?
And clearly, we knew we would eventually get the kernel done.<eos> But as it happens.<eos> somebody else did a better kernel before we did.<eos> Now in the old days, we had an overall strategy from calling people's attention to the importance of freedom<eos> To the freedom they can have, or not have, when they use a computer.<eos> Well what can we do about it? As far as I can tell, the only workable way of trying to change this make that strategy work again is to, spread the word that the operating system you're using is actually the GNU system.<eos> Somewhat modified of course.<eos> And when people know this, they'll take a look at the reasons we developed this system.<eos> They'll think about these issues.<eos> And some of them will decide they agree.
There is less and less tolerance on the part of the public... for people who have transgressed the rules.<eos> We have a huge prison population.<eos> This gets into other questions.<eos> Putting a computer hacker in with sex offenders and murderers... is probably the worst thing you can possibly do... to somebody who has... not murdered, is not a violent criminal!<eos> Somebody who's a technological....<eos> Who's gone over the edge.<eos> Then, again, we have to define what we mean.<eos> We need a new classification system for technological law.<eos> In one of my books I talked about setting up a court system... especially for technology where the people that were prosecuting... and the judges and the people involved in the cases... would have some technological basis... to evaluate and try the case in a reasonable manner... and to come up with an alternative sentencing system... that reflected more the nature of the crime.<eos> If you're exposed to people like that for too long, you change with them.
You become one of them.<eos> Next thing you know you'll be locked away again for doing what they do.<eos> One night I was in my cell in a minimum-security facility, Bucks County Prison.<eos> Two guards stormed in... and flipped my bed upside down... and locked me in handcufs and started rummaging through my storage locker.. demanding to know where my computer was.<eos> I'm like, "l don't have a computer here.<eos> What are you talking about?"<eos> They were squeezing the toothpaste out of my tube... ostensibly looking for a computer or whatever they were looking for.<eos> It was bizarre!<eos> But Pennsylvania was more than prisons, it was a place of learning.<eos> And theAge Expo was where thousands of senior citizens learned... that corporateAmerica really cared about them.
We're at your door. Open up."<eos> I wasn't there when they searched my home.<eos> My mom had to get me from school.<eos> They thought... that he was me.<eos> They were looking for somebody that was an adult.<eos> When they found out that I was like, 13... they didn't know what to do.<eos> I think when they walk in and want to take things... they should be told to go to hell... take what they want, we'll see you in court, don't even talk to me.<eos> The problem, of course, is that hackers don't have the resources to do this.<eos> They want to try to get off cheap... so they cooperate and they plea bargain... and they end up pleading guilty to something they didn't do.<eos> And that sets the record bad for them going forward.
We were detained for two hours in the parking lot.<eos> There were 13 police officers and I think five or six police cars.<eos> I told them what was going on... but they seemed to think there was more going on than there was.<eos> Without my consent they took my box of crystals... even though they admitted they didn't know what they were.<eos> They took anything and everything that had magnetic media on it... or had an electrical plug on it.<eos> They took other unrelated items such as a woman's purse.<eos> I'm not quite sure howthat fits into the scope of their investigation.<eos> Every business card I had.<eos> They took everything just to make life difficult on me.<eos> They told me they're not trying to chastise me... and then one of them said... he used to play with baseball cards when he was a kid.
They were doing the bombing; the Junkers.<eos> I couldn"t stand it, such terrible fear.<eos> My two brothers were so scared they wouldnt go inside our house.<eos> My mother held on to me while I held my two small brothers.<eos> I looked after them, I'd take them to the air raid shelters... but the shelters were even more frightening... because it felt like everything was going to cave in.<eos> My mother has always been a very stoic woman... very brave, very left wing... and I overheard a conversation in which she told them:<eos> "I love my children above all... and here they would die.<eos> This will end and they will continue to live."<eos> Thats when the Basque government propaganda... set the objective of evacuating at least 20000 children... to France, England, or any country... willing to receive... these people, these children.<eos> Countries that wanted to take them in.
In school, at our desks: Here Paco, and me beside him.<eos> We were always together.<eos> If Paco was sick, I was sick as well.<eos> Curious, isnt it?<eos> At bedtime, I always went to kiss my brothers goodnight.<eos> The others made fun of me.<eos> "Look at her kissing them!"<eos> I would tuck them in and give them a kiss.<eos> But I was so embarrassed at being made fun of, I stopped going.<eos> Three or four months passed since we saw our parents... but we still remembered them.
"Here she comes, my sister!" And she screamed, "Araceli!"<eos> "Araceli!<eos> Araceli!"<eos> And my father and mother saw me coming.<eos> The emotion was just too much for my father.<eos> A man who used to be a champion weightlifter... a Basque weightlifting champion.<eos> When the car arrived and he saw me come out... he held himself against a tree... and fell on the ground... such was his emotion.<eos> Coming from Moscow... to a small mining town was for me... I don"t know...<eos> I didnt have too much in common with the people.<eos> We were like aliens for them.
My husband is so foolish<eos> Please send him to jail<eos> 6 months later<eos> Two men are getting to new path<eos> You are hiding there<eos> Go away!<eos> You little punk!<eos> Please don't come again<eos> Sure I'm a new man now<eos> But gangsters were waiting in the back lf you get along with them, you will be back here
Policemen!<eos> Hi I was here 8years ago as a Yakuza<eos> As I was the one who stirred up a riot many times I caused a lot of trouble to all of you, the citizens l am a criminal on the most wanted list I am Kihara Yuji I haven't seen you for a long time<eos> Now I changed my mind I am marching with the cross<eos> No matter how I've been bad person in the past<eos> Now, I want to showthat I can start for something new<eos> That's why I am trying to march all parts of country<eos> Hey, policeman!<eos> Although you take a bad person, Don't hate the person<eos> God will definitely take care of them
Quite an entrance, huh?<eos> Thank you, J.J.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wow.<eos> Well, it's a great night.<eos> We here at CRG have always considered ourselves to be in the "Find what people want" business and at Jansen, you guys are in the "Make what people want" business.<eos> So, imagine what we can do together.<eos> We'll be able to find out exactly what people want and make it... for them.
Richard?<eos> Richard?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, It's Me.<eos> What's going on? Is Kim at the store?<eos> No, she's not here.<eos> I thought you said you saw their car.<eos> We think she left with the boys.<eos> This guy you're with, York does he know either of these boys?<eos> No, but one of them, Dan, works here.
No.<eos> - Many?<eos> - Perhaps.<eos> And you see no problem?<eos> The first thing I say to every prospective employee is:<eos> "Don't even consider working here unless you're prepared to desire me."<eos> Because he will.<eos> You expect every male employee to have sex with you?<eos> No, Your Honor.<eos> I expect them to want to.
And then, who should I see but the two of you, handing out flowers and getting the brush-off from that snaggletooth waitress.<eos> Hey!<eos> Kathleen was not snaggletooth.<eos> And you should talk, smiley.<eos> - And is that where you came up with the evil plan?<eos> - My dear, those are the best kind.<eos> So the Perseids on Sintii Four think humans will screw up the new Commonwealth just like we did the old one.<eos> Just a faction on their High Council. Hohne and your other supporters have, the motion locked up in committee, but it might not stay there.<eos> I've spent almost an entire year trying to get worlds to sign up for the new Commonwealth.<eos> I've managed to get three, and now one of them is threatening to back out.
A classified mission. One that was erased from Andromeda's official records.<eos> And from my memory.<eos> What was that?<eos> We're under attack.<eos> Boarding parties detected.<eos> Automated internal defense systems are completely useless.<eos> You and your friends did your jobs well.<eos> Your allies will be very happy.<eos> Allies?<eos> You mean them?
But you let them go, first.<eos> No, they come with us, for insurance.<eos> Lead on.<eos> There's one thing I don't understand.<eos> Why do you care about these kludges?<eos> They're nothing.<eos> Nothing...<eos> they're the people who feed you, the people who clothe you.<eos> If it weren't for enslaved worlds, the Drago-Kasov Pride would cease to exist.<eos> Ruling over them doesn't make you strong, it makes you dependent and weak.
They're simply attempting to make sure that this entire endeavor is worth their time.<eos> I didn't think you'd have a problem with that.<eos> You've got the genetically engineered intellect.<eos> You tell me what Dylan will say when he finds out.<eos> If he found out, he would make a futile appeal to my conscience, after which he would eject the thieves into deep space through the missile tubes.<eos> Which would make him feel better, but it wouldn't solve his problem.<eos> - And what's his problem?<eos> - Logistics.<eos> He needs these people, like them or not.<eos> You need them as well.
We nearly met our destruction at the hands of the last Nietzschean pride we encountered... the Orca, a few thousand strong.<eos> The Sabra and the Jaguar each number in the millions.<eos> Which makes them important players in this area of the known worlds players we may have to deal with sooner or later.<eos> May I caution you?<eos> Watch your back amongst these Nietzschean serpents.<eos> Let the prides know I'll agree to transport the Sabra's First Daughter to her wedding, but at a price.<eos> And what would that be?<eos> Tyr, I'm under no illusion that an alliance as powerful as the Sabra-Jaguar would be interested in signing my Commonwealth Charter. However, there are two systems that would be.<eos> The Enkindu and Schopenhauer systems.<eos> The Jaguar and Sabras have been fighting over them for more than 200 years.
- He had to take care of some vampires.<eos> How was the big fight?<eos> We killed it just before it devoured some power walkers.<eos> - Horrible. - I know.<eos> I saw it in my vision.<eos> Not the Haklar, the walkers.<eos> Walking I get, but power walking?<eos> Why not run for a shorter time?<eos> Weird.<eos> - One of them hit him. - A walker?
You finally found a body that won't burn out, huh?<eos> Looks like.<eos> - I can live with that.<eos> I don't think you know what you're getting into.<eos> I know. You don't seem to know what you had.<eos> You were the worst vampire.<eos> Vampires don't help people, moron, they kill them.<eos> - Here, let me show you.<eos> - You may have the attitude and power. But there's one thing you don't have and never will: friends.<eos> Four of them behind you with heavy things.
And who would have blamed you?<eos> One more vampire turned to dust.<eos> But you helped me find my destiny.<eos> I really appreciate it.<eos> I've never belonged anywhere.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> The vampires, where are they?<eos> Oh, right behind you.<eos> I belong with them.
Kind of.<eos> Come on, you guys. Think.<eos> What do we know about Fred?<eos> - Well, I knew about the tacos.<eos> - She seemed comfortable in the sewers.<eos> They're dark, cavelike.<eos> She felt safe.<eos> I'll head back there.<eos> She worked at the public library.<eos> What about them?
Is my slayer too far gone to care?<eos> What if Buffy can't defeat it?<eos> Beady-Eyes is right, we're needed!<eos> Or we could just sit around and glare<eos> We'll see it through It's what we're always here to do<eos> So we will walk through the fire<eos> So one by one, they turn from me<eos> - I guess my friends can't face the cold<eos> - What can't we face<eos> - Why I froze, not one among them knows
- Listen to me.<eos> Please, there's not a lot of time, listen.<eos> Dawn, listen to me.<eos> I love you. I will always love you.<eos> This is the work that I have to do.<eos> Tell Giles...<eos> Tell Giles I figured it out.<eos> And I'm OK.<eos> And give my love to my friends.<eos> You have to take care of them now.
I should have. But, no...<eos> DANNY: I only worried about my butt.<eos> They killed Joey to send a message to me.<eos> Mom, I'm sorry. I didn't know.<eos> Danny do you have any idea who shot your brother?<eos> One of the runners.<eos> Probably a guy...<eos> No!<eos> No. No names.<eos> One of them killed Joey.
Well, we got to have pictures.<eos> The coroner will be all over us.<eos> I'll get the pictures!<eos> I'm going to take him.<eos> Oh, my God, my baby!<eos> The Andersons, who own a profitable Internet company in Las Vegas, are said to be devastated by the death of little Zachary.<eos> As for leads, the police will only say they have widened the investigation to include employees of Steve Anderson's company.<eos> Immediate coworkers are being asked to give DNA samples.<eos> By all accounts, the employees are complying voluntarily.<eos> One of them is quoted as saying
For those who have to ask, no answer could suffice.<eos> Look, I see we've come to an impasse.<eos> If further investigation determines that Walden didn't kill those other women then you can rejoin the investigation.<eos> Oh, do I get the weekend off?<eos> For starters.<eos> And a two-week holiday... anywhere but CSI.<eos> You brought this on yourself.<eos> Now, the next time you want to play with my career maybe you'll think twice.<eos> You know, it's not fair, Grissom.<eos> You know more about signatures than most of them put together.
God, I'm really sorry.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me leaving. I'm leaving.<eos> Well, we knew what we were getting into.<eos> So maybe it's time we get out of it.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Once upon a time, before we were witchy women,<eos> Prue and I shared this amazing apartment in North Beach.<eos> But then when Grams got sick, we decided to move back to the manor for a while.<eos> And we gave up the apartment to friends, and your wife was smart enough to keep in touch with them.
I had it in my pocket, Piper.<eos> And all the orbing in and out and...<eos> Your orbs are grass if you do not find that ring.<eos> All right, hi. Before blood is spilled, can I just ask a business question?<eos> Is it possible to turn a human into a demon?<eos> Well, there's rumours. Stories about demons recruiting humans.<eos> So "join the evil and see the underworld"?<eos> Apparently the demons go after humans in need and strike your classic Faustian deal.<eos> But then the humans are forced into this training academy, a program that destroys their humanity.<eos> And turns them into demons.
You were saying?<eos> Look no further, boys. I am the pharaoh.<eos> It's him.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Off the top of my head...<eos> I'd say these men are in the employ of some super-secret federal agency... which created Pharaoh as a recruitment device... for the ultimate warriors of the digital age.<eos> - Oh, you're very good.<eos> - You're not going with them, are you?
Don't make a big deal out of it.<eos> - Where's your squad?<eos> - We got separated when the fire broke out.<eos> Then I saw the signal that told us to go to ground.<eos> - So you're alone?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - What are we looking at here?<eos> - A Kiloma Indian burial site, probably from the early 1800s.<eos> These pictures, they're just like in the stories.<eos> - Legend has it that a group of white fur traders kidnapped a girl from the tribe, forced her to have a child for them.
- I got an aquarium.<eos> Yes, I see.<eos> - Couldn't get a bigger one, huh?<eos> - The next size up was pretty expensive.<eos> - I thought we were gonna go out to eat.<eos> - I'm still hungry.<eos> Want to play?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - We can hunt zombies together.<eos> Couldn't we just reason with them?
So I ordered an ANA.<eos> That's a test for a disease called lupus.<eos> I know.<eos> I take Plaquenil, 200 milligrams a day.<eos> - You lied to me?<eos> - I wanted to avoid a debate.<eos> I may have harmed you by giving you those steroids.<eos> The steroids help me.<eos> I can move around, make visits do my work.<eos> Without them, I'm stuck in bed.
After his ship crashed, Ma'el found an alien colony... not Taelon, nor Atavus.<eos> They came here 8 billion years before he did.<eos> Atavus?<eos> - That's a Taelon proto-species, they're extinct!<eos> - Not totally, this is a healing chamber.<eos> Ma'el designed it to regenerate the Taelons with the healing energy in the pool.<eos> It's the Atavus residual life force.<eos> The Taelons are descending from the Atavus; they might be compatible.<eos> Ma'el knew that the dying taelons would follow him here.<eos> This chamber was what he left for them.
Actually, they-- no.<eos> They just kind of... run around and I can't seem to get them to follow the music.<eos> Well, maybe they just need a little more practice. That's all.<eos> Well, we've been rehearsing for a week.<eos> They just don't seem to have the proper coordination.<eos> I'm sorry. Oh, okay,<eos> let's see the first light cue for the prince's entrance.<eos> Wait, you're joking, right?<eos> 'Cause my boys, they're coordinated.<eos> You know, I play ball with them.
We both had enough.<eos> It's not like Ray's parents.<eos> What?<eos> They seem to have the secret.<eos> What?<eos> They know how to do it.<eos> It's not a facade for them.<eos> But they're maniacs.<eos> Yes, but they're honest with each other.<eos> Everything's out in the open with them.
You still want 'em, you bony old blue-hair? Ow! Ow!<eos> Titty-twister!<eos> Ow!<eos> Hurts!<eos> All the clown fish and yellow tangs in the world can't help you now.<eos> That's it? Fish food?<eos> That's your ace in the hole?<eos> Turkey!<eos> Lois, it was horrible.<eos> The fish were jumping all over my eyes and in my nose, and one of them muttered something anti-Semitic.
- Oh, Peter. I care as much about the size of your penis as you care about the size of my breasts.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You can't let those awful kids get to you.<eos> They won't. I'm never going back to that school again.<eos> - Dad, could you help me with my algebra?<eos> - You're a big man.<eos> You figure it out.<eos> I bet there's a part of you that wants to be friends with them.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> - So be nice to them.
Of course, you'll be playing the role of "Sans Testiclese".<eos> We're ready for you down the hall.<eos> Sure you want to go through with this?<eos> You could have puppies with another dog.<eos> And maybe with a condor!<eos> Yeah, then you'd have flying puppies.<eos> Would you like that, Brian? Huh? Flying puppies?<eos> No.<eos> Those puppies in there are mine.<eos> And I'll give anything to be with them. Anything.
Again!<eos> ?<eos> We've got half an arn.<eos> I've heard Dominars never need rest.<eos> Growl like a Luxan!<eos> So, what'd you do?<eos> Why'd they imprison you?<eos> Actually, when the Peacekeepers found me, they tried to give me back, but...<eos> Nebari Prime didn't want me.<eos> To them I'm just... another mouth to feed in a non-conformist colony.
Scorpius trap.<eos> No, no, no. I know Scorpius.<eos> This is different.<eos> All right, so let's say it is this alien who takes the form of your father.<eos> Why would they come looking for you now?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I thought the Ancients were done with me.<eos> Why... don't you... just ignore it?<eos> Why do you want to look for it?<eos> Because I'm not done with them.
Pilot has been unconscious for over an arn now.<eos> Well, why didn't you stop me earlier?<eos> Well, somehow I have a feeling this isn't about him anymore.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm angry with myself because I could almost forgive her.<eos> Why don't you?<eos> How can I trust Chiana with my heart?<eos> Can you trust Crichton again?<eos> He trusts these aliens.<eos> We know nothing about them.
For all the souls you've murdered! Don't!<eos> Keep it away!<eos> Got her, Pilot.<eos> We're coming back to Moya. We'll try to free her up.<eos> Crichton, don't you know?<eos> D'Argo's already outside.<eos> Pilot, I've cleared Moya of all the cables except for two.<eos> Be careful, those last cables are pulse rechargers.<eos> Can you shut them down?<eos> I have no control over them.
That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage and say, "Look at me I am a broken robot!"<eos> - Bender! You can move!<eos> You're cured!<eos> - Oh, crap!<eos> It's a miracle.<eos> I can move again.<eos> My music career is over.<eos> I don't understand the biz, but wouldn't being able to move help?<eos> No!<eos> Don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots. I was one of them.
- I'm uninformed, ignorant, and...<eos> I can't even think of a second synonym for 'uninformed. '<eos> - I suck.<eos> - Honey.<eos> Thirteen million volumes?<eos> I've read 300 books in my entire life, and I'm already 16? You know how long I would need to read 13 million books?<eos> You don't have to read every one of them. Tuesdays With Morrie. Skip that.<eos> Who Moved My Cheese?<eos> Stuff you already know.<eos> But every kid coming to Harvard is inevitably reading books. Different books. I want to be able to converse intelligently with each of them.
There's a cocktail hour tomorrow night, and then a big closing luncheon on Saturday, and pruzan said that I can bring you to both.<eos> Shut up! That's good news.<eos> Mrs. butterworth's? Dash.<eos> Dash.<eos> It's not in here.<eos> There you go.<eos> Oh. So would you please just come to this thing?<eos> I'm gonna be running around dealing with 200 drunk lawyers.<eos> I could use a hug now and then.<eos> Can't one of them hug you?
We'll only take a few minutes.<eos> Hey, this-- it's nice.<eos> He can't help himself.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> I guess so.<eos> Careful. it's still drying.<eos> That smell, linseed oil-- you grind your own paints.<eos> The pigments are better that way.<eos> Just the way the Impressionists used to do it.<eos> Some of them.
She's a good employee.<eos> She's good at playing these guys for their money.<eos> You want the girls to talk to you, you gotta buy them drinks.<eos> Everybody knows the game.<eos> She hasn't been here for a few days.<eos> Because she was strangled and drowned in her bathtub.<eos> Little Angie?<eos> - Anyone here good for it?<eos> No. The customers don't know where they live.<eos> Maybe she was seeing one of them on the side. House rules.
Well, he has immunity from arrest, but not from talking to us.<eos> Play nice, maybe he will.<eos> Ava had that odd combination of greed and innocence.<eos> Very common in girls from the countryside.<eos> You were romantically involved?<eos> No. I attend many official functions.<eos> I needed at my side a woman who spoke my language, knew our customs.<eos> And Ava was okay with that?<eos> Very much so. She got to meet many important men.<eos> Any of them want her dead?
You think the D.A.'s office doesn't know what we're doing here, Counselor?<eos> We're not above the law, either. I will subpoena anyone I have to.<eos> And you'll be making a big mistake.<eos> The only mistake was trying to make a felony disappear to protect your own case.<eos> Now that's a crime, fellas.<eos> We'll see who's blowing their career.<eos> Are you going to tell us what this is all about?<eos> Not without our lawyers.<eos> Fine.<eos> Bring them down to SVU tomorrow morning when you surrender yourselves.
This is Det. Benson from SVU unit. We need to rush a bus to Avenue...<eos> Forget it. There's no pulse.<eos> And I do whatever I gotta do to save a kid from a perv like Kanick.<eos> You kicked the crap out of him.<eos> Jill Foster's dead on account of Kanick.<eos> I want my union delegate.<eos> He's here.<eos> Want me to go with you?<eos> We didn't get the information fast enough... from Kanick to prevent Jill Foster's death.<eos> Capt. Cragen, we have grave concerns... about the actions of your detectives... that at least one of them used excessive force with a suspect... and that a confidential informant was... improperly used and actually mishandled, leading to his death.
What about my team?<eos> What happens to them?<eos> You know, some people actually laugh at those guys.<eos> Like blind football's funny.<eos> Like it's a lost cause.<eos> I think they're missing the point.<eos> These boys are out here because it's difficult. Because people say it can't be done.<eos> They have courage.<eos> And God knows that we need more guys like that... that have the courage to fight for the lost causes.<eos> Because every now and then... one of them wins.
Isn't this a bit dramatic?<eos> Couldn't we have simply spoken over the phone?<eos> Actually, I find that face-to-face yields better results.<eos> Hmm. I want to know what you have for me.<eos> Nothing yet.<eos> Soon, hopefully.<eos> Well, so much for face-to-face.<eos> Do you ever think about dinosaurs?<eos> Can't say that I do.<eos> It's amazing to think that our entire world economy... is based on them, you know?
Look how fast you run to her defense!<eos> Why couldn't you ever feel that about me?<eos> I'm your wife, Max!<eos> I'm carrying your child!<eos> This was all some kind of plan to get pregnant and go home, wasn't it?<eos> Home to what, Tess?<eos> To Kivar?<eos> To our enemies?<eos> They're not my enemies, Max.<eos> You made a deal with them, with Kivar...
- They haven't seen her, honey.<eos> Dr Reid, isn't this your day off?<eos> - It's that pregnant girl...<eos> - The one who went missing.<eos> And now you're here, voluntarily, hell bent on finding one of your little lost ducklings.<eos> It's important you understand something.<eos> I'm not interested in babies.<eos> I don't melt when I see them, I don't have a yearning to make them my life's work.<eos> I'm a doctor interested in my patients, male or female.<eos> Right now, one of them needs help.
Does that strike you as okay behavior?<eos> Hey, I'm here too.<eos> Good point.<eos> What's your story?<eos> Can you keep a secret?<eos> I'm the Fort Knox of secrets.<eos> I came out here to talk with my parents.<eos> You must think I'm pretty weird, conversing with dead people.<eos> I don't think you're weird, Lana.<eos> Do you remember them?
We got a job in Denver day after tomorrow.<eos> A mosque.<eos> Morning. We'd like to get onto your property to trim some growth that's posing a safety hazard with the power lines.<eos> Okay. Go around the side.<eos> Records show our repair department had some crews here yesterday.<eos> - Were you affected by the shortfalls?<eos> - Yesterday?<eos> The people next door had some trucks go up there.<eos> But, no, we're fine.<eos> How about them?
Fine.<eos> - I'll believe you.<eos> - To the Crazy Horse, buona fortuna.<eos> Club business ain't easy, I tell you.<eos> With the Bing, everybody only sees the glitz and glamour. Nobody knows what goes into it.<eos> There's a lot to deal with, I know.<eos> See, it's one thing to have a bar.<eos> When you're dealing with performers... I don't care if it's music, tits, fire-eaters.<eos> It's a whole other game. (PHONE RINGING)<eos> Ultimately you're relying on them to get the customers in... and spend money.
Come on, guys, we'll just have to find other stuff to do.<eos> What's a VHS?<eos> Why can't I be like all the other kids?<eos> They all have three-bedroom homes<eos> Broken trucks on their lawns and cut-up hot dogs for lunch<eos> It's not my fault my parents succeed so much<eos> There's no one in town I can relate to I play with autographed baseball bats<eos> While everyone else just plays with sticks and pine cones<eos> Has a boy ever felt so alone?<eos> Well, who needs them anyway?

Neelix... where's our "souvenir"?<eos> In my pack.<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> Um, we'd like to give her something.<eos> It's in the equipment bag.<eos> It's a toy.<eos> That could be a weapon.<eos> It's harmless.<eos> These men are dangerous.<eos> I want you to stay away from them. Understood?
It's harmless.<eos> These men are dangerous.<eos> I want you to stay away from them. Understood?<eos> Well, so much for making friends. Mr. Verin?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> My job.<eos> I'm Voyager's Ambassador, remember?<eos> Can I have a word with you?<eos> Just between us... I understand why you don't trust humans.<eos> Then why are you with them?
Of course, we'd need to build a network of them and launch them into orbit.<eos> - Can we do that?<eos> - Well, this is an entirely new technology.<eos> We'd need to bring in outside help.<eos> A lot of it. Engineers, physicists... But ultimately it means we don't have to involve the Tok'ra.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Now the Goa'uld think we're no threat. If it gets out that we're at this level of technology,... ..we couldn't build this system fast enough.<eos> You think the Tok'ra would betray us? Maybe not intentionally, but they've had problems with Goa'uld spies before.<eos> I don't think it's worth the risk.<eos> Not when we can do this without them.
A way to coexist.<eos> For that, we thank them.<eos> You don't coexist.<eos> You use them as slaves.<eos> Look.<eos> We're not gonna tell you anything, so you might as well let us go.<eos> We'll go back to where we came from, you can go on doing what you do so well.<eos> Because now I know for certain there is more out there.<eos> Yeah, I know the grass always looks cleaner.<eos> But a bunch of bad guys with glowing eyes are out there, and you really don't wanna mess with them.
Our soil samples indicate only minute traces. The geological survey I read said there was none.<eos> - We're not stopping the test.<eos> - You don't realise the implications of this.<eos> Or maybe you do.<eos> - Are you making an accusation, Major?<eos> - You knew all along, didn't you? You were hoping for a chain reaction with the naqahdah in the soil.<eos> - That entire planet could be destroyed.<eos> - The possibility has been considered.<eos> Most Goa'uld worlds have a high incidence of naqahdah.<eos> This would be a very effective weapon against them.
Ah.<eos> An excellent point.<eos> Sirs, if I may.<eos> Our robots are really so much like us... ..they probably couldn't resist the chance to use the gate to explore.<eos> I think we can also assume they'd guard top-secret information... ..as closely as we would.<eos> Besides, they don't have our IDC codes, so they can't give those away.<eos> Colonel O'Neill, if you don't want to take this on, I won't make it an order.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> But I have grown accustomed.<eos> I cannot go on without them.
Oh, I just can't believe Midge would do this... after all the years we've been friends.<eos> She took the cheese puffs.<eos> All the cheese puffs?<eos> What the hell? I wanted some of those.<eos> Red, this isn't about the cheese puffs.<eos> Well, maybe not for you.<eos> They're so light and fluffy.<eos> - This is all your fault.<eos> - What?<eos> You're always mean to them.
You know each other. Your kids know each other.<eos> You built hospitals together.<eos> He was Midwest finance chairman on the campaign.<eos> - Never played chess, though. - No.<eos> See?<eos> - You're scared of Babish.<eos> - Like you're not.<eos> No, because we are both men of Chicago.<eos> What is it with people from Chicago that they're so happy to have been born there?<eos> So many people can't wait to tell me they're from Chicago and when I meet them, they live anywhere but Chicago.
- In fact, it's to subsidize art.<eos> Go ahead and explain that distinction in Topeka.<eos> They're bright. No artists you mentioned received direct money from the Endowments because the last time Republicans tried losing the NEA not three times ago, but last time, we got rid of the individual grants.<eos> And Oakenwood found a back door by giving money directly to the museums that put on...<eos> Toby, do you like this stuff?<eos> You'd need the Budweiser Clydesdales to drag me to Picasso and Monet.<eos> I'm not the guy you want deciding this.<eos> You're not the guy I want deciding this.<eos> I don't know where you get the idea taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for anything of which they disapprove.<eos> Lots of them don't like tanks.
- Muncie.<eos> Number for a Raymond Pearce.<eos> - Sorry I'm late.<eos> - lt's all right.<eos> I just got the blood test back on Ray Pearce, and it was indeed the same Ray Pearce pronounced dead three days ago.<eos> But that's not all. By all medical standards, he should still be dead.<eos> His blood has enough metal alloy in it to poison an elephant.<eos> Except that he's still a man, and he'll act and think like one even if he is more powerful than a locomotive.<eos> But then the question is, why kill his friends?<eos> I mean, if he was wronged somehow, wouldn't he go to them for solace?
Now look, Geniah...<eos> If your god was all-powerful and all-knowing, then maybe he sent me to save you.<eos> Or maybe he sent you to test my faith.<eos> I'm going to hold my breath and sacrifice myself.<eos> Yeah, good one.<eos> Now, listen, Gabrielle...<eos> This kid needs our help.<eos> She's so blindly devoted to that god of hers she's willing to kill herself.<eos> Well, why don't we introduce her to the gods that we know?<eos> Then she wouldn't wanna throw herself over a cliff for them.
Thanks!<eos> I could have sworn I gave that back to your mother.<eos> I mean, I don't know what happened.<eos> Well, here's what probably happened is that, you know, I'm doing a million things and the kids are always at you and asking for stuff and Ally probably came up to me and asked me for something and I didn't really hear.<eos> And as long as I don't hear the word "gun" or "knife," I just said, "Yeah."<eos> So, yeah, that-- that's probably what happened, I'm positive.<eos> Because, you know, I'm doing like a million things, and you know, I've gotta do everything here myself, and if you would pitch in a little bit more, Ray--<eos> Oh, no no!<eos> No! No! Don't look at me!<eos> This is what drowning people do, they pull you right down with them.
- Or would you rather..?<eos> Yes, I'd rather be making love to my fiancée on the Riviera right now.<eos> Just send it.<eos> If you can't install the regulator into your back harness, please call the emergency number.<eos> Good luck, sir.<eos> Like never trust politicians or parking meters.<eos> Like on the first day, you know, me and Izzy, when we got along.<eos> Seeing our plan actually working was amazing.<eos> I was just worried my friends would be even more disappointed if it all fell apart.<eos> Like things usually did for them, 'cause they'd always been what you call total losers.
Is somebody there?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Please don't leave me!<eos> I don't want to be alone.<eos> All right.<eos> Do you hate normal people?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Why?<eos> I suppose... I'm afraid of them.
Fry, what the hell are you doing?<eos> I gotta drop more load.<eos> Look, I tried everything else.<eos> I still got no horizon.<eos> Better try everything twice, 'cause we don't just flush out...<eos> Look, If you know something I don't, get up here and take the chair.<eos> Listen, company says we are responsible for every single one of those people, Fry.<eos> What, we both die out of sheer fucking nobility?<eos> Don't you touch that handle, Fry!<eos> I'm not gonna die for them.
- Mr. Supervisor, please.<eos> - Hector, let me finish.<eos> - But that contract is part of our guarantee.<eos> - You're wrong.<eos> - We get the rectifiers. That's the deal.<eos> - Hector, let me finish, please.<eos> - I knew it.<eos> The deal for minority quotas is 1 0% of the business - which 1 0% is up to us.<eos> If it was up to me, Weltec wouldn't get anything, 'cause of your failure rates.<eos> - That's 'cause of them.
This is our position, Captain.<eos> We're still bucking some pretty heavy seas.<eos> I estimate us to be about three hours behind schedule.<eos> I gave orders to run at flank speed and hold off a trim dive...<eos> -...until we make up the lost time.<eos> -That's fine, Lieutenant.<eos> You're a first-rate XO, Andy.<eos> A damn good submariner.<eos> I know the men like you.<eos> I'd give my life for any one of them, sir.
It'll be Munich all over again<eos> Yes. Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive<eos> And the Soviets will be emboldened to push us even harder<eos> No, we must remove the missiles one way or another<eos> It seems to me the options are either some combination of international pressure and action on our part till they give up or... we hit them<eos> An air strike<eos> Bob? We've worked up several military scenarios<eos> Before I ask General Taylor to take us through the various options I'd like for us to adopt a rule<eos> If we strike we must agree to do it before the missiles become operational<eos> Because once they are I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some of them are launched
At least, I think she did.<eos> - Do you like that one?<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - We went out for two years.<eos> And I never got comfortable.<eos> Why would a girl, no, a woman like Charlie go out with me?<eos> I felt like a fraud. I felt like one of those people who suddenly shave their heads... and said they'd always been punks.<eos> I was sure I'd be discovered at any second.<eos> And I worried about my abilities as a lover.<eos> And I was intimidated by other men in her design department... and became convinced she was gonna leave me for one of them.

Caffeine helps us program.<eos> Perfect. Smart simple and logical.<eos> What did your boss say?<eos> He said no.<eos> Question!<eos> Who builds this company's products?<eos> You do.<eos> Engineers do.<eos> Not managers.<eos> They should be answering to you, not you to them!
Tell us about the bailiffs, da.<eos> All right, so.<eos> Do you know what bailiffs are?<eos> They're just like gods but they're worse.<eos> Much worse.<eos> So... one day...<eos> I was coming home after working hard all day.<eos> And I saw them -- the bailiffs attacking our homes.<eos> Big bastards with hammers and knives and all sorts of things.<eos> But that didn't stop me when I saw what they were at. I went for them.
It's good to see you.<eos> Tell me what happened that night?<eos> He got in a fight in a black club.<eos> Threats had been made. They got Po the same evening, before I could find him.<eos> Why there?<eos> He wouldn't tell me.<eos> Your brother was a loose cannon, but he didn't deserve this.<eos> Why fight with blacks?<eos> Well, the waterfront's only four square miles.<eos> Half the businesses belong to us the other half to them.
So just what is he planning?<eos> And what pays for it?<eos> These daily games are costing a fortune, yet we have no new taxes.<eos> The future.<eos> The future pays for it.<eos> He's started selling the grain reserves.<eos> This can't be true.<eos> He's selling Rome's reserves of grain.<eos> The people will be starving in two years.<eos> I hope they're enjoying the games because soon enough they'll be dead because of them.
I never thought I'd be on television.<eos> I'm just...<eos> 'That's right. You, on television.<eos> 'We'll send you the necessary information.<eos> 'Goodbye, congratulations and take care.'<eos> But I don't get it. Why are you so hard on your folks?<eos> I mean, they give you everything.<eos> They hook you up with an apartment, a croaker shrink.<eos> Which is fine, you know. It's great.<eos> It's just... money is never what I really wanted from them, you know?
What a card you are. How bizarre.<eos> - Very well, but make it snappy, huh?<eos> - It'll be snappy, sir.<eos> After you.<eos> - Ever been to the zoo, Sarge? - Sure.<eos> - Seen the walruses?<eos> - Yeah, cute.<eos> That's what I think.<eos> What do you think, sir?<eos> I can take them or leave them alone.
Tony!<eos> Marcia!<eos> This is Maestro Crawford.<eos> They adore you, sir.<eos> Big fans. - Absolutely.<eos> - What an honour to meet you, sir.<eos> - How nice.<eos> - Do you have time to?<eos> They were hurrying to the concert, sir, when Gabriel's body hit, right there. Wham.<eos> Right in front of them.
It got a little messy, but... I'll tell you all about that once we're on the road.<eos> For your information, I never fuck the wrong guy.<eos> So, Rudy, I want you to meet Millie Bobeck.<eos> Remember Millie Bobeck, don't you ?<eos> My girlfriend before I went in.<eos> Worked in that bar in Motor City where I manslaughtered What's-His-Name.<eos> See, Millie here, she used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers.<eos> Real big talkers, scheming about a real score one day.<eos> Two years in the Mountain, man. What the hell ?<eos> Why not let her get friendly with them ?
The lines must have faded over time.<eos> This great village was the capital for all our tribes.<eos> This is where our people's history was buried.<eos> Here.<eos> When the Psychlos attacked Earth...<eos> ... theysentoutflyinggasdrones.<eos> Our ancestors must've made it out into these remote radiated areas...<eos> ... andtheonlyreasonthey survived was because radiation is...<eos> ... LethaltothePsychlos.<eos> -And that was not good for them.
And when this conflict is over, we will reestablish commerce with them.<eos> Do you understand, colonel?<eos> Perfectly, my lord.<eos> Reverend, with your permission, l`d like to make an announcement.<eos> Young man, this is a house of God.<eos> I understand that, reverend. I apologize.<eos> The South Carolina Militia is being called up.<eos> l`m here to enlist every man willing.<eos> Son we are here to pray for the souls of those men hanging outside.<eos> Yes, pray for them.
Our Cosette is the prettiest.<eos> And I'm not saying that because I'm her uncle.<eos> Nonsense, you are not her uncle.<eos> It's almost a little bride.<eos> She's got the right age.<eos> I won't show you the garden.<eos> Because it's so cold, not all the flowers are blooming yet.<eos> But in the summer...<eos> I'll introduce you to our gardeners.<eos> Thanks to them, we commit a true sin every summer when we refresh our senses with these miracles.
Then you try and slip them into the cracks like that.<eos> Is he a drunk?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Then you'll have to say no.<eos> It's just like Darian and Falcon.<eos> He was addicted to gambling and even though she completely loved him she had to walk away.<eos> Am I supposed to know these people?<eos> From Santa Cruz.<eos> It was more complicated for them. They were actually half-brother, half-sister.
I wish I were a Catholic sometimes.<eos> Incense, nice costumes...<eos> A lot to be said for it, really.<eos> They have confession too.<eos> I've got some friends... and I think they're going to get into a lot of trouble.<eos> And I don't know what to do.<eos> Don't suppose you can go to the police?<eos> I thought not.<eos> If you have to commit crime... to get what you want... then you're not meant to have it.<eos> I don't know if I'm worried more for them or worried for myself.
And I have here 84 motions to strike and demurrers submitted by representatives of Pacific Gas Electric. Each one attacking the validity of this complaint.<eos> I have reviewed all of the information carefully.<eos> I'm ready to give my decision.<eos> Before I do, is there anything anyone wants to say?<eos> -No, Your Honour.<eos> -No, Your Honour.<eos> Very well.<eos> In the matter of the plaintiffs of Hinkley, California vs. PGE it is the order of this court that each of the 84 motions to strike and demurrers are denied.<eos> And the causes of action against Pacific Gas and Electric are upheld.<eos> On a more personal note as a resident here in Barstow, which is not far from Hinkley I am disturbed by reference to evidence that suggests that not only was hexavalent chromium used but that your clients actually sent these residents pamphlets telling them that it was good for them.
Father Geronimo Cattaneo, whose side will you take?<eos> The laughs of Democritus.<eos> Your Majesty the Queen...<eos> Kind Roman minds...<eos> The laughs of Democritus...<eos> First of all, his laugh was like the vapors of smelling salts by which he aspired to protect or cure the human race from corruption.<eos> And, in contrast, the tears of Heraclitus were like a secretion too soft and pungent, which incited or increased the corruption of the state.<eos> That may seem paradoxical. But not if we seek the truth in the words of these two rival philosophers.<eos> Come here, Democritus, and listen!<eos> If you were crazy for philosophizing about infinite worlds, then you are wise for making fun of one of them.
These arguments are a little subjective.<eos> From where does your authority come to allow you to change our vote?<eos> The subjectivity for which you criticize me comes from the Christian principles which guide us.<eos> The authority comes not from me, but from the principles which orient us and from all I know of these people.<eos> For no one amongst you has ever dealt with these Indians or learned their language!<eos> With the exception of one who knows a few words.<eos> I spent five years in all the villages of Bahia, and nine years in the Gentile areas of Maranhao and Grand-Para<eos> where, over 400 leagues, I built 16 churches, and taught catechism in seven different languages!<eos> And, after... having converted the Indians and made them into subjects of the King of Portugal,<eos> I established between them and the Portuguese, the way things were...
Why don't you say it, Judy?<eos> I have the reputation for being on the hunt for a husband.<eos> Lily, I asked him here on purpose for you.<eos> Percy Gryce and I are becoming very good friends.<eos> You're sure you wouldn't like me to telephone Lawrence Selden?<eos> Quite sure.<eos> I do enjoy the quiet.<eos> Don't you, Lily?<eos> I wish men would always stay away.<eos> It's much nicer without them.
I have been compromised once... I cannot be so again.<eos> I am very grateful for your kindness... but it is impossible.<eos> You must see that.<eos> We must think of your future.<eos> If you only knew what little difference that makes now.<eos> At least let me tell Selden where you're living.<eos> It will do no good. Please.<eos> Very well.<eos> You may tell him if you wish.<eos> If only you'd let me help you... you could wipe your feet on them.
Yeah, it's me again.<eos> We're coming.<eos> Tell him to be ready.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> -It's me.<eos> -Where the hell you been?<eos> -I've been trying to get a signal.<eos> A couple of guys showed up.<eos> It got pretty choppy.<eos> One of them made off with her.
From here.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I was born here.<eos> Here in the nuthouse?<eos> What about your parents?<eos> My mother is dead.<eos> A hairdryer fell into the bathtub.<eos> And my father is out there.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He's one of them.
Everywhere I go I' m harassed by you.<eos> This march took place in Century City, Los Angeles, in 1990.<eos> So you're gonna see it what it is and we'll talk about.<eos> Forthe janitors of Los Angeles, this was supposed to be another morning.<eos> They would sing, they would march, some would go to jail.<eos> But when the marchers reached the entrance to Century City... they found themselves trapped in a movie,a very bad movie.<eos> Twice the demonstrators tried to submit to arrest.<eos> The police moved in with vengeance.<eos> The marchers were barely able to scramble to Century and nearby it.<eos> Fifty of them would go to jail. But more than 60 demonstrators would end up in hospitals and ERs.
I'll be back from the conference by tomorrow morning, make sure that... everything is alright in Gurukul.<eos> Morning Mr Aryan, what changes would you like to make in Gurukul today.<eos> Just a small change sir I would like you to begin the day... with some sweets<eos> - Today is my birthday.<eos> Congraluations Mr Aryan.<eos> I'm sorry I am not allowed to have sweets...<eos> Actually sir, there was something I wanted to ask you for.<eos> I knew you would ask me for something tell me what can I do for you.<eos> Sir, I was thinking of throwing a small party for the students... they have given me so much respect in such a small span of time.<eos> I will be very happy to do something for them sir - only if you permit.
They could also make war in the sea.<eos> Their fleets consisted of 100 to 120 canoes.<eos> In a few days, they would go from Bertioga to the Guanabara Bay.<eos> The prisoners they would take were sacrificed and eaten.<eos> That was the peak of the village's life, their biggest celebration.<eos> The prisoner was taken to his master's village.<eos> The women and the children were the first ones to cry out... jump up and down and slap the prisoner.<eos> They'd cover his body in ashes and shave his eyebrows off. Then they would tie him up and offer him a woman to serve him... even sexually, in fact.<eos> All done, they would schedule the celebration.<eos> The men would take the prisoner along to drink and party with them.
Was he with you last night?<eos> Early on, he was.<eos> Then, later on, he wasn't.<eos> Now, this is called a decapod crustacean. That's a lobster.<eos> Nature uses them to clean dead bodies.<eos> Them and shrimps get all the drowned flesh off the bones.<eos> What was the name of that fish I showed you? - A halibut.<eos> - That's right.<eos> Fishermen like halibut because of their shapes.<eos> Fishermen like to make them their girlfriends even though their body temperature is much lower than a proper girlfriend.
I can't get over it.<eos> - The suffering he must've gone through.<eos> - Don't think about it. He'll be fine.<eos> Makes me sick to my stomach.<eos> That's a mere pittance.<eos> £2 million.<eos> I'd pay twice this to catch these fiends.<eos> I know.<eos> Promise me something.<eos> Fifteen minutes alone with them.
You're kidding, right?<eos> No. I'm getting completely screwed here.<eos> None of my equipment's here.<eos> None of the stuff they promised.<eos> I've got 60 guys running around the jungle with nothing to do.<eos> Something is really messed up here.<eos> I'm going to pin these bastards down tonight.<eos> You really want to put me at a table full of oil executives?<eos> They're big boys. They can stand up to a little hippie like you.<eos> Can I tell them what I think of them?
Please!<eos> I'm still at the motel.<eos> Oh, my God. Oh, God.<eos> What's the matter, Joe?<eos> You okay?<eos> No, don't do it!<eos> I lived in a world of facts, of a reality that I thought I understood.<eos> I believed I was the center of the design... and I was certain that I knew all the answers.<eos> But now I face the truth about what I've done to hurt those around me, and in hurting them, what I've done to myself.<eos> I've confronted my own demons, and now the only thing I know for certain... is that I will live with them forever.
He was murdered.<eos> Perhaps God kept me alive so that I could tell you the truth.<eos> So that I could show you those killers.<eos> And reveal their identities to you.<eos> So that they could get punished both by God and the law.<eos> Their..<eos> Excuse me, sir, would you please switch off your mobile phone?<eos> And now.. .. I'm going to reveal their names.<eos> They were three of them.<eos> Two of them were police inspectors.
For you, for you ... and for you two.<eos> You don't have to pay!<eos> We want to.<eos> One ticket is left over.<eos> Rita!<eos> I find it brave of you to have stayed here.<eos> You are going to see socialism for what it is.<eos> You are going to see that sometimes we have to force people into their luck.<eos> But maybe, you will understand.<eos> We are for the people, therefore we are against them.
But what's your shot in all this?<eos> Being a famous underground pirate cyber journalist can't be much of a payday.<eos> My folks were loaded.<eos> So, what?<eos> You like the sound of your own voice?<eos> Look around at all this.<eos> Built by people who got up every morning, worked hard trying to make a better life.<eos> Then The Pulse happened.<eos> They blinked, and before they knew it, they'd turned over the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to have it.<eos> Overnight, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
Does it?<eos> How's Anouk?<eos> Is she well?<eos> Oh, she's better.<eos> She's fine. Good. How are you?<eos> I'm throwing a party... If anyone shows up.<eos> Who's invited?<eos> A bunch of townspeople.<eos> Tell me something. Why do you give a damn about... what these narrow-minded villagers think?<eos> You're not scared of them, are you?
With it I measure the length and width of your face.<eos> If your eyes and mouth match the length, you're beautiful.<eos> OK?<eos> First the length...<eos> This convinence store for the quenching of desire this uncontrolled intersection of male and female this arena in which the sexes do battle in Japan they call it...<eos> GO-CON<eos> Ow!<eos> Oh, sorry!<eos> I'm late!<eos> Not them again!
Master wanted to visit you... so as to know Min-Min's family better<eos> Mr Jian, most people neglect spiritual disciplines<eos> So you missed Min-Min's signals<eos> Yang-Yang, don't run around naked!<eos> You should join us on the mountain<eos> A purified soul helps the gods to answer prayers<eos> Nothing would help your wife more<eos> Like everyone, my wife and I need help from others<eos> But maybe I'd anger the gods by making too many requests<eos> If I turn to them only for the big things I can't handle... my sincerity may impress them more
In no way do we feel lonely or offended.<eos> He feels no bitterness.<eos> - I see.<eos> He may have no feeling of bitterness, but we have.<eos> - I have?<eos> - No, neither of you, but we have.<eos> I remember very well the general silence when he was banished.<eos> - This is what they can't forgive.<eos> There are people who know well that they were silent, but they respect and love him for he spoke for them.<eos> But his fellow writers, the majority of them, can't forgive just that.
Look at the state of you!<eos> My darling, drunk fiancé...<eos> How will I cope with you?<eos> Like this.<eos> Keep it together.<eos> I'm not going to church.<eos> It 's the latest craze.<eos> All the bigshots go to church.<eos> They'll be jailing non-believers next!<eos> I wouldn't put it past them.
Those who were not already placed in foster homes were taken to temporary centers hastily set up in summer holiday camps like Dovercourt.<eos> They did try and keep us busy.<eos> The memorable part of this camp experience was that it was one of the coldest winters in history.<eos> We all went for breakfast to this big hall. The snow came in through the cracks.<eos> We had this curious food.<eos> We had kippers.<eos> What little Austrian-Jewish child has ever heard of kippers?<eos> Here was this salty, shoe leather on our plates and it had snow on it.<eos> It was interesting.<eos> While we were sitting around the stove always with our coats on and with our little gloves on groups of people would come to choose children to take away with them.
"Your letters come to us like sunshine.<eos> "It's our future that gives us big worries.<eos> "We yearn to get away from here.<eos> "That's our fondest wish.<eos> "It'll be a difficult task for you to bring us over there...<eos> "...but I have the feeling you'll manage it in time. "<eos> When I arrived in England I made it my priority to try and find homes for people because I felt people didn't know how desperate it was in Germany.<eos> My biggest problem was to try and get my parents out.<eos> That was difficult, because it was either finding them a job and bearing in mind my father's age or getting this £100 guarantee which was just nowhere to be seen.<eos> I proceeded to find large houses and knock at the door to find out whether I could get them a job.
Eventually, in 1947, they were ready for me.<eos> I didn't want to go, but the Cohens took me to Paris where I was to meet my parents.<eos> I remember standing outside the hotel.<eos> And I saw, in the distance, my parents approach.<eos> I couldn't look at them directly.<eos> So I looked at them their reflection in a shop window as they walked towards me.<eos> I felt a very, very strong emotion.<eos> It was a sense of elation and of love.<eos> I suddenly felt it and fought it.<eos> But I felt, you know, I knew it was them.
I'm Spinning round and round in games and mysteries.<eos> I'm an artist, you know.<eos> I've played parts in movies and TV shows.<eos> That's the first step to a big role in an important movie by a famous director.<eos> I have relationships with a lot of people who are going to help me out with my career.<eos> That's the way it's done.<eos> Friends give you a hand with your work.<eos> Friends?<eos> Yes.<eos> You go to bed with them like you go out to bars with them.
After we got that, it made it a lot simpler.<eos> Some 60 years ago, an anonymous German bureaucrat poked his finger on a map and decreed that here, in this French farmer's fields, would be the site of these big coastal batteries.<eos> They're still there today, silent yet ominous reminders of the way in which war intrudes itself on ordinary human life.<eos> And yet that life has an amazing stubbornness.<eos> The guns may thunder, but the fields must still be harvested.<eos> The geese have to cross the road, even if it's choked with military traffic.<eos> The ordinary skein of human life goes on, and our cameramen recorded that, too.<eos> [Hanks] The young liberators were bored, restless, coltish when they were off duty.<eos> These American airmen discovered these horses in a Norman pasture.<eos> One of them was an Oklahoma cowboy, who for a moment gracefully recaptured one of civilian life's lost pleasures.
There are none.<eos> We're the butterflies.<eos> A name's a name, the substance is what matters.<eos> Take off your clothes, kid.<eos> For protection.<eos> - From what?<eos> And that?<eos> I got a blast from a shotgun.<eos> So the amulets don't work!<eos> No, they do. Without them I'd have died.
That you don't accept anything and that you don't go with anyone.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> -Absolutely.<eos> We promise it daddy.<eos> -Sweet cuddly daddy.<eos> I gave them water this morning.<eos> They're probably still wet.<eos> That damned Sander...<eos> He doesn't give anything about his workers.<eos> He plays with them.
If I hadn't spoken, if I'd shut my mouth, if I hadn't said "Tie"... the bastard wouldn't have ruined our lives.<eos> Are you going to keep it all?<eos> What?<eos> You wouldn't kill for 30 million, but you would for 300 million.<eos> People kill for 15,000 pesetas.<eos> You needed the neighbors.<eos> You couldn't guard the old man by yourself.<eos> You planned this.<eos> - That's a lie.<eos> - Now you don't need them.
The same theory.<eos> That's why there's been only five cases reported of multiple personality disorders including Amamiya.<eos> In the field of cultural psychiatric medicine, it's been categorized as possession.<eos> So it's being possessed by Nishizono instead of being possessed by the fox spirit.<eos> Anyway, although the superficial phenomenon is hallucination the personality of Shinji Nishizono actually exists.<eos> It's not something a psychiatrist would want to admit but it's a fact that a personality translated into a program transfers itself.<eos> So, if the killers have Shinji Nishizono's personality transferred in them no matter how much profiling we do don't we end up with Nishizono after all?<eos> No.<eos> Nishizono's personality is merely a key that unlocks the will to kill within the barcode carriers.<eos> Nishizono's personality merges with them, but the actual murder is done according to the barcode carriers' own desires.
Won't you pay me for my last 2 loads?<eos> No way.<eos> The owner of the load should pay.<eos> You hired us. You've no right not to pay us.<eos> Yassin says hello and told me to ask you to pay him for the load.<eos> You want paying?<eos> We already told him... we couldn't give any money to the carriers.<eos> So, what am I supposed to do with these loads?<eos> That's not my problem.<eos> It's up to them to get paid.
I didn't mean to change the whole team<eos> But don't you think...well<eos> ..what I mean is..you know..<eos> ..it's their appearance<eos> ..I just wonder how... ..appropriate it is<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> You mean, the way they act like sissies on the court?<eos> Exactly<eos> What I'm concerned about is the big boys<eos> If just one of them makes a fuss... ..We'll all be in trouble won't we?
How delicious to wake in one's sleep and listen to the croaks of penguins mingling with the sea.<eos> To fall asleep and awaken again, and feel this is real.<eos> We have reached land.<eos> Land, such as it was, was a low silver of beach that offered no shelter.<eos> Two days later, Shackleton led the men to a second location on the western side of the island.<eos> The new campsite was called Cape Wild, after Frank Wild.<eos> To the sailors it was Cape Bloody Wild.<eos> The boats landed in sleet and rain.<eos> By night a gale blew up, ripping one of the tents to shreds and blowing equipment out to sea.<eos> Men crawled under the boats for shelter, and lay shivering in their tunics as the wind heaped snow upon them.
this is where it was torn!<eos> Ajersey isn't worth anything if you don't fight for it.<eos> You guys sweated in these jerseys.<eos> It's your smell.<eos> Your bodies and your souls have left these jerseys like this.<eos> Sure, they're worn out, but your souls are inside.<eos> It isn't the jerseys. They just make us look ridiculous.<eos> Ridiculous?<eos> These jerseys are our pride and joy.<eos> We'd die for them!
It stains my heart with tarry black and muffles any joyous sound within my soul.<eos> I am so tired, that open coffin I would seek to lie in, an unfeeling form.<eos> If I could just be with my dwarves I'd be at peace and you'd be rid of me.<eos> I plague you, and our face proclaims you wish me a thousand miles away.<eos> No, no!<eos> If I could just be at the dwarves'!<eos> How was it there?<eos> All still and blithe?<eos> Peace dwelt there silent as the snow.<eos> Were I with them, who were as kind as brothers to me;
I give actors a space to create, to express, very relaxed... with a lot of silence and concentration, and with a lot of contention. And I could give myself that... because the team was already trained for that when my turn came... to act in the movie.<eos> As a director Terese can really contain people... and an actor finds that soothing.<eos> You only have to worry... about your part, which in itself is quite a task... and demands a very special concentration.<eos> Her merit is that she soothes actors... and she achieves the necessary mood for one to work.<eos> The problem is that I miss Lola in my bed at night.<eos> I miss the warmth of her body next to mine, I miss her smell, I miss her...<eos> "Puma" is a great actor, you have to... with care, you can get anything out of him.<eos> He needs you to ask of him, he likes to be asked.<eos> He likes being demanded: " No, give me something else" And he likes it.<eos> When you see Teresa seeing her actors she is in them... and it is then that she stops worrying about herself and it's a marvelous woman
The whole place is going to explode in a minute.<eos> Explode?<eos> I'll destroy them.<eos> Good idea...<eos> An eye-witness told the police that he saw a white van on the scene of crime.<eos> The police closed off several roads hoping to locate this vehicle.<eos> Shit!<eos> Did you create these zombies?<eos> I never wanted to create a monster.<eos> Because of them, my friends are dead now.

Eun-Joo!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Didn't you lose this?<eos> Listen to this... "I love you..."<eos> "Hi, Eun-Joo.<eos> It's me, Sung-Hyun."<eos> - "I hope you received the recorder."<eos> - Hey, who's this?<eos> Thank you for the recorder.<eos> I'm sending you two gifts, but one of them may not get there because it's alive.
Monsters and humans sure are different<eos> Such a huge bolt, and he's still alive<eos> No big deal, it was just a small jolt!<eos> Why are you so impressed?<eos> What's more, he's a monster, what's to be afraid of?<eos> Yikes!<eos> I was scared to death!<eos> Wait for me!<eos> We've finally made it to the monsters' lair!<eos> Since the eruptions, people have begun fighting each other over nothing, killing is like a game to them!
Return him now! Let her keep the coward.<eos> We can't do that. He'll...<eos> Quiet!<eos> We're wasting time.<eos> This is my hunt now.<eos> If you go anywhere near the hologram ship, you can consider yourselves prey.<eos> They've gone to warp.<eos> We're not going to let them intimidate us, are we?<eos> I think you know me a little better than that.<eos> Harry, keep a sensor lock on them. Aye, Captain.
Nobody, nobody travels alone!<eos> Nobody travels alone!<eos> Twos and threes, twos and threes.Keep alert. They're on all sides!<eos> -Sweetheart!<eos> Are you still mad at me? No.<eos> But listen, things are just getting too complicated.I want you to come and live with me.<eos> -You can still visit all the time. Right? -Of course.<eos> But between visits, you need to take care of me --there are dragons in my neighborhood.<eos> -I just tried to give them something.-I know that, Marty.<eos> Who is going to take care of them now?
My personality is alienating?<eos> Yes, very much so.<eos> Listen, when I was growing up, I was always the odd man out.<eos> Never popular.<eos> And as a defense I well, I formed a shell so it became harder for anybody to hurt me.<eos> But it also became harder for me to let anybody in.<eos> So in a way, I was securing my own unpopular fate.<eos> Now, tomorrow on the stand I want your demeanor to be different.<eos> Your voice, it needs to be more relaxed.<eos> It's important that the jury relate to you as if you're just like them.
Even if I were fully functional, it would already be too late.<eos> They're gone.<eos> There was nothing you could have done.<eos> You keep saying that.<eos> You said it about the fall of the Commonwealth, you said it about that girl dying, and now this!<eos> But I don't buy it.<eos> Dylan.<eos> Scan the ship.<eos> Lock onto the intruders.<eos> I want to know how many of them are left.
Tagged along?<eos> Do better.<eos> I sold them some stuff.<eos> You ran guns for them, didn't you.<eos> You ran guns for the Restors.<eos> Do you have any idea who you're dealing with?<eos> These people are fanatics!<eos> - Oh, Beka, you don't understand.<eos> - Don't understand, my ass!<eos> You're still one of them, aren't you?
Hailing frequency.<eos> Yo, Rafe, can you hear me?<eos> Me and everyone else in the system, Booster Rocket.<eos> Don't call me that, lying, two-faced backstabber.<eos> Oooo...<eos> now you're just being mean.<eos> You want mean?<eos> Mean is eating my food, sleeping in my bed, and working for the Restors the entire time.<eos> Mean is stealing Andromeda's command codes and giving them to people who want to destroy her.<eos> - It was either them or me.
No, but they sounded like footsteps coming from the kitchen.<eos> And that's when you hid in the closet?<eos> Does your family normally keep the doors locked at night?<eos> I don't know.<eos> My dad checks the house at night.<eos> It's always been a safe neighborhood.<eos> Tina... Do you... go out with anyone special?<eos> I hook up with different guys.<eos> No one special.<eos> Are any of them... called Buffalo?
Keeps us centred, focused.<eos> The apple holds a pentacle in its heart.<eos> Add a laurel leaf, you will block the path of evil.<eos> - A simple laurel leaf?<eos> - Simple, but powerful.<eos> Remember, there is magic all around you.<eos> Especially on this night.<eos> What's with the masks?<eos> Demons walk freely on All Hallows Eve.<eos> So a mask allows you to hide your identity, walk amongst them.
I'm gonna run a series of tests on all three of you. Even DNA sampling.<eos> Maybe it's a genetic marker, I don't know.<eos> But I'm gonna find out. And you're not gonna leave until I do.<eos> Wow, his bedside manner sure could use some work.<eos> Six people?<eos> How is that possible?<eos> When we did the spell, we must have awakened everything in the room, including the disease.<eos> Is there anything different about our blood because we're witches?<eos> I don't know, but our first priority is to figure out how to save these people.<eos> Yeah, but even if we can find a spell to save them, how do we prevent it from spreading to other people?
- Sure I do. I scare everybody.<eos> For good reason.<eos> By the way, your essence isn't the only one I sense here.<eos> You bedded a witch.<eos> And not just any witch, one of the Charmed Ones.<eos> My offer is simple.<eos> Your life in exchange for theirs.<eos> Screw you, Litvack.<eos> You can't hide from me.<eos> I can keep sending demons after you for eternity, till one of them finally gets you.
Okay, Piper, honey, just listen to me, okay?<eos> We think that Kate's in trouble.<eos> Our kind of trouble.<eos> Okay, well I don't.<eos> And after what they did to Leo, I'm not really all that motivated to go dig up demons for them.<eos> - Trolls.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> Look, you guys can do whatever you want, but I've had it, and I'm done.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - That means that the powers that be haven't done anything but ruin my life, so therefore I'm not gonna do anything for them anymore, okay?
Can you do me a favor?<eos> This afternoon, come by the house... and apologize to my parents.<eos> It's for me, they're here for another week.<eos> My dad wants me to drop you as a client!<eos> He keeps telling me every day, "Drop him as a client!"<eos> Because of one stupid little joke I made in the car?<eos> -One stupid, little thing.<eos> -Because of the gay Jew cousin?<eos> They're very sensitive about it... of the gay Jew cousin.<eos> I gotta go meet them for lunch.
I'd like to say excuse my kids, but there's no excuse.<eos> I grew up with three brothers.<eos> Peter tells me you're from Indianapolis.<eos> - Your family still live there?<eos> - They do.<eos> Could you go shut them up, please?<eos> - Don't ask her a million questions.<eos> - Go, go!<eos> So... Any of your brothers become doctors too?<eos> A couple of them work for my dad.
It's not me.<eos> Speed, where is that java?<eos> I finish the code on the interface.<eos> Hey, have we met?<eos> Yeah, I am surprised that you remember, you must meet hundreds of people.<eos> Oh thanks.<eos> Yeah of course I remember, you came up to my office.<eos> You were working on an enviro-shield.<eos> It does still have a few glitches if I recall.<eos> Well, I've managed to resolve, most of them.
Now you listen to me Kincaid.<eos> We'd orders for years to search and destroy resistance.<eos> We've got new orders now.<eos> We'll follow them too.<eos> Yeah, I'm just thinking out loud.<eos> There's a lot of pro-taelon militia out there, you think about them.<eos> As for my troops.<eos> Let me tell you this: Volunteers are trained to come home.<eos> Those men were on a suicide mission.<eos> Each one of them who was equiped with a plasma flying unit.
All right.<eos> Look, you were probably just going on instinct.<eos> But you really screwed things up for me.<eos> I got famous 'cause of you.<eos> Not the good kind of famous.<eos> The kind of famous where people point at your butt and laugh.<eos> I was in the hospital.<eos> That's right.<eos> I had to sit on a special pillow.<eos> I don't know where your parents are right now, but how would you like to have to go and live with them for awhile?
So you're stuck with Debra's parents for the whole weekend?<eos> We hardly get to see them. So when they come to town, we want to spend as much time as possible with them.
Pants, Dad! Pants pants.<eos> You want them up or down?<eos> What kind of party is this?<eos> You can never complain about my parents again, ever. I mean it.<eos> - Okay, well, this is all of it.<eos> - Did you get that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh my goodness.<eos> How long are your relatives staying, dear?<eos> Well, we hardly get to see them. When they come to town, we want to spend as much time as possible with them.
All races living together in harmony and love.<eos> Pancakes!<eos> He must still be working the junk out of his system.<eos> He needs hugs!<eos> Doorbell!<eos> We're from the One World, One People Book-of-the-Month Club.<eos> Is there something missing in your life?<eos> You know, I just bet there is.<eos> Sarah, we have guests!<eos> And one of them is a homosexual!
May the Goddess recite your name on the whispers of the wind.<eos> Ahmet.<eos> Amen.<eos> D'Argo, give me your knife.<eos> Give me... your knife.<eos> Aeryn, forgive me.<eos> I love you.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Are you sure you don't want your friends here?<eos> No, I don't want them here.
Time count till our weapon can fire.<eos> Three arns.<eos> By the goddess, we mean you no harm.<eos> Let me take you aboard Moya.<eos> I'll prove to you that we have no weapons.<eos> You'll return to your ship when it is corpse.<eos> Thank you, Chiana.<eos> D'Argo, close your eyes.<eos> Now, listen. Listen through all the sounds in your head.<eos> Beyond them, there's a high pitched sound very faint.
I know what to say to a woman. Oh, wow.<eos> She's... talking to vicki.<eos> How do you like it?<eos> It's great. I've met some really nice people.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> The minute she starts getting with that crowd, We'll never see her again.<eos> You think she'll hang out with us After hanging out with all those jocks and cheerleaders?<eos> Why wouldn't she?<eos> Because they're pod people. It's like invasion of the body snatchers.<eos> They'll make her one of them.
That's all right. We don't need you.<eos> I'm over it already.<eos> Yeah, and I don't even give a tiny rat's ass.<eos> Yeah, we're gonna go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Pheebs, you were right about her.<eos> You know, she did try to use sex as a weapon.<eos> Yeah, I hurt my back a little.<eos> You know, he hums while he does other stuff too.<eos> We're better off without them.
Must be all that good air in Hartford.<eos> Mom, Dad, can I get you a drink?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - You're gonna need one.<eos> I have wine glasses that say "Holiday Inn" on them.<eos> - Stoli on the rocks with a twist.<eos> - Right.<eos> - My parents are here.<eos> - No.<eos> I've cursed in front of them twice, Miss Patty tried to hit on my dad... and I'm sure Mom's gonna call Child Protective Services.
What about static electricity igniting the propellant or a misfire where the breech is prematurely opened?<eos> We couldn't duplicate those in the lab.<eos> But are they possible?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess.<eos> I want to thank you both.<eos> I don't think that there's a military academy in the country that can duplicate the experience that you're giving my cadets.<eos> Actually, commander, we're enjoying it.<eos> It's a relief to try a case where the verdict doesn't matter.<eos> Oh, it matters to them.
They know who we have onboard.<eos> It doesn't matter to them.<eos> Then you're all going to die.<eos> - What were you gonna do?<eos> - Do about what?<eos> When Solla had the gun on Renee, who were you gonna protect, her or me?<eos> Well, you stepped forward, Mac.<eos> I guess we'll never know.<eos> All passengers except these will move to the lower cabin.<eos> - What are you doing with them?
My boyfriend doesn't like me working here.<eos> Not that he's jealous. I tell him, "You should see the state of 'em!"<eos> - Just thinks it's depressing for me.<eos> - Did you meet him through an agency?<eos> God, no!<eos> I shall tell him that tonight in bed!<eos> He'll laugh!<eos> No, we met at a friend's party.<eos> You meet people through people.<eos> A lot of them haven't got friends!
I had dinner last night with Preston's parents.<eos> It's been awhile since I'd seen them.<eos> Anyway, I mentioned your interaction program.<eos> Really?<eos> How'd they react?<eos> Patricia seemed more intrigued by the idea than Lars.<eos> Would you like me to call them?<eos> Nope. I convinced them to participate.<eos> You?<eos> I always had a really good relationship with them even though Preston married outside of his religion, outside his tribe.
- Because you're a junkie. - I'm not a junkie anymore, Huey.<eos> I don't want him seeing' me in here like this.<eos> Have an attitude of gratitude, Jill, hmm?<eos> You're blessed.<eos> Your son is going to get to see you again, clean and alive.<eos> What Huey is saying is that... you need to accept the fact that you have a problem.<eos> I know I have a problem, Dr. Earl.<eos> I lost my son.<eos> Section "A,"page 22 had five obituaries.<eos> So I ran the names through the database, and one of them... a guy named David Arnold, used to work here.
We're back live on KROZ from the strangest blind date I've ever been on.<eos> As I enter the club with Liz Parker, her dream man, Doug Shellow... and not one but two of her ex-boyfriends.<eos> - Lyle...<eos> And Max. - Kyle.<eos> I can't control them.<eos> You guys have got to help me. Please?<eos> I think you'd look better as a blond.<eos> Um, you know I think I just better get him home.<eos> You're not gonna get off so easy. I mean, look at these guys.<eos> You got 'em hanging on by a string, and I think you owe it to them... and the KROZ listeners, to choose your valentine here and now.
I take this form because it will be familiar to you... and it will help you to understand what I am about to say.<eos> You have lived before.<eos> You perished in the conflict that enslaves our planet... but your essence was duplicated, cloned... and mixed with human genetic materials... so that you might be recreated into human beings.<eos> My son... you were the beloved leader of our people.<eos> I have sent with you your young bride.<eos> My daughter, the man you were betrothed to... and your brother's second-in-command.<eos> Oh, my God, Max.<eos> Our mother.<eos> Our enemies have come to the Earth.<eos> You will know them only by the evil within.
In my language, the word is Nasedo, so that's what I called him.<eos> It's a map.<eos> I hate the start of a cold... that little tickle that tells you something's about to happen... that you know you can't prevent.<eos> Something that could be mild if you did all the right things... or could knock you off your feet if you're not careful.<eos> You're late.<eos> Liz, today is the first day of the rest of our lives.<eos> - Spending time with your mother again?<eos> - No, I mean it. Aren't you tired of being a slave to men?<eos> - Definitely your mom.<eos> - Tired of spending... every waking moment pining over them... just for us to get our hearts crushed in the end?
Open the door! Police!<eos> Valenti.<eos> I figured you'd have to come over here and give me grief about leaving the knife out there.<eos> Man, what's the big deal?<eos> Mr. Guerin, you're under arrest.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> You have a right to an attorney.<eos> If you can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you by the court.<eos> You can never find those little pod people when you want them.
You do have them, don't you?<eos> - We can do easy things... like change simple molecular structure, but we don't use them very often.<eos> - What about you?<eos> - Being around Nasedo has taught me quite a few things. Wait.<eos> What about that dream thing that you can do?<eos> - What dream thing?<eos> - I can go into people's heads when they're sleeping.<eos> - And you can all do that? - No.<eos> Just Isabel.<eos> - And you can communicate with them?
- Yes, you can.<eos> You're sexy.<eos> He should see you.<eos> You're something to see.<eos> The next night, I realised how many desperate New York women there were.<eos> I'm flattered that so many of you showed up to hear me talk.<eos> The fact is, I have had a lot of experience with men.<eos> Some of it good, some of it bad, some of it very ugly.<eos> There are two million single men in this city.<eos> I have dated about a million of them.
Yes, I thought you looked familiar.<eos> - Do you ever think about writing comics?<eos> - Aren't they a boy thing?<eos> No way.<eos> There are woman superheroes - Batgirl, Supergirl, Black Canary...<eos> You've heard of Wonder Woman.<eos> With the bracelets and the tiara.<eos> I used to love that even her accessories had super-powers.<eos> What's wrong with them?<eos> To them, you are Wonder Woman.
The kid's not turning tricks for nothin'.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I could never support the black arts.<eos> - Black arts?<eos> Yeah, you know: Magic, fortune telling, Oriental cooking.<eos> Hey, you guys!<eos> You're in our spot. What?<eos> Oh, okay, we'll move.<eos> We don't want any trouble, fellas.<eos> Dad, only one of them is real.
By giving him the benefit of my own experiences, encouraging him to be resilient in the face of obstacles.<eos> Sounds like a good strategy.<eos> is your alcove malfunctioning?<eos> I'm calculating neutrino trajectories.<eos> You need to regenerate.<eos> Very well.<eos> Wait.<eos> We've located your parents.<eos> Voyager is due to arrive at their planet tomorrow.<eos> Do I have to stay with them?
is your alcove malfunctioning?<eos> I'm calculating neutrino trajectories.<eos> You need to regenerate.<eos> Very well.<eos> Wait.<eos> We've located your parents.<eos> Voyager is due to arrive at their planet tomorrow.<eos> Do I have to stay with them?<eos> They're your parents.<eos> I don't remember them.
I can help you, but first you must release the hostages.<eos> That wasn't the agreement.<eos> I've modified the agreement.<eos> I didn't realize I'd be dealing with children. Your behavior is erratic.<eos> I can't be certain that you...<eos> No modifications.<eos> We show you the hostages; you give us the deflector.<eos> Comply.<eos> Comply.<eos> Take me to them.
What else did you learn?<eos> You were assimilated as a juvenile, like us.<eos> My parents were scientists studying the Borg.<eos> They took me with them.<eos> My childhood was short.<eos> Childhood?<eos> The years between birth and physical maturity, when humanoids adapt to their roles as individuals.<eos> Perhaps you have memory of yours. I don't know.<eos> What about your parents?<eos> Do you remember them?
Take it easy! We'll decontaminate you when we get back home.<eos> If I ever volunteer for a two-week away mission again, would somebody please confine me to Sick Bay?<eos> Too much togetherness for you, Harry?<eos> Nothing personal, Commander.<eos> To tell you the truth, I've enjoyed our little junket together.<eos> It's given the four of us a chance to bond.<eos> The bonding stopped when the sonic shower went off-line.<eos> That's all part of the experience, the adventure.<eos> Think of the great explorers that came before us. They survived without creature comforts.<eos> I wouldn't want to bunk with them, either.
Get me the plate, and then I'll tell you.<eos> Everyone's asleep. I'll do it in the morning.<eos> The Vulcans?<eos> Maybe I've miscounted, but... I don't think you've slept in ten days?<eos> Your count is accurate.<eos> Don't you think you should go to bed?<eos> As a Vulcan, I can function without sleep for more than two weeks.<eos> But there's a point of diminishing returns when your mind starts to play tricks on you.<eos> My mind, Mr. Neelix, does not play tricks.<eos> The ship is lonely without them, isn't it?
They're all probably up at Castle O'Dell, conspiring against us.<eos> Now... that's enough.<eos> I can't deny there's been some unusual goings-on.<eos> But what are you proposing-- that we run Katie and her friends out of town?<eos> Or maybe we should line them up in front of a firing squad-- is that what you want?<eos> These people have been our neighbors. We've become friends.<eos> Let's not forget that.<eos> Well, we can't just sit here and do nothing while they take over Fair Haven.<eos> I'm not saying we do nothing... but let's go about this like civilized people.<eos> What do you suggest-- we sit them down and discuss it over tea?
That would be my job.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to announce that you are all under arrest for high crimes against the United States and its allies.<eos> - You really blew it, O'Neill.<eos> - Oh, I think it came off quite nicely. - Don't you, General?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> You have no idea how high up this goes. You've pissed off the wrong people.<eos> Like the Tollan, Tok'ra, Asgard, Nox... Those folks?<eos> They refuse to give us what we need to defend ourselves against the Goa'uld.<eos> We don't need their stuff, Makepeace.<eos> We do need them.
Hang on a second.<eos> The race who created you and put these things in our brains. They're gonna want the information you're collecting.<eos> - I suppose.<eos> - So how do they get it?<eos> - You don't wanna know.<eos> - Let's say I do.<eos> You will never have to find out.<eos> Aren't you programmed?<eos> I mean, how can you defy your creators?<eos> Because they're evil, scary evil, and we don't want anything to do with them.
SULLY: All right. We got it.<eos> Just relax.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Breathe.<eos> COP: whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> You're gonna need to keep clear.<eos> One of the bastards got away, don't know where he is.<eos> - They need treatment.<eos> You just worry about those wounded cops and forget about everybody else.<eos> There's nothing you could do for them now anyway.
CARLOS:<eos> Here it is. - Yeah, well, that kid shot cops.<eos> - They shot him.<eos> - It's not an even-steven game.<eos> DOC: Kim, you were there.<eos> You know they went in shooting first and asked questions later.<eos> Yeah, I was there.<eos> Outside, where you were.<eos> Look, Doc, I'm the first person to say the cops need to be pushed back now and then.<eos> But we need to Work with them every day.
Here it is. - Yeah, well, that kid shot cops.<eos> - They shot him.<eos> - It's not an even-steven game.<eos> DOC: Kim, you were there.<eos> You know they went in shooting first and asked questions later.<eos> Yeah, I was there.<eos> Outside, where you were.<eos> Look, Doc, I'm the first person to say the cops need to be pushed back now and then.<eos> But we need to Work with them every day.<eos> And like it or not, we need them.
He has the flu.<eos> You wouldn't have come back for that.<eos> He fainted.<eos> He was running a fever.<eos> He has multiple sclerosis.<eos> A fever could be life-threatening.<eos> Mrs. Green, there are things you must never say to Chief Bennett.<eos> He's married to someone else, and so are you.<eos> Don't any of these characters have jobs?<eos> I don't know. I think one of them is a surgeon.
All in, showroom floor to your garage, $1 8 million.<eos> -1 8 million is a cheap price, isn't it?<eos> -Yes, it is.<eos> What you're happy about isn't the price. It's the structure of the deal.<eos> -Well, how do you figure that?<eos> -Sam's gonna tell you about it.<eos> Sam.<eos> -Structure versus cost. -Yeah.<eos> What Jack means is that if you were getting the tankers for $1.85 in trading stamps, it'd still be a bad deal... -...if we didn't limit your liability. -And did you?<eos> We did, by creating a separate corporation for each one of them...
-Good evening, Nancy, Leo.<eos> -Jack.<eos> -T en-hut.<eos> No, as you were.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Bobby, can you report on domestic activity?<eos> Yes, sir. There's not much. Air traffic control down for 22 minutes at Logan.<eos> Citibank computers were off-line for a little more than an hour and the lights went out for seven minutes at the Delta Center.<eos> Somebody tell me. These shooters didn't have a wallet, driver's license?<eos> They didn't have anything on them.
During the Newark riots, you could hear the looters shouting:<eos> "That was my 40 acres. I'll be back for the mule! "<eos> - Catchy.<eos> - If you guys had paid up on time.<eos> A lesson well learned.<eos> Let's talk about your confirmation.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And while we're on the subject of the Civil War let's remember the 600,000 whites who died over the issue of slavery.<eos> - Is that why they died?<eos> - It's why a lot of them died.
- You said to chime in.<eos> - Yes. but by "chime"<eos> I did not mean "The Bell of Saint Mary."<eos> Listen--<eos> - No. then-- then you bend over in front of Lawrence Weber. a grandfather of four and a large contributor to the Republican National Committee. and ask him to squeeze your happy heinie!<eos> Hey. I got a vibe from him. but that's a whole 'nother story.<eos> And to top it all off. you produce... this-- this sad. obscene thing.<eos> this... butt puppet.<eos> Buttford happens to be our spokes-puppet.<eos> You stole Grace's pantyhose. drew a face on them. and then addressed people with it.
- Are you a doctor?<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> Thank you for helping me.<eos> I'm not sure if I've actually done anything.<eos> In fact, I don't even know... I don't even know what's going on with you right now.<eos> Do you know what your name is?<eos> You don't remember, do you?<eos> How about how you got here?<eos> What about these people who have taken you in?<eos> Do you know anything about them?
Listen... What you're doing here is wrong.<eos> This has been our way for generations.<eos> Who are you to tell us any different?<eos> -You're not even an amazon.<eos> -It's wrong and you don't have to take my word for it.<eos> The sacred dagger of the Atmah...<eos> If you won't listen to me, isten to your ancestors.<eos> Let Yakut reveal the truth Samsara hid!<eos> What did I say?<eos> I think it was them!
So what did you want, Ray?<eos> - What did I want? - Mm-hmm.<eos> What did I want?<eos> I know what he wants!<eos> Walnuts in the brownies.<eos> Not now, Mom.<eos> I-- okay, yeah.<eos> All right, here's what I want.<eos> The guys are thinking of going to Myrtle Beach for a weekend for golf.<eos> And I was thinking I wanna go with them.
Promise me you'II never show your 'light-play' to anyone.<eos> Why?<eos> You OK?<eos> Yes!<eos> How's Dr Fritz?<eos> Sir!<eos> He died at 1802 hours, sir!<eos> He was a genius!<eos> Your orders were to take him alive!<eos> Was there a boy with them?
It smells of human flesh.<eos> It's a bitter smell.<eos> I don't know if I like it.<eos> It was an irresponsible act.<eos> I offer you my apologies.<eos> What would you say to my oil wells?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I don't want the Americans after me.<eos> And my palaces?<eos> One of them, a jewel of Islamic architecture, has a harem with one hundred concubines...
Is it my eyes or have your tits grown as well?<eos> They're the same.<eos> It must because because of the blouse.<eos> Could you just show me one?<eos> I've been on bread and oranges...<eos> In front of the guard?<eos> Pretend you've got an itch, undo three buttons and he won't notice a thing.<eos> They're small...<eos> They're the only ones.<eos> There is so much beauty in them that if you don't put them away quickly I'll have a fit.
Me?<eos> I came from Heaven.<eos> Now let's start walkin'.<eos> Walk? Fuck you!<eos> Do you know how far we are from anywheres?<eos> Hey, man, back in the old days with JC, we used to walk everywhere.<eos> Did you ever hear of a fat apostle?<eos> What the hell's an apostle?<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> She's already met the prophets... and the apostle's with them?
Elsa, darling, is not the moment.<eos> Shall we go, please?<eos> Luca, I have to go, but I love you.<eos> Good-bye!<eos> - Why are you hurrying me so much?<eos> - I tell you later.<eos> This is Vittorio Fanfani.<eos> He is a good lawyer and a good friend.<eos> You know lawyers.<eos> Better to be friends with them.
So sorry.<eos> I ain't thrilled with the level of service up to this point.<eos> hat was my fault.<eos> I apologize.<eos> Why don't we start over?<eos> Why don't you just tell me about your friend?<eos> his friend, you know, he's a very powerful guy.<eos> Never had trouble with nothing.<eos> All of a sudden, he's falling apart he cries for no reason, he can't sleep he can't be with his friends.<eos> All of a sudden, he gets nervous around them.
- You're three hours early.<eos> - It's an amazing opportunity. - Amazing.<eos> - I have a class in here in 1 5 minutes, you know.<eos> Oh, well, you're gonna want to hear this, Ben.<eos> Tell me.<eos> He killed two Rwandan park rangers and injured three others... with a wooden club.<eos> - He was studying the animals there, right ? - Not any more.<eos> The party of foresters and rangers said he walked among them-- part of the animal group.<eos> It's just possible, Ben, that he was living with the mountain gorillas... for nearly two years.<eos> With them.
Why ?<eos> They have to work out their own problems. He won't kill him.<eos> Oh, this is Phillip !<eos> Somebody help me, please ! Get him off me !<eos> - Hey, calm down !<eos> Dr Theo Caulder, continuing interview with Dr Ethan Powell.<eos> I've further reduced your Haldol.<eos> Have you felt the effects of that ?<eos> Yeah. Thank you.<eos> In our last session, we discovered why you left your normal routine of study... and began to travel with the gorillas, staying with them even at night.
I lived as humans lived 1 0,000 years ago.<eos> Humans knew how to live in the world then, before--<eos> Before civilization ?<eos> No, before you, Juha, and all your kind.<eos> Takers.<eos> Yeah, I was one of you.<eos> I believed in control.<eos> - Some control is necessary.<eos> - Is it ?<eos> The gorillas, they let you stay with them, even at night.
Watch your step.<eos> The gorillas are in the cage room now.<eos> [ Woman ] The old silverback's been with us the longest.<eos> You remember him, Dr Powell. He's the one you--<eos> I'm sorry. We need to be alone in here.<eos> The restraints ?<eos> I'll put them back on him before we leave.<eos> You understand if he comes out of that door without them on--<eos> I thought you'd feel safer here.<eos> I thought if you were around them, you'd talk to me.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!<eos> Nice shooting, Maniac.<eos> Buy one, get one free.<eos> OK, we've cleared a path for the bombers.<eos> Let's get back to the action.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Steady on course, Mr. Knight.<eos> The flak's too heavy.<eos> Let's launch now.<eos> Wait for them to launch a torpedo.
I wasn't gonna say it.<eos> Yeah, but you'd have tinkered with it till it went away, right?<eos> You know what this means to us.<eos> I know. I know the whole speech. Good.<eos> Then, I won't have to make it.<eos> Now the guy's hooked, you've got your second chance.<eos> By the way, we all deserve a second chance.<eos> Now, see these two trees? It's time to give them a second chance.<eos> They'll stay.<eos> We'll design everything around them.
-That's what I hear.<eos> I guess we're not in Kansas anymore, Toto.<eos> Hannah?<eos> Grant! -Be careful of his hand! -I got two hands!<eos> It's been a long time since I've seen him just being a kid.<eos> Sometimes, he...<eos> You know, since his mother...<eos> He has a tough time making friends sometimes.<eos> Michael, we all need friends.<eos> Life just isn't the same without them.
Loved it when you busted into "Viva Las Vegas."<eos> You insignificant little fuck!<eos> I always get my money, you cocksucking bastardo!<eos> The '90s are killing me.<eos> I shouldn't have done that.<eos> You're not supposed to tell a guy you're gonna kill him no more.<eos> I gotta tiptoe through the tulips with these assholes.<eos> Taking all the fun out of the job.<eos> Pappa Joe, you want me to go now?<eos> All the boys tell me how you make them laugh when you come around.
And now that we know who you are, we'll need to speak to you, Colonel.<eos> I just have a... I have a meeting...<eos> Something tells me, we can file Colonel Moore under "last to know".<eos> Are you married?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Right...<eos> Well, she wasn't a hypochondriac, she didn't dye her hair, she didn't have oily skin. And she keeps her method of birth control somewhere else.<eos> Or perhaps she required her men to wear condoms.<eos> Maybe you've heard that condoms are in fashion again because of disease?<eos> Nowadays you have to boil people before you can sleep with them.
I have no need to explain that to you.<eos> Come on, cop to cop.<eos> Cop to cop, let's just leave it at personal reasons.<eos> Doesn't have anything to do with your father, does it?<eos> You keep charging at walls.<eos> Stubbornness is something we both share.<eos> They say we come into this world with a preordained destiny.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Neither of my parents had more than an eighth-grade education.<eos> Never read more than one book between them, not one.
Okay, what about Houston and Greenwich?<eos> 1 898.<eos> And Hudson and 1 55th was closed in 1 906.<eos> 1 906, 1 898--<eos> All right, let's.... 1 898.<eos> Houston and Greenwich.<eos> Call Emergency Services and tell them to meet us at Houston and Greenwich.<eos> Solomon, you get on to Hanson.<eos> He'll need about 20 guys.<eos> You go with them.
Is that bad?<eos> Well no, but...<eos> Are you happy at home?<eos> Yes... very.<eos> Everything's fine with your mother?<eos> Yes, she's... wonderful.<eos> You sister Catherine is still your best friend?<eos> My sister's just... She's wonderful!<eos> And your other friends?<eos> You don't like playing with them?
Well no, but...<eos> Are you happy at home?<eos> Yes... very.<eos> Everything's fine with your mother?<eos> Yes, she's... wonderful.<eos> You sister Catherine is still your best friend?<eos> My sister's just... She's wonderful!<eos> And your other friends?<eos> You don't like playing with them?<eos> I play with them.
Well, what do we do now?<eos> How's he doing?<eos> He might make it.<eos> He might not.<eos> Sheila's over at the hospital.<eos> I'm gonna head over.<eos> Frank, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, because, I think I know why Adam shot himself.<eos> I gotta call the police about it.<eos> And I don't want you to hear it from them, and I don't want Sheila to read about it in the paper.
She's got somebody's hair in her hand.<eos> They're gonna be able to tell whose it is.<eos> we gotta call the cops.<eos> What were we supposed to do?<eos> It was an accident.<eos> The kids come to us.<eos> She's already dead.<eos> The damage is done.<eos> There's nothing anybody can do to bring her back.<eos> But these kids got everything ahead of them.
Shall we get some ofthese?<eos> And how did His Majesty fare amongst all your countrymen?<eos> He was charming.<eos> Absolutely charming.<eos> I don't think I'll ever forget how he stood there, holding his hand out as if I was...<eos> One of his 26 wives?<eos> Well, thank you, Beebe.<eos> I hadn't thought of it in that way.<eos> Well, perhaps you should.<eos> We have been searching for our Burmese killers here, here, and here, except no one has seen them for weeks.
Admit it.<eos> I'm not funny.<eos> I laugh, but I don't even get the jokes.<eos> And you just chase women.<eos> That's not funny. It's pathetic.<eos> What great vibes!<eos> I'm not being negative.<eos> Look at these people.<eos> Their lives are boring.<eos> And though it's hard to admit, we're just like them.
That's what it is.<eos> Attention shoppers.<eos> I got a letter from my father today.<eos> The same father who told you to drop dead?<eos> That father?<eos> Yes...no, well, what I mean is his lawyer wrote me.<eos> And he says my parents are going to buy me a condo.<eos> So that after the surgery I'll have someplace to go... to recuperate...<eos> to have some sense of security.<eos> I mean, wow, not a word from them since I told them.
I have a crush.<eos> It was the first time I really felt something for a guy.<eos> And it just... it really proved to me the treatment's working.<eos> Oh, Graham.<eos> Now, let this show you what determination has yielded.<eos> Fruit.<eos> Now I want you all to look at Graham's strength, and how she worked her way through this five-step program.<eos> And by the way, I am very disappointed in the rest of you.<eos> And I have scheduled a meeting with each of your parents.<eos> If you can't listen to me, then perhaps you'll listen to them.
It's true !<eos> Take it, it's for all of you... a gift from the lord of this fief.<eos> He's an absolutely excellent lord.<eos> What are waiting for ?<eos> Well, the three masters of de city dojo should come but they haven't arrived yet...<eos> Are they the only combattants ?<eos> No.<eos> Two men of our fief are also ready.<eos> Moron !<eos> Why not start with them ?
It is pouring with rain.<eos> Can't even light a fire.<eos> Show us what the stick is for.<eos> We've got our very own leaning post.<eos> If it smells of farts too much in the night...<eos> Okay, so I can't have a cigarette in the tent, but he can fart as much as he wants?<eos> No, I never gave Mike a fart allowance.<eos> You heard noises last night? - I did.<eos> - Problem is, I sleep like a log.<eos> There were two separate noises one of them could have been an owl but the other was a cackling.
Excuse me.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Don't forget I can't come on Thursday.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> - I won't forget.<eos> I wanted to say...<eos> I liked what you said.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I got carried away.<eos> We don't know people better by sleeping with them.
You can't believe your ears.<eos> You send for everything that had been most forbidden.<eos> That's why there is something... rather indecent... about the unbelievable frivoIity of the dying.<eos> Dictating is too tiring.<eos> I'II try to write.<eos> You may...<eos> You may bring me a little hot milk, but only if it makes you happy.<eos> You know, celeste, if I get through the night, tomorrow<eos> I'II show the doctors<eos> I'm more than a match for them.
shall I tell you what she is? A pig!<eos> morel.<eos> Do you know what I heard about Mrs. de ForcheviIIe?<eos> She's like a rose that's been pickled.<eos> - It fits her.<eos> - Champagne?<eos> We have the same idiom.<eos> You obviously don't like her, but if I understand correctly, you're related.<eos> vaguely... on my husband's side, but very distantly.<eos> Strange, how our relatives are close or distant, depending on our interest in them.
Give me some Everest.<eos> I started something like this in the aftermath of the Spanish conquest of Peru.<eos> There was a lot of infighting.<eos> They formed parties, and there was this unbelievable amount of greed among the Spanish.<eos> And there was on one side, Pizzaro and his brothers...<eos> And on the other side, there was Almagro...<eos> And he was one of the principal leaders, and boy, the guy really looked so ugly, they sent a delegation to the Spanish king and Almagro looked so gross and ugly, they couldn't even send him out there.<eos> And there's this wonderful story about this old Spanish nobleman who was well into his 70s, who's been involved in campaigns back in Europe, and then the conquest of Mexico, conquest of Peru.<eos> He was white-haired, and in all this fighting, he was on one side,<eos> I think sticking to Pizzaro's side, and all of a sudden he rides into an ambush of his enemies, and he rides on his horse and they point their muskets at him and they were just about to shoot him... and he knows he's gonna be dead in a minute... and he just defiantly sings a song against them.
Good thing we took out some insurance on all this.<eos> Henmi...<eos> What if that man's a Wolf?<eos> I'll shoot him. Before he has a chance to tear out my throat.<eos> I'm nothing like him at all.<eos> The fugitives are a male and a female. They are armed.<eos> Shoot on sight. Repeat.<eos> Aren't you going to run?<eos> sir.<eos> Still checking vehicles. No sign of them yet.
- I saw him the other day on a match making show.<eos> - On TV?<eos> It seems he's dating contestant number two.<eos> - You're kidding.<eos> - Maybe they'II end up getting married.<eos> They went out 3 times already, and everything's going smoothly.<eos> - We should get his number and call him.<eos> - Let's call the TV station.<eos> Two old high school classmates saw me on TV and called me.<eos> - I almost didn't remember them.
No, I've already told you.<eos> It's only a control check.<eos> You have 15 minutes to make her talk.<eos> Come to my office when you're finished.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Stay put!<eos> If you talk you're saved.<eos> Tell me where you were going to meet your friends.<eos> If I bring here one of them, you're saved.
Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sheng, come over here<eos> Together<eos> No, not for me<eos> One, two, three<eos> The first time I had my picture taken was at this salon<eos> I refused to be photographed<eos> I feared when the camera flashed my soul would leave my body<eos> But your parents insisted that I join them
There's no point talking to you.<eos> Go home.<eos> Go home, I said!<eos> I'm here because I want to be.<eos> It's an order then.<eos> Go!<eos> - I won't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Don't dogs obey their masters?<eos> Dogs obey their owners because they want to stay close to them.
Watch out.<eos> What do you know about that thing that's after us?<eos> It's some kind of demon.<eos> Before tonight I didn't believe it. I thought it was just something that they made up to scare the little kids.<eos> But when the sun went down, my grandpa fetched the whole family together.<eos> And he told us that some outsider folks had done something real bad.<eos> He wouldn't say what.<eos> He just said that Pumpkinhead was gonna be out after them, and that we better stay inside till he got them.<eos> - Pumpkinhead?<eos> - That's what it's called, 'cause it comes from the old pumpkin patch graveyard.
I think you'd better go.<eos> I can't.<eos> They're looking for me.<eos> Young men with guns who call themselves the Resistance.<eos> - Why?<eos> - This is a great time for settling scores.<eos> Anyone who has an enemy can find himself labelled a collaborator.<eos> But you have the perfect answer.<eos> They're saying that I was put there as an informer.<eos> It was wrong of me to come here but a hunted animal heads for the place it knows as home.
This place is your true home, after all.<eos> Please do come home.<eos> - Have you been well? - Yeah.<eos> - I learned the song!<eos> The canary forgot how to sing.<eos> Shall I beat it with a willow branch?<eos> No, no, I would pity the poor thing...<eos> - Take it.<eos> The canary forgot how to sing.<eos> Give it an ivory ship, and a silver oar.
it states that by hurting me, you're hurting others... and ultimately, hurting yourself.<eos> alf, you signed all these names.<eos> yes, by proxy.<eos> alf, i already said you could use... the portable tv in the bedroom.<eos> it's too small.<eos> it makes everyone look like danny devito.<eos> for your information, i'm sending the tv back to the factory.<eos> the factory?<eos> why don't you just call a repairman?<eos> because it's still under warranty.
You've done your best, Alex.<eos> You've done the wife bit, the motherhood bit.<eos> The car pools, the vegetable garden needlepoint, the macramé potholders a cup of coffee with a neighbor in the morning a couple of drinks, a couple of pills a little psychoanalysis....<eos> Where are you now, Alex?<eos> Exactly where I want to be and I'm doing fine.<eos> Pretending to be somebody else...<eos> to be half of what you are.<eos> How long can you last like that?<eos> The world keeps growing, and you feed it.<eos> But it doesn't feed you, does it?
- We thought so.<eos> - Pete.<eos> All right.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> And I thought all secret agents were cold and heartless.<eos> No, Pete and I go way back, to some pretty funny places.<eos> Is that what the camel was about?<eos> Well, the first time I met this fella, he pulled me out of the quicksand in the wadi Nafud.<eos> Deep desert.<eos> Then he put me on a camel, and he gave it this gigantic swat.
Come on, BB.<eos> There's nothing we can do.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Paul, as soon as you finish that, I want you to trace the cortical motor pathway.<eos> I already did that.<eos> You already did it?<eos> It runs from the cortex to the substantia nigra to the medulla oblongata.<eos> Look at this.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> I hooked it up to a new circuit I set up for BB. And all of a sudden it started showing animation.
I am real pissed.<eos> - About the money?<eos> - How much did you give him?<eos> Why didn't you ask me before you gave it to him?<eos> Abby, it wasn't a whole lot of money.<eos> We have to help out around here.<eos> Do we have any left?<eos> Yeah, there's a little left.<eos> He said he wouldn't use it unless it was necessary.<eos> - How much was it?
I'll be back<eos> I've gotta run but I've a favour to ask you<eos> Whatever, but hurry I'm really busy!<eos> I'm supposed to get a valuable package on Sunday, but I won't be home<eos> Can I have it delivered here?
Who knows?<eos> They are such a mysterious breed.<eos> I don't know. I've met so few Jewish people.<eos> It's one of the advantages of a convent upbringing.<eos> Three successive convents.<eos> You can't imagine what a welcome sight you were after all those sisters.<eos> And I thought it was the Italian men who suffered by comparison.<eos> So they did, my love.<eos> Actually, this uniform is quite good for me.<eos> And the arm band, it gives it some flair.
I can't believe you're so blatantly jealous.<eos> You still can't stand the sight of me with another woman, huh?<eos> My heart goes out to any living creature in your company.<eos> One of these days you're gonna realise that if you want to get back together with me, you'll have to talk a little nicer.<eos> Sam...<eos> - You are an unmitigated egomaniac.<eos> - Too little, too late.<eos> Good night.<eos> You know, Normie, I was just thinking.<eos> When you and Vera have the baby, you'll have to give it a name, right?
Don't worry, she will when she gets to know me.<eos> - What's wrong, sweetheart?<eos> - l just... I can't believe it.<eos> Ernie, I won the lottery!<eos> Two million dollars!<eos> My God!<eos> Two million bucks!<eos> - l think I'm a little woozy.<eos> - Sam, get some brandy.<eos> Yeah, make it the good stuff. She can afford it.
Search him, Brody.<eos> All right. Against the car.<eos> Assume the position.<eos> Spread your feet.<eos> Hands on the hood. Now what happened?<eos> I went into Eve's dressing room because I was searching for the costume...<eos> - Lieutenant.<eos> - Hey, a gold button.<eos> Isn't this the button that you saw next toJerry Lydecker's dead body?<eos> That's it.
One carryall handles four spice mining teams.<eos> However, it will fly only two harvesters at a time.<eos> Today, we have 930 harvesters and 981 carryalls.<eos> Spice.<eos> The second moon.<eos> The sleeper must awaken.<eos> Am I the one?<eos> A hunter-seeker!<eos> It can't get me if I don't move.<eos> It's too dark in here for it to see clearly.
Robespierre's here, she's hiding eggs!<eos> You're mental!<eos> Scotch?<eos> Port?<eos> - That'll be fine.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - Scotch port.<eos> - Together?<eos> I like fortified wine, but port is too sweet.<eos> Scotch gives it a dry kick.
Do you want me to bring out the LeRoy Neiman paintings?<eos> No. We cannot risk violating the Geneva Convention. We'll break him tomorrow.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> My name is Nick Rivers.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I am Dr Paul Flammond.<eos> I am a prisoner here, just like you.<eos> A year ago, I was close to perfecting the first magnetic desalinisation process.<eos> So revolutionary, it was capable of removing the salt from over 500 million gallons of sea water a day.
They've lost contact with HRH.<eos> - This is all terribly unfortunate.<eos> - You'll have to cancel the ceremony.<eos> - You mean surrender?<eos> - Well there seems to be no alternative.<eos> Never!<eos> I LOVE this hospital!<eos> It's my whole life!<eos> It's been wife, mother, child to me;<eos> I've given it everything!
Man is entering an era of infinite possibility, still imprisoned in a feeble, inefficient body, still manacled by primitive notions of morality which have no place in an age of science, still powered by a brain that has hardly developed<eos> since the species emerged from the caves.<eos> Only a new intelligence can save mankind!<eos> Only a new human being of pure brain can lead man forward into the new era.<eos> I do not speak of dreams... such a being exists already.<eos> I have created it.<eos> It is here, now.<eos> Prepare yourselves to meet the human of the future.<eos> Neither man, nor woman, greater than either.<eos> I have given it a name: Genesis, "Birth".
- But isn't there anything we can do?<eos> I thought we were meant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head.<eos> Yes, if you like.<eos> - Oh, will that help?<eos> - No.<eos> Excuse me. I've got to go.<eos> Oh, well, then...<eos> Last orders, please!<eos> You pin-striped barbarians!<eos> I'll sue the council for every penny it's got!
Secretly I mounted my horse in haste and galloped hereto you<eos> I beg you, sister let your courage accomplish the deed you can perform!<eos> End this eternal torment<eos> What tales of tortured dreams do you tell in such distress?<eos> From the gods' heaven in the clouds I was banished in my folly<eos> I do not grasp what I am told<eos> Idle seems your story to me<eos> In your eyes, so exhausted glow flickering fires<eos> With ashen cheeks wan. wild sister what do you want of me?<eos> The ring on your hand, that is it
- Your tie.<eos> - What about it?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Who is it?<eos> A file for Mr. Borel, ma'am.<eos> - At this hour?<eos> - Sorry, ma'am.<eos> Mr. Borel has to read it before tomorrow's meeting.<eos> - Give it to me.<eos> - I have to explain what it's about.
THE MAN WHO LOVED WOMEN<eos> MONTPELLIER<eos> - CHRISTMAS '76<eos> One funeral is just like another.<eos> However, this one is special.<eos> Not a man in sight... only women... nothing but women.<eos> Yes, I think Bertrand... would have enjoyed the sight of his funeral.<eos> This is the moment oftruth. From where he lies... he can take a last look at what he liked best in us.<eos> I remember something he would say.:<eos> "Women's legs are compasses... which circle the globe... giving it its balance and harmony. "
the fillies... and the kittens."<eos> There'sa filly... a kitten.<eos> A beautiful leg is very pretty... but I am not against heavy ankles.<eos> I'm even attracted to them. There's the promise of greate rharmony at the top of the leg.<eos> The mystery of the mail... is fat homless.<eos> Fat homless.<eos> Legs...<eos> The legs of women... are compasses... compasses...<eos> "The legs of women are compasses."<eos> They circle the globe... giving it its balance and harmony.
Perhaps you know the way out?<eos> Perhaps ye sits here and chats with it a bitsy, my preciousss.<eos> It...<eos> likes ... riddles?<eos> Do I like riddles?<eos> Well, yes, after a fashion.<eos> It must have a competition with us.<eos> If precious asks and it doesn't answer we eat it, my precious.<eos> Oh, I say!<eos> But if it asks us and we doesn't answer then we shows it the way out!
- Being ironed.<eos> Will you answer that please?<eos> I'm trying to put this up. Fawlty Towers.<eos> Oh, hello, Mrs Fawlty.<eos> I'm doing it!<eos> I'm doing it now!<eos> Tell her I'm doing it now!<eos> He says he's doing it now.<eos> How's the nail?<eos> I wish it was this one.
Mariposa Way. [ Line Disconnects ]<eos> I don't know where we're gonna get another panda.<eos> They come from Tibet.<eos> The Commies have 'em all.<eos> - The Commies.<eos> - Most people think the panda's a bear.<eos> - Actually, it's a raccoon.<eos> - A raccoon.<eos> With a heart attack?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Maybe you fed it too much cholesterol.
Here I have carried out experiments that science would consider fantastic and, of course, go against all the principles of biology as it is understood today.<eos> What does all this have to do with Loreley?<eos> - You don't see it?<eos> - No.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Look.<eos> The chameleon, a prehistoric animal.<eos> Can you tell me what color it is?<eos> Light brown or thereabouts. Right?<eos> Mimesis allows it to change color at will through a chemical reaction.
We gotta get some meat on those bones.<eos> You're eating for two now, you know?<eos> -l'm fat enough already.<eos> -When's the last time you saw a doctor?<eos> -You're the first.<eos> -Well, from now on, you stay put.<eos> I have to drive the wagon.<eos> -You do, and that baby will be stillborn.<eos> -Good.<eos> And you'll die giving it birth.
What do you think of all this, Nick?<eos> I think it stinks.<eos> You would.<eos> All you know is concrete.<eos> You know, my family were Americans... when yours was still digging the bugs out of Irish potatoes.<eos> Go on, wave a flag and make me laugh.<eos> Wait a minute. You think I don't know this country?<eos> I know it.<eos> This is my country.<eos> I give it just what it wants:
- Who is?<eos> your floor? - Three, please.<eos> Is he dead?<eos> I sincerely hope so.<eos> - Who is he?<eos> - No idea.<eos> This chap's been following me all day today.<eos> My God!<eos> You've just killed James Bond!<eos> Is that who it was?
Where is Olyania Bolshoi?<eos> 6 km south of Krasny Sigorsk, Sir.<eos> Thank you, Colonel.<eos> That meet this demand means of communication?<eos> We would know more the Soviet system by what means Colossus.<eos> "What does Colossus"?<eos> I have told you, it performs better than expected.<eos> He discovered a system similar to him and understood that we could the information.<eos> But that is not enough, He wants to know more.<eos> Colossus and if it passes secret information?
That's what you called Emory, wasn't it?<eos> A "freak"? A "pansy."<eos> My, what an antiquated vocabulary you have.<eos> I'm surprised you didn't say "sodomite."<eos> Or "pederast."<eos> You better let me bring you up to date.<eos> Now, this isn't so new, but it might be new to you.<eos> Have you heard the term, "closet queen"?<eos> You know what that means? Do you know what it means to be in the closet? Don't, Michael.<eos> It won't help to explain what it means.
You always call my wonderful drink "the product," "the drink," et cetera.<eos> You never say Bueno.<eos> Say it for me.<eos> Well...<eos> For heaven's sakes, Darrin.<eos> Maybe I shouldn't tell you this but he's superstitious about saying the name of a product before he has the account.<eos> Now, that is silly.<eos> Bueno simply means good.<eos> Say it for me, please.<eos> Well, you see, I've been thinking. That word doesn't mean anything to most Americans. I think it should be renamed for the American market.
Italy, the FIAT car factory.<eos> - Croker, this is my toilet.<eos> - Please.<eos> Just read it.<eos> Get out.<eos> Are you alright, Mr Bridger?<eos> Are you alright?<eos> He's alright!<eos> I can always take it to the Americans.<eos> They're people who recognise young talent, give it a chance, they are.
- I'll give you a hand.<eos> - No, please don't bother.<eos> But I have to show you where things are.<eos> No, I'll find them.<eos> Go read your newspaper.<eos> Do you know where Daddy's slippers are?<eos> Go and get them.<eos> - All right, finish your yogurt.<eos> - I don't like yogurt.<eos> You say you don't like it, but maybe it doesn't like you.
-I'd cut my throat.<eos> -Now, there's an idea.<eos> -Hi.<eos> -Car all tucked in?<eos> -I was looking at the engine--<eos> -Would you like some tea?<eos> Oh, no, thank you.<eos> I was just looking at the engine.<eos> It was cute the way you put "Made in Detroit" on it. And a serial number.<eos> -Makes it look real legitimate.
Remember it all your life.<eos> I wonder if she understood.<eos> - That dress?<eos> In 1949, I was born.<eos> In June of 1960, I was born once again.<eos> Women and blood.<eos> Now, in 1967... we're still in the hands of the gods.<eos> The god of January 1st gives life to a girl who has no reason to live.<eos> January 15.<eos> The girl has a piece of white paper in her hand, but in a minute it's snatched away.
We're falling down on two items, I said:<eos> repentance and heart.<eos> Did they give you anything?<eos> I'm not a knocker of this kind of music but the intro goes something like this...<eos> Is he still giving you those 4 bar intros?<eos> - 8 bars. - It's 4 bars, Uncle Julie.<eos> You're counting it in 2. It's 4 bars.<eos> 4 bars, 8 bars... Anyway...<eos> I said to the boy who wrote it what made him think of that kind of a sound?<eos> How does it come here?
Manual override blocked. Source: engineering.<eos> - Nomad.<eos> - Jim, we'll only have enough air for...<eos> Get Scotty, some antigravs and meet me in engineering.<eos> Stop what you're doing and effect repairs on the life-support systems.<eos> Stop.<eos> You're programmed to obey the orders of your creator.<eos> I am programmed to destroy life-forms which are imperfect.<eos> These alterations will do so without destroying the vessel.<eos> It, too, is imperfect, but can be adjusted.
I have investigated it.<eos> To correct the fault will require an overhaul of the system.<eos> Three weeks at a starbase.<eos> I wouldn't mind so much if only it didn't get so...affectionate.<eos> It also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle.<eos> I take it a lady computer is not routine.<eos> We put it in to Cygnet xiv for maintenance.<eos> Cygnet xiv is a planet dominated by women.<eos> They felt the computer system lacked a personality.<eos> They gave it one.
I asked him to stay overnight.<eos> You did?<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'd already invited him.<eos> I thought I'd explained.<eos> You see, I thought he was Uncle Albert.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> - He's wearing my suit.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Doesn't it look nice?
Here's the principal treasury.<eos> Are you keeping this treasury for difficult times?<eos> That's the truth, Lord.<eos> Who could convince you that those times have come?<eos> When they come?<eos> We'd have to call for an extraordinary council composed of the pharaoh, 13 priests, 13 governors plus merchants, officers and peasants.<eos> You'd hand over the treasury to such a council?<eos> We'd give the necessary funds, if the assembly decides unanimously that Egypt is in danger.<eos> I want to improve the life of the people.<eos> I'll give it right away one day of rest after six days of work.
For the last time, I will fulfil the prayer of the priests because I am a merciful God!<eos> If you want to see Kama again, you have to do as I tell you.<eos> Bear that in mind!<eos> Who are you?<eos> The guards of the Labyrinth.<eos> You seem to know its outlay only too well.<eos> Herhor has sent you!<eos> Now I know that I won't build a temple like Amon's, or a pyramid like Cheop's!<eos> I have found the country feeble and ill.<eos> I want to give it back its power.
Deliver him to Missy Marshall.<eos> My pleasure, sir.<eos> The speedboat's waiting.<eos> Is that your cat?<eos> No, just found it wandering around the end of the pier.<eos> Unusual too. Most cats don't take much to the water.<eos> I'm moored at the end of the pier.<eos> This way, sir.<eos> Are you taking that cat?<eos> Might as well give it a good home aboard the True Love.
They send the machines to tell us lies.<eos> We do not wish to hear them.<eos> Yes, er, madam!<eos> You may not but I'd like to, uh, hear it.<eos> It's not good for my soldiers!<eos> Ahh, I see.<eos> It's stopped.<eos> Yes, now it is sending its message.<eos> Fire!<eos> You didn't do it very much damage, did you?
- It can't be helped.<eos> - But it can be helped.<eos> I can design a scaffolding myself which will never touch the ceiling.<eos> Do you now claim to be an architect too?<eos> - Do you claim to be one if that's the best you can do?<eos> - Bramante is my architect. I pay him for it.<eos> I pay you to paint.<eos> - Have you been trained as an architect?<eos> - No, Your Holiness. You have my permission to tear down Bramante's scaffolding and build your own.<eos> But it must not touch the ceiling and the painting must be perfect.
Beautiful.<eos> I was attracted to her, made love to her... even wrote a sonnet to her.<eos> It was a poor thing.<eos> The words meant nothing because she meant nothing.<eos> Less than nothing.<eos> It left me empty.<eos> After that I prayed.<eos> Yeah, I prayed for understanding.<eos> Maybe God crippled me... with a purpose as he does often.<eos> The bird's weak, He gives it wings.
What are you saying, Vicki?<eos> I'm sorry I behaved like that, but... when I first woke up, I...<eos> Robot?<eos> My dear, you... you have haven't got a temperature, have you?<eos> You come and sit down, Vicki.<eos> There is a robot!<eos> The Daleks made it - exactly like you.<eos> A robot exactly like me?<eos> Every detail.<eos> I heard them giving it orders.
I'm sorry.<eos> There's just no way to avoid the problem.<eos> There are times when she genuinely doesn't know what she's saying, but...<eos> On the other hand, I thought she described the way you left me rather accurately.<eos> If it's any comfort, I've always regretted having let you go.<eos> We don't have time for regrets now, Drew.<eos> And there is a lot to regret.<eos> What a shame.<eos> With all that money, she could have done such wonderful things with this place.<eos> Made it so beautiful again.
Once, Christopher Columbus landed here. He wrote in his diary:<eos> "This is the most beautiful land ever seen by human eyes."<eos> Thank you, Senor Columbus.<eos> When you saw me for the first time, I was singing and laughing.<eos> I waved the fronds of my palms to greet your sails.<eos> I thought your ships brought happiness.<eos> I am Cuba.<eos> Ships took my sugar and left me tears.<eos> Strange thing, sugar, Senor Columbus.<eos> It contains so many tears, but it is sweet.
He may have been taken.<eos> I can't see him.<eos> I can't find him anywhere. There's not a sign of him.<eos> don't worry.<eos> -What's the matter? -It's his notes.<eos> He'd never leave his notebook.<eos> It's too important to him.<eos> It's got the key codes of all the machines in the ship.<eos> It's got notes of everywhere we've been to.<eos> I know it has.
It proved they could win without their starting line-up.<eos> I always get that way at ball games. I lose control.<eos> Well, it's over now, we won.<eos> I know just the place where you could calm down.<eos> - Where?<eos> - My apartment.<eos> It's not ready for a housewarming but how do you like it?<eos> - It's beautiful up here.<eos> - I might put in some walls over there.<eos> And perhaps a ceiling, just to give it that traditional touch.
All right!<eos> Walter Bottazzi, do you take Rosetta Grotti to be your lawful wedded wife according to the rite of the Holy Mother Church?<eos> I do.<eos> Grotti Rosetta, do you take Walter Bottazzi to be your lawful wedded husband according to the rite of the Holy Mother Church?<eos> I do.<eos> - Did the witnesses hear?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Give each other your right hands.<eos> [Lt was a beautiful summer's day.]<eos> [The great river flowed lazily through the fields of the Po Valley...] [... and the poplars told it true stories of events that had happened there.]
Hurry up!<eos> Good boy, Schlemmer.<eos> Yes, sir. Anything else you wish me to do?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> We can just sit back now... and let the East German police finish the job.<eos> Pardon me. I must be very stupid, but I do not understand any of this.<eos> There's nothing to it. All it takes is a little knowledge of physics... and elementary psychology.<eos> Right now, Comrade Otto Ludwig Piffl... is tooling along on his motorcycle... toward East Berlin, gay, chipper... feeling like a million rubles.<eos> Little does he know that meanwhile back at the exhaust... the fumes are filling the balloon.<eos> It gets bigger and bigger... and all the time in the sidecar... a little booby trap is ticking away.
If you wish to bump me you may. And lose a seal?<eos> It is better to tell you we have visitors.<eos> Who?<eos> My brother is dead but his widow, powtee, and his two daughters have arrived.<eos> So?<eos> What are they like? - Women.<eos> When a seal is captured there are certain rituals and practical things to be taken care of.<eos> The first is this:<eos> ...since seals live in salt water they are always thirsty and the hunter must do as these hunters are doing.<eos> The soul of this animal will tell the souls of the other seals that it has received a drink of sweet water.
I wish I'd never woke up this morning.<eos> Sorry, Dr. Coburn... but I need to run some tests on you now.<eos> Leslie... please forgive me.<eos> I don't want to die like that housekeeper.<eos> OK, OK, OK.<eos> Rhonda, listen to me.<eos> I am going to do everything I can to beat this... but I'm going to need your help, OK?<eos> How did they beat it in that book?<eos> So we're gonna die because some lousy writer... couldn't come up with a happy ending?<eos> That might be it.
- So, why did you do it?<eos> Because grandma wanted it.<eos> I don't think that she wanted illegal food.<eos> Throw it on the river.<eos> It's just a fish, Philip.<eos> Noone saw me.<eos> So, if anyone hasn't seen you, does that mean that you did nothing?<eos> I know, Yutaka.<eos> And you know it too.<eos> Give back the river what it owns.
Well... I just think he's guilty.<eos> I mean, somebody saw him do it.<eos> oK.<eos> Here's what I think.<eos> And I have no personal feelings about this.<eos> I just wanna talk about facts.<eos> Number one.<eos> The old man lived downstairs under the room where the killing took place.<eos> At 10 minutes after 12 on the night of the killing, he heard loud noises.<eos> Said it sounded like a fight.
Carey's death was the result of an attack by a common house cat... a former pet in the Carey home.<eos> He was the victim of the most fantastic ailment in the annals of medicine.<eos> Thus ends the life of a man whose courage and will to survive... lasted until the very end.<eos> A man whose fantastic story... was known to virtually every man, woman and child in the civilised world.<eos> - Mr. Carey? - Yes?<eos> And now for the sports...<eos> - You may go up.<eos> She wants to see you.<eos> - Is she all right?<eos> The doctor gave her a heavy sedative but it's hardly working at all.
Maybe we're getting some advance publicity.<eos> You can call it that if you like, but whatever those savages are saying, you can be sure it's about us.<eos> And sooner or later they'll close in on us.<eos> In that case we're better off staying right here and wait for that search plane to spot us.<eos> Other people have crashed in Africa before and been found.<eos> Lots of them, in heaven.<eos> Hawkins knows the country, Dick.<eos> I think we ought to do what he says.<eos> I don't agree.<eos> If there is a search plane out, we gotta give it the chance to spot us.
Done and done.<eos> Jesse came home strong again.<eos> And he'd fallen in love with you.<eos> Those were happy days, Zee.<eos> Oh, why couldn't things stay that way?<eos> Who is that coming?<eos> It's Robby and the reverend.<eos> Jesse<eos> - God's grace. That's what the name signifies.<eos> - It don't seem to fit, does it?
Do you think I'd sink millions of dollars into a venture... that would scare the paying public witless?<eos> Why not?<eos> The public loves to be scared.<eos> It excites the imagination.<eos> Makes them believe in the existence of things unreal.<eos> He doesn't believe in Santa Claus, either.<eos> I read that in your last book.<eos> You call Mitchell's condition unreal?<eos> Hundreds of people swore to the reality of the Loch Ness monster... in the Scottish Highlands years ago.<eos> It was anything from 20 to 300 feet in height.
So you liked that approach, hmm?<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - You didn't? - No, sir.<eos> - But I thought-<eos> I didn't get a chance to finish what I was going to say.<eos> I don't think that's the right approach at all.<eos> You surprise me.<eos> You're the sixth man I've asked about it... and the first that wasn't actually enthusiastic about it.<eos> Well, I could be a hundred percent wrong, of course... but... you asked me what I thought about it... and that's it.<eos> Why don't you think it's right?
We share each other's sorrow, Prince Xenon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> May I go now, Hamar?<eos> Yes, my prince.<eos> It is my wish that the doors to the treasure vaults be opened.<eos> It shall be as you wish, Your Majesty.<eos> What is all this?<eos> All the doors are open, it's gone.<eos> - Where is the treasure?<eos> - In that place for which it was destined. The tomb in the pyramid.
I suppose there's no other way.<eos> Very well.<eos> Anything else?<eos> In fairy tales, the evil fairy always asks for three things.<eos> What's your third wish?<eos> You.<eos> I'll have to tell my husband.<eos> Just what I intend to do.<eos> - Fidelity of wife to husband in body and soul, in things small and large, in joy and in sorrow-<eos> Fidelity purifies love, enlarges it, elevates it, ennobles it, and raises it up to the kingdom of God, giving it its true reason and deepest meaning.
An extreme, but not unusual case of the seven-year itch occurred in Leipzig, Germany in 1912.<eos> Gustaf Meyerheim, happily married for seven years suddenly..." Seven years!<eos> - Dr. Brubaker to see Mr. Sherman.<eos> - Doctor, you're early. Yes, my 3:00 patient jumped out of the window.<eos> So I'm ahead of schedule.<eos> - Dr. Brubaker.<eos> I see you've been working on my book.<eos> It's a wonderful book.<eos> Very important.<eos> You'll be happy to know that we're giving it a big promotion.
We can't give a show without wardrobe.<eos> Well give a show, boss, if I have to put them in horse blankets.<eos> Holly.<eos> Here, hold.<eos> Hank, any horses hurt?<eos> The horses are okay, Brad, but you're not.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> I've seen all kinds of accidents on the lot, Holly.<eos> That's an artery.<eos> Every time his heart beats, it pumps blood out of him.
You'd better come with me.<eos> You've bothered this man enough.<eos> No, I want to hear it.<eos> You go buy your magazine.<eos> Very well, but we've got to get right back on the train.<eos> Come here.<eos> Where's our wandering boy?<eos> I've got him in sight, Mrs. Sinclair.<eos> He's talking to his train robber.<eos> So that's who it is.
That's just to look at!<eos> I'm sick.<eos> Grab hold.<eos> Hang on.<eos> What happened to me?<eos> You're alright.<eos> In free orbit, everything is falling at the same speed.<eos> Everything unfastened just floats. There's no up or down.<eos> Tell that to my stomach!<eos> It says there's nothing but up!
All right.<eos> This is what you're shooting for.<eos> Take a good look at it, and say a prayer... and pass it along for the others to see.<eos> It's real pretty.<eos> While the contestants are examining the prize to be awarded to the winner, I'll tell you something about it.<eos> It seems that when the Winchester people are turning out these here guns, every so often, maybe one gun out of every 10,000, 20,000, well, it comes out just perfect.<eos> Now naturally, it ain't for sale.<eos> I would give a year's wages for that gun. But money won't buy it.<eos> It wouldn't be right to sell it.<eos> So the Winchester people, they have given it a name.
So it's no more politics?<eos> I've worked too hard in my time to get there.<eos> I'll just go on practicing law and making more money.<eos> I'd like to ask... why all the speeches you're making around the countryside?<eos> I wonder who that is.<eos> I brought some people up from the capital just to meet you.<eos> Folks, I want you to meet Willie Stark... the next governor of our state.<eos> Bear patiently with me for a few minutes.<eos> I'd like to tell you what this state needs.<eos> It needs a balanced tax program.
- Oh, is that so? By the way, you don't know of anybody who wants a boy, do you? A parochial apprentice.<eos> Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry.<eos> I'll take him.<eos> - Yes, sir? Pull that cap off your eye.<eos> And hold your head up some.<eos> Be good enough to tell Mr. Sowerberry that the beadle is here.<eos> Is that you, Mr. Bumble?<eos> No one else, Mr. Sowerberry.<eos> Here, I brought the boy.<eos> - So this is the boy, is it?
Any better? Worse.<eos> Go to bed, Luigi.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Wouldn't you rather go upstairs, sir.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm expecting someone who is just a little late, that's all.<eos> Good night.<eos> Don't look so unhappy, colonel.<eos> It's time you had a little dream.<eos> It would make you feel so much better.
She likes him quite a lot, doesn't she?<eos> And he's crazy about her.<eos> Quite.<eos> Nick, you were asking me about Mr. Chips...<eos> Jamie, if we could only find you a girl like Anne.<eos> Look, Nick, why don't you try this on?<eos> It's never suited me.<eos> Do you think this type lid would do something for my personality?<eos> I think your personality would do something for the, uh, lid.<eos> Lend it a little dash, shall we say?
I knew instantly you had the spark. - Thank you, Mr Syrette.<eos> - Not at all, Mrs Maile.<eos> Please forgive the intrusion.<eos> I have been to the village, done some shopping.<eos> - I came to say goodbye. I'm leaving.<eos> - Indeed, sir?<eos> I will miss you, Syrette.<eos> And so will my one suit very much indeed.<eos> You know, you brought glamour into its sordid life.<eos> You creased and increased its self-respect. You gave it hope.
Hey mister, you forgot your hat.<eos> Wait a minute. I wasn't trying to give you the brush-off.<eos> Oh, I know, but I can't impose on you any further.<eos> Oh, don't be a chump.<eos> Look, 'll take you to the nearest police station.<eos> And if they can't help... we can always advertise you in Lost and Found.<eos> Alright.<eos> Get your evening paper. Read all about it.<eos> Big Murder.<eos> Robert Dilling shot it the way to go home.
Well, you know how opera singers are.<eos> What with your matron from the SÃ"retÃ© in her dressing room and that sphinx-like fellow of yours waiting to escort her to the stage, she feels quite important.<eos> Madame Lorenzi, I trust you're entirely composed.<eos> Composed?<eos> What are you talking about? Why not?<eos> Maestro.<eos> The piano has just been tuned, Maestro.<eos> And when do we introduce the concerto?<eos> Probably after the opera.<eos> Inspector Daubert has a plan of his own, and we must give it every chance.
Then I must do it alone.<eos> While it lives, no one is safe.<eos> My son.<eos> What are you about to do?<eos> Would you destroy... that which I, your father, dedicated his life to creating?<eos> I must.<eos> The monster you created is in itself destruction.<eos> Nevertheless, I was near to solving a problem... that has baffled man since the beginning of time... the secret of life, artificially created.<eos> But it has brought death to everything that it's touched.<eos> That is because, unknowingly... I gave it a criminal brain.
Mr. Salvador Perez Gomez!<eos> I'll send the first one thousand pesos to my family!<eos> Really? Did you find "the Fox"?<eos> Not "the Fox", the gamecock breeder.<eos> He's another one of the murderers.<eos> Where is he?<eos> At the cock fight ring, I just talked to him.<eos> He's fixing a fight.<eos> He wants me to get foreigners to bet on his cock.<eos> Then he gives it chloroform and secretly bets on the other one.
We may need that fight before we get to the ferry.<eos> You wouldn't be much good in a fight, you jailbird!<eos> Oh, leave the Kid alone. He's handcuffed!<eos> Gentlemen, please let's not forget the ladies.<eos> Let's have a little Christian charity one for the other.<eos> Well, folks, we're coming into Lee's Ferry now!<eos> Lordsburg, next stop!<eos> Curley, look!<eos> Look at the ferry!<eos> It's burnt too!
That's life. - What?<eos> - You want me to smash your face?<eos> - Oh, come on!<eos> Say, doesn't all his money amaze you?<eos> - It's his mother's.<eos> - His mother, that's easy to say.<eos> What about the fuss he just made over his papers?<eos> In the middle, there was an ID card with a photo in the corner.<eos> Oh, maybe it's just a driver's license.<eos> - In any case, it had a funny color.
There you are.<eos> You still got your little plaything.<eos> - Come on, Swan.<eos> - I'll come in a moment.<eos> Thank you, Miss Rutledge.<eos> I couldn't have stood it if they'd broken it.<eos> It isn't much use this way though, is it?<eos> A poor shamed thing that mustn't speak.<eos> It can speak, Colonel.<eos> Let it speak the language of the town.
Young man, you know too much.<eos> I arrest you for the murder of...<eos> Yes, and another murder may be happening now.<eos> It's a confession you wish to make? No.<eos> An accusation.<eos> Dr. Mirakle in the Rue Morgue is guilty of four murders so far this week.<eos> And by now, perhaps a fifth.<eos> Do you accuse this doctor?<eos> Dr. Mirakle has a captive ape.<eos> It committed this crime.
After a few years, he could write better French than his former colleagues.<eos> He sent me to a Flemish school, then a French one.<eos> Then a Flemish one again.<eos> I can understand it, but he was so demanding...<eos> It was always:<eos> "If you don't like it, you can leave. "<eos> So I left.<eos> I took a few books, a shirt, and I left.<eos> My family are natural born resistors.<eos> My father rebelled against his parents.
Teacher, something has happened.<eos> What is it?<eos> Hsiao-ying is coming here under the flag of the Chentien School.<eos> Teacher!<eos> Hsiao-ying, you tried to become my student just so you could do this?<eos> Please forgive me.<eos> Why do you want to challenge me?<eos> My name is Sha Hsiao-hu.<eos> My father, Sha Chentien had a duel with you...<eos> You said you only wished to compare your kung fu with his.
I had a stomach operation and healed quickly.<eos> I had to return to my hometown despite my father.<eos> I had to come to write my story on which this film is based taking the necessary liberties.<eos> Not really my story, but of the shepherds.<eos> They, not I, gave life to the book. With their lives.<eos> And I chose to come back for that very reason. They make the writer's trade a valid one.<eos> Even if often I've the unrestrainable desire to flee from this village from this square.<eos> It's lively now because you're here but come back in winter!<eos> On the mainland... I'd find far greater attractions.<eos> But I'd be using my position as a prerogative as my father wielded his. And it would be his final victory.
You told me to check around the grounds to see if I could find out how Mr. Walsh got hurt?<eos> I couldn't find nothing outside. No blood, nothing.<eos> Then Nurse Rita call me.<eos> Watch your feet, Doctor.<eos> The police may want to examine it exactly the way we found it.<eos> Why the police?<eos> Mr. Walsh fellow attempted to molest the poor girl while she was still in a coma. I've seen things like that happen before. Maybe he was drunk.<eos> Judy Glasberg. You back again?<eos> Daddy didn't think the new nose was different enough, so I'm in for more alterations.<eos> I keep telling him it looks just like his, and he keeps saying, 'That's why I want you to change it.'
She isn't like her at all. It's only your imagination.<eos> I lived here, didn't I?<eos> When they took Helena's husband away, my sister found us shelter here.<eos> Please go away and never come back. The more silent he is, the more they beat him, but he is silent as he knows nothing about you.<eos> Don't you understand that every minute I stay with you is a sin against him?<eos> Now I know what I must do.<eos> Go away, please.<eos> Is it his child?<eos> Ours.<eos> It's his, yours... and mine.
Say another word and you'll be out of the classroom!<eos> Exactly what I was trying to suggest...<eos> Barbara, please!<eos> This story is stupid.<eos> Barbara!<eos> "Then, God seized him..."<eos> No, we are at:<eos> "But this is where he was mistaken."<eos> "But this is where he was mistaken. The same day God asked of each animal its name.<eos> All knew it, only the donkey started to stutter, unable to remember his."
The fate of France depends on that piece of paper.<eos> - Here is the letter. - Good.<eos> It appears that your feeble-minded husband intends to betray us, Marie.<eos> Betrayed by Louis?<eos> My darling Escargot, he has the brains of a chicken.<eos> Brains enough to summon the de Sisis, my love.<eos> The de Sisis?<eos> The brains of a chicken, coupled with the claws of two eagles may well hatch the eggs of our destruction.<eos> - He must know our plan.<eos> - And we shall know his.
Two...<eos> Let's go.<eos> That's my horse!<eos> Let's get after them!<eos> is that your horse?<eos> Nope.<eos> Coley's the thief.<eos> Stole my horse in Dodge.<eos> Rigged faro game.<eos> So you stole his?
We had a meeting last night.<eos> We heard Koharu, the courtesan would be redeemed by a rich merchant.<eos> The merchant loves her.<eos> He says he'll redeem her any day now.<eos> They say some rich men are really stupid. Like the merchant.<eos> - But...<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> Gozaemon, my husband, is very strict, as you know.<eos> He heard the rumor and thought the merchant was you.<eos> You're my nephew, not his.
Oh, nonsense.<eos> And I don't like being watched by crowds.<eos> Well, you have to give me my good luck kiss in the box.<eos> Now.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Aren't we going to watch the race?<eos> The American ambassador, I promised to see it from his box.<eos> - Darling, he has a horse running.<eos> - Well, so have I. I know.<eos> But his hasn't a chance, and yours is going to win.
Its purpose is to give false information to the enemy.<eos> If you complete it successfully, you will be promoted.<eos> From now on, you will do anything he says.<eos> -And if I refuse?<eos> -You will not leave this room alive.<eos> -l will obey your orders.<eos> -Good.<eos> These are your instructions.<eos> You report to me here but the consulate security man must not know I'm in Istanbul.<eos> This is classified far above his level.
See what you're doing to him?<eos> I see him behaving abominably, which is nothing new, is it?<eos> Perhaps if you'll leave us alone, we can get on.<eos> No, I'm staying.<eos> Please yourself, Harriet.<eos> Yes, now your brother had a pony, what was its name?<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> Yes he did, he did, John.<eos> No, Aunt Harriet.<eos> I had the pony. But he made such a fuss, we had to pretend... it was his.
Yeah. Not smart like us<eos> Yep.<eos> Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?<eos> How about I bring him some?<eos> It isn't food he's hungry for.<eos> Then let me tie a can to his tail.<eos> Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.<eos> Leave him alone.<eos> It's a free country.<eos> And it's his.
- What are these?<eos> - Chemicals.<eos> This is, well...<eos> It's so many things, but... above all, it's so completely unexpected.<eos> - These all yours?<eos> I mean, did you do all this?<eos> Mark, tell me about this room.<eos> - It-lt belonged to my father.<eos> - A scientist. Oh.<eos> Then this equipment was his?
- Chemicals.<eos> This is, well...<eos> It's so many things, but... above all, it's so completely unexpected.<eos> - These all yours?<eos> I mean, did you do all this?<eos> Mark, tell me about this room.<eos> - It-lt belonged to my father.<eos> - A scientist. Oh.<eos> Then this equipment was his?<eos> No, l-I sold his to buy it.
There's not been enough time.<eos> But it's just possible. Good grief!<eos> What is it?<eos> I had a confrontation with a german officer.<eos> At Tiercelin's.<eos> What an idiot.<eos> He knows my name.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Not really.<eos> He gave me his.
Nor the mold.<eos> Particularly not the mold.<eos> That path will lead you directly to where your friend is waiting.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Perhaps you will be near the flower stalls on Boulevard Charner at precisely half past 1:00 this afternoon.<eos> Half past 1:00?<eos> Your friend, does he live here in Saigon?<eos> He comes and goes, I believe.<eos> The communist have a couple of committees who specialize in assassination.<eos> His wouldn't be one of them, would it?
I'm going into the men's room now and change into the busboy's green pants. And then we'll go up to my place and pick up a suit.<eos> You haven't been listening. Your clothes are at my place.<eos> - You shouldn't have done it.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I'd have wagered a Lily Daché hat there'd been another woman at that table.<eos> But I wasn't going to ruin my second day of marriage with petty jealousies.<eos> For some reason, I'd pictured Marilla living in a one-room kitchenette with a girlfriend who studied music.<eos> This place even had an outside flunky.<eos> Very refined.<eos> He tried not to notice my pants, and I tried not to notice his.
Michel!<eos> What is there?<eos> What happened?<eos> E -e -eh, she had recognized her son.<eos> Likely she was mistaken.<eos> It is so old.<eos> Besides, I do not see a captain of the Czar mails would do in such a corner.<eos> Poor Marfa.<eos> It is still strange that a mother does not recognize her own son.<eos> You are very sure that his is the captain of the Czar mail?
Miss Torso, for example...<eos> You keep your mind off her.<eos> She sure is the "Eat, drink and be merry" girl.<eos> Yeah, she'll wind up fat, alcoholic and miserable.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Speaking of misery, poor Miss Lonelyheart. She drank herself to sleep again, alone.<eos> Poor soul.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> Maybe one day she'll find her happiness.<eos> Yeah, and some man will lose his.
Can it be possible, sir, that the British have found him out?<eos> It can also be possible that they have known about him all the time.<eos> Curious.<eos> How easily Cicero acquired the documents he wanted to sell.<eos> When only once we named the documents we wanted to buy how mysteriously he has failed to deliver it.<eos> Light.<eos> What does the Colonel propose to do now?<eos> Precisely nothing.<eos> All spies in time, outlive their usefulness.<eos> And I'm afraid, Moyzisch, that your friend Cicero has just about outlive his if any.
I guarded the king, her father.<eos> I guard her now.<eos> Guard her well, my gray-haired colossus.<eos> Guard her well.<eos> Romance seems to have been short-lived.<eos> There's always a weapon to bring down a flighty dove, my friend.<eos> And please, dear Lord, forgive me my anger and my spite.<eos> I do not know what came over me.<eos> It was temptation, perhaps.<eos> A selfish desire that this man might see your light. For my sake rather than for his.
What did you do that for?<eos> Why did you lie to him?<eos> Sometimes they call me "the bird who feathers his nest"... because they say that I steal from everyone.<eos> It is not true, of course.<eos> But let us say that I'm in a position to take a smaller profit than my kindly master.<eos> I go with the caravan.<eos> I'm in charge of it.<eos> Perhaps I will take you.<eos> It will cost me nothing to provide you with equipment.<eos> It will be his.
Ruy Blas, and... and that I'd sack your friend without a trial.<eos> Duke, you have a curious notion about... about my police.<eos> I have the notion of a man arriving in Madrid and who's been held for a ransom.<eos> Unravel this yourself, Ruy Blas, Zafari, I'm getting confused.<eos> Zafari?<eos> Do you know my rascal?<eos> He's on my list.<eos> Strange times. The bandits look like Grandees of Spain.<eos> Your Zafari has kept nothing of me but my clothes.<eos> These are his.
- Why do you say that?<eos> Nobody can afford to own a bag like that now.<eos> Look here.<eos> A man was mobbed in Trafalgar Square this morning.<eos> They nearly had his life just because he was carrying a small black bag.<eos> That sort of thing's going on all over London.<eos> I came straight home when I read about it, because I remembered... I had a small black bag of that sort.<eos> So I hid it.<eos> Anyone who even owns one is under suspicion.<eos> That's why he tried to get rid of his just as I've hidden mine.
They don't like people fooling around with them.<eos> Give them a bathtub, they keep coal in it.<eos> You got to understand, honey, no man is strong enough to buck the party.<eos> No matter how much he wants to make his wife happy.<eos> You'll be strong enough some day, Dan, and then you'll wash clean of all graft, and crooks, and thieving politicians, and really deserve your title, The Honorable.<eos> You like the kids, huh?<eos> Why shouldn't he like them?<eos> Sure I like them.<eos> Take them away.<eos> The guy with the red hair says not so much lemon in his.
Or agree to remain here.<eos> All right. Release her.<eos> Janet...<eos> Is she?<eos> And Countess Zaleska?<eos> Out there.<eos> Janet, open your eyes.<eos> There's your vampire, Sir Basil.<eos> The arrow...<eos> A wooden shaft through her heart, just as I drove the stake through his.
Mm.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - [Grunts]<eos> Try not to move too much.<eos> It takes a while for that cocktail to wear off.<eos> My sisters.<eos> I have to call them.<eos> You can't.<eos> Why?<eos> Did they get hurt?
- [Grunts]<eos> Try not to move too much.<eos> It takes a while for that cocktail to wear off.<eos> My sisters.<eos> I have to call them.<eos> You can't.<eos> Why?<eos> Did they get hurt?<eos> What happened?<eos> They think you're dead, Sean.
Well, Prince Charles was pretty devastated when...<eos> I'm the saddest prince there is because I cannot find my true love.<eos> But hark!<eos> Upon what hopeful vision does my royal gaze fall?<eos> Klaus, my liege, it appears we may be nearing the end of our quest.<eos> I can't stop thinking about those spiders in your boobies.<eos> Good sir, 'tis I, the Prince of Mardi Gras.<eos> Be there any fair maidens in this cottage?<eos> Why, yes, indeed.<eos> I have three uniquely-breasted daughters, and they all went to your Mardi Gras ball.
Sorry, my last apology didn't come out right.<eos> You're not here to apologize.<eos> You feel what you feel.<eos> Something tells me that there's been a lot that you have felt that you needed to apologize for.<eos> Your anger towards your mom, your feelings for guys who don't deserve you, apparently.<eos> And now you've put your heart out there again after you've kept it locked up for so long, and this lug nut can't see how unique your connection is if he's tempted to fall back into a relationship<eos> that's safe and familiar, but not really what he needs, or... not really what he wants.<eos> Wow, that was... that was oddly good.<eos> Well, you're not the only one whose life isn't perfect.<eos> Relationships are, um... uh, they're a pain in the ass.
- Thank you.<eos> -Here's the paperwork to your friend.<eos> - Good boy .<eos> I just have to ask you something :<eos> Why him ?<eos> Try the meatballs .<eos> Okay . Just so I understand this ...<eos> You drugged me down , send me to Africa.<eos> - Just because of a few meatballs ?<eos> They're something for themselves .
I never do.<eos> Buckle up. We're taking off! It's a safety measure.<eos> You'll become a human cannon ball.<eos> We must hit the mark. Tell me: what precisely, offends you?<eos> Sir, offends, no.<eos> Anything you add, will worsen the problem.<eos> Like reading the Talmud to condo-owners.<eos> These are the rules: 191 States, 191 Ministers, 191 speeches. Ten minutes each.<eos> Precisely, every minute counts!<eos> They must be weighty, deep...
Yeah, I know.<eos> In a town this size...<eos> No, I mean really.<eos> She can't do that forever.<eos> Look.<eos> This tracks Lemon's location by her cell phone signal.<eos> Those fe this up when I got lost bringing her iced teduring that Civil War reenactment.<eos> accidently run into her. Those fe this up when I got lost<eos> And make her see just exactly what she's been missing.<eos> Meatball's lyrics may seem simple at first, but like an onion, they're many-layered underneath.
Look, what better way to show your commitment than to stare fear straight in the face?<eos> Love is risky, Tom.<eos> But the risk is worth it.<eos> Beady eyes and all.<eos> LEMON:<eos> I thought we put these boots back.<eos> I had her ring them up when you weren't looking.<eos> Well, I guess there's a fine line between deceit and initiative.<eos> Hey, you know what best friends do?<eos> They go to concerts.
Why did you change your mind?<eos> I'm no longer constrained by being a commentator on TV1<eos> Someone decided that it wasn't going very well.<eos> I don't know if it had something to do with my skin colour but it did provoke emotions that I want to work through in political work.<eos> That sounds unpleasant.<eos> But for us it's good.<eos> We'd like to offer you the role of integration spokesperson.<eos> That's not my field.<eos> Of course I have views about integration.<eos> But they're quite strong views.
Things I'll do for a new purse.<eos> One pump of that stuff will do the trick, you know.<eos> Have you ever heard of an armpit fetish, hmm?<eos> No.<eos> My clients are a little more traditional.<eos> What's your secret?<eos> I mean, I have plenty of repeat clients, but your client Lisa has been in here multiple times a week.<eos> You leading her on?<eos> Women are the same as men.<eos> They just want a little naughty fun on the side, no strings attached.
How much is this?<eos> Who told yöu?<eos> Kajal, what are yöu doing?<eos> What if it starts raining?<eos> The doctor's asked yöu to keep the wound dry.<eos> It feels nice.<eos> Of course, all the girls were rescued.<eos> Except for one.<eos> - What?<eos> No, they all ran away.
Is she a suspect?<eos> We're working several different angles.<eos> I saw on the web site that there was a fourth trustee?<eos> Steven Doppler.<eos> He's flying up from L.A. tomorrow.<eos> We're, uh, meeting with candidates to fill Julia's position.<eos> So soon?<eos> The meeting was already scheduled.<eos> It's our monthly meeting.<eos> I-I know it seems cold, replacing her so quickly, but the women at the shelter here, they--they've suffered enough.
You're as beautiful as a queen should be.<eos> I pray your child is a son, so he may follow my brother on his throne.<eos> Thank you, Richard.<eos> George.<eos> I am very grateful for your kinship.<eos> Where... Where's Edward?<eos> At the Abbey.<eos> He is to watch the coronation from behind a screen, as is the custom.<eos> My daughters will escort you.<eos> They have been trained for such occasions.
All right, Dave, you win.<eos> Even I think this is a stupid idea.<eos> But I gotta hand it to you.<eos> You are being very chill.<eos> Let's go get a char-dog.<eos> Chillzilla.<eos> Beige napkins.<eos> This is the exact shade I wanted for our wedding.<eos> Beige napkins are pretty.<eos> Yeah, they're great. They're great.
I could marry her.<eos> I could get her pregnant. She'd have the child.<eos> And then, if she could die soon afterwards, that would really be. best for everyone, really, because... you know, the kid couldn't hate. You then, right?<eos> "I'm doing my best.<eos> "Your mum's dead," you know?<eos> Jesus, Jim, that is cold-blooded, even for you.<eos> I've looked into it.<eos> All right, it's not as easy as you think anyway, all right?<eos> It turns out that terminally ill women don't want to get pregnant.<eos> They're all about them and "what" "they're up to" and their situation... high-maintenance, if you ask me.
God, Jim!<eos> No, dad, no.<eos> I don't want that.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> It's part of the drill.<eos> I'm never gonna forget this.<eos> Neither is my wife.<eos> What is it with women and sex?<eos> No, it's mothers.<eos> They don't understand sex with their sons.
So, no, we will not lend you any money.<eos> I'm sorry, Daddy.<eos> Look at that.<eos> - I'm jacked.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Good old brunch.<eos> See, this is what I keep trying to tell Hannah when she's talking about all of her wandering, is that there's an end point.<eos> We have all these experiences so that eventually we can settle down.<eos> Uh, wait, what?<eos> Well, like we have our experiences and now they're behind us.
We'll just talk it out. Good talk.<eos> Nay, great talk.<eos> Very healthy.<eos> FBI.<eos> You're here about the lady-killer murders, aren't you?<eos> The lady-killer murders?<eos> - Yeah, coined it myself.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> What can you tell us?<eos> Well, both victims were female, under 21 and here's the kicker, they were drained of all their blood.
Are you sure we're safe here?<eos> As safe as we're gonna be.<eos> Hey.<eos> Nothing's gonna hurt you.<eos> I won't let it.<eos> You know I kissed you once.<eos> It was right when you moved here.<eos> It was my first.<eos> I never told anybody that, not even the twins.<eos> They lost their virginity the summer before.

- Great!<eos> I'm so happy.Thank you.<eos> - We've calculated it like this.<eos> I've been turned down so many times!<eos> There are very few doctors who will help female couples.<eos> - I think only four or five in Germany.<eos> - I've become aware of that.<eos> I'm the only one in the southwest.<eos> And there are no more catches?<eos> The only catch is that when women are 25 to 30, they become pregnant easily.
He signed noncompetes, nondisclosures.<eos> If he breaches them, they will fire him.<eos> They will sue him.<eos> There could even be jail time.<eos> He can't know any this.<eos> You want me to lie to him.<eos> No, I want you to just not say anything for now.<eos> You want me to lie to him.<eos> The nurses aren't being unreasonable.<eos> They have valid concerns.
I don't appreciate you invading my privacy like some kind of creeping Tom.<eos> I apologize for breaking up this sordid little tryst, but I do have some urgent business.<eos> Or have you forgotten that our paranoid brother Kol is running around with a white oak stake and homicide on the brain?<eos> He tried to kill me last night.<eos> I didn't forget.<eos> Yes.<eos> Unfortunately, he seems to have absconded with my set of daggers.<eos> Poor Nik.<eos> However will you get your way without your precious daggers?<eos> They were so handy when you wanted to end a conversation with one of us.
We didn't know any better.<eos> You didn't even email?<eos> Email was not invented yet.<eos> What about Facebook?<eos> - Facebook wasn't really a thing yet.<eos> - How old are you?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm young.<eos> Don't worry about me, okay?<eos> Yeah, these Facebook connections, they rarely pan out.
Brought up in an orphanage, in France.<eos> I'm afraid she picked up some bad habits.<eos> Bad habits!<eos> Nuns?<eos> Habits?<eos> What sort of bad habits?<eos> Alcohol.<eos> Chewing gum.<eos> Those cigarettes of hers.<eos> I said to her, "They'll kill you one day."
But if you look at the crimes, they're very different.<eos> The first one was clearly planned.<eos> The planted cigarettes, the locked room?<eos> But the second, well, the attacker just grabbed some rosary beads that were left lying around after confession.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, straight after confession.<eos> You know, sir, that cancer business was brilliant.<eos> Really.<eos> How did you work it out?<eos> Well, remember, Fidel, things aren't always as they appear on the surface.
How tall would you like to be?<eos> 6' tall.<eos> Weight?<eos> 190?<eos> You're an adonis.<eos> Steve, go make yourself useful.<eos> Get some pictures of him playing tennis and rock climbing.<eos> Billy, just be yourself.<eos> Billy, women don't want you to be yourself.<eos> At times, they say they do, but you know women.

Billy, whenever you try to... no more '50s dad.<eos> You sure?<eos> No.<eos> No '50s dad.<eos> Well, look.<eos> When you meet a girl, try to be funny.<eos> That's all you got to do.<eos> Be funny.<eos> Girls like witty guys.<eos> I'm not very attractive, but I'm funny, and they appreciate it.
I don't even know why I said that.<eos> Um, you're really pretty.<eos> Oh. Thank you.<eos> You're kind of cute yourself.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Uh... You are really pretty, in fact.<eos> But...<eos> What's with those big dumbo ears?<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, they're huge.
You... you're gonna be okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey, what do you think happens when we die?<eos> Do you have any hobbies?<eos> ♪ Don't you worry ♪<eos> ♪ don't you worry ♪<eos> Hi, Renee.<eos> What's up with your legs?<eos> They're, like, crazy small.
And he was disciplined.<eos> And he threw a fit, and he didn't return to work.<eos> And you've never liked him.<eos> For whatever reason, you've never liked him.<eos> That's not personal. That's not how it looks to everyone.<eos> And you're sinking his career.<eos> Well, it's been more than 24 hours.<eos> I think the cards were officially wrong.<eos> Not wrong, per se.<eos> They were close.
Information wants to get out, Watson.<eos> Which is why...<eos> There is no such thing as conspiracies.<eos> We've covered this.<eos> Hello, Clyde.<eos> Oh, are you taking Clyde?<eos> He will starve if we leave him here.<eos> Oh, I didn't know you liked tortoises.<eos> I love them.<eos> They make an absolutely delicious soup stock.
♪<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yeah, Special Agent Xande Diaz.<eos> I'm looking for Sherlock Holmes.<eos> I've uncovered some information about the girl he's trying to find.<eos> He needs to know about it right away.<eos> Hello.<eos> It was an ambush.<eos> A group of painters when I arrived on the scene.<eos> But they're not painters-- their shoes were as clean as they are expensive.
We should call him Erb.<eos> (laughing)<eos> Well, as a doctor, I have access to some pretty righteous chronic.<eos> You're a pediatrician.<eos> I prescribe it to the parents.<eos> BILLY:<eos> Hmm.<eos> This would be way better if there were four hot women in here.<eos> Yeah, and none of you.<eos> Please, the only way you could satisfy four women is if they were cannibals.
Well, all right. I'm on my way.<eos> What's up, Johnny?<eos> I don't believe we've had the pleasure.<eos> I'm Deputy U.S. Marshal Givens.<eos> This is Brooks.<eos> I think I seen you up here before.<eos> As much as I don't consider myself the type, I have become a frequenter of this particular whorehouse.<eos> Hey, Teri, you step out?<eos> Actually, it's ladies of your establishment we're looking to speak to.<eos> Figure maybe they could help us find someone?
Go back to the hatboxes?<eos> No, we can never go back to the hatboxes.<eos> It's a point of pride.<eos> We have moved beyond the hatbox.<eos> So, you...<eos> Yeah, I have no idea where I put them.<eos> Wow, you really were talking about candles.<eos> I was sure it was code for something good.<eos> I love homemade candles.<eos> They are so hard to find sometimes.

We're laughing at Griffin's shoes.<eos> Why, what's wrong with them?<eos> I don't even know what those are.<eos> What's "Teslik"?<eos> Um, I'm not sure, but my mom says they're very popular with Latvian athletes.
Uh, why not?<eos> I thought they were good at that kind of thing.<eos> Well, they both have minor strengths as well as delusions of grandeur.<eos> It's a bad combination, so I'm gonna call a repairmen.<eos> Hey, what brings you over here so early?<eos> Honestly, man, I just had to get out of the house.<eos> Between Silver and Michaela, man, I feel like the whole house is pregnant.<eos> You need a little estrogen break...<eos> I get it.<eos> These girls, they're great, but they can be a little overwhelming.
Why is there no bomb residue?<eos> So you think whoever did this triggered a ship to explode? We think so.<eos> Russo's trying to use the shrapnel to determine that now.<eos> The witness says he saw Jackar in the area.<eos> Maybe Jackar planned to do this and just kept quiet.<eos> Or...<eos> It actually was a Jedi.<eos> I found something, an anomaly, something that should not be here.<eos> These pieces came from the blast origin.<eos> They are covered with microscopic droids of a highly volatile nature.
If he's still here, he might be planning another attack. Instead of Jedi,<eos> I have droids that can do the job much faster.<eos> So you've found nothing so far?<eos> We have a clue we're following.<eos> But we still don't have answers.<eos> It is imperative that the truth be found soon.<eos> There are whispers the Senate will have a meeting to decide whether the military police will need to become involved in the investigation.<eos> They can't do that.<eos> Clones died in that explosion, maintenance clones working on the gunships as well as civilians.<eos> The Senate tends to take notice of these things no matter where they happen.
So uhm...<eos> Your friends they were telling me about your fiancé, sowing his wild oats in London.<eos> I'm not discussing James with you.<eos> Let me do the talking then.<eos> He's a rich kid, born into command.<eos> Didn't have to earn it the hard way, the real way.<eos> Go ahead, tell me I'm wrong.<eos> But you, working the plant?<eos> You're playing some funny game.<eos> These other girls, they need the money.
He was so decrepit.<eos> I really like helping people.<eos> Running the new Sweetums Foundation charity allows me to do that and work in an office with more mahogany wood than currently remains in the Amazon rain forest.<eos> So, win-win.<eos> Except for the rain forest.<eos> I need you to select your first charity by tomorrow.<eos> Sweetums' public image is currently at an all-time low.<eos> Yeah, there's even a rumor going around that the chocolate is made of rat parts.<eos> You know what they say about rumors.<eos> - Yeah. - They're mostly true.
Ben Wyatt, a great friend and a wonderful man.<eos> May you and Leslie find eternal happiness together. - Hey.<eos> Thanks, you guys.<eos> Thanks for indulging me.<eos> Hey, you want to stick around?<eos> I got a bunch of Homeland episodes burning a hole in my DVR.<eos> No!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> On principle, I cannot stand idly by and watch a bachelor party peter out like this.<eos> Now, I know you said no strippers 'cause they make you sad.
No.<eos> No, don't... don't say that.<eos> That's... we can still fight this.<eos> You can fight this.<eos> Me?<eos> I've got an early retirement package waiting.<eos> Maybe I'll take it.<eos> Good night, Torres.<eos> Good night.<eos> Things aren't what they used to be.
It's "Mary Margaret" here.<eos> No.<eos> You will always be my dear Snow.<eos> I never thought I'd see you again.<eos> Or this.<eos> Oh. I came across it in Mr. Gold's shop, and I knew how much it meant to you.<eos> I knew you had to have it.<eos> Mm. Thank you.<eos> I haven't seen those flowers in a long time.<eos> They reminded me of you, because they could survive the harshest winter, and you were born during the harshest one of all.
He's a perfect afternoon companion.<eos> - He's a woman's best friend.<eos> - It's true.<eos> I'm the Laverne to her Shirley, the Gilmore Girl to her other Gilmore Girl.<eos> Speaking of which?<eos> Season six is locked and loaded.<eos> Subtitles are on.<eos> They speak so fast, those gilmore girls.<eos> We can't understand a word they're saying.<eos> But they sure are charming.
- I'm too young to die.<eos> Sorry, boss.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Maybe I'll protest more tomorrow.<eos> Where are you all going?<eos> Come back here, you traitors!<eos> What do we hate?<eos> Cars.<eos> Why do we hate them?<eos> Because they're stupid and impossible to drive, and everyone... does it better than me.
Records.<eos> Of clients who have stayed at the clinic over the past two years.<eos> Among them, you'll find 18 people also recorded as deceased.<eos> I understand your medical prowess may be on the wane, but even in your heyday, I doubt you could resurrect the dead.<eos> No, the clinic was being used as a one-stop shop for identity theft with the occasional spot of cosmetic surgery when needed - as in Mr Vincent's case - to finish the job.<eos> All run by Dr Jones, under everyone's nose.<eos> We've already established Valerie Dupree was frightened the night that she died.<eos> We also have a witness who saw her clearly uncomfortable in the presence of the man we know as Paul Vincent.<eos> 'I think they were having some kind of lover's tiff.'<eos> Things weren't quite as they seemed.
We should have just done it the regular way.<eos> Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque Du Soleil made it look so easy.<eos> Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?<eos> If you could bend that far, you'd be doing us both a favor.<eos> Hey, Raj, what's up?<eos> You were right. I can't get out of here.<eos> - You're still at my mother's?<eos> - I'm trapped.<eos> My clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys.<eos> I think they might be in her bra because she jingles when she walks.
Hey, you never told me where you were going.<eos> This is everything that I was able to retrieve from the microprocessor inside the victim's watch.<eos> Did you pinpoint the time at which the watch broke?<eos> 12:24 a.m. And it gets better.<eos> This is one of those fancy, high-tech sports watches that reads the victim's heart rate, GPS location, and even the altitude.<eos> Notice how the victim's heart rate was elevated for close to two minutes prior to flatlining.<eos> A person's maximum heart rate is approximately 220 minus their age.<eos> Melinda was 32 years old and her heart rate peaked at 186.<eos> So, maybe she was running from someone?<eos> Or her adrenal glands pumped everything they had into her system.
If it's not about the case,<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> Right.<eos> Look at the sternum.<eos> I found faint postmortem microfractures.<eos> They're consistent with someone receiving CPR after death.<eos> So the killer attempted to resuscitate the victim after the initial attack.<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> But look at these postmortem cuts to both femurs.<eos> They're in line with the femoral arteries.
She doesn't talk to me about boy stuff.<eos> Hasn't since the muppets took Manhattan.<eos> - What?<eos> - She had a weird dream about Gonzo.<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Gonzo's a daredevil who plays the trumpet, okay.<eos> He checks a lot of boxes. I get that.<eos> This guy is no Gonzo.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> The thing about these rims is they're real close to the ground, so they get dirty.
Meanwhile, Dallas was about to take on a new project of her own.<eos> Dalia's appetite for material things was becoming a nightmare.<eos> What in blue blazers is going on in here?<eos> What's the problem, mommy?<eos> Dalia, this closet is bursting at the seams like a Christina Aguilera dress, which is not a comment on her weight, but rather on the tightness of her attire.<eos> I know.<eos> She really crams it in there.<eos> Just like me with my closet.<eos> I need a bigger one.<eos> We have enlarged the closets in your room four times already, and they were generous to begin with.
- Why stop there?<eos> - Who knows who else they'll go after.<eos> - Oh, sure. Let's protect everyone. Scientists, politicians, our most important philosophers.<eos> That'll keep us so busy chasing our tails we won't have any time to chase them.<eos> So run Customs and Immigration, last three weeks see who's going in and out of the country.<eos> Other than usual flags, we're looking for anyone who pulled a visa on less than two weeks' notice, and anyone entering for the first time.<eos> They're using a false identity, my guess is it's gonna be a fresh one.<eos> Milbank, take the lead on surveillance, get eyes on our top priorities.<eos> Tell your wives not to wait up.<eos> They don't see us anyway, sir.
Awkward.<eos> I'm Cosima.<eos> You have my number.<eos> You want answers?<eos> I want the briefcase.<eos> Seriously, it's life-or-death.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Clones?<eos> They're not me.<eos> They're not.

What are you doing here?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I was worried.<eos> What happened? Not here.<eos> Meet me at home.<eos> Don't bring him.<eos> Okay.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah. Your task is more difficult, since the real Beth Childs shot our friend Maggie Chen.<eos> The copies, they're harder to find.
Brilliant, really.<eos> That's brilliant, really.<eos> So, what, you want me to kill her?<eos> No, we don't want to harm her at all.<eos> We want you to bring her in so we can deprogram her, get her the help she needs.<eos> You do this, and we can move forward with a new understanding.<eos> You and your friends will be free to live as you choose, no monitors.<eos> Oh, you're going to give us lives?<eos> You've always had lives.<eos> They haven't been directed, just observed.
He's right there!<eos> It's not him.<eos> Oh, for Christ's sake!<eos> Give me that.<eos> Oh, you're right.<eos> That's not him.<eos> Can I get you anything, Mr. Augustine?<eos> I'm gonna have a smoke.<eos> I haven't indulged in I don't know when.<eos> But circumstances being what they are, I figure what the hell?
Jessica Wedge says they're lame.<eos> So fuck Jessica Wedge.<eos> They all make fun of me.<eos> They call me pigsty.<eos> Did you tell them who your dad is?<eos> I've never even met him.<eos> Well, you tell them.<eos> You tell them, "My dad is Lee Burley, the drummer for Death Maiden."<eos> You see what those smug little bitches say then.<eos> I mean, who are they, huh?
You are the daughter of a rock god.<eos> If he's so rich and famous, why are we so broke?<eos> You know how many girls used to scream at his concerts?<eos> You know, rip their clothes off?<eos> Throw themselves at him?<eos> But your dad chose me.<eos> And together we made you.<eos> Now go get your fucking sneakers.<eos> Don't you listen to those smarty-pants assholes.<eos> They're gonna have boring-ass lives.

So you do like 'em young.<eos> Nah, man, it was all a misunderstanding.<eos> What, do you?<eos> Yeah, I mean, 16, 17, growing into themselves, almost a woman.<eos> Well... not many men would admit it.<eos> Mnh-mnh. I take care of my girls.<eos> I protect 'em from psychos like you.<eos> Like the 13-year-old?<eos> They got to make their money, man.<eos> They're gonna do it anyway.
No, you'll get arrested, and then the cops will think Twitch killed those girls.<eos> Are you scared?<eos> Let's go, bitch.<eos> So, if I see a snake, my black ass is running.<eos> We got three identified girls--<eos> Nicky Velasco, Ashley Kwon, Sandra Helford.<eos> Any matches with Goldie's porn?<eos> Nicky ran away when she was 15.<eos> Sandra, 16.<eos> Nobody reported them missing or even noticed they were gone.
Sheldon "Goldie" Willis.<eos> Has an impressive arrest history for pandering and statutory rape.<eos> Just opened up his juvie records, and I'm liking him more and more.<eos> Age 15 while attempting to rape an 11-year-old,<eos> Goldie held a knife to her throat and threatened to cut her ear to ear if she moved.<eos> Still got eyes on his residence?<eos> Been holed up for the last 24.<eos> He's got to make a move eventually.<eos> So far, we don't have any tangible connection between Goldie and our dead girls.<eos> Besides the fact that they're hookers and he's a pimp?
I don't have a venue for my sister-in-law's baby shower.<eos> Why is it up to you to throw her shower in the first place?<eos> Have one of her high-and-mighty friends throw it for her.<eos> Because it's important to Dale.<eos> But when he asked me to throw his sister's shower, I didn't know there were gonna be five more.<eos> Well, okay, all right. If it's so important to Dale, why don't you ask him for help?<eos> Because Dale's on a run in Santa Fe, like he always is when Earlene has a shower.<eos> You know, she thinks that we owe her because she lent Dale and I money to start our trucking company, but we paid her back a year ago.<eos> Don't you just hate those big, brassy women who take over a room?<eos> They're all sunshine and "y'alls," but you know they're just wishing you a bad day.

I'm not letting a little thing like you dumping me keep us from being together.<eos> That's not usually how this works.<eos> And I got here tonight, there was no parking spot, so I illegally double-parked because I'm not gonna bail due to a problem like that either.<eos> I want to be with you.<eos> I want to try this.<eos> And that's... pretty much all I planned out I was gonna say, and, um, yeah, I'm kind of regretting that.<eos> But I am not gonna bail on this...<eos> Thank you for stopping me.<eos> Oh, I brought you flowers.<eos> They're plastic, so you won't itch.
Nice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm one lucky guy, all right.<eos> You coming, Romeo?<eos> Morning, Gloria.<eos> Wow. Someone's been busy.<eos> Well, like my mom says,<eos> "idle hands make the devil's work."<eos> I don't know about that, but I can use those pies.<eos> They've been flying off the shelves.
I just know it.<eos> That is the last thing I need right now.<eos> You can't give up on love, Gloria.<eos> I'm just giving it a rest, okay?<eos> Now go get your other pies.<eos> Okay.<eos> (Caroline) Where are my flats?<eos> What's the problem now?<eos> My black flats.<eos> They're probably in one of the boxes the movers lost.
Right.<eos> The army dangles a carrot in front of you,<eos> - and you jump for it.<eos> - I don't want to fight, Roland.<eos> I don't either.<eos> And I don't intend to.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> There's nothing to fight about, Joan.<eos> All the issues are on the table.<eos> They have been for some time.
Thank you, Colonel.<eos> Sir.<eos> Anytime.<eos> _<eos> Bye, thanks.<eos> Help you?<eos> Yes. Um, I have some pearls.<eos> Let's have a look.<eos> Those are Akoya pearls with an 18-karat white gold strand.<eos> They belonged to my grandmother, so do not try to lowball me.
You're no fun right now.<eos> What do you mean I'm no fun? I'm-<eos> - I'm tons of fun.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You're a mess.<eos> You need some shut-eye.<eos> I feel great.<eos> You need to go home.<eos> You're not even wearing any shoes.<eos> Why can't things just be the way they were?

Not even my cousin, Olivia.<eos> Rude, right?<eos> So, is that a yes?<eos> Yes, I will help you, Wanda.<eos> You come in here, and instantly you feel a powerful connection to the spirit world.<eos> Because I'm feeling more of a connection to the auto parts store that was here last week.<eos> Welcome, Ms. Breeland.<eos> The tarot cards tell me that you fear an upcoming event.<eos> Well, what else do they say?<eos> They say that this event you fear, you will not have to bear it alone.
And I think, the murderer is a jilted, and perverted, lover who drinks orange juice, and wears fake Miu Miu heels,<eos> Why did it have to be you?<eos> It's a cruel god that makes me bring you in myself.<eos> I know how the story began, but I never guessed it would come to this.<eos> I don't want our relationship to end like this either, but I'm a police officer, and this is my duty.<eos> Yeah, yeah, you're a cop,<eos> You think this is "Infernal Affairs"?<eos> Can you maybe use your brain?<eos> Are bad guys that easy to catch?<eos> I just spilled the drink a minute ago, and I bought these shoes in Europe, and they're genuine.
My uncle is paralyzed, how could he...<eos> Your first boyfriend died three years age, at the same time your uncle was paralyzed.<eos> Pretending to be paralyzed was the best way to avoid suspicion.<eos> Just now, when I fought with your son, he took all the responsibility.<eos> - He said he did it all himself.<eos> - It was me, I killed every on of them!<eos> But after I saw his skill with the needles, I know...<eos> I knew there had to someone else.<eos> You're a very patient man.<eos> When the first three victims got struck, they were moving at high speeds.
You caught a serial killer, and found the thieves who robbed the New York museum.<eos> Two birds with one stone!<eos> Congratulations!<eos> You'll get a promotion.<eos> Huang Fei Hong, you can officially begin your retired life.<eos> Wang Bu Er,<eos> So, you get early retirement and a pension increase, and I get nothing.<eos> Baby!<eos> Can you believe these women today?<eos> They don't even get to know you before they come on to you!
I know you knew that vampire.<eos> I know a lot of dead people.<eos> You killed him to prevent me from finding Katherine to keep me from getting the cure.<eos> Do you really want the cure?<eos> I mean really?<eos> Look.<eos> Let me give you a little bit of advice.<eos> See these girls?<eos> They look happy now.<eos> In 5 years, they're gonna settle for a mediocre starter husband and a mind-numbing career, and about that time, they're gonna realize something you're never gonna have to learn.
- Professor.<eos> Come in.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> What is it?<eos> Well, um, we will soon be undergoing our final examination.<eos> - Yes. - And as you know, the student who scores the highest will be given the opportunity to serve as your research assistant.<eos> I see.<eos> You have consistently scored the highest marks in class for every written and oral exam.<eos> - However... - My surgical technique leaves much to be desired, yes.<eos> Professor, I can't tell you how often I practice, but the moment the scalpel pierces the epidermis, well... my hands begin to tremble and no matter what I do, they...
Was it this car?<eos> Look, like I said, I didn't see him kill anyone, all right?<eos> - I just saw him get into that car.<eos> - Her body was found in this car.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> - Okay, thanks.<eos> How old are your kids?<eos> Five and seven.<eos> I remember when my daughters were that age.<eos> It's a lot of fun until they turn 13.
Tell me, how do you decide who lives or dies?<eos> I base it on suffering, prognosis, will to live, whether they're a pain in the ass or not.<eos> I work in the terminal ward.<eos> It is so easy.<eos> Has Roderick told you what I'd like you to do for me?<eos> He said you wanted me to follow Ryan Hardy.<eos> And?<eos> I've always wanted to live in New York.<eos> All the videos are on this drive.<eos> And they're all indexed in the journals.
So the explosives, the military training, how does this connect to what we know about Joe Carroll?<eos> There's more.<eos> "Tell-tale Heart,"<eos> "Pit and the Pendulum,"<eos> "Mask of the Red Death. "<eos> Carroll's message is alive and well here.<eos> The idea of emotional salvation through death.<eos> See, Joe's stealing from various religions.<eos> You see these images?<eos> They suggest several afterlives.
He's still wearing leg shackles.<eos> All men is unpolished stones.<eos> Ou est le whisky que vous m'avez promis?<eos> And then I ran right home to you.<eos> You did everything great, Bart.<eos> Then you told me all about it like a true gentleman.<eos> I can't wait to use your moves on Lisa.<eos> Ew!<eos> On every level, ew!<eos> Bart, you have to treat girls like they matter, not like they're a bunch of Milhice.
According to the adage used to explain any surprise, "Truth is stranger than fiction."<eos> To get an idea, if we look at the last few months, there's been a feeling of dizziness, a mixture of relief and trepidation, an enthusiasm based on uncertainty dressed up as fact.<eos> Shall we start?<eos> Has it been remastered?<eos> - No, that's the edit.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> "Day 3, number 1."<eos> Hello.<eos> Sales of new homes are collapsing.<eos> According to promoters, they fell by 24% in the first quarter.
She's not moving out.<eos> I'm not talking about her.<eos> Hell no, not her!<eos> I'm talking about you.<eos> When this thing blows up in your face-- and it will blow up in your face, Nick-- you're the one moving out.<eos> You think I like living with you?<eos> You have centipedes living under your bed!<eos> - Those weren't centipedes.<eos> - You've named your testicles,<eos> - and they're both named Sharon.
It's me, Grandpa Edmond.<eos> - What a beauty!<eos> - We've got plenty of time, Dad.<eos> - Let's go home.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hello, Madeleine.<eos> Hello, my son.<eos> Isa, 3.1 kilos, and Léa, 3.2 kilos.<eos> That's great for twins.<eos> They have such pretty eyes.
We would have not one, but two children!<eos> A victory over MRKH.<eos> And why California?<eos> The science is cutting-edge and the success rate high.<eos> Surrogacy is also legal and regulated over there...<eos> It protects the children in case there's an issue.<eos> Except for the issue at the Consulate.<eos> Well, let's try to clarify the situation.<eos> For now, your daughters were born in the States, where they are considered to be your children.<eos> They have American citizenship, but not French citizenship, as the vice-consul has doubts.
You should be relieved.<eos> - You mean...<eos> - You could have been arrested.<eos> But you're free to go.<eos> The weather's nice.<eos> Hello, my darlings.<eos> - Did everything go well?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Your little girls have big news for you.<eos> They took their first steps today. - No! - That's amazing!
Mom!<eos> - How are you, girls?<eos> - Good.<eos> Wait here, I'll be right back.<eos> You wanted to see me, Ms. Dumas?<eos> Yes.<eos> Hello, Mrs. Desprez.<eos> There isn't any problem.<eos> Your girls have great grades.<eos> They're smart, focused... They're very bright.
Put the gate back up.<eos> Calm yourselves.<eos> Be confident, as I am.<eos> I asked the child psychologist to testify.<eos> The twins Isa and Léa Desprez are very happy.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Desprez are loving parents.<eos> It's a perfectly balanced family.<eos> However, if the courts continue with the lawsuit, the twins will suffer from a symbolic deficiency, which the courts will have caused by challenging their filiation.<eos> Furthermore, invalidating that filiation will be catastrophic to their psychological development.<eos> They will be thrown into a world of unknowns, due to the absence of any official filiation.
I put 5 perfect children into the world, but the 6th...<eos> I was so ashamed.<eos> So very much.<eos> I resented myself for the deformity.<eos> I was ashamed and afraid for you.<eos> That's why I always... pushed you to study, so that you would have a good, time-consuming job. You wouldn't have time to think of having children.<eos> My whole life, I've been ashamed of it, Lolo.<eos> And even now, although you have such lovely children, I'm still ashamed.<eos> I will until the day I die.<eos> I wish infertile women didn't commit suicide and that their mothers weren't ashamed. That they didn't feel guilty.
- Sure.<eos> - No, Your Honor.<eos> So, Your Honor... - I, Léa... - Léa... and my sister, Isa...<eos> - Would like to meet with you.<eos> - To meet? OK.<eos> No, girls, don't leave your bikes there!<eos> Help me take them in!<eos> Mom! Mom!<eos> Bravo, my darlings!<eos> They killed me! They're barely 10.
We're gonna have dogs and cats.<eos> I met my third wife!<eos> Hey. - Schmidt...<eos> - Stop it!<eos> You okay, buddy?<eos> Yeah. No, I'm-I'm fine.<eos> It's just, I'm really annoyed about the lighting cues.<eos> Also, our girl-to-guy ratio is taking a real nosedive.<eos> I mean, we're, like, two bro groups away from being a total wiener fest.<eos> It's just really disappointing when things don't work out the way you thought they would, you know?
Neither one of us are Tom Cruise or the other one.<eos> We're both Iceman.<eos> - Yeah. Equals!<eos> - Equals!<eos> You get a lot of girls?<eos> - Um, I don't know.<eos> Yeah...<eos> - Yeah. Me, too.<eos> - I feel like you probably have a lot of game with the ladies.<eos> - I know what they want sexually, and I'm not afraid to give it to them.
The bats flock here to gorge themselves on fruit.<eos> It's what the crowned eagle and her chick have been waiting for.<eos> But they're not alone.<eos> Other eagles have flown in from miles around... fish eagles, martial eagles, and they're all after the bats.<eos> The gamble the crowned eagle took months ago by nesting here has paid off.<eos> She is the only eagle to actually nest in this forest.<eos> The only one who took the risk to breed here, well before the trees came into fruit and the bats flooded in.<eos> She only breeds once every two years, so her timing must be perfect.<eos> In a few months, the bats will leave, but her gamble means her chick will have the best possible start in life.<eos> These grasslands have been grazed and burned and have endured the harshest drought in generations... but with the rains, they're beginning to recover.
And in this world, they must grab every opportunity.<eos> Competition is intense and unrelenting.<eos> Even the forest itself fights its corner with spines and poisonous sap.<eos> Here, every living thing must fight for its space.<eos> Such beauty.<eos> But the flower is self-serving, enticing animals into an unwitting alliance.<eos> Stingless bees.<eos> They have to work hard. The forest flowers make them do so by rationing their nectar, forcing each bee to visit and so pollinate at least a thousand blooms each day.<eos> For the bees, it's worth the effort.<eos> They need the nectar to make honey, which they store in pots.

The hogs will carry the seeds in their stomachs and deposit them far from the parent tree.<eos> Night falls.<eos> But one living community, which is neither animal nor plant continues its never ending work in the darkness.<eos> This ground is alive with fungi that digest all the litter discarded by the forest.<eos> Some rare fungi do so with enzymes that are luminous.<eos> The local people call them "chimpanzee fire."<eos> Without the fungi, the dead vegetation would pile so high the living trees would be submerged.<eos> Dawn, and a new day reveals just how much control the jungle has over its own environment.<eos> The forests of the Congo are the lungs of Africa.<eos> As they use the sunlight to build their tissues, so they release oxygen and water vapour into the air.
Spray blows in from the sea, making the grass salty.<eos> So here elephants can get their tasty salt without having to dig for it.<eos> This mother with her tiny baby can feel the sun on her back.<eos> Here, it's safe for her little one.<eos> They're free to eat in peace.<eos> The bulls have all the room they need.<eos> So there is less risk of a fight.<eos> Everyone, from gorillas to forest hogs, ventures out to relax on the beach.<eos> But the forest creatures can't stay out here forever.<eos> Despite everything... the intense competition, the threats, the darkness... they need their forest, just as their forest needs them.
Not this time.<eos> At last, the sea.<eos> She has to catch a breath if she's not to drown, but the pounding waves make it desperately difficult.<eos> Beyond the surf, calmer water, but even here, the hatchling is not out of danger.<eos> Just in time.<eos> Only one hatchling in a thousand will survive to adulthood, but if she does, she may live for 80 years.<eos> For now, the ocean is there to be explored.<eos> As the hatchling disappears into the deep blue, she swims into the waters of one the planet's most powerful currents. The Agulhas.<eos> The Agulhas sweeps south towards the Cape, transporting a hundred billion gallons of warm water every day.<eos> These tropical seas are so warm, they evaporate on an enormous scale.
But where the water is deep enough to escape these storms, nutrients carried from Africa's interior fuel an explosion of life.<eos> A rare oceanic hunter rules here.<eos> Giant Kingfish.<eos> As big as a man, and weight for weight, one of the most powerful fish in the sea.<eos> Despite their size, they're extraordinarily agile when hunting.<eos> Normally kingfish are solitary, but for just a few weeks each year, they gather at places like Bazaruto and prepare for an extraordinary journey.<eos> One that will take them far inland.<eos> The Mtentu River.<eos> A king of kingfish leads them upstream.<eos> As they travel further into fresh water, they seem to change from aggressive hunters into dedicated pilgrims.

But doing so requires an enormous amount of high-grade fuel.<eos> So this is a great bonanza for them the body of a dead whale.<eos> The carcass will draw in every great white for miles around.<eos> And here, off Cape Town, that means a lot of sharks.<eos> Instead of feeding in a frenzy, these sharks have rather refined table manners.<eos> They swim side-by-side to get the measure of each other. Then each takes its turn.<eos> This female is the biggest, so she eats first.<eos> The next only feeds when she gives way.<eos> The waters of the Benguela are so rich, they support more great white sharks than any other seas on the planet.<eos> And they are so cold, they attract some surprising creatures to these African shores.
And suddenly all these crows come flocking in and start picking them off and you just think, that's just so unfair.<eos> Lots more coming in.<eos> Just loads coming in now.<eos> I do, God, I feel for them.<eos> You know it's really quite upsetting and particularly when you're looking through the camera and I'm just filling frame with a turtle running down the beach, then suddenly from nowhere, a beak comes in and whoosh, that's it.<eos> That turtle's no more.<eos> The turtles that escape the perils of the beach still have to face pounding surf.<eos> But, at last, they're in their element.<eos> More than can be said for the crew.<eos> They're faster than you, aren't they?
A particularly high spring tide flooded the beach.<eos> Any baby turtles still in their nests would be lucky to survive.<eos> See it bubbling out as well. Yeah.<eos> See the air.<eos> Well, it means that basically anything below that line's going to be gone.<eos> Let's hope and pray it's not, but...<eos> As you say, we don't know, let's wait and see.<eos> All across the world, turtles are in decline.<eos> Their eggs are stolen, the adults are hunted for their flesh and they drown in fishing nets.<eos> But here in the Comoros, they have friends.
It's very dry here.<eos> Some years, the rains fail entirely.<eos> A lone Grevy's zebra.<eos> He weighs close to half a tonne, and could go for three days without drinking.<eos> Like the macaques, his forebears were refugees from the advancing Sahara.<eos> The land is scrubby and dry.<eos> But this stallion has claimed it as his own.<eos> He's been waiting months for visitors.<eos> Female visitors.<eos> If they like his territory, they might stay a while.
He too is alone, and eager to start a new colony in his lonely burrow.<eos> Two months later, the princess has become a queen.<eos> And a new tyranny begins.<eos> Tough though they are, such refugees living on the edges of North Africa cannot survive in the heart of the Sahara.<eos> And yet here, in southern Nigeria, there are creatures preparing to journey right across the centre of that great desert.<eos> Barn swallows.<eos> They spent the winter roosting in a forest of elephant grass.<eos> But now, it's time for them to leave.<eos> All two million of them.<eos> They're tiny, each weighing the same as a couple of one pound coins, yet the journey to their breeding grounds in Europe is over 3,000 miles long.
In spite of the Sahara's reputation, less than one-fifth of it is sand.<eos> The rest is stone and wind-scoured rock.<eos> The sun not only bakes the land, it warps its appearance.<eos> The superheated air, rising upward from the desert surface, distorts the distant scene.<eos> A reflection of the sky shimmers on the sands... a mirage.<eos> The sun is an illusionist.<eos> To thirsty travellers, a mirage can resemble a lake which agonisingly recedes as it's approached.<eos> And swaying camels coming to the rescue transform into dry, spiny acacia trees.<eos> To cross this confused, shimmering landscape, many swallows will need to find real water amongst the mirages.<eos> Even in the Sahara, rain does sometimes fall and that is sufficient for plants to survive providing they have the right adaptations.
Even in the Sahara, rain does sometimes fall and that is sufficient for plants to survive providing they have the right adaptations.<eos> Rising from the sand, a dried-out ball of twigs.<eos> In strong winds, it can travel.<eos> This plant may have been dead for 100 years.<eos> Yet its name suggests that all is not lost, for this is a resurrection plant.<eos> Around here, rain might only fall once or twice a year.<eos> But if you're searching for decades, that might be enough.<eos> Dead limbs absorb water and unfurl in a matter of minutes.<eos> But the resurrection plant needs one more miracle.<eos> Rain must fall on its branches before they dry out and close up again.

They too can leap.<eos> With first light, the crocodiles lose the element of surprise, and the battle is over, for now.<eos> The mother fish has survived, but where are her young?<eos> All present and correct.<eos> They spent the whole night sheltering in her mouth.<eos> The contest will be repeated at sunset.<eos> There is nowhere else to go.<eos> Oases are always sought by desert travellers, but not all are as they seem.<eos> This is the great Ubari Sand Sea, in the heart of the Sahara.<eos> These swallows have travelled 1,500 miles since they left Nigeria.

He's on a stake-out.<eos> Flashy scales reflect some of the sun's rays.<eos> Nevertheless, the heat is almost unbearable.<eos> His prey hasn't left home all day.<eos> The lizard is the last animal still out on the dunes.<eos> But even he can't take it any more.<eos> To survive longer, you would need a spacesuit.<eos> And in a way, that's what these insects have.<eos> Silver ants' armoured skin reflects light.<eos> They can tolerate temperatures that would kill any other land animal.

In the meantime, crews are shooting all across North Africa.<eos> In Egypt, the challenge is to get into the world of the most heat-tolerant desert animal, the silver ant.<eos> They're really small, they're really fast.<eos> Like, you're not too sure if you've seen an ant.<eos> The crew have three weeks to gather the footage they need.<eos> We're going to try a tracking shot on this ant nest.<eos> Moving forward towards it, as the ants pour out of the hole in their millions.<eos> Not only are these insects super-fast, they also keep antisocial hours.<eos> The thing is, we need to be out here in the middle of the day to film these ants.<eos> They don't do what they do when it's nice and cool at seven, eight o'clock in the morning.
This was the scene in Amboseli National Park in 2009.<eos> The park is home to nearly one and a half thousand elephants.<eos> And this was the worst drought for half a century.<eos> 60% of zebras and 95% of wildebeest were wiped out.<eos> The seasonal rains had failed for the last two years.<eos> And the elephants that lived here were slowly starving.<eos> The park created to protect them is now surrounded by farmland.<eos> The elephants had little choice of where else to go.<eos> Caught up in this catastrophe were three sisters.<eos> They are the frontline for elephant protection in the park.

For the sisters, who know each elephant personally, this is a terrible moment.<eos> It is something that we feel in our hearts.<eos> You can imagine the kind of feelings that we get.<eos> You know, knowing those elephants and seeing something like that happen. It really touches us.<eos> It was a tough year for all the young elephants in the region.<eos> We lost all the calves who were born that year.<eos> All of them.<eos> We lost them.<eos> There was nothing the sisters could do to save the baby.<eos> But they were determined to save any elephants they could, especially mothers who could breed again.
As more tropical forest is felled, some scientists are seeing a correlation with changing storm patterns across Europe and America.<eos> And it's likely to become more extreme.<eos> Staggeringly, 50 percent of the Congo basin forest has been allocated for logging.<eos> The future of Africa's forests has never been more critical for us all.<eos> But the consequences of global warming aren't limited to the land.<eos> Africa is almost completely surrounded by oceans.<eos> Here on the east coast, there are animals feeling the change in climate in a most surprising way.<eos> This is a young female green turtle.<eos> During her lifetime, she will travel thousands of miles, through the ocean, looking for food.<eos> Turtles return to the same beach from which they hatched to lay their own eggs.
These creatures form the basis of life in the park.<eos> This is so much fun.<eos> These little invertebrate creatures, the creatures that do most of the work, turn most of the energy, save most of the material, and allow us to re-insert big animals with some confidence.<eos> Have you got it in the vial yet?<eos> - Yeah, I got three of them.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> Professor Wilson was one of the first scientists to explore this area, together with local wildlife biologist<eos> Tonga Torcheeda.<eos> That's a good one.<eos> If you could gather them all up, all these little invertebrate creatures, and weigh them, they would weigh... far more than all of the big animals put together, even in a fully restored park.
They took him away from his mother a few weeks ago because she couldn't protect him any more.<eos> He's very vulnerable, so he would have been killed by predators.<eos> It's like filling up a petrol tank.<eos> Every rhino is precious.<eos> And so it seems a fitting end for the final scene of the series.<eos> No one knows what the future holds for this little creature.<eos> Nor, indeed, what changes will take place in the great continent on which he lives.<eos> David, I found that...<eos> Gosh, there's ants.<eos> They're everywhere, yeah, hang on.
He once doubled-down 20 grand on 16.<eos> How awesome is that?<eos> It was even more awesome when I laid down a five and he threw me a $1,000 chip in return.<eos> As awesome as that story is, uh, we got to figure out what we're doing for grandma's dinner.<eos> Look, I know ma asked for small, but in Angela speak, that is code for big.<eos> Look, I say we do a costume party, like the ones dad used to throw.<eos> No, we could get the whole gang back together from Commack.<eos> Even better, we make it a surprise.<eos> You know the best thing about surprise parties?<eos> Knowing when they're coming.
I heard this story about this girl whose Had like a fingernail, and this guy's tongue got... yeah, I heard about that. Sliced open.<eos> What's with you dudes?<eos> Where's the 'tang?<eos> I need to shoot the silk milk before our big game.<eos> - Empty the nuts! - All: Yeah.<eos> - Empty nu... yeah. - We know.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm so used to doing it, I... you think my nuts are ever full?<eos> - Like, so many...<eos> - Oh, the... the girls, whoa, they're close, and then it says that they're juicing' for you.

Above her crack, actually.<eos> I was there.<eos> Figures.<eos> I knew when she saw me hanging out with you, she'd try to use you next.<eos> She's the most vindictive person I know.<eos> All she cares about is hurting the people who hurt her.<eos> So just be careful around her.<eos> Dalia and Jenna used to hook up?<eos> It was crazy, but also weirdly made sense.<eos> Suddenly I understood Dalia's lesbian jokes for what they were... a deflection.
Oh, my God.<eos> Yeah, I had the same reaction.<eos> Why are you lying to us?<eos> Me and Rutherford, we did talk about the audition, and about me crashing at his place.<eos> Yeah, in rehab, months ago!<eos> Yeah, that's true.<eos> I never followed up.<eos> And I did tell you it was a done deal, and... and then when I tried to call I couldn't get ahold of him, so...<eos> I got a bad habit of that, sweetheart.<eos> I... I make these big promises, and then... when they fall flat... Disappear.
[Chuckles] Do you want to tell us why?<eos> Not particularly.<eos> You should reconsider.<eos> We got you, but the vigilante got away before E.S.U. could move on him.<eos> You know who he is.<eos> Who he really is.<eos> Don't you?<eos> [Laughs] Ms. Bertinelli, you're going away for all day, we can't change that.<eos> But things can be better.<eos> Or they could be worse.
Are you going to be okay on your own?<eos> A kid misbehaved.<eos> An adult needs to discipline him.<eos> You're a kid yourself, Tony, an obstinate, stubborn kid.<eos> Are you going to scold me, Pepper?<eos> Why do you keep putting me in that position?<eos> I don't want to be the only adult in this relationship.<eos> It's intriguing, though.<eos> I find I'm drawn to more mature women.<eos> Especially when they're beautiful.
At least you'll be taken care of by a bunch of hot nurses!<eos> I'm glad you're okay, Tony, but if you do anything like that again, I'll kill you myself.<eos> I hear you, Pepper.<eos> When a child is bad, you need to scold him.<eos> You're an obstinate child who needs discipline.<eos> And it's an adult's duty to provide that discipline.<eos> Do you hate women who scold?<eos> Not really.<eos> All boys look up to authority figures.<eos> Especially when they're as beautiful as you.
That's it?<eos> A rifle?<eos> That'd be a great idea if I was hunting bear in Montana.<eos> I was told you wanted something untraceable and something fast.<eos> Fast and untraceable does not mean some assembly will be required.<eos> Well, this is all I got.<eos> It's supposed to be for my protection.<eos> How am I supposed to protect myself or my product and I can't even put that up under my shirt?<eos> This is better.<eos> This eliminates the threats before they make it through your door.
Thanks, Fong.<eos> All you need is a bed, right, babe?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> A bed.<eos> A place to lay your keppie, and this would make the perfect apartment, no?<eos> What's your problem?<eos> You don't like guns?<eos> You got one on your hip.<eos> This is a necessity of the job, okay, but I do not love guns the way you love guns.<eos> If purchased legally and used responsibly, they're a civilian's best friend.

The prostitutes can happily make a statement<eos> Research has shown that the Swedish ban didn't have the desired effect<eos> Look at the facts.<eos> I've organised a hearing about this.<eos> All the facts speak for a ban.<eos> - The prostitutes haven't been heard.<eos> The experts in field have been heard.<eos> Don't sex workers themselves understand their own occupation?<eos> I don't see prostitution as an occupation<eos> Are we agreed that prostitutes pay tax... and this means that they have an occupation?
- Yes, it's me.<eos> The number of street prostitutes isn't growing explosively.<eos> So these figures don't match the reality.<eos> Shelter is understaffed and underfinanced.<eos> Something must have gone wrong.<eos> There were 400 too many counted of the 1300.<eos> Will you question Pernille about the figures?<eos> I've worked there myself. I've spoken with masses of girls.<eos> You're only talking about street prostitutes.<eos> They make up 20% of the total number of prostitutes in Denmark
Sex workers' receptionists are accused of being pimps... unless they can show that their work is a secondary source of income<eos> There are lots of examples of ambiguity in the legislation<eos> We want to clarify the rights of sex workers.<eos> We're thinking of a licence, to gain control over this occupation.<eos> Come on.<eos> Break a leg.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> In the clubs there must be fixed working hours. The number of clients falls between 10 and 40 per month.<eos> Research has shown... that sex workers are no more psychologically damaged than the average Dane.<eos> And no matter how strange it might sound... many women like their work, otherwise they'd go do something else.
Yeah, Danforth took pictures.<eos> That's why I went back the next day to tell him to give them back.<eos> So the men took polaroids the night they worked you over?<eos> You know, I heard clicks.<eos> I seen flashes.<eos> I said, "Stop it."<eos> I said, "No more pictures."<eos> Then I went back to Danforth.<eos> I tried to grab them from him.<eos> They fell all over the floor.
Or your daughter's dead."<eos> Damn it.<eos> Uncle Mike, is that you?<eos> You touch my granddaughter?<eos> Doesn't look very interesting.<eos> That will work to our advantage.<eos> So we still have five days until the shipment arrives.<eos> But as you can see, we're thoroughly prepared now.<eos> Is that true, Mrs. Walraven?<eos> The boats now have additional storage, high-tech radar, and I've leased the marina dry dock to store the weapons when they come in.
Yes, I am the one that asked for the meeting.<eos> Now I'm asking to cancel it.<eos> Mr. Schiller asks that you come anyway.<eos> He'll see you at noon.<eos> (Whispers) Damn it.<eos> (Normal voice) Gabriel.<eos> Gabriel?<eos> In here.<eos> What happened to the bins?<eos> You're the only one who knew where they were.
Gabriel?<eos> In here.<eos> What happened to the bins?<eos> You're the only one who knew where they were.<eos> The bins you said you dumped?<eos> Okay.<eos> I haven't dumped them yet.<eos> But if I don't find them now, I am in serious trouble.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, that's what Uncle Irwin said.<eos> So I told him where they were.
I know how you feel.<eos> And I'm confident that I can get you out of this without endangering your father.<eos> But first we need to be absolutely certain that he's still alive.<eos> How do we do that?<eos> Find Helen Crowley.<eos> Start with a simple phone call.<eos> I want to talk to Amanda.<eos> Let me give you some free marital advice, J.P.<eos> She's only gonna tell you more lies 'cause that's what wives do.<eos> They screw you over.
A little under the weather?<eos> Oh, just a little.<eos> You needed me?<eos> Yes, how's it feel to be an equity partner?<eos> Good.<eos> The power surging through you?<eos> Something's surging through me.<eos> So the, um, Bishop defense.<eos> I was looking over the billable hours.<eos> They're coming in a bit high.
That's for me to know and you to find out.<eos> No, that's for me to know, too.<eos> Discovery.<eos> Then take me to court.<eos> You want me to take you to court?<eos> I can't wait for you to take me to court.<eos> I love the shape of your lips.<eos> - You leave my lips out of it.<eos> - I can't.<eos> They're so pillowy.
- Hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> - You two ready to kick off your romantic weekend?<eos> - Yes.<eos> She doesn't know where we're going, so nobody say anything.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is it safe to mention the earrings?<eos> Are those emeralds?<eos> They're beautiful.
Hey.<eos> - You two ready to kick off your romantic weekend?<eos> - Yes.<eos> She doesn't know where we're going, so nobody say anything.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is it safe to mention the earrings?<eos> Are those emeralds?<eos> They're beautiful.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> They were my grandmother's.
We'll hide you, put him in your place, wait for them to come in -<eos> And then what?<eos> ! You are only two!<eos> Well three, so- Better make that two.<eos> Think I mighta grabbed the tail of the dragon here...<eos> Ooh, then you're in for a treat!<eos> Shut up! And with all due respect Your Holiness, it's the Swiss Guard...<eos> I think we can handle a few court jesters with, whatever, halberds.<eos> Which, you realize are just ceremonial.<eos> Obviously they're ceremonial, they were made obsolete by the arquebus.
Oh.<eos> Which is why where's the gear bag with all of our automatic weapons?<eos> !<eos> Well I assume in the hotel room, but- God -<eos> I thought they just had halberds!<eos> Do you at least have a sidearm? !<eos> It was ruining the lines of my cassock.<eos> Dammit!<eos> And again, I honestly thought they just had - halberds.<eos> Although technically I think they're called voulges.
- Hello.<eos> Is that her?<eos> I -- oh right, he can't see us.<eos> Which has really got me...<eos> nettled!<eos> Alright, Mr. Tunt, send them down.<eos> But if this is some sort of ruse...<eos> Are -- was there a follow-up, or...?<eos> No, I was leaving the consequences to your imagination.<eos> But trust me, they are grave.
Alzheimer's.<eos> Yeah, they got saved from closure with 5,000 signatures so in that case, you know, it worked.<eos> I mean it could all come up again.<eos> Let's get signatures, then.<eos> Yeah, go down Hampstead High Street.<eos> People love to get involved, don't they?<eos> Bored housewives.<eos> How bored?<eos> What?<eos> These housewives, how bored are they?
I mean it could all come up again.<eos> Let's get signatures, then.<eos> Yeah, go down Hampstead High Street.<eos> People love to get involved, don't they?<eos> Bored housewives.<eos> How bored?<eos> What?<eos> These housewives, how bored are they?<eos> They bored sexually?<eos> Are they choosy?
Let's get signatures, then.<eos> Yeah, go down Hampstead High Street.<eos> People love to get involved, don't they?<eos> Bored housewives.<eos> How bored?<eos> What?<eos> These housewives, how bored are they?<eos> They bored sexually?<eos> Are they choosy?<eos> They want a bit of twinage?
You're a stud bull, aren't you, baby?<eos> Hold that thought.<eos> Mom!<eos> Jump in between us.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Wasn't sure when to bring this up, but maybe I could use a little warm-up this time.<eos> Warming up, like a jog around the block?<eos> 'Cause if you're asking Kev to go down on you,<eos> I can tell you right now that is not happening.<eos> Women are more likely to conceive if they have an orgasm.
And take the credit for doing something nice when you actually did nothing?<eos> Well, to be fair, at that point, I will have carried it all the way over there, so...<eos> You're taking Mandy for granted.<eos> Why?<eos> What'd she tell you?<eos> She's kind, she's devoted, she's not someone whose feelings you can ignore, so stop being a dope, and put her feelings first every once in a while.<eos> School is a time to experiment with your minds and with your genitalia.<eos> Now, the human genitalia, to me, is like a homing device... God's compass. Huh?<eos> And each of us has it, and it guides us to our destined homes.<eos> Now, our devices don't work if we try to point 'em in a direction that they don't want to go in.
We've earned that right.<eos> Do you want to spend time with him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, that's wonderful.<eos> He is so special.<eos> You know, I saw this movie the other day about babies around the world.<eos> Do you know that mothers in Africa wipe their babies' dirty bottoms on their knees?<eos> - Where's Jody?<eos> - At the Wongs'.<eos> And then they use leaves to scrape the poop off.
Because I'd like to hang out with C-3PO in my lifetime and at the rate you're going, that's not gonna happen.<eos> I'm not following.<eos> You don't wanna go to classes, you just wanna play in a lab?<eos> I don't wanna sit in a lecture that teaches me how to modify algorithms instead of think for myself.<eos> And?<eos> Okay, the people working the weaving machines in the 17th century they didn't see the steam engine coming.<eos> One invention, industrial revolution.<eos> Encyclopedia Britannica didn't see Wikipedia coming.<eos> Great things don't happen in tiny little increments.<eos> You know, they happen when someone thinks completely differently.
Do you know, if we lived here, that would count as quality ass?<eos> Clyde thinking he's better than everyone else yet again.<eos> Not everybody.<eos> But her, yes.<eos> Why?<eos> That woman is not an indication of everyone in Omaha.<eos> Kid, wait one second.<eos> I got to ask you a question.<eos> What do the girls look like in your class?<eos> They're all kind of gross.

[Applause]<eos> What was that?<eos> Hey.<eos> Come walk with me.<eos> Witches aren't allowed to do magic here.<eos> She broke the rules.<eos> I told you I wanted to talk to her.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> I got caught up in the show.<eos> Those witches, they think that they still have power in this town.
Fine.<eos> Why don't you show me what you've done with the place while you explain exactly what it is you've been up to in my town.<eos> [Chuckles] Follow me.<eos> Look at that skyline.<eos> That there, that's progress.<eos> More hotels, more tourists, more fresh blood.<eos> And the humans?<eos> I taught them to look the other way.<eos> And what of the witches?<eos> In my time, they were a force to be reckoned with, and now they live in fear.

Max, give it to me!<eos> Whether you believe it or not, you're above that.<eos> And you know what?<eos> We're above this.<eos> Forget this.<eos> Let's go out.<eos> I mean, I'm newly single, and you're not picky.<eos> True.<eos> I'm ready to let my hair down and have one of those crazy yet fiscally responsible kind of nights.<eos> You mean steal other girls' drinks when they go to the bathroom?
I'm a trooper.<eos> I'd have it in my mouth.<eos> Tears would be streaming down my face, but it'd all be worth it, just so I could split the occasional bill.<eos> That's why lesbians are so bloody angry... neither of them know who's gonna pay.<eos> One of them's sitting there thinking, "well, I put the effort in."<eos> I've shaved my head.<eos> I've got a brand-new plaid shirt.<eos> "She better treat me like a princess."<eos> Yep, you're an asshole.<eos> Why do they always look like men if they hate us so much?
- This is from the ocean.<eos> - The shell is gonna cut her.<eos> - It stinks.<eos> - Get that out of here.<eos> - But it's nature.<eos> I need, like, a vegetable.<eos> Her retina's gonna detach.<eos> You've gotta hold that in.<eos> Here's a couple of shrimp.<eos> They're very dull.
Brains!<eos> Uh, could we get something other than brains?<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> We're the characters from the TV show "Schoolhouse Rock!"<eos> 20 years ago, we taught kids basic grammar and math with music, but those kids grew into illiterate adults.<eos> So, we're back with new songs since nobody seems to remember the [bleep] we tried to teach 20 years ago.<eos> Remember me? I sang "Conjunction Junction."<eos> Let's talk about one way your grammar doesn't function.<eos> ♪ Apostrophes are really fun ♪<eos> ♪ they mean something is owned by him or her ♪
You're still hanging on.<eos> No.<eos> You did just call him heroic.<eos> Okay, maybe I'm hanging on a little.<eos> But I am not telling her.<eos> Besides, I am moving on, cold turkey.<eos> It is over, done, finito.<eos> Okay, well here's to "I am woman, hear me drink."<eos> Cheers.<eos> Things are not as they seem.
We could go somewhere we could drive to.<eos> Central America, Mexico.<eos> You know how much I love margaritas.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> All right, let's just start with a milkshake.<eos> I'll never say no to a milkshake.<eos> Watch the road.<eos> Road, right, right.<eos> Nothing so far.<eos> She has pill bottles in the bathroom, but they all have legit prescriptions.
My prints...<eos> Catherine got rid of any trace.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I am such an ass.<eos> Can't say I'm going to argue with you there.<eos> Ah, get it, I got to go.<eos> Didn't expect to hear from you.<eos> I didn't expect to call, but I found a bug in my office.<eos> I'm assuming not a cockroach?<eos> I ran it for prints; they're classified, the prints.
That's all I can remember.<eos> Hey. You did good, Debra.<eos> We are gonna find you.<eos> Deidre's gonna stay with you.<eos> Debra, I'm here.<eos> I'm gonna stay on the line with you, okay?<eos> There's 8 different railroad crossings in Milton County.<eos> Okay, but she's to the east, Cedarville State forest.<eos> It's 3,000 acres.<eos> There's 12 access roads, they're all gravel.
Please.<eos> Understand, Colonel.<eos> The Volm have, over time, developed specific strategies for engaging the Espheni.<eos> Yes, well, I would certainly hope so.<eos> What my son is trying to say is that we have no need for your participation in this war.<eos> The war is over for you.<eos> It is over for all human beings.<eos> The Volm are well-equipped to carry the fight to the enemy.<eos> Your military forces are no longer needed.<eos> In fact, they will only be in the way.
So, Jeanette's squatting in your room?<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> We heard you screaming from three blocks away.<eos> Why is she in there?<eos> Lily, there is no reason why.<eos> That's like asking why is the earth round?<eos> Why does the sun come up in the morning?<eos> What do I do for a living?<eos> There are some questions we're not meant to know the answer to.<eos> Crazy girls are crazy because they're crazy.
Seriously.<eos> But that was last night.<eos> I mean, it's not like...<eos> Listen, Jeanette, we really need to have a serious talk about our...<eos> So, did Lily leave these boots here or was it some other bitch?<eos> Marshall, Barney, help me!<eos> I don't think they're coming.<eos> I guess not.<eos> It's those red boots.<eos> They just look sexy on everyone.
Something not even your little machines could fix.<eos> Randall is in the tower.<eos> - God knows what he can do.<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> What could Randall possibly do to me?<eos> This is bigger than what happens to you and me.<eos> The person i love most on this planet is in her 16th year of stage four cancer.<eos> She's a miracle.<eos> Those nanites are inside of her, eating away at her tumors, just like they were inside of Danny.<eos> They do more than keep the power off.
You don't know me-- Or my situation.<eos> You're right, i don't.<eos> But i do know that right now you have a choice, And you're gonna have to live with it.<eos> Unfortunately, i had to live with far worse.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I told you not to follow me.<eos> My choice just became... Much easier.<eos> All right, they kept the girls in a dorm Somewhere in this area, But now that lynch doesn't need them anymore...<eos> Wh-What do you mean, doesn't need them?<eos> They're just guinea pigs, lab rats.
She's stuck in that house with her mother with no plans to leave.<eos> She needs help, she needs you.<eos> You're such a good team.<eos> (P.A.): Just a reminder of today's lunch time meeting at the glee club.<eos> All those boys gunning for action... they must be loving this!<eos> They can keep their French beach.<eos> I'd rather be up on a rooftop with a pretty girl.<eos> How you like the olives?<eos> Buonissimi, huh?<eos> They must be hard to come by.
- So it's...<eos> - Sometimes you get a bone with the breast.<eos> - No, because...<eos> - It's not as...<eos> - It's not. If you've got...<eos> - Not in a pure breast.<eos> No, that's why you have to go for the legs.<eos> - Yeah, the legs are good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They're quite sexy.
- Yeah?<eos> Mmm. I've got quite pronounced clavicles.<eos> - You can see.<eos> If I do that...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If I do that, you can really... you really notice how the clavicles<eos> - are quite...<eos> - They're massive, aren't they?<eos> - ... pronounced, aren't they?<eos> - Yeah, they are. Yeah.
- You can see.<eos> If I do that...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If I do that, you can really... you really notice how the clavicles<eos> - are quite...<eos> - They're massive, aren't they?<eos> - ... pronounced, aren't they?<eos> - Yeah, they are. Yeah.<eos> - You can see, can't you?<eos> - Yeah, they're right...
Have we yet mentioned... that our son is five?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> We're not really sure that your act is necessarily... age-appropriate.<eos> We just wanna keep it real, you know.<eos> I think kids need a warning these days.<eos> Not that real, though, 'cause I saw your lips move.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - While you were doing the "MacDonald" song.<eos> - You didn't see my lips move.<eos> - They didn't move.
( stammering ) I see...<eos> I'm not seeing... like, not seriously, no.<eos> Don't you like to go out?<eos> Don't you like to take a girl out,<eos> - show her the town?<eos> - I love to do that.<eos> But it's tricky out there.<eos> It's not like when you were...<eos> Women are scary now.<eos> They're no different than they were when I was young.

Which means they were stalking you.<eos> Or us.<eos> What if this is the Replicator.<eos> I just came from the Director's office.<eos> He doesn't like the idea that his agents are being taunted and he wants me to keep him personally in the loop.<eos> Catch me up, please.<eos> Okay, so, uh, the flowers cleared all of our security checkpoints.<eos> Which means there's no explosives, no chemical residue.<eos> Nothing.<eos> They were ordered from a local florist- - Wendy's Bloomers.
Okay, so, uh, the flowers cleared all of our security checkpoints.<eos> Which means there's no explosives, no chemical residue.<eos> Nothing.<eos> They were ordered from a local florist- - Wendy's Bloomers.<eos> I checked Wendy, her bloomers, the employees the delivery service.<eos> They all came out clean.<eos> I managed to track down the credit card.<eos> It's a stolen card number, and it was ordered from a prepaid cell phone in Philadelphia.<eos> But it's all about the message he's trying to send.<eos> But they were sent to JJ.
That sounds terrible.<eos> One day I just came home from work and they were gone.<eos> Poof.<eos> Did your wife ever say anything about leaving?<eos> Not a word.<eos> She just packed up the girls and left.<eos> They're my kids.<eos> My kids.<eos> They were so little then.<eos> They didn't understand.
You said...<eos> I said what?<eos> Peggy, she said, if I changed my mind about them, if I didn't want you to use them...<eos> You said you were OK with it.<eos> You said it was fine.<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> I had a lot of wine.<eos> Well, that's not our fault.<eos> I'm-I'm sorry, but I don't want you to use the pictures.<eos> It's too late now, they're at the printers.
It's a lot of blood.<eos> It looks like Michelle was still bleeding out when the unsub dumped her here.<eos> He was probably with her the whole night.<eos> A large pickup truck or an SUV would go unnoticed in these parts.<eos> Give him room to work.<eos> A bachelorette party and a speed-dating function.<eos> Both female victims were in situations that would have drawn the attention of the men around them.<eos> So maybe the unsub was on the prowl.<eos> The women could have enraged him by rejecting his advances.<eos> Well, they didn't reject him right away, though.
I've got some good news.<eos> And, as Prosecutor General, you go along with this argument?<eos> That's true, yes.<eos> Thank you for calling me.<eos> A procedural error?<eos> What exactly is a procedural error?<eos> Well... the law is complex.<eos> All kinds of strict rules have been incorporated to prevent arbitrary arrest or detention.<eos> Those rules are there with good reason.<eos> They protect the innocent, of course, but the guilty can occasionally use them too and that is what has happened now.
The film's called "Monte Carlo, Monte Carla."<eos> It's the latest in his around the world comedy series, and my first Woody Allen Audition since he blacklisted me ten years ago.<eos> Boy, jazz sucks, huh?<eos> Right?<eos> What?<eos> Come on.<eos> It's a dead art.<eos> We were all thinking it!<eos> This is my shot at redemption.<eos> I get it, and to show my support of you, I'm gonna buy the movie tickets, but they're gonna be for tuesday, and we're gonna see...
I'm so sorry.<eos> I've gotta head back to the office.<eos> Is there any way that... that we can do this exact same thing tomorrow Night?<eos> Tomorrow's great.<eos> I'll... you then.<eos> You left out "See" On purpose.<eos> I did.<eos> Ugh. Forgot the olives.<eos> June! June, hey. Do we have any olives?<eos> Yeah, they're in the fridge.
What does it say on every piece of paperwork and on every sign-off sheet?<eos> - It says C6.<eos> - It says C6.<eos> And you know why?<eos> Because, eventually, when my building is complete, it will be 55 floors high. It will weigh 2,223,000 metric tons.<eos> Okay? My building will alter the water table and squeeze granite.<eos> It will be visible from 20 miles away.<eos> At sunset, it will cast a shadow probably a mile long.<eos> Now, if the concrete at the base of my building is not right, if it slips half an inch, cracks appear.<eos> Right? If cracks appear, then they will grow and grow, won't they?
I was 23 years old and this old cunt comes from the fucking blue sky.<eos> He says, "Guess what, everybody.<eos> - What?<eos> - Ivan.<eos> - What?<eos> - Ivan, it's all going to hell.<eos> What?<eos> The rebars in the shuttering in pit six, they wouldn't hold a fucking kitten's fart.<eos> It's those mavericks from up north we put in there at the last minute.<eos> - What tension did they hold?

In the future, don't let rage decide for you.<eos> Don't overstep the limits that the gods have set.<eos> What limits?<eos> Anger and excess that push men to crime.<eos> Apollo reminds us that order and moderation must rule.<eos> I'll remember.<eos> You're my father.<eos> I owe you respect, but war taught me other laws.<eos> Not the ones I taught you.<eos> - They kept me alive.
You didn't want a second child.<eos> We very much wanted a second child.<eos> Where's your grandma?<eos> Is she there?<eos> Grace, where are you?<eos> Grandma,<eos> - Mom wants to talk to you.<eos> - God.<eos> Look, we went out to the cars,<eos> - but they were blocked by...
They have our daughter, too.<eos> Show them the sketch.<eos> A neighbor spotted this man coming out of the farmhouse driveway after the girls were taken.<eos> Do either of you recognize him?<eos> No, he's not familiar.<eos> So what's our next step?<eos> The Skype call was made over a cellular data network, so we have isolated the signal to a 30-square-kilometer area.<eos> 30-square kilometers is the whole city.<eos> I know.<eos> But hopefully, an analysis of the video will give us a clue as to where they're being held.
But hopefully, an analysis of the video will give us a clue as to where they're being held.<eos> In the meantime, we're reaching out to the embassy to estab--<eos> Reaching out?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> There are certain protocols we have to follow before we can move forward, permissions we have to get.<eos> And how long will that take?<eos> A day or two at the most.<eos> A day or...<eos> Our daughters are out there right now.<eos> They need our help right now.
I don't care.<eos> Gaston, please.<eos> Stay close to your phone.<eos> Yo, Beckett.<eos> They didn't fly to Paris, at least not at first.<eos> FAA shows a Dassault Falcon departing Teterboro to Brussels<eos> 18 hours after the girls were taken.<eos> The plane was then designated a Medical Angel Flight, transporting two young women awaiting organ transplant from Brussels to Paris.<eos> Alexis and Sara.<eos> French immigration met the plane and processed the girls before they were loaded onto an ambulance.

Mr. Beale.<eos> The shooting took place four days ago in Griffith Park, but the body wasn't identified until yesterday.<eos> An Indonesian national, Rachmed Santoso.<eos> Mr. Santoso was a vocal supporter of radical Islam and a suspected arms dealer.<eos> Increased chatter amongst Taliban groups in Afghanistan in recent weeks indicates a terrorist attack against the United States is imminent.<eos> Yes.<eos> Speaking.<eos> Uh, Santoso dropped off the grid ten days ago, after his name was mentioned in several cell phone intercepts, suggesting he had an involvement in the crime.<eos> - What happened to his shoes?<eos> - They're missing.
- Sabrina, as a landscaper, if you really wanted to hit us where it hurt, you'd have called us aspen canker fungus.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Five gallons of the finest Grade C, non-organic maple syrup ever imported from South America.<eos> Nothing like a belly full of warm maple syrup soup when you're getting ready for the great pulling of the trees.<eos> Must take a lot of syrup to sugarcoat the murdering of all those trees.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You don't hear anyone whining about the trees at Christmas when the whole world chops 'em down and drags 'em into their living room.<eos> Because that's a tradition, not some crazy, made-up way to spend a holiday.<eos> So, uh, you guys are just here for the syrup then? Yeah?<eos> That's what traditions are-- they're all made-up, they're all crazy.
Maybe it was an Arbor Day miracle.<eos> You grew up today, Jimmy.<eos> I'm passing my Arbor Day costume on to you.<eos> You go, Papa Woody.<eos> Papa Woody...<eos> Oh, now I get it.<eos> Right?<eos> He's like the dad of the forest.<eos> When you form a family of your own, sometimes old traditions go through a change.<eos> But that doesn't mean they're not just as special.
We promise we won't tell anyone.<eos> No. Wait.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's forbidden, man.<eos> They gonna kill me.<eos> Please.<eos> All right, look for a price, y'all can be smuggled across hell's border.<eos> - By who?<eos> - Rogue reapers.<eos> They got secret ways in and out.
Please.<eos> All right, look for a price, y'all can be smuggled across hell's border.<eos> - By who?<eos> - Rogue reapers.<eos> They got secret ways in and out.<eos> And not just hell.<eos> The veil, heaven.<eos> Rogue reapers smuggling people?<eos> People, souls.<eos> So, what, they're like hell coyotes?
He didn't make it.<eos> They were on their way to pick up their daughter from a sleepover.<eos> Their daughter?<eos> She was 12.<eos> She got into trouble after her parents' accident.<eos> Nobody's heard from her since.<eos> Folks have been donating to cover Gertrude's care over the years.<eos> It's a sweet gesture, but the truth is, she's gone.<eos> She ever get any visitors?<eos> A couple nurses said they thought they saw someone in here reading to her, but nobody's ever officially signed in to visit her.
Oh, we have to get the wedding cake.<eos> I'll do that too.<eos> I'm perfectly calm.<eos> I feel like every crazy thing Leslie's ever had me do has been, like a drill, and today is the real thing.<eos> I'm ready, because I had the greatest teacher in the world.<eos> Leslie.<eos> Who is crazy.<eos> Also, we need rings and marriage licenses.<eos> Oh, let me be on rings.<eos> I love what they symbolize.
No, I just realized that in a world without love, pain and death are a foregone conclusion, so why fear what you can't control?<eos> Andrew's been commissioned to shoot a film to raise funds for the Jeffersonian, so we are to give him access to everything we do.<eos> As long as he's not in the way.<eos> Trust me, you won't even know I'm here.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh, by, uh, wearing the camera, I give the audience an immersive experience.<eos> The camera sees and feels what I see and feel.<eos> Amazing.<eos> No, it's ridiculous.<eos> Cameras are inanimate objects; they have no feelings.
What vows?<eos> Cleveland, the whole point of a vow renewal ceremony is to offer personalized vows.<eos> I assumed you understood that.<eos> Ha! Dummy.<eos> Now help me flip this thing on its side.<eos> Ooh, nice tuzedo.<eos> And why are you bringing all those rainbow weeds in here?<eos> They're flowers, Lester.<eos> They smell like our toilet spray.<eos> Yeah, well, it's too hot in the car; they'd wilt.
And when he makes that move, you'll be there to stop him.<eos> How many times have you told me that sometimes the best thing to do is wait, each crime teaches you something new?<eos> The Replicator is dormant.<eos> You're not learning anything new.<eos> All you're doing is working yourselves to death and ignoring the cases that need your attention.<eos> Erin, he's stalking this team.<eos> No one's gonna give it up.<eos> I know that.<eos> And neither will I.<eos> But the cases are piling up and they need to be cleared so the Director no longer thinks that his best unit is dropping the ball.
Right after he left, local P.D. picked him up for public intoxication and they're holding him, but it's just until he sobers up.<eos> Ok, it takes a lot of strength to rip out someone's tongue.<eos> It's one of the strongest muscles in the body.<eos> The M.E. is still trying to determine whether it was done ante- or postmortem.<eos> According to Chinese mythology, one of the most dreadful punishments in the 18 levels of hell involves having one's tongue ripped out.<eos> It's considered to be one of the most horrific forms of torture.<eos> It's also symbolic, used to punish liars and anti-regime activists.<eos> The very nature of the M.O. is overkill.<eos> We can't rule out a personal vendetta.<eos> These women may have had something on this unsub and he wanted to make sure that they didn't live to talk about it.
No sign of a struggle or that he used restraints.<eos> Both women suffered solid blows to the head.<eos> Probably how he subdued them.<eos> Neither victim showed signs of sexual assault.<eos> Maybe he's impotent.<eos> Or sadistic.<eos> The stabbing could be what's getting him off.<eos> I have looked into both of the victims.<eos> The only thing they have in common are the same zip code.<eos> They have different occupations, interests, hobbies.
Have you been able to determine if they were from the knife?<eos> Either that or from the other object.<eos> Other object?<eos> The assailant used two weapons, one to grip and the knife to severe the tongue.<eos> Something like pliers.<eos> Well, that's new, isn't it?<eos> She was the only one with this type of bruising.<eos> I'm still doing tissue samples.<eos> All 3 women had copious amounts of blood in both their lungs and their stomachs.<eos> They were still alive when their tongues were cut out.
I was drunk. I wasn't thinking straight.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I never should have left her out there.<eos> You want her so bad, you can have her.<eos> I figured he was someone she knew.<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> Walk away. John.<eos> Because he knew my name.<eos> Go ahead, Garcia.<eos> Sir, I did premium spelunking on these 3 women and they were super duper active online, I mean chat rooms, blog, Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook, you name it.
You're funny.<eos> Your move.<eos> Tyler, Kayla is dead.<eos> Someone took one of the stories you wrote and made it real.<eos> Was there a lot of blood?<eos> Your blog went into great detail about how you wanted to kill her.<eos> Now, I need to know, did you discuss this with anyone?<eos> With people on story swap, yeah.<eos> So story swap allows you to download stories from other people.<eos> Are they all about murder?
Well, she figured out what made Mark tick.<eos> When he was 10, he confessed to his mother that her boyfriend had been abusing him.<eos> Mm-hmm. Let me guess.<eos> When Child Protective Services arrived, she changed her story.<eos> Told them Mark had made the whole thing up.<eos> It explains the tongues.<eos> He viewed all women as liars.<eos> It looks like he documented every attack.<eos> The semantics in these two writings are markedly different.<eos> They were all composed by different authors.
Saw that from the crow's nest, did you, sailor?<eos> I'm not even gonna dignify that with an answer, gym rat.<eos> I know that because she's not halfway to Bermuda.<eos> Inside the harbor?<eos> That's still a big area to cover.<eos> We got to find the crime scene where this poor girl was killed.<eos> You're still wearing my boots.<eos> You know I want 'em back.<eos> Now?<eos> They're so comfortable.
Anyway, I haven't seen you in a century, and suddenly you turn up half-naked on my doorstep, telling me I'm in danger.<eos> Care to elaborate?<eos> Oh, yeah, I was getting to that, but first... where are the girls?<eos> We're gonna need their help.<eos> No, no.<eos> Whatever this is, I'm keeping them out of it.<eos> And no magic while you're here.<eos> House rules.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The girls don't know what they are.

Is that really even a curse?<eos> Immortality with endless motherhood.<eos> Do you know how many times I gave birth before they invented the epidural?<eos> Not to mention soap.<eos> All right, but even though you're "cursed" with immortality, you're not really immortal, are you, Joanna?<eos> I mean, if somebody wanted to kill you, really wanted to kill you, they could.<eos> Even with your girls, the right spell in the wrong hands could not only kill Freya and Ingrid, but it could stop them from being reborn.<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> Put out your cards.<eos> I don't know where they are.
Uh, do you recognize these people?<eos> Val Butler and Jason Bennett-- they--<eos> They stayed here back in 2008.<eos> Long time ago, 2008.<eos> Seen a lot of faces come and go.<eos> They would've been here in November.<eos> Do you remember anything unusual from that period?<eos> You wouldn't happen to know their room numbers.<eos> Yeah, uh, 213 and 313.<eos> Those rooms, they're not... normal rooms.

This is a cool one.<eos> It's these college kids in the US.<eos> They fixed a camera and a toy man onto a weather balloon and sent it to the edge of space.<eos> 'There we go.<eos> Pause that a second.<eos> Leo had all the equipment to launch a weather balloon.<eos> Helium, balloons, radiosondes.<eos> What's a radiosonde?<eos> One of these, look.<eos> They contain the equipment that hangs below weather balloons.
Thank you.<eos> You must all miss her so much.<eos> She was the apple of his eye.<eos> She was.<eos> You all right there, Pip?<eos> You know what it is?<eos> It's weird, isn't it?<eos> I found it hidden.<eos> If things are hidden...<eos> they're hidden!

Yeah. Yeah, there he is.<eos> It's all right...<eos> he's with my dad.<eos> - Guess what Tom told me?<eos> - What?<eos> Eve used to work here on this farm and she actually stayed here.<eos> Well, that makes sense of the letters.<eos> What letters?<eos> I found them when I was going through Eve's stuff after she died.<eos> They were from a boy called Pip.
Well, that makes sense of the letters.<eos> What letters?<eos> I found them when I was going through Eve's stuff after she died.<eos> They were from a boy called Pip.<eos> Wasn't that Lucy's brother?<eos> When Tom mentioned him, the name rang a bell.<eos> I only glanced at them in London.<eos> But...<eos> I've called Dad and he's gonna send them.<eos> Well, maybe they'll tell us what happened.
We carry on.<eos> If anything should happen to me...<eos> promise you'll look after your mother.<eos> Got your message.<eos> Lucky I'm here today.<eos> Mission delayed.<eos> Target's clouded over.<eos> You... You can't drop bombs through clouds?<eos> Well, sure you can.<eos> If you don't care where they land.
Luke is seeing her!<eos> He thinks he is. He's not.<eos> He can't be.<eos> Ghosts don't exist.<eos> Oh, come on, Lorna.<eos> Don't do this!<eos> Don't lose it.<eos> People die.<eos> Daughters die.<eos> They don't come back.
I'm already done with this.<eos> The real tragedy is there are kids here who should be in school, staying away from drugs, eating their vegetables and going to bed early.<eos> Your boyfriend is hot and boring.<eos> I wonder if all these food vendors have licenses.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to get you back, Ro.<eos> You said I'm a joke, but who doesn't like a good joke?<eos> I don't like a good joke.<eos> They tend to be hurtful.
Ladies and gentlemen, we regret to inform you that George Clinton and the P-Funk All Stars have been mauled to death by a bear.<eos> On a lighter note, that bear plays guitar, so put your hands together for Freight Train and the Palpitations.<eos> I want to send this out to the only woman who's ever really mattered in my life-- my wife<eos> Evelyn "Cookie" Brown.<eos> ♪ Ooh... ♪ Cookie, I made mistakes, I treated you wrong, but ever since you left me,<eos> I've been feeling sick, so bad. ♪ Ooh... ♪<eos> Everybody, gather around in a circle because... ♪ I'm feeling ookie, Cookie<eos> ♪ Ookie, Cookie ♪ ♪ Because I made such a mess<eos> ♪ I'm eatin' my words now, Cookie ♪<eos> ♪ And they don't taste the best ♪
OK, here's the number for poison control.<eos> Ask for Carol.<eos> Honey, we're gonna be fine.<eos> Enjoy your reunion.<eos> Oh, it'd be a lot more fun if you were there.<eos> I really am sorry about that.<eos> - I just can't miss the chance to bowl on Jay's team.<eos> That's why I ordered these glide rights.<eos> If you break 'em in properly, they're supposed to give you a completely frictionless--
Hell, yeah.<eos> Look, whatever was going on over there, it was bad enough that Dicey wanted to jump ship at the end of the season.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, can you talk?<eos> Uh... yeah, yeah, I'm good.<eos> What do you know about Dicey Hot wanting to leave the Diamond Dolls?<eos> No. Everything I've heard is that she loved this team.<eos> Not according to Sugar Stix.<eos> She said the other girls on the team were jealous.<eos> Um, they are really competitive.
"Sisters cause traffic hazard."<eos> "Sisters burn down family garage"?<eos> I gotta tell ya, I don't know what is more disturbing-- how much chaos Alex and Jane have caused or how much attention this paper paid to two little girls.<eos> Oh! "Sisters make peace."<eos> Yes!<eos> That's it.<eos> Jackpotty.<eos> Now come on.<eos> The block party starts in 12 hours.<eos> - They'll both be there.
She's still alive?<eos> Yeah, Kerkovich women have good genes.<eos> If they don't die in a war or a turnip famine, they live forever.<eos> Sestra... ples.<eos> Nana.<eos> - Nana.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Mm.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Well, apparently, the last time they fought like this... The incident.
- Her network is a failure.<eos> - Martha Stewart.<eos> - Jailbird.<eos> Okay, Jackie, we're not failing because we're women.<eos> We're failing because we're failures.<eos> Now you're just trying to make me feel better.<eos> And you're gonna make me feel better.<eos> I've led many revolutions, but never one through dance dance.<eos> Husband, what are you doing?<eos> These beautiful creatures have already earned four badges today, and they did it with a joie de vivre and a sense of silliness that our boys have never come close to exhibiting.
Mmm.<eos> Money doesn't mean anything if I don't have anyone to share it with.<eos> Oh, I get that.<eos> But you're not going to meet anybody sitting on your couch feeling sorry for yourself.<eos> Are you?<eos> I guess not.<eos> Damn.<eos> I just don't get relationships.<eos> Nobody does.<eos> They're scary and messy.
Can you tell us what you found on the grounds at Grafton that day?<eos> When I was leaving, when I was mounting my horse,<eos> I noticed that he, the horse, was kicking at something in the dirt.<eos> So I had a look and found there was something buried there.<eos> What?<eos> Two dolls.<eos> They were very small.<eos> Made of lead.<eos> One was a woman, the other a man.<eos> And they were bound up with wire.
I will stay and fight by your side!<eos> How many of my ships have landed?<eos> All but one, although they are scattered along the south coast.<eos> Forget Warwick, we must rethink our plans.<eos> Your Graces, I come direct... directly from London.<eos> Your husband... the King...<eos> Imprisoned, imprisoned in the Tower, I know.<eos> And how heavy were our losses at Barnet?<eos> Very.<eos> Course they were.
- Whoa.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Exposed wiring.<eos> You seem to make a habit out of being negligent, Professor.<eos> This is a 240-volt battery.<eos> If Benji came into contact with these wires, it could have created the fracturing we found on his ribs.<eos> Professor was cooking with some serious fire with these batteries.<eos> 240 volts to the chest could definitely be responsible for Benji's death, but was it enough to crack his ribs?<eos> Well, that's what we're here to find out, my brother from another mother.<eos> See, this ordnance gel has been calibrated to absolutely replicate human tissue, so we can see if the ribs crack when they're electrocuted.
Were you aware that he deals drugs?<eos> He used to.<eos> I gave him a job here as part of his early release.<eos> - I'll open his locker for you.<eos> - Uh, so,<eos> I've been thinking about you and your father...<eos> Okay, that cannot be a coincidence.<eos> There's something going on with his dad.<eos> I haven't seen my dad in years.<eos> These doors here, what angle do they-they come down on?
All units, all units, code 99.<eos> 417 in progress, Starling Aquarium.<eos> All available units-- this just came over the police frequency.<eos> I hacked the aquarium security system to get a better look.<eos> [Indistinct yelling] [All shrieking]<eos> Bystanders said they saw him pop some green and black pills...<eos> There's a lunatic high on Vertigo who's taking hostages, and you're making-- making tea.<eos> They're medicinal herbs from the island.<eos> They counter balance the effects of certain drugs and poisons.<eos> They should counteract the effects of Vertigo.
If you look at her art, she sees the bizarreness of life, the incongruity of life, and the unappealingness of human beings.<eos> There were little things, all the time, that she was just plain... in microscopic ways, just chipping at me.<eos> All the time.<eos> I would go down, with my allowance money, to the crafts store, and buy myself a thousand little tiny, you know, like rainbows and... Glass tchotchkes.<eos> Viv would look at my trove of tchotchkes and hate it.<eos> She would get a big mop bucket and she would fill it with hot, soapy water, yes, and ammonia.<eos> And she would have the ammonia be such a strength that you couldn't be near the bucket.<eos> Clearly, to need that much ammonia, you would surely be cleaning something very, very dirty.<eos> She would take her arm, and just swipe all the tchotchkes into the bucket.<eos> They're crashing and grinding together, and smashing, and they're all covered in ammonia...
I thought you were 42.<eos> That's almost 40, Luke.<eos> My mom went back to work when I was 4.<eos> Oh, so there was no one at home to teach you not to interrupt?<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> Stay-at-home moms are heroes.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - They're the backbone of this country.
Time of death?<eos> Rigor completely passed.<eos> So some time before noon on Saturday.<eos> Do we know who she was?<eos> Margaret Bell.<eos> Her family's in Rhodesia, according to Miss Byng.<eos> Landlady.<eos> She's next door at the minute, having a cuppa.<eos> For the shock.<eos> Two other girls live here but they went away Friday morning for a week in Rhyl.
It will be winter over there, you know.<eos> I checked the weather.<eos> Overcast.<eos> Four degrees.<eos> Ha, ha!<eos> It's not even that cold in my fridge.<eos> But you will be back on Friday?<eos> Yeah, that's the plan.<eos> Of course things might change.<eos> You know, not saying they will, but, you know being here wasn't really the plan, was it?
Sue me for trying to get to a place but also wanting to find out if Elin Nordegren is moving on with her life.<eos> By the way, she's open to dating.<eos> Yeah, so you'll get off at the next stop.<eos> Yeah, in Brooklyn, where everyone is incredibly intimidating and expressive.<eos> So thanks for adding that to my day.<eos> And by the way, what's in these?<eos> Like, dead bodies?<eos> Stuffed animals filled with cocaine?<eos> Baby strollers for Haiti, okay?<eos> They've got all-terrain wheels on them so that malnourished mothers can push the strollers through the rubble.
Are you sure she didn't come back again?<eos> Well, you're welcome to search the place.<eos> Check our logs.<eos> She's not here.<eos> It's mostly girls, Pastor.<eos> Not a lot of boys up there.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Girls like getting their picture taken.<eos> They're just kids in so many ways.<eos> Yeah. They're more vulnerable than the boys.
Check that he's secure.<eos> No weapons!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Watch yourself.<eos> Did you talk to the cop?<eos> No, she hasn't returned my calls.<eos> I need to talk to her.<eos> There must be something she can do.<eos> She said she believes I'm innocent.<eos> Ray... all your appeals, the final decisions, they've come and gone.
Yeah.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Thought I lost you there for a second.<eos> Just when I was getting used to you.<eos> That was scary, huh?<eos> I couldn't see him, you know?<eos> Just his eyes in the mirror.<eos> And his voice.<eos> I kept thinking that this must have been what it was like for all those girls.<eos> How alone they must have felt.

Can't I, like, take the next one?<eos> I'm, like, not ready for this.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Look,<eos> Jaelynn, um, there's this girl, and I didn't tell her that I was into her, and now she's with some dude with big arms.<eos> Um, are you, like, hitting on me?<eos> 'Cause you're, like, old.<eos> God. No.<eos> No.<eos> No, my-my p-point is, is that this-this kidney is a good thing, and that you need to take the good things when they're in front of you, because if you don't, someone else will.
Look Fin I'm really busy.<eos> Just calling to make sure you and Claudia are ok.<eos> There's a bad hurricane rolling in and I want-<eos> Is this about money?<eos> Because if this is about money Fin, I told you already that-<eos> It's the storm. I just want to make sure guys are ok.<eos> Of course we're ok.<eos> It's barely even raining.<eos> Look, it's really sweet that you are calling in to check in on us but Collin already checked the drains and, we're gonna be fine.<eos> They're cleared out.
Very.<eos> Me, too.<eos> How's the baby, still kicking?<eos> Quiet now.<eos> Probably dead.<eos> Oh, Meredith, stop.<eos> Well, I'm just kidding.<eos> Mostly.<eos> Really, I need you to stop.<eos> Bad things happen, and it just makes me feel better to be prepared when they do.
♪ Awaits unbelievers<eos> ♪ all of the sinners the same ♪<eos> Hey, Cole, can I bum a little weed?<eos> I don't have any.<eos> You're smoking right now.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> And your mom would kill me.<eos> Is this log taken?<eos> Do you, like, have an outcast fetish?<eos> Those girls suck, and also they don't like me.
If you're looking for rebound sex, there are better options.<eos> You know, I wasn't really happy in my marriage.<eos> I just thought that if I was nice and happy, then we could muddle through.<eos> But Steve didn't want to settle.<eos> He found something that actually made him happy.<eos> You know that relationship is doomed, right?<eos> Sooner or later, she's gonna learn English, and then...<eos> Cole, last year, property taxes almost wiped us out.<eos> I have had six cancellations for August, and who knew electricity was more expensive than cocaine?<eos> I just see things as I want them to be, not how they actually are.
A new reality is about to be born.<eos> Yours will be the last and only emotion this universe will ever know.<eos> What emotion is it, Green Lantern Hal?<eos> Regret.<eos> Razer!<eos> What...<eos> What have I done?<eos> Is this the emotionless machine mind that wants to fix the universe?<eos> Your emotions were never completely sealed off.<eos> They couldn't be, because you're not a machine.
Where is she!<eos> - I know that you know.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> I do.<eos> Where?<eos> Where?<eos> I want you to know, I would never hurt her, I've had Amelia in years,<eos> I need a doctor.<eos> Okay... okay, where does it hurt?<eos> My ribs, they're broken.
I'm gonna talk to you anyway.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I was taking pictures of this girl who always ignores me, and then out of the blue, she kissed me.<eos> Did anything happen before she kissed you?<eos> I said something about how the left side of her face isn't as good as the right.<eos> - And this is a pretty girl?<eos> - Very.<eos> You may not know this 'cause you're a dork.<eos> Go on.<eos> But women who base their self-esteem on their looks are usually pretty insecure, so when you point out a flaw, it freaks them out and they would do anything to get you to like them.
Yeah, maybe.<eos> I mean, after we get it into Photoshop and fix your face.<eos> Which part?<eos> - You know, your...<eos> - My nose.<eos> It's crooked, isn't it?<eos> - No, it's perfect.<eos> -It's my ears.<eos> They're lopsided, right?<eos> No, they're perfect.
Let's shoot some people, people!<eos> (Clicks)<eos> She is a real beauty.<eos> That's a Winchester 30-30.<eos> Yeah, it's a beautiful rifle.<eos> So enjoy yourselves.<eos> But stick around afterwards.<eos> There's a bison petting zoo in the parking lot... Complimentary Buffalo wings.<eos> I chopped them off the buffalos myself.<eos> They're huge.
(laughs)<eos> Yeah, I know, right?<eos> Who knew Lavon Hayes could act?<eos> Oh. Yeah, I see a whole new future career for my myself.<eos> Well, I mean, you were great, but BlueBell needs you a heck of a lot more than Broadway.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Look, I was so proud of you, putting yourself out there.<eos> What happened?<eos> AnnaBeth happened.<eos> Yeah, I-I told her my fears, and they just went away.
Oh, it's Spanish, for the language requirement.<eos> It's a bitch, right?<eos> How you getting it?<eos> That's good.<eos> Dude, this place is a melting pot.<eos> Hey, ladies.<eos> No?<eos> No?<eos> What did you say to them?<eos> I said, no matter what they say, I'm gonna hold it against them.
Put it down or I'm gonna shoot you this time.<eos> I can't.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm Mike Warren, FBI.<eos> - Let's see some I.D.<eos> - I don't have any.<eos> Bad day for you.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> See these track marks?<eos> They're fake.
And the scratch, I got at work.<eos> One of the hazards of working with shot girls and drunk men.<eos> Some jackass got handsy with one of my girls, so she triggered her security band and I had to step in.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> A security band?<eos> Sort of like a panic button.<eos> Each of the girls wears one.<eos> Was Meghan wearing one?<eos> Of course.<eos> They all were.
- Fon-what?<eos> - Fontaines.<eos> They're only the sexiest high heels most normal people can't possibly afford.<eos> I really don't want to know how you know that.<eos> And wha... high heels that leave red flakes?<eos> Fontaines.<eos> I love Fontaines.<eos> - You know these shoes?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They do leave red flakes, and they scratch on the bottom, but very sexy.
I've still got a couple good years left.<eos> Which, thanks to some really poor career planning, you'd need to make the most of.<eos> Yeah, you needed to get the Sheriff of Le Bare back on top so you can start making the big bucks again...<eos> Like killing the club's main attraction.<eos> I didn't kill Judd, okay?<eos> I swear I didn't.<eos> He needed protection, so I sold him my gun.<eos> That's all.<eos> Sounds to me like with your best years behind you, the only person who needed protection was you.<eos> They aren't behind me, man.
- Oh...<eos> JESS:<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No. Guys, guys...<eos> NICK:<eos> How are we gonna get a picture of Shivrang's junk?<eos> Well, spoiler alert:<eos> - Women are liars.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah.<eos> They're supposed to want commitment, right?
JESS:<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No. Guys, guys...<eos> NICK:<eos> How are we gonna get a picture of Shivrang's junk?<eos> Well, spoiler alert:<eos> - Women are liars.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah.<eos> They're supposed to want commitment, right?<eos> But then I offer it to them on a silver platter and they throw it back in my face like a comedy pie.
I wouldn't let you start a moped.<eos> We're on the rails with this thing, okay, and the only way out of it is through it.<eos> Believe me, I know, and you know how bad I want to slam the door on all those sons of bitches.<eos> But you got to let me take care of you, man.<eos> You got to let me help you get your strength back.<eos> This isn't a cold or a fever or whatever it is you're supposed to feed.<eos> This is part of it all.<eos> Those first two trials -- they're not just things I did.<eos> T-they're doing something to me.<eos> They're changing me, Dean.
You can do whatever you want, Crowley.<eos> I will never tell you where I buried the tablet.<eos> I know, Cass.<eos> I know.<eos> Luckily...<eos> I don't believe you have to.<eos> I've been getting regular updates from my expensive friend here.<eos> Naomi should have caught you out of the gate, seeing as lately she's been knuckles deep in that melon of yours.<eos> She thinks that your touching the tablet has broken her spell over you. Hmm?<eos> The tablets weren't meant for the Angels, and they weren't meant for you.
To determine where a shooter stood, you need to calculate the bullet's trajectory.<eos> And the arch of a bullet can look like a rainbow.<eos> And do bullets create different types of... rainbows?<eos> Yes, guns do-- in this case, you have a 1929 pistol firing a .38-caliber<eos> ALICIA:<eos> And is the fact that it was<eos> - made in 1930 important?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Old ammunition doesn't have as much power, which means that gravity pulls it down faster.<eos> Modern bullets are typically copper-jacketed so they shoot flatter.
No, he's freaking out.<eos> Yep.<eos> Totally.<eos> Okay, finished with the photos?<eos> Right.<eos> Let's rattle them bones.<eos> (mechanical whirring)<eos> Well, the victim's clothing suggests she had expensive tastes.<eos> Come on, I need a psychologist for that?<eos> The wear on her shoes indicates they didn't fit well.
There has been a long tradition of trial watching.<eos> Salem Witch Trials, the Nuremberg Trials.<eos> This show's just a logical progression.<eos> Logical?<eos> Are you watching the same trial I'm watching?<eos> They're talking about goldfish.<eos> Who is talking when I'm talking?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I'm sorry, Your Honor.<eos> No, I was just explaining to my partner that while these proceedings may be unconventional, they are by no means a "freak show." JUDGE:
You gotta go after what you want. And don't take "no" for an answer.<eos> Good to see y'all.<eos> You, too.<eos> Loved the show, Rayna.<eos> So good to see you.<eos> I haven't seen you in forever.<eos> I'll see y'all.<eos> Uh, your girls are great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I bet they can sing real well.

I'm trying to keep 'em as far away from this business as I can.<eos> They're really lucky to have a mama watching out for 'em.
All I wanna do is just protect her.<eos> And it doesn't feel like having her here, hanging out with Juliette Barnes is doing that.<eos> This isn't about Juliette.<eos> They idolize you.<eos> They are not idolizing me right now,<eos> - I'll tell you that much.<eos> - Of course they are.<eos> No.<eos> We all do.<eos> And so for the girls, if they want to fantasize a little bit about what it would be like to be a big star, if it helps them through this hard time, what's the harm?

I'm sure that I love you.<eos> Sign the damn contract, please.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> - Hey, how are you? - Hey.<eos> Nice to see you.<eos> Those girls of yours...<eos> I know.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> They'll be fine.
Maybe I just wanna go home.<eos> Besides, the road is no place for a new dog.<eos> Or an old one.<eos> You're not old.<eos> No.<eos> You're perfect.<eos> You gave those girls...<eos> The thrill of a lifetime.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They were so great, weren't they?
She is so fragile.<eos> Maybe we should just keep whatever's going on between us quiet till she's a little stronger.<eos> Not the healthiest plan.<eos> You got a better idea?<eos> No. Well, then I guess we're done talking about my mama.<eos> - (Whispers) Are we? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Hey. It's the middle of the night.<eos> - We got a family emergency.<eos> I gotta get my girls back to Nashville.<eos> - Are they okay?
I'll see you in a bit.<eos> (Peggy) What?<eos> (Sighs) Lamar had a heart attack.<eos> Rayna's on her way back with the girls.<eos> I gotta meet 'em at the airport.<eos> Is it serious?<eos> You know, I don't know.<eos> He's in cardiac I.C.U.<eos> But the... the girls are really upset.<eos> They'll all be coming back.
Do you really think I care about this right now?<eos> Please, let me just go with my sister.<eos> You're C.F.O. You should care about this.<eos> God knows your father would want you to.<eos> Where's Tandy?<eos> She's out talking to Albert.<eos> I thought you were on the road.<eos> I was. I had the girls with me, so...<eos> I must be in pretty bad shape for you to miss a show.<eos> Well, they were worried.
They say you might be canceling tonight, so that must mean it's pretty bad.<eos> I know this whole thing... has got to be pretty complex for you, to say the least.<eos> I just wanted to let you know I'm thinking about you.<eos> We canceling or not?<eos> Not.<eos> Juliette's gonna go on.<eos> Of course she is.<eos> Juliette wants the band to have these ready by the time we go on tonight.<eos> What, ten new songs?<eos> She said they weren't new to you, and she's keeping it simple.

- I talked to your mother!<eos> She told me... she told me what you did to those kids.<eos> She's done protecting you.<eos> She said that you're not her little boy anymore.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> She told me.<eos> She... she told me everything you did to those girls in the hotel... those films.<eos> Why?<eos> Those little girls...<eos> They came to me.
Bullshit.<eos> She told me.<eos> She... she told me everything you did to those girls in the hotel... those films.<eos> Why?<eos> Those little girls...<eos> They came to me.<eos> It's not wrong.<eos> It's nature.<eos> It can't be helped.<eos> They look at me... with that ache... that sweet, sweet ache.

- What did they say?<eos> - The Attorney General needs corroborating evidence about the ring before he's willing to move forward and consider a stay.<eos> - I told you it's hers.<eos> - That's not enough.<eos> And that jewelry shop's gone out of business.<eos> I have some photos that might have your wife's ring in them.<eos> Photos of the crime scene?<eos> No, from the apartment.<eos> I'm waiting for them to get here.<eos> Is that what happens to your things after you're killed-- they're put in some basement at the police station?

Where's Adrian?<eos> He's been with us the whole time.<eos> He's in the trunk.<eos> Give me the keys!<eos> Give me those keys.<eos> Adrian? You okay?<eos> Yeah. I'm a police officer.<eos> [ Cellphone beeps ] It's gonna be okay.<eos> Holder. Give me the keys.<eos> You know, those girls... they weren't that innocent, Sarah.

Oh, no.<eos> You want me to kill witches?<eos> We've been over this.<eos> It's temporary.<eos> They'll come back.<eos> - What if I'm not strong enough?<eos> - You are strong enough.<eos> Look.<eos> It won't be easy.<eos> Once they realize how strong you are, they'll channel each other one by one using spirit magic till they can strip you of expression.
All right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Only one way to stop a bully, Stan.<eos> I can't go in on this, Chris.<eos> I can't.<eos> Your shoes squeak.<eos> I get it.<eos> Me?<eos> My shoes...<eos> they don't squeak.
Hm?<eos> Right, and the next time your boss is out of the office, I would like you to do me a favor.<eos> What kind of favor?<eos> I need you to place this in Agent Gaad's office.<eos> Somewhere where he won't notice it or pick it up.<eos> Keep this in your purse because I'll need to check it when we meet at night.<eos> Clark, you, uh...<eos> You came out of nowhere, like some sign from the universe that, after a lot of crappy years, things would be okay.<eos> Are things gonna be okay, Clark?<eos> I mean... just please tell me that they'll be okay.

I'm talking to Aunt Janet.<eos> Try the laundry room.<eos> (Groans) God.<eos> So anyway, I'm trying to learn this stuff, and it--<eos> Frankie, where are my keys?<eos> How am I supposed to know where your keys are?<eos> Mom, you have to find dad's keys.<eos> I have my driver's license test today, and I cannot handle any extra stress.<eos> (Snaps fingers) Hey, get-- get out of there.<eos> They're not in my purse.
Oh, really?<eos> 'Cause I have notes.<eos> [Laughing] Oh, do you, now?<eos> Well, one, actually.<eos> Okay, in At Your Feet, when Gladys takes Norma Jeane to the Chinese Theater, why does she have to just leave her there?<eos> 'Cause that's the way it happened.<eos> Well but it's sad, it's, like, right there, the second number in the show, this melancholy chord.<eos> It's the truth.<eos> And sometimes the truth is too hard.<eos> Sometimes, you wanna remember things better than they actually were.
And I don't want that around my son.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No further questions.<eos> Yes, I took those photos.<eos> I was upset.<eos> She's the mother of my child. Hold on.<eos> You seem confused again.<eos> These photos are from before you raped her.<eos> I was found innocent of that charge.<eos> And from before she was pregnant, aren't they?
Insurance companies always tell you not to apologize when you're in an accident.<eos> Admits fault.<eos> Just say, "Being locked up sucks.<eos> "But that's no reason to hang yourself,<eos> "slit your wrists or chug 10 bottles of NyQuil."<eos> Mendez out.<eos> You think a dead prisoner is a joke, Mendez?<eos> Something to make light of?<eos> Let me be clear.<eos> When these women are at Litchfield, they're in our care.
You know what pisses me off, Benny?<eos> These fucking bitches look at me like I'm some goddamn piece of meat, you know?<eos> Like a fucking sex toy.<eos> But I'm a human being, man.<eos> I'm a person, you know, with feelings and emotions.<eos> Does anybody ever ask me how my day is going?<eos> No.<eos> We practically live with these girls.<eos> We know everything about them.<eos> Do they ever for a second think about our life outside of work?
Does anybody ever ask me how my day is going?<eos> No.<eos> We practically live with these girls.<eos> We know everything about them.<eos> Do they ever for a second think about our life outside of work?<eos> It's like we cease to exist outside of those fucking walls.<eos> What the fuck is that?<eos> I'm sitting here, right?<eos> Yeah, I exist!<eos> They think I'm so tall, my feelings don't get hurt.
Well, I think my favorite is one of the first.<eos> This insane girl, like, actually insane, the kind of person who belongs in a psychiatric hospital not a prison, but that's a whole other discussion.<eos> She decides that Piper is going to be her wife.<eos> She followed her around for days.<eos> Wrote her this horrible poem.<eos> Do things like that concern you in terms of Piper's safety?<eos> Of course.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I know she can handle herself, but when you're dealing with unstable women, you have no idea what they're actually capable of.

And I don't want to imply that they're all crazy and dangerous.<eos> There's one girl who should've been a track star.<eos> She was actually gonna start training again while she was in there, but they shut the track down because of budget cuts.<eos> There's the girl who has been planning her wedding for months, just like everything is normal.<eos> Oh, but she is also sleeping with the hot, lesbian junkie.<eos> How's that for a prison cliche?<eos> I mean, the cast of characters goes on and on.<eos> There is the Russian woman who runs the kitchen, totally terrifying, but she takes so much pride in feeding everyone.<eos> You really have to admire the way these women find meaning in their days.<eos> How they take care of each other.
Come on, Gary.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Gentlemen.<eos> Very excited about this new demographics study you're planning.<eos> You should be.<eos> Dream Metric will reveal the electoral battleground as it truly is.<eos> It's comparable to the invention of the microscope.<eos> Would it be okay if I showed you some ideas I have regarding strategy?<eos> No time, Mr. Egan.<eos> They're mostly Flash based, but I put them on YouTube.
You know that?<eos> Every copper knows that.<eos> So why does nobody do anything about it?<eos> Because it's complicated.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> You got me there.<eos> Listen.<eos> Detective Chief Inspector John Luther.<eos> All I want is what you want - to have these people locked up, so they can't do any more harm to anyone else.
Your Honor, as you know, Ms. Kaswell failed to get Revengephoto to take down the photos.<eos> And this Hail Mary against my client is an abuse of the legal system.<eos> Intentional infliction of emotional distress, really, is a loser.<eos> I agree, which is why I've amended our complaint to include copyright infringement.<eos> We'd like to call Alex Gray to the stand.<eos> And if Your Honor doesn't think we have a case once I've finished with the witness, we'll drop it.<eos> All right, Mr. Gray, you're up.<eos> Did my client give you permission to publish her photos?<eos> What do you mean, "publish"?<eos> To distribute to the public, which is what happened when they were displayed on the website.

From what I can tell, she's on a tandem bike tour of the Great Wall of China with some guy named Ping.<eos> I couldn't find a varmint.<eos> But I found three critters and a rascal.<eos> Beef jerky, kettle corn and soda.<eos> Well, that's got diabetes and road trip written all over it.<eos> Where you headed?<eos> Up to Hagerstown.<eos> Gonna take some pictures of the house Maw Maw grew up in and see if it shakes loose any memories of her mother.<eos> Huh, I was going to take a road trip today, too. Visit my two moms for Mother's Day.<eos> But they canceled to go outlet shopping.
She says she needs to if she is to perform her duties properly.<eos> Is something wrong between you?<eos> But I don't know what it is.<eos> She says it's nothing I've done but I can't believe that.<eos> It must be my fault because she is incapable of fault.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> There is no such thing as a marriage between two intelligent people that does not sometimes have to negotiate thin ice.<eos> I know.<eos> You must wait until things become clear.<eos> And they will.

Right.<eos> Cool.<eos> And what's castrated, again?<eos> Doughnuts!<eos> Where are they? I was promised hot girls.<eos> They should be here, by the doughnut seller.
Maybe it's not just about them being nannies.<eos> He could be keying in on the relationship itself.<eos> And he would have to stalk them and know their routines well enough to be able to pick up on that.<eos> I'll have Reid and Rossi retrace Gina's steps, and we should interview the victims' families again.<eos> If he sticks to his schedule,<eos> Phoebe could turn up soon.<eos> Let's hope so.<eos> I just talked to a bunch of nannies over at the observatory.<eos> They knew Gina and Phoebe.<eos> Said they're here every, uh, Tuesday and Thursday.
Hacking them apart means the anger ran deep.<eos> Reid, you ok?<eos> There's no shortage of enemies to the logging industry, from climate change environmentalists to animal rights activists.<eos> Native Americans with longstanding territory disputes.<eos> Maybe this is all to create a hostile working environment for the logging companies.<eos> It looks like both men disappeared overnight.<eos> They left work one day, didn't show up the next.<eos> Garcia, did anyone interview family members?<eos> No.<eos> The families didn't know anything 'cause they were all back at home.
When I checked the software's internal time stamp to see when he turned it off, it's the same on every car-- 3 days before date night.<eos> All right, thanks, Garcia.<eos> Of course, of course.<eos> So he breaks into the car before the abductions.<eos> Even his stalking's organized.<eos> But in order to pull that off, he needs access to their cars without attracting attention.<eos> We've already checked garages and dealerships.<eos> Nothing matched the service records.<eos> Which means there's some target-rich location where all the victims go.<eos> They park, he hacks in.
And forgive my tone, but I am frustrated!<eos> Wait.<eos> My mood is changing.<eos> We may have a lotto here.<eos> There is exactly one point of common intersection for each of the 4 cars, and I am sending it to you now.<eos> Want to take a field trip?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why here?<eos> Access, maybe.<eos> He knows the victims will be away from their cars while they work out.
Cut him.<eos> Leave him alone!<eos> Cut him or I'll kill you.<eos> How can number 6 be the unsub?<eos> We profiled a sadist.<eos> That all changed when he had Mary Hammond alone.<eos> He found something else that worked for him.<eos> The guy's wife left him because he was a cutter.<eos> So he took those women not because of sex but because of something better.<eos> They validate his obsessive-compulsive disorder, turn it into a shared bonding experience.
Linda wasn't using.<eos> How do you know?<eos> She was my girlfriend.<eos> And the M.E. reports showed 3 other victims bleeding out over the last week.<eos> One in Harlem, two in the Village, all 5 of them categorized as Ecstasy overdoses.<eos> And one of the victims may have been drugged without her knowledge.<eos> Ecstasy is frequently used as a date rape drug, but I've never seen it cause bleeding like this.<eos> Could it be a bad batch?<eos> Well, uh, according to the M.E., the victims had so much MDMA in their systems that it caused their internal body temperature to go out of control.<eos> They boiled from the inside out.
- Be cool.<eos> Do I look all right?<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> Let me do it.<eos> - I can be very persuasive.<eos> - And very impulsive.<eos> - You don't trust me?<eos> - I trust Bill.<eos> But I also know there's a fight going on inside you between Bill and Lilith and I just want to make sure she doesn't win tonight.<eos> Those girls, they're also the same age I was when you turned me.
Pawnee is no longer the fourth most obese city in America.<eos> We're now ninth.<eos> Together, as a town, we lost an amount of weight equal to 800 pregnant manatees.<eos> A gym opened, and it stayed in business.<eos> And people checking into the E.R. after ingesting a whole candy wrapper is down 40%.<eos> But where will it end?<eos> Now, you wanna rob our children of fun by attacking the Sweetums school lunch program, literally taking candy from babies.<eos> Those school lunches are incredibly unhealthy.<eos> You somehow convinced the school board that napkins are a vegetable.<eos> They're made from plants.
Well, if Tina does make the sale before your assistance is needed, you don't get the commission.<eos> - Just your hourly.<eos> - What?<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> Uh, you know, I-I get it.<eos> Gonna be less work for us, and we're still getting paid hourly.<eos> Exactly, thank you, stretch.<eos> No, you don't get it!<eos> This is just the beginning, guys.<eos> All right, if we let these machines take our jobs, next... next, they're gonna take everything.
- All: Whoa! - Oh, my God!<eos> Tom Green!<eos> Wow, really big fan.<eos> - Really big fan.<eos> - I'm a huge fan.<eos> [Metallic voice] My bum is on the cheese.<eos> - My bum is on the cheese.<eos> - Cyber Tom Green, that's... that's awesome, but you need to shut it down.<eos> - Yeah. - Because soon enough, the cyborgs, they're gonna come for you.<eos> These machines would die for me, because they need me to survive.
Ow!<eos> Okay, you better go help Ryder with that case of light bulbs.<eos> Hey, oh, good.<eos> You're home.<eos> - Joe, how are your eyes?<eos> - Perfect.<eos> Damn!<eos> I just bought 24 pairs of reading glasses.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Because they're cheaper by the case.
Okay, let's just take your wine and walk ever-so-slowly into the living room.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Follow the wine glass.<eos> Follow the wine glass.<eos> All right, now, I want you to close your eyes and imagine yourself in your furniture happy place.<eos> Ooh, ooh, oh, "Crate and Barrel."<eos> Yeah, they have those oak nesting tables.<eos> Okay, imagine yourself running through a field of oak nesting tables.<eos> Oh, are they on sale?
Sorry.<eos> I want to be alone tonight, I need to be alone.<eos> Then I'll go.<eos> Bye.<eos> Qkay...<eos> I'll go.<eos> Fuck it!<eos> It's full of ants under there, the word got around.<eos> - The word?<eos> - They're attacking me on all sides.
Last time I was here, someone shot me.<eos> Sigma pi tau?<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> What's up, man?<eos> Sorry, sirs.<eos> We'll turn down the music.<eos> No, we are here for the party.<eos> Sorry, man.<eos> We don't need any extra guys here.<eos> Especially old ones who will remind drunk girls that they have fathers who love them.
Who is that?<eos> Jackson. Huh.<eos> I'm doing okay.<eos> I'm doing okay.<eos> I really am, you know.<eos> Really?<eos> I was a little depressed there for a little bit.<eos> I'd wake up in the morning, have my coffee, you know, exercise, do a little Russian roulette.<eos> Breakups are the worst.<eos> They are the worst.

The medical community would never accept it.<eos> It's funny, I guess.<eos> You're the second person in the medical community to fuck me.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> My eyesight is bad.<eos> Why don't you wear glasses?<eos> - Glasses?<eos> ! - Sure.<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause they're terrible.

No one's gonna know about that.<eos> And I guarantee you that every other clown in your little study uses a fake name.<eos> That little study is keeping a roof over your kids' heads, George. It's keeping shoes on their feet, and it's keeping food in the icebox!<eos> Okay. That is a hell of a lot more than I can say for their father!<eos> Sorry it's a mess.<eos> I'm hardly ever home.<eos> You don't have people over?<eos> - Girls?<eos> - Sometimes.<eos> Sometimes I have girls over, and they never notice because I don't even turn the lights on.

I'm so sorry about that, sir.<eos> Have a chocolate bar.<eos> Thanks, Black Santa.<eos> Wow, Junior, that's a lot of chocolate, even for you.<eos> I bought 40 boxes of these to support the Troubled Youth Orchestra of Stoolbend.<eos> I'm singlehandedly sending them to perform in Norfolk.<eos> Oh, okay. Some "troubled youths" sold you these?<eos> And I'm sure they gave you a great deal on these 50-cent candy bars.<eos> Oh, child... these are not 50-cent candy bars.<eos> They're five-dollar candy bars.
Now just what in the heck is going on here?<eos> First you're married, then you're dead, and now she's your mom?<eos> Yes. Settle down, it's not what you think.<eos> I mean, have we shared a bed lately?<eos> Sure.<eos> Why, you're nothing but a dirty, rotten mother lover.<eos> It's true. I love my mom.<eos> And why wouldn't I?<eos> Moms treat us best.<eos> They say we're tall and handsome, they touch our socks when no one else will.

You should come.<eos> I'd lose my job.<eos> I can't afford that.<eos> My boss is a Jew and a freemason. I can't be seen there.<eos> In fact, I don't believe in anything.<eos> Dad is right, and that attitude might just boost his promotion.<eos> Julia, be careful!<eos> You stained the tablecloth.<eos> You know my husband is a vegetarian.<eos> By the time she brings the carrots, they'll be cold.
Corky.<eos> Enough. Get him a doctor.<eos> But detective--<eos> Now!<eos> Francis killed a copper.<eos> I looked at him in his cell, beaten and bloodied, guilty, and all I thought of was you you and him.<eos> I can't do this anymore, whatever this is.<eos> I've tried but I... I can't get past what happened.<eos> You and Maguire Maggie.<eos> All I wanted was for things to be the way they were before, but... It ain't never gonna happen that way.
We must remember, he murdered a prostitute to highlight the inequality of the law.<eos> Well, he said he did.<eos> But he's the Truth Terrorist.<eos> Funny.<eos> - So it depends.<eos> - On?<eos> Age, body type, sex.<eos> My girlfriend still has the heating on in July.<eos> Actually, women bear extreme cold better than men.<eos> It's the fat. They have more of it.
You're beautiful.<eos> Symmetry-<eos> - I'm... trained to be on the lookout for it.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Anyway, I looked at those pictures you e-mailed.<eos> Tell your friend at Christie's that, I'm sorry, but those canvasses aren't original Turners.<eos> You're certain?<eos> The provenance is quite convincing.<eos> Yeah. They're good forgeries but, you know, they're forgeries.<eos> They're supposed to be the studies for The Fighting Temeraire, but they have a... a medium orange and ochre in them.
I know how much you... see.<eos> I can only imagine what you must be picking up right now.<eos> You know, you're the only person I ever empathized with.<eos> Empathy.<eos> You have changed.<eos> (TV continues indistinctly)<eos> You asked me the other day what my life's been like.<eos> Um... (TV clicks off)<eos> You may recall, over the course of our relationship, that I... dabbled with the occasional narcotic.<eos> They were a hobby, and... after your demise they became... a good deal more than that.

It's over!<eos> - Snotlout, what are you doing?<eos> - What does it look like I'm doing?<eos> - I'm getting rich.<eos> - But you can't.<eos> - I already did.<eos> The gems are gone.<eos> - Gone.<eos> - They're not gems.<eos> And they certainly don't bring good luck.

I brought it to excite the spirits.<eos> We use objects, something emotionally significant to the dead to provoke them.<eos> I mean, come on, man, that's Ghost Chasing 101.<eos> That's Murder 101.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't turn off the camera.<eos> My battery pack went dead.<eos> Don't you check your batteries before you start?<eos> Yeah, of course I did.<eos> And they were both full.
Tradition's a fine thing, Mildew.<eos> But things have changed...<eos> for the better, if you ask me.<eos> I didn't.<eos> We've come a long way from the time when it was us or the dragons.<eos> You might be a little less crusty if you got used to that, Mildew.<eos> I'll pass, thanks.<eos> When are Bork's archives going on display?<eos> You've still got that dragon-gutting dagger of his, don't you?<eos> They'll all be in the great hall tomorrow.
And?<eos> He was there, so he's off the list.<eos> Great. I didn't like him for this anyway.<eos> What about you?<eos> Any luck with his brother?<eos> Well, his big brother Mustafa, on the other hand, he's a very angry young man.<eos> He's got a bunch of summons for disorderly conduct and harassment.<eos> What kind of harassment?<eos> Standing outside of the mosque harassing women as they walked by for the way they're dressed.<eos> Smart money says it's because they looked like "whores."
I'm following orders.<eos> I work for the man, same as you.<eos> Look if you can't stand up to them, at least be real with me.<eos> What's really going on?<eos> Following the rules.<eos> Mrs. Corbett. I was wondering if I might chat with you for my story.<eos> I'm sure you can find more interesting people to talk to.<eos> I know subjects and you're a good one.<eos> I won't participate in an article that criticizes my girls.<eos> They work far too hard to have the press take potshots.
You felt it, too?<eos> Haley, why don't you tell us what yours says?<eos> Well, it's so sweet.<eos> It's about how beautiful I am inside and-- score!<eos> Jewelry<eos> Whoa!<eos> Check it out!<eos> Oh, look at that.<eos> Your grandma loved pocket watches.<eos> - Aw! - She said they made a man look dignified.
He won the gold medal for best design.<eos> You sure you want to give it to me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do. It'll feel right at home here.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Whoops.<eos> Oh, hey, hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> Uh, not really. But the visions are still happening, but they're getting clearer, and last night, I actually saw Nick.
Previously on Revolution.<eos> The rebels are winning.<eos> - Miles is leaving.<eos> - We have to kill him now.<eos> Why would you go to the tower?<eos> We need to turn the power back on.<eos> You're going to destroy the nanites, even though they do more than keep the power off.
And...<eos> Are you wearing cutlets?<eos> Oh, this is what I got, King.<eos> I don't usually play to 'em, but I got 'em.<eos> She's fair game. If you want her, you gotta step up and compete.<eos> - I'm not afraid.<eos> - You should be.<eos> It's a dark time for men.<eos> Women used to need us.<eos> Now, they got options.

It's dead nippy.<eos> Evening, ladies. You have yourselves a good night.<eos> OK, so we sort of need to get in.<eos> Look, gents, I'm not sure this is the place for guys like you.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Do I need to spell it out for you?<eos> Salve, Marcus.<eos> All right, landlord?<eos> I've just got some new tenants fresh off the boat.<eos> Oh, yeah? What they like?
I'm willing to go as high as six cartons of cigarettes and a jug of toilet wine.<eos> Is it a strain, feeling like a single dad at times? Sure, but Lily's been busting her butt at this new job.<eos> It's not like she's been out there partying.<eos> Man, I'm 'faced.<eos> I ate a ton of caviar, but it soaked up none of the champagne.<eos> - Mondays, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> When did you get glasses?<eos> Oh... you mean my glare reduction lunettes. Yeah.<eos> They help me discern genius from pretentious crap.
Oh, moment of silence over.<eos> You really hate Diana that much?<eos> Uh, um... look, I... I didn't mean any disrespect.<eos> It's, uh, it's my knee.<eos> Locks up if I don't keep moving.<eos> In case you haven't noticed, I'm an old lady in roller-derby years.<eos> The... body takes a beating.<eos> Well, I noticed, other than walking out on a moment of silence for my murder victim, you don't really seem like a Beach on Wheels.<eos> I guess you'll have to ask my kids what they have to say about that.<eos> You know, some girls, they pick their names because they think it fits them, and some, like me, we just like to have a fun alter ego.
I cheated on the idea of us, which is way worse.<eos> But it won't happen again.<eos> I do not release you.<eos> Okey-dokey.<eos> Stacey, hard not to notice that you're following me.<eos> I was gonna go this way anyway.<eos> Well, well, well, it turns out I'm just as much inside the bubble as you are.<eos> What clued you in?<eos> My feminist friends couldn't get enough of my women-hating rants.<eos> They agreed with me on everything.
Aw, babe, I'm sorry I didn't bring the relaxation tape.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - No, wait.<eos> It's cool.<eos> I know it.<eos> Visualize floating on a sea of indigo bubbles, as you allow yourself... to trust your baby and your body.<eos> Release all doubts as you give yourself permission to relax.<eos> You know, families aren't made in big, formal ceremonies.<eos> They're forged day by day in smaller moments of hope and heartache, through arguments and kindnesses.
You got me down.<eos> I don't know my own strength.<eos> Bring these people another round on the house.<eos> Oh, no, we couldn't.<eos> But we will.<eos> ( laughs ) Oh, oh!<eos> Just one for luck.<eos> ( laughing )<eos> Y'all enjoy yourselves, hear?<eos> Got the girls coming and they stepping high.
Maurice: Need to check the tires, Doctor.<eos> ( door opens )<eos> A thing mixed is a thing weakened.<eos> What?<eos> A thing mixed is a thing weakened.<eos> Is that from the Bible?<eos> It is from me.<eos> ( Swallows )<eos> It's nice for cocktails.<eos> To hide the impurities, but they are there.
Oh, Quagmire, don't fall near ze mouse trap.<eos> Yeah, and French also comes in handy when I have layovers in Montreal.<eos> That place is the best.<eos> I always wanted to go to Canada, but then South Park went, so we couldn't go.<eos> Oh, man, you guys should come with me sometime.<eos> Montreal has the best strip clubs in the world.<eos> They do?<eos> Yeah, they're unbelievable.<eos> The girls up in Canada are gorgeous.<eos> And they all play ice hockey, so they lose their teeth by age ten.
Ugh, it stinks!<eos> We should not rule out the Predator having been the farter.<eos> Okay, we still got nothing to eat, so it looks like we're gonna have to hunt animals for food.<eos> And since we have no weapons, I set up some traps and snares.<eos> Well, I was about to take a leak.<eos> Can I go in that direction?<eos> Yes.<eos> No.<eos> Ah, damn it, my legs!<eos> I think they're broken!
He also received a typhoid booster.<eos> So it's possible that he was planning to stay in Kuwait.<eos> He also received a vaccination for... meningococcal disease.<eos> Inoculation for that disease is only required for travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia!<eos> Again, not proof.<eos> But it is a suggestive detail which I should have noticed before.<eos> I also should have noticed the $30,000 deposit made to Rourke from a shell corporation in April 1991, mostly likely a payment for his services to the oil company.<eos> Still not conclusive. And our assignment was to find the killer for Wallace Rourke, not Leah Sutter.<eos> A case which- - I have just bothered to find out-- unidentified fingerprints were found on Leah's door after her death.<eos> Now they could have been left behind by someone unrelated to the case.
We've been trying to identify people who wanted to tear Sutter down, but what if he was tricked into killing Wallace Rourke by someone who wanted to lift him up?<eos> If this is about Daren, I don't feel comfortable answering questions without his attorney.<eos> Well, actually, Mrs. Sutter, this is about you.<eos> We were hoping that you might be able to confirm exactly when you met your husband.<eos> Well, as I told Ms. Watson, it was in 1991, at a vigil for his sister Leah.<eos> So that would be after her death?<eos> Obviously.<eos> Well, being with Daren as long as you have, I'd assume you know as much about her case as anyone.<eos> So surely you know that partial fingerprints were found on her front door that night.<eos> They were never identified, but police thought there was a chance they belonged to the killer.
He left a message, a written warning for the Daleks.<eos> He's a fool.<eos> No. He's a madman.<eos> As you can see, sir, all Dalek fleets surrounding the planet, now converging on the capital, but the Sky Trenches are holding.<eos> Where did he go next?<eos> What does it matter?<eos> This is their biggest ever attack, sir - they're throwing everything at us...<eos> Sir, we have a security breach to the Time Vaults.<eos> The Omega Arsenal, where all the forbidden weapons are locked away.<eos> They're not forbidden any more - we've used them all against the Daleks.
Yes, exactly!<eos> Why wasn't it locked?<eos> Because I was fascinated to see what you would do upon escaping.<eos> I understand you're rather fond of this world.<eos> It's time I think you saw what's going to happen to it.<eos> Ah!<eos> Kate?<eos> Oh, goodness, you're not actually dead.<eos> Oh, that's tremendous news!<eos> Those creatures, they turn themselves into copies.

What?<eos> What, you forbid me?<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> You're like a different person.<eos> No, I'm just doing what I usually do, which is trying to protect you.<eos> All right, you just spent the last decade feeling guilty, trying to figure out what actually happened to your mother.<eos> Now you're finally moving forward, and he's pulling you straight back.<eos> Well, at least he hasn't been lying to me.<eos> And you can't forbid me to see anyone.<eos> She had this drawer full of lollipops, but they didn't have sticks-- they had strings.
Your mom brought you one day to play when she came to check on me.<eos> I was wondering if you'd remember.<eos> Is this really how you want to repay her for rescuing you from those labs?<eos> Vincent was willing to give you his blood.<eos> Sadly that's not enough and Vincent figured it out.<eos> I didn't realize until yesterday just how comprehensive the procedure would be.<eos> You're gonna kill him.<eos> He's not a beast anymore.<eos> He took your pills.<eos> They had a different effect on him than you.
Flight, fetch me coffee.<eos> Go on.<eos> DOOR OPENS<eos> Raine!<eos> What game is this, young lady? !<eos> Hide and seek.<eos> GIRLS GIGGLE<eos> See?<eos> You are not alone in wishing your girls a better measure of living.<eos> Here, they feel part of a family.
One lived behind bars?<eos> These girls have been saved from slavery and disease and given a place... ..a voice.<eos> I insist on everything that was never insisted upon for me.<eos> Education of the self, control of the self, respect of the self.<eos> Rebuilding what was ruined.<eos> Here they are turned to no-one's account but their own.<eos> You!<eos> You would have them spread-legging your service and pocket your 60%.<eos> My girls are treated better than any.<eos> In my care they are tended to when sick, have as much security as might be afforded them anywhere in this world!
DOOR OPENS<eos> I've been wounded.<eos> There was a letter-knife in the bedroom.<eos> Ely used it.<eos> A needle and thread, there.<eos> You will oblige me?<eos> I am not one of your mulish girls.<eos> But I cannot ask one of my girls.<eos> I am their leader.<eos> They may not see me so...mortal.
And I must live with that.<eos> You Boer half-wits.<eos> You have nothing on me.<eos> Nothing...<eos> So leave now or kill me.<eos> But if kill me you must, know that you do so in the home of an inspector of the Metropolitan Police.<eos> Come.<eos> You work late.<eos> You know my habits?<eos> They are of a kind with mine.
Suggesting what?<eos> That he died a month or so later?<eos> That he was murdered a month or so later.<eos> He has this correct?<eos> Hey, I wouldn't have picked it, but my brother is somewhat conspiratorial by leaning.<eos> I am a man for patterns, Inspector.<eos> This here is the thyroid cartilage.<eos> Lives right above the trachea.<eos> See these striations?<eos> They're minute - less than a millimetre in diameter.
Now, the M.E. took two bullets out of his body.<eos> Two different calibers.<eos> Yeah, I remember the shooting.<eos> There was, uh, there was a manhunt, wasn't there?<eos> Right.<eos> The DOA was some local thug.<eos> You know, complete dead end.<eos> But they never found the second perp.<eos> The bullets match.<eos> They came from the same gun in your brother's homicide.
I mean, maybe it's just a random coincidence.<eos> I don't think it was just one.<eos> - Because that girl over there, she's got the exact same injuries.<eos> Do you see that?<eos> Yeah, it's a firefly.<eos> No, no, I know, it...<eos> What?<eos> It's, uh... it's very unusual.<eos> The, uh, California fireflies aren't bio-luminescent.<eos> They don't glow.
Stiles, I just turned 17 today.<eos> And you know what I want for my birthday?<eos> To not be a 17-year old virgin.<eos> Has anyone else been through here tonight?<eos> Any... any other bodies, or even anybody missing?<eos> Uh, no, no bodies, but, um...<eos> - what?<eos> - Two girls.<eos> They brought the first one in, Caitlin, for a tox screen, and then I overheard that her girlfriend, Emily, just disappeared.<eos> I mean, they were out in the woods and... nobody's found her yet?
What?<eos> Why Danny?<eos> Because...<eos> Last night, he was a target.<eos> But it wasn't a sacrifice.<eos> The problem with no ligature marks around the neck is that both doctors were still asphyxiated, so the question is...<eos> How did they suffocate if they weren't strangled?<eos> Right.<eos> Now, take a look at the wrist marks.<eos> What do they tell you?

No.<eos> Then why did he go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Because we're friends? Friends, really?<eos> - Is that all?<eos> - It's no big deal.<eos> He has a girlfriend. And you have a boyfriend.<eos> [Knocking] Jenna.<eos> [Knock at door]<eos> [Whispers] Jenna. In the course of a relationship, if things didn't evolve, they threaten to go extinct.
Carl didn't get it.<eos> It was so easy for him.<eos> He said that...<eos> if I had any guts, I'd tell people the truth.<eos> Is that what you two fought about that night?<eos> Do I need a lawyer?<eos> I don't know, Dylan.<eos> Do you?<eos> Hey, I found motorcycle tracks back up on the ridge.<eos> They match the tires on Carl's bike.
Not at all.<eos> Although, I did leave a bit curious.<eos> So, according to Freud, there are two types of orgasms, immature and mature?<eos> Have janitorial give the place the once over.<eos> There's dust in here from the Truman administration.<eos> So he's saying that one orgasm is better than the other?<eos> As I understand it, he's saying when a woman reaches puberty, there's a transfer of sexual response from the clitoris to the vagina.<eos> The external or clitoral orgasm is the province of adolescent girls.<eos> Mature women experience sexual response intravaginally with their husbands.<eos> Otherwise they're frigid.
I bought you some athletic socks.<eos> You can't wear argyles on the beach...<eos> Unless you want to look like the Duke of Windsor.<eos> I still haven't dared to try on my bathing suit.<eos> Of course there is a nude beach near the hotel.<eos> We could leave our suits at home...<eos> Feel the sun glinting off our naked bodies.<eos> Hmm? Oh, you're somewhere else.<eos> In an Austrian prison with Dr. Freud...<eos> "Illusions commend themselves to us because they save us pain and allow us to enjoy pleasure instead."
So then you agree that we're on to something.<eos> It's not science to operate from a series of unproven assumptions.<eos> That's dogma... like, one form of orgasm is immature, another is mature. Which we've just scientifically proved is not science.<eos> But there are other assumptions.<eos> For example, how long do elderly people remain sexually active?<eos> Now, the general assumption is that the course of a sex life ends around 60.<eos> But I've got two 70-year-olds in Miami who are living proof that that's something we should investigate.<eos> Here's another question...<eos> Why can some women orgasm without any genital stimulation whatsoever?<eos> - Can they?
You can have your boy bring the car around.<eos> Oh, he's not my boy, he's, um...<eos> Uh, he's the handyman.<eos> I'll wait outside.<eos> Well, I think we found our culprit.<eos> Your blood pressure is 100/65.<eos> That's very low.<eos> Yes, but a little hypotension is nothing to fret about.<eos> It's your hormones.<eos> They cause your blood vessels to widen, increase the blood flow to the baby.

- Oh, God.<eos> Where's my car?<eos> - Hey, you said we were "really something"<eos> - and we want to know what that means. - What does that mean?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - This may come as a shock, but I have no opinion about you two.<eos> Did you valet?<eos> God, that is classy.<eos> You know what?<eos> You can't just tell two people that they're "really something"
Okay. Make it look romantic.<eos> When she comes in, I want her to feel special, like she's the only woman that's ever been here today.<eos> Let's just sit down and talk about this.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Max, is she dead?<eos> No.<eos> She's Alexis.<eos> You have one of those anatomically-correct real dolls!<eos> It's rare to see one without a short, fat man standing next to it with a button penis.<eos> They sell for $6,000, but I got her for half off.
There's another whole keg of that green beer on ice in the bathtub.<eos> (Carl laughs)<eos> Man, this party's starting to heat up nice.<eos> Yeah, it's simmering to a boil.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> And yet, as I gaze around the room, something seems to be missing from this festive motif.<eos> Well, go put on that leprechaun outfit I bought you.<eos> I was actually referring to the complete absence of anything even resembling a female.<eos> Hey, man, women don't show up at parties this early.<eos> Okay, they're too busy primping and getting themselves beautiful for us.
Listen to what?<eos> The truth.<eos> The government's never gonna let 300 former convicts turned assassins just disappear without the President's approval.<eos> Now look, if you take charge, we can free Michael and restore order.<eos> But you need to make them stop following Rachel.<eos> I thought you were on board with this.<eos> No, that was just so the angry villagers wouldn't tear me to pieces.<eos> Alex, if we run, we will be hunted for the rest of our lives.<eos> These people are not gonna end up free.<eos> They're gonna end up dead.
She's just having one of her bad days.<eos> What's that?<eos> I bought you a little something.<eos> Well, aren't you the sweetest thing?<eos> It's silk.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> Beats the piece of crap my niece knit.<eos> You know... Birdie,<eos> I bet those nurses would like to see your new scarf.<eos> They'll be green with envy.
I... it'll feel like home.<eos> All right, buddy.<eos> You win.<eos> Italy.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We asked you to be the judge here and we gotta trust your opinion.<eos> She's right.<eos> And with all the traveling that we'll be doing... we could probably use a couple of your... hands-free belt satchels.<eos> You said they were lame.

I'll be honest with you.<eos> You are making a huge mistake.<eos> You think these television people can help solve your problem?<eos> You are currently on parole.<eos> Pulling something like this is breaking French law.<eos> What are you telling me?<eos> You could be going to back to jail.<eos> You keep poking around at the French judicial system.<eos> How would that make them feel?<eos> And the trial records... they're not as important as you think.

I thought you weren't leaving.<eos> Kalinda, don't talk to Alicia.<eos> Uh, Cary, I didn't say anything.<eos> I trusted you when you told me that you weren't leaving.<eos> I thought you were telling me the truth.<eos> That's why I didn't say a thing.<eos> I also found bruising on Ms. Selwin's left and right thigh, and abrasions on the lower back and buttocks area.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> And do you interpret these injuries differently than the plaintiffs?<eos> I don't think they're indicative of rape as much as vigorous gymnastics training.
- No, no.<eos> She needs these to hide in public.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause she's dating you?<eos> We're not dating.<eos> I mean, I like her, but who knows?<eos> It'll never work out.<eos> - Celebrities and regular people don't mix.<eos> - You don't know that. Let me tell you something I learned about celebrities last night.<eos> They're just like regular people.

I got this.<eos> Drink.<eos> You're putting everyone on edge.<eos> So.<eos> What's the deal?<eos> I'm new to this whole emotional switch situation.<eos> It's not complicated.<eos> See that dart board?<eos> All I can picture is Katherine's face.<eos> So, your emotions are on, they're just dialed to rage.
- Congratulations.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Greetings, little witch.<eos> - Jeff Gillies.<eos> Thought Stefan got rid of you.<eos> He did, and I spent the night crawling out of a cement grave.<eos> Isn't that the witch your friend Caroline killed?<eos> And over there, that's my hybrid friend Adrian, also dead.<eos> In fact, these seats are scattered with two dozen supernatural faces, all of who have reason to lash out since their lives were sacrificed in order to make your expression triangle.<eos> All they're waiting on is word from me.
No.<eos> You're building this on nothing.<eos> You have nothing.<eos> Maybe she went to Canada to see her brother.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's something else.<eos> About the guy who took the risk of shaving her head at the hospital... We were too quick to assume he was a lunatic.<eos> Shaving a woman's head doesn't date back to the Liberation.<eos> The Bible talks about shaving the heads of the girls of Zion because they misbehaved.
What?<eos> Subway access tunnel.<eos> Since hurricane Sandy, a lot of those are still closed.<eos> So bigfoot's been using them to get around.<eos> Castle, that's ridiculous.<eos> How can you say...<eos> Look at these footprints.<eos> These are the footprints that I'm interested in.<eos> They're near where the body was.<eos> C.S.U. Said that they were made within the last 24 hours.
- You're welcome.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> What have we got?<eos> Well, I've been going through the footage trying to spot the moment when the gun's got switched, but no dice.<eos> You sure you're not getting a sneak preview of the movie?<eos> I'm not gonna lie,<eos> I did browse through the original last night.<eos> It still holds up.<eos> I also managed to track down the threats that were on Vince's computer.<eos> They started over a year ago and the last one was four months ago.
- Hello, Mr. Grovner.<eos> - Let's start with...<eos> "no one likes it when someone steals your stuff."<eos> I don't see the value in stating the obvious.<eos> But ... but it's ... it's my name, and you asked.<eos> Just say it.<eos> I'm sure you felt frustrated when your belongings were taken.<eos> I thought I was going crazy at first.<eos> And I'm not crazy, you know.<eos> My things, they were disappearing into thin air.
I'm sorry, but she was strangled.<eos> Can you not see that?<eos> Who's in charge here, me or you?<eos> Um, I just want to see your guns.<eos> I can search this place from the roof to the basement.<eos> I can dig up the garden if I want to.<eos> O-okay, all right.<eos> Just chill.<eos> I'll show you my guns.<eos> They're in the safe.

I don't know.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> "How they grow."<eos> Yardley had lilies on his grave.<eos> Well, flowers, anyway.<eos> Uh, not--not the normal kind of flowers you'd see in the desert.<eos> And grass, for that matter.<eos> That's what he's trying to tell us.<eos> How did those flowers end up there?<eos> And--and how did they get water?
However, he did want me to commend you on your combat prowess.<eos> He said that?<eos> No, it was more of a look.<eos> So, what were you doing there in the first place?<eos> Before she left, my mother went to see him.<eos> I want to know why.<eos> I'm just taking a wild guess that he didn't tell you anything.<eos> And Doris is conveniently unavailable to give you an answer.<eos> I have my theories.<eos> I just hope they're not right.
But you do realize there are over 7,500 C.M.A. members.<eos> What's your point?<eos> Just that at $100 a pop, and with the money that Dante took, you're looking at over a million dollars.<eos> Would you just order the bottles?<eos> "Gun for a mouth"...<eos> I mean, that is a killer title.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Hey, you get a chance to listen to those other demos?<eos> - You mean the ballads?<eos> - Yeah. They're cool.
- You've been humming that same thing for days.<eos> That's what I do when I got something new stuck in my head.<eos> You know, you should probably get it down on paper before it disappears.<eos> You know, you did a great job playing the other night.<eos> I woulda told you myself, but... you kind of bailed on me.<eos> Was that because they told you to stay away from me or because you couldn't keep up?<eos> I bailed 'cause it seemed like you were a little... over-served.<eos> That is a very ballsy thing to say to your boss.<eos> You are lucky you're cute enough to get away with it.<eos> You wanna help me get those lyrics down on paper before they disappear?
And she even opened Beth's window to make it look like an intruder had broken in.<eos> What was your mom wearing that night?<eos> (Exhales)<eos> Gray slacks, gray sweater, and slippers... and her pearl necklace.<eos> The one dad gave her on their 10-year anniversary.<eos> Did she destroy that, too?<eos> I...<eos> I... I don't think so.<eos> Pearls are porous.<eos> They absorb blood.
Larissa didn't die, because she never even existed.<eos> You can't stop someone from dying.<eos> You can't leave now, Alex.<eos> Larissa is hurt.<eos> She needs your help.<eos> Alex, you need to save everybody.<eos> The girls.<eos> Did you see them?<eos> Are they--<eos> They're real.
- You can.<eos> 'Cause you're a survivor.<eos> And I know that's not some kind of curse.<eos> It just means that you're strong enough to keep fighting.<eos> I don't understand why I keep getting to live.<eos> Why me and not them?<eos> I had the same questions when Daniel died.<eos> I never found an answer.<eos> You know, maybe tonight is the answer.<eos> Those girls, they got out because we were there.

I'll catch you all later.<eos> Rocket, pass out them straws.<eos> Chicken, start making spitballs.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> No, no... no spit...<eos> give me that.<eos> No spitballs.<eos> Guys, look, Wade is a friend.<eos> And I know he's got a history with Tansy, and everything, but the way I see it, if things wouldn't have ended the way they did with the two of them, then I...
Do you... do you know what, man?<eos> Who could ever possibly understand the inner workings...<eos> They've got little fickle minds, mate.<eos> My dad, he used to say to me, you know, he used to say,<eos> "Rudy, women are very much like tractors."<eos> Which I have never understood.<eos> I think it's something, really, to do with potatoes.<eos> That's what it is.<eos> Shit.<eos> They're just not like men, seriously.
One of the files just had a note written in the margin about room 7B and the word "weird" with three exclamation points.<eos> Good times.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dean: Hmm.<eos> Got it.<eos> Sammy, check this out.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Is that a Devil's Trap?<eos> It takes up half the room.<eos> These chains -- they have spellwork etched into them.
She's gone.<eos> My name is Naomi.<eos> We rescued you.<eos> ♪ I was soaring ever higher<eos> The Angel Tablet.<eos> I won't hurt Dean.<eos> Kill him.<eos> We're family.<eos> I have to protect this tablet now.<eos> These trials -- they're purifying me.
With Nick.<eos> [Knock at door]<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> I got you flowers, because I'm really nervous.<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> Me too.<eos> They're really pretty.
I got you flowers, because I'm really nervous.<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> Me too.<eos> They're really pretty.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, I just want to say, Monroe told me what you saw at the spice shop.<eos> Yeah, that was...<eos> Eye-opening.<eos> You're okay?<eos> Well, um, why don't I go put these in water before they woge?
I think so.<eos> I didn't believe him.<eos> I mean, he told me everything, but I didn't believe him.<eos> And what about now?<eos> You believe Nick, don't you?<eos> And so do you.<eos> We do.<eos> Yeah, 'cause I just...<eos> I thought he was crazy.<eos> Some things aren't as crazy as they seem when you kind of get to know them.
Has it ever gotten personal for you?<eos> Sadly, after this interview, I learned that Lieutenant Kelly lost someone very dear to him, his wife, Malia, as a direct result of a Five-O investigation.<eos> Now, out of respect, I won't go into further detail, but what I will tell you is that despite their personal losses,<eos> Five-O has forged an incredible bond, one akin to family, or what the locals refer to as "'ohana."<eos> Now, what if I was to tell you that we-- and by "we" I mean this show-- had a direct hand in helping this investigation?<eos> To explain how, let's meet Officer Kono Kalakaua.<eos> Kono grew up on the North Shore of O'ahu and spent the early part of her life as a professional surfer. Now, when a knee injury sidelined her career, she followed in the footsteps of her cousin, Chin Ho Kelly, and joined the ranks of law enforcement.<eos> A skilled sniper and martial artist,<eos> Kono explains here how Five-O uses technology to help solve crimes.<eos> In a lot of cases, we use public surveillance cameras because they allow us to capture evidence of criminal activity.
Which would mean that Wo Fat's not the killer.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Why's he so interested in our John Doe?<eos> Oh, welcome.<eos> Please, come in, come in.<eos> Ms. Walker, so good to see you again.<eos> Billy, Todd, always a pleasure.<eos> Where are your glasses, Max?<eos> Oh, I'm wearing contacts.<eos> Uh, they don't respond to indoor precipitation like my spectacles do.
Yeah -- looks perfect for a 6-year-old.<eos> My wedding is ruined.<eos> Georgia, that is not true.<eos> Now, it says, "Happy Birthday, Lilly Marie."<eos> That means that Lilly Marie has to have your cake, and so I'm gonna go get it back.<eos> It's a bad omen, Riley.<eos> Georgia, there is nothing to worry about.<eos> Nothing to worry about?<eos> I have a list a week long and only two days to do it.<eos> Like the flowers -- you have to remember to pluck the petals off the rose but not a moment -- Moment too soon, because they will wilt and shrivel up, and I got that.
Dearest.<eos> Holiness.<eos> May I present to you, Vincenzo Salvatore.<eos> Your Holiness.<eos> Your hands.<eos> My hands?<eos> Yes, let me touch your hands.<eos> Soft.<eos> Never worked with land.<eos> They toiled with a feather quill, Your Holiness.
- And who appointed you?<eos> - Signor Orsini.<eos> This behemoth fires the ball with 300 pounds.<eos> Admirable.<eos> - But there is a problem.<eos> - Problem?<eos> The powder to fire the ball.<eos> Gunpowder is made of saltpeter and sulfur.<eos> Saltpeter we have in plenty, but the supplies of sulfur have dried up.<eos> How can they just...dry up?
How can one be a prince without a principality?<eos> One cannot.<eos> Which is why, I presume, you came to talk to me of Forli.<eos> If Rome moves on Forli, what would Florence do?<eos> You know well what Florence will do.<eos> What we always do.<eos> We must cross the borders of Florence to get there.<eos> Do so then at night.<eos> But armies make noise.<eos> I'll make sure they move quietly.
We knew them already, my lord.<eos> Good.<eos> Never presume that I will not act on my worst instincts.<eos> Or that it is not in your best interests to stay loyal to me.<eos> We have an army here.<eos> It is well stocked, powdered at last.<eos> It has generals. They imagine they rule.<eos> They don't.<eos> You rule.<eos> Armies act like locusts on the lands that they move through.
Amy, let's put out that press release that Chief Taylor is so anxious about.<eos> The one confirming murder-suicide?<eos> - That's the one.<eos> - But, ca--<eos> You heard the Captain, Sykes.<eos> Please-- just do it.<eos> It's like I thought.<eos> She says the baseballs are out of order.<eos> El señor William siempre las organizaba por el año en que estaban autografiadas.<eos> He always kept them by the year they were signed.
Yeah, but a drone?<eos> Maybe the pilot was just pretending that he wasn't flying.<eos> No, no.<eos> You can't fake that kind of panic.<eos> I agree.<eos> He was having a pants-soiling moment.<eos> But there is one possibility we are neglecting.<eos> The drone itself.<eos> It's "Rise of the Machines", not unlike skynet in "The Terminator".<eos> The machines have achieved consciousness, and they are pissed.
Duke told me you had a picture of Audrey Parker.<eos> Mm-hmm, in here somewhere.<eos> So these troubles, how come the whole world doesn't know about them?<eos> Well, that's what we do here at The Herald.<eos> We cover it up.<eos> We said this one was caused by 17-year cicadas.<eos> Haven also has a lot of gas leaks.<eos> Are they like evolution or magic?<eos> Oh, no, it's... it's more like having a supernatural ability that you don't want and can't control.<eos> They tend to cause a lot of death and destruction.
- Miss Channing, now, you wrote here the reason for your visit is an "Uncomfortable sensation in your nether regions."<eos> Could you be more specific?<eos> Is there a more private area we could discuss my private area?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry!<eos> Let me bring out my hot air balloon and we'll take a tour of the city... While we discuss your uncomfortable lady sensation.<eos> Shirley, the only lady sensation I'm seeing in this office is you.<eos> Oh, well, I appreciate that, girl.<eos> I try to lighten the load with a little humor.<eos> Well, I don't need the jokes. Thank you.<eos> Oh, they not for you.
You mean how you try to plot your course.<eos> You never end up going where you planned.<eos> Ouch. That's cold.<eos> But it's true.<eos> And that's because I can't plot where the wind will blow.<eos> I have to let it take me where it wants to go.<eos> And you know, a lot of times, I end up someplace way, way cooler than I had ever, ever expected.<eos> The wind has literally pushed me in new directions.<eos> Some people, they prefer to stay on the ground.<eos> That way, they can always tell where they're going.
I'd really rather not have to do this in interview.<eos> For what?<eos> Getting our rings cleaned?<eos> I'm sorry, Officer.<eos> You're gonna have to do a little better than that.<eos> This is Noelle's old place. (Keys jangle)<eos> She's been trying to sell it since she moved in with Frank.<eos> She gave you a key?<eos> Well, that's what single girls do, Steve.<eos> They give each other keys to their place.
Yes, of course.<eos> Do me a favor, will you, Harker?<eos> Turn out the lights and lock up.<eos> I just know I'm going to botch it.<eos> I will be lucky to pass, much less be chosen as Professor Van Helsing's protégée.<eos> You...<eos> You'll do fine.<eos> No, Jonathan, I most decidedly will not do fine.<eos> The cardiovascular system is the most complex structure I've studied this term, and surgical skills are not my forte.<eos> They never have been.
And seeing as Mitch is dead, I'm going with you carried out your threat.<eos> I don't expect you to understand.<eos> But those rules exist for a reason.<eos> Trust is the life blood of any polyamorous union.<eos> It's what separates us from the cancerous jealousies of so-called monogamous relationships, and is the only way one can truly love freely.<eos> And with your anger issues, it's those rules that separate you from beating someone to death.<eos> Obviously I lost my temper.<eos> But Ian called me back, and he talked me off the ledge.<eos> Cindy wants a baby, and she's not getting any younger.<eos> Our hesitations, they're not just theoretical for her.

- to leave right now.<eos> - No, no, no...<eos> Whoa, whoa. Where... where you going?<eos> When I followed Junior down here a few days ago, we found another way out.<eos> We gotta find those kids.<eos> Angie!<eos> You should go back to the shelter.<eos> No, I want to stay with you.<eos> You should be with your moms.<eos> They're your family.
You need any help?<eos> How about you take that gun off your daddy?<eos> I'm asking you nicely to leave now before anyone else gets hurt.<eos> You okay?<eos> Norrie thinks it's my fault that Alice died.<eos> No.<eos> She doesn't think that.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll let you in on a little secret.<eos> Women say a lot of things they don't mean.
With a mini-dome around it.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> The caterpillar's in a cocoon now.<eos> It's actually a chrysalis.<eos> He's a nerd.<eos> And you think I'm supposed to be part of this, too?<eos> We do.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's the pink stars.<eos> And they're making constellations.
Chester's Mill is a place like any other.<eos> At least it used to be until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome.<eos> Invisible, indestructible, and completely inescapable.<eos> We're trapped.<eos> We don't know where it came from or why it's here, but now that we're all trapped under the dome together, none of our secrets are safe.<eos> It's the pink stars.<eos> And they're making constellations.
But none that didn't absolutely need to be taken... for the good of this town.<eos> Then why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because I thought I needed to protect you from all this.<eos> But I realize now that was a mistake.<eos> You and I... are in this together.<eos> The Rennies.<eos> We were chosen.<eos> Your mother knew it, and she was trying with all her heart to tell us.<eos> Those pink stars she painted are a message, son.<eos> And they're shining down on you.
I've seen you, listening.<eos> Watching.<eos> Figuring out how people work.<eos> When you see me, for instance, do you...<eos> - Old, weak, slow.<eos> - Go on?<eos> Patronizing, curious, sensual.<eos> I see you're warming up to me.<eos> The way you touch your things.<eos> Like they're precious.

- Fucking Ray.<eos> I hate him all day, and when I'm drunk, all I do is think about him.<eos> - Here you are.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> That's $5000.<eos> Doesn't Ray buy you things?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But it's never the right thing.<eos> Oh, just buy them.<eos> They look great on you.
What did you do to get into this group, sweetie pie?<eos> The court sent me there.<eos> I'm on probation.<eos> - That's none of his business, Lacey. - No, I'm not hiding anything.<eos> His imagination is probably worse than anything I did.<eos> I shot my boyfriend in the balls.<eos> Oh, my Holy Mary, mother of God.<eos> Sounds bad out of context. What context?<eos> Did his balls pull a knife on her?<eos> No, they complained that I parked in their driveway.
I got him, but he's good.<eos> Signal's bouncing all over the globe.<eos> You know explanations will require time that we do not have.<eos> We can make the time.<eos> Perhaps, in a few days.<eos> Nothing will make me happier.<eos> For now, take my word for it.<eos> Nothing is entirely as it seems.<eos> I wish things were different, Ziva.<eos> Thanks to you, they're not, Ilan.
I must apologize for my unbridled optimism this morning, Jethro.<eos> I am no closer to identifying this man now than before.<eos> Abby ran his DNA, and she came up empty.<eos> This guy's had more plastic surgery than Joan Rivers and Cher combined.<eos> That is an inappropriate remark, Mr. Palmer, however accurate.<eos> This man has gone to great lengths to conceal his identity.<eos> Besides removing his fingerprints, all of the key parameters for facial recognition have been surgically altered-- shape of his nose, the length of his chin...<eos> He's even had the contour and length of his ears changed.<eos> In recent years, ears have proven to be a more unique I.D. than fingerprints.<eos> They have a 96.6% degree of accuracy.
Can we please get out of here?<eos> [Sputters] All right.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I know where we're going.<eos> Where?<eos> I'm telling you, Steve, gay bars... best place to meet women!<eos> I love this music!<eos> Yeah!<eos> It's hot in here!<eos> Girls don't think you're gonna be in here, so they like you, and they talk to you, but then when they find out you're not gay, they think you're a great guy for being so liberal!
It's for my friend Tommy here.<eos> Just hear him out.<eos> He's opening up a nightclub.<eos> No place like it in Vegas.<eos> A joint for all the bands, showgirls, cocktail waitresses, to unwind after the show.<eos> Everything's set, but... It's been a real pill getting the city to give us our liquor license.<eos> Considering you eat lunch with the girls down at the city planner's office...<eos> Why don't you ask them yourself?<eos> If you hurry, you'll catch them at the Staley's counter.<eos> They eat there every day at noon.
He wanted to know if I'd ever given you any of the hydrocodone that I was prescribed last year.<eos> Why would he ask you that?<eos> He said you were uncertain if you'd ever taken it.<eos> I've never taken it.<eos> Emily, I checked the bottle.<eos> I counted the pills.<eos> Now, I might be one or two off, but there are more than seven pills missing.<eos> Did you take them?<eos> I didn't take them.<eos> Then where did they go?
Mums go to prison for that.<eos> I see you live in Summerhouse.<eos> Don't look at him!<eos> Look at me.<eos> Someone in the Summerhouse gang, did they give you these drugs and tell you to sell them?<eos> No.<eos> So these are YOUR drugs you're selling? They're not my drugs.<eos> These are your drugs.<eos> Is that's what you're saying?<eos> They don't... They're not mine.
Colombian?<eos> Argentinean.<eos> Of course.<eos> I should have been tipped off by the superior attitude.<eos> I'm Mexican.<eos> We invented chilaquiles.<eos> Didn't mean to offend you.<eos> Feel free to use a bland pepper of your choosing.<eos> My chilaquiles are not bland.<eos> If you're using poblanos, they are.
Uh... it's... it's... it's nothing.<eos> I'm just tired.<eos> I'm actually gonna go to bed.<eos> You want me to clean your jacket?<eos> Uh, just get it later.<eos> I'm gonna go conk out.<eos> Thanks for the dance.<eos> I felt awful, Ida.<eos> These women don't make that much.<eos> What did they have to sacrifice to scrape that money together?

Maybe some other time.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Zoila, have you seen my car keys?<eos> Are you going somewhere?<eos> A friend's having a party.<eos> I thought I'd stop by.<eos> Okay.<eos> So... car keys?<eos> They're in the kitchen.
I choose not to.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> Do you really think I would do anything to make your stay here easier?<eos> You're not happy Genevieve and I are seeing each other.<eos> No. I'm not.<eos> You're worried that I'll hurt her again.<eos> You're 2-for-2.<eos> Would you believe that I've changed?<eos> Not you, Mr. leopard.<eos> Your spots are where they've always been.
Yeah, who was plumb concerned about y'all canceling his favorite show.<eos> Why do they keep hanging up on me?<eos> I'm sorry you're upset.<eos> You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this.<eos> I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.<eos> Oh, that's nonsense.<eos> I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time.<eos> I don't care how they end.
So you recognize what Tolcher was doing?<eos> He took my nanoparticle drug delivery system and weaponized it.<eos> How did he get this?<eos> The people he's working with have eyes everywhere.<eos> So someone's spying on my lab?<eos> Possibly.<eos> More importantly, is there a way to counter the nanotoxin?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Nanocells are designed to mimic human tissue, so they can't survive without a live host for more than 20 minutes.
Getting her out.<eos> - Michael, you're at risk--<eos> - Screw that.<eos> Look, Michael, we will rescue Nikita, but you can't do anything if you're dead.<eos> I'm dead already.<eos> Kang is gone, as is any chance of me getting an antidote.<eos> And I'll be damned if I stand around while Nikita's in trouble.<eos> Wait, you're not dead yet.<eos> Look, I've been thinking, Kang said that the nanocells react just like living tissue.<eos> They die when the host body dies.
No!<eos> A-all right, Brick.<eos> I give up.<eos> If the Tribe of Truth doesn't work, I don't know what will.<eos> I've done everything a professional therapist can do to justify his job.<eos> I just don't get it.<eos> Why don't you want to go to middle school?<eos> Oh.<eos> Was that what this was all about?<eos> Well, at the middle school, the handles on the water fountains are on the right, and I'm used to having them be on the left like they are here.
(Door slams) I'm gonna kill him.<eos> Just relax.<eos> He's not gonna be here much longer.<eos> Then I'll have to act fast, won't I?<eos> I can't stand him, Mike.<eos> I just hate his stupid face.<eos> I swear to God, when he goes off to college, I'm not even gonna miss him.<eos> (Sighs) Look, all this fighting is just nature's way of helping you guys deal with the fact he's leaving.<eos> You think mama birds push their babies out of the nest to help 'em fly?<eos> Maybe they're just sick of 'em.
Good luck with the baby.<eos> Last one.<eos> Robert Hatfield.<eos> All right.<eos> You behave tonight, Robert.<eos> You behave.<eos> Elizabeth Hayworth. (Man whistles)<eos> Here you go.<eos> As I watched my first son about to become a high school graduate, I realized that Mike was right.<eos> There is a natural order to things, and by the time they go, you're ready.
Keep it.<eos> How will you shop otherwise?<eos> 25 years old.<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> Yes, my poor Viviane.<eos> To be honest, my son is a little bit innocent.<eos> Did you notice you could be intelligent about some things and naive about others?<eos> That's true.<eos> He knows nothing about women.<eos> He has no idea what they can do, especially when poor.
It was me, I did it.<eos> Did what?<eos> The pills.<eos> You care to explain.<eos> I was feeling like a freak.<eos> Just tired being the kid with add.<eos> Everyone always asking me, "did you take your pill?"<eos> "Did you take your pill?" You know, so I stopped.<eos> I started hiding them in my pocket.<eos> Kelsey saw them at school and she told me she heard they make you really smart, and really focused.
Ok.<eos> Let's go. Time's up.<eos> Mariana!<eos> My turn.<eos> - Girls take longer. - No, no, no.<eos> But this isn't fair.<eos> - Get out.<eos> - Just gimme a second.<eos> You're not supposed to be on the computer.<eos> - If Moms find out they're gonna ream me.
Really? Wow.<eos> I mean, moms are gonna be devastated if you go.<eos> And my Dad will be devastated if I don't go.<eos> You wanted to choose.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> I just think, I mean, we're gonna get a lot more time alone.<eos> I just hope my moms don't get too upset.<eos> Brandon they'll be fine.<eos> Really.<eos> You can go visit them, you know, whenever... with all those kids in the house I doubt they'll even notice.
I know.<eos> Jenna said they haven't had sex in over a year.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> That is a long time to let it go, isn't it.<eos> How long has it been for us?<eos> Uh, it was last...<eos> If you have to think about it, it's been too long.<eos> Sweetheart, what do you expect?<eos> We have jobs, five kids, and no cleaning person.<eos> Can't expect things to be the way they used to be.

Do you mind?<eos> Ok.<eos> When Stef and I are at home, we hold hands and kiss...<eos> Really?<eos> Well, we used to do it a lot more often, but we've just been really busy lately.<eos> What does being busy have to do with holding hands?<eos> Ok, we're getting a little off-track here.<eos> My point is, sometimes when we're out in a new neighborhood or walking home late to our car, we won't hold hands.<eos> Why?<eos> Some people out there are afraid of what's different, and sometimes they want to hurt people like Stef and me.
All right, Garret!<eos> Woo!<eos> Hey.<eos> Congrats.<eos> You totally blew everyone away.<eos> Aw, thanks.<eos> At least we got the happy ending for one night.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> My moms are splitting up.<eos> They don't think I know.
She's not a hypocrite, and she was ashamed.<eos> "Seemingly unaware that her own family own and run..."<eos> What's going on?<eos> We found this in the privy, Master.<eos> Privy's where it belongs.<eos> Get back to work.<eos> Yes, Master.<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> He's been trying to make the slave driver accusations stick for months and you've just handed it to him on a plate.<eos> All your meetings and petitions may stem from the most honourable of motives, Mother, but until this battle with Doherty is won, they have to stop.
Are you glad to be back?<eos> Glad I got to see the fat cow gone, we'll get bigger portions now.<eos> What was it really like out there?<eos> One thing better than a bowl of scouse - the taste of freedom.<eos> But it's inhuman, Robert, and it's not the way we do things here.<eos> I may have... overreacted... but I haven't broken any laws.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Apologies, ma'am, been quite a day.<eos> Have you had any runaways lately?<eos> Yes, we did, but they're all accounted for now.
Who can tell me why we're having movie day?<eos> Uh, you wanted to show us how you spent your summer vacation?<eos> And people wonder why mad scientists abuse their assistants.<eos> Sit down, Lewicki.<eos> I showed those clips to pose, one of the most fundamental questions we'll explore this semester.<eos> What is an abnormal brain?<eos> And how does having one affect behavior?<eos> It could turn someone into a monster, like Mr. Karloff here.<eos> But, more likely, it manifests in less dramatic ways.<eos> Some abnormalities are structural, so they show up on a brain scan or an autopsy, but others are sneakier and more insidious.
But I can't.<eos> I've, uh, got a previous engagement.<eos> Oh.<eos> I am exploring the dialectic of a post-colonial symbiosis...<eos> Between the otherness of the object and the objectification of the other...<eos> Uh, Caroline.<eos> You want to get the hell out of here?<eos> You have no idea how much.<eos> Its dialectic roots are as epistemologically reductive.<eos> As they are reductively epistemological.
Or is it malleable?<eos> The science of Neuroplasticity... Suggests that our brain has the ability to change and grow throughout our life.<eos> In essence, our experiences rewire us.<eos> They can make us do or think things previously undoable or unthinkable.<eos> They can provoke us into forming new thoughts and ideas.<eos> And they can teach us valuable lessons, making us less inclined to repeat the mistakes of our past.<eos> The brain is in a constant state of flux.<eos> Suggesting that nothing in life is permanent.<eos> And yet, as they say, the more that things change...<eos> The more they stay the same.
[Coughs] Erika, any hemoptysis or dyspnea?<eos> - No.<eos> - Are... and I'm not producing any sputum either.<eos> Because... and if I did it would be clear.<eos> Yup.<eos> We'd like to run some blood anyway.<eos> And give you an antitussive for the cough.<eos> - And ask when you plan to rest.<eos> - When the runway show is set.<eos> I still have a few pieces left to finish, and they have to be perfect.
Why don't we try this again tomorrow night?<eos> At my place.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> [Footsteps approaching]<eos> So...<eos> Problem?<eos> Sorry, Monroe.<eos> But it looks like things are going really well with you two.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, they're actually going amazing.
Baby, I don't want to go either, but we don't have a choice.<eos> I love you.<eos> We're gonna make it.<eos> - Am I late for something?<eos> - In a way.<eos> I take it this is not about a case?<eos> We're talking about a key.<eos> I suppose now is as good a time as any.<eos> I know there's seven keys.<eos> I know they lead to something that was buried in the 13th century.
Yes, I do.<eos> What?<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> They were supposed to be extinct.<eos> At least that's what I was told.<eos> Well, that wouldn't exactly be in a natural history book.<eos> No, these things have a very unnatural history.<eos> They were supposedly hunted to extinction.<eos> Like the buffalo, their skins were considered very valuable because of their luminescent quality.<eos> They were hoarded by collectors.

When this is done, you leave me alone.<eos> I never go back on my word.<eos> Yes?<eos> How do they look?<eos> Everything is checked.<eos> It's on its way.<eos> Okay.<eos> The merchandise was checked and is being taken to the ship.<eos> Bombs are already being delivered to a ship?<eos> We can't bust them till we know where they are.
I'll inform the brigades.<eos> Take a breath... look in his eyes, take his gun, and flip him!<eos> Go buy a new pack.<eos> Am I alone? You go.<eos> - You've turned rebel now?<eos> - What's with you?<eos> I have seven sisters, not one of them is married.<eos> I have to feed them all.<eos> Don't get me wrong.<eos> They're nice, God bless them. But not one of them is pretty.
What secrets do they know about you?<eos> What? What secrets?<eos> What's going on between you and Amjad?<eos> Give Amjad this number and ask him to let me know where I can find him.<eos> Omar, please don't come here any more.<eos> Press one for messages.<eos> You have no messages.<eos> - How did you find me?<eos> - Your sisters.<eos> How are they doing?

Nothing in the engine and boiler rooms.<eos> - The bow is clear.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Did you check the utility rooms?<eos> - It's all clear.<eos> - There's no bomb.<eos> - Bloody hell!<eos> Is this some sort of Victoria Day prank then?<eos> Could the bombs be between the hulls?<eos> Oh, by God, they could be anywhere.
- He set the bombs himself.<eos> This is absurd!<eos> Why would I sink my own ship?<eos> For the insurance money.<eos> It was the only way you'd be able to recoup all that you've spent on this ship.<eos> And you reported the threats to throw suspicion off of you.<eos> Well, if I wanted to sink my ship, why would I tell you about the bombs?<eos> Because your daughter went missing.<eos> And when that happened you needed us to find her before the bombs went off.<eos> You didn't know where they were!
That's all this is.<eos> He is a mentor to her, and she is his impressionable, young mentee.<eos> You want a cocktail?<eos> Sure. Cocktails, please.<eos> Make hers a double.<eos> Riley: Okay. Lace, I know that you don't want to talk, but there's something I want to show you.<eos> You see those two buttons?<eos> Well, the two girls on those buttons have been through hell and back.<eos> And I'm gonna save those buttons so I can show them to your kids -- beautiful, wonderful, smart kids.<eos> And the two girls on those buttons -- well, they're gonna get through it all together.
We must remember, he murdered a prostitute to highlight the inequality of the law.<eos> Well, he said he did.<eos> But he's the Truth Terrorist.<eos> Funny.<eos> So it depends.<eos> On?<eos> Age, body type, sex.<eos> My girlfriend still has the heating on in July.<eos> Actually, women bear extreme cold better than men.<eos> It's the fat - they have more of it.
It's driving me crazy!<eos> No!<eos> No grated cheese on a gratin!<eos> It's a heresy!<eos> But doesn't gratin imply grilled food?<eos> Yes.<eos> But the potatoes get grilled with the cream.<eos> I see!<eos> So you cook them with any potatoes.<eos> I used sorted out Agata potatoes, so that they're all the same size.
Favorite? Let me,<eos> Hello, my angel!<eos> Very nice.<eos> Already finished<eos> What big eyes!<eos> Want to say something?<eos> At that time you were afraid Jelena lift, as it was so small.<eos> True, but I'm learning very fast, is not it?<eos> Already landed,<eos> For the girls, so they do not miss me!
That is a Eurasian collared dove.<eos> The bird didn't even migrate to the tristate area until 2008.<eos> Harris died in 2003!<eos> MONTENEGRO:<eos> Hodgins is right.<eos> The pixels don't match.<eos> SAROYAN:<eos> Pelant is sending these videos to her.<eos> HODGINS:<eos> And she thinks they're really from her father.
♪ I'll take the long way<eos> ♪ If it's a long way<eos> ♪ A long way down<eos> ♪ For us.<eos> BRENNAN:<eos> Is Christine asleep?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Angela gave me this magazine.<eos> I-I don't understand why all these women are wearing white dresses.<eos> There's no way they're all virgins.
Why isn't the echo on battery power?<eos> There should be a manual switch.<eos> Ross, go look.<eos> I know the generator should be on.<eos> I'm asking why it's not.<eos> Webber, I'm checking in.<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> - Some light would be good.<eos> - The emergency lights shoulda kicked on.<eos> Well, they didn't.
What, a couple, maybe more?<eos> When I say a vaginal delivery isn't an option, I mean, it's not an option.<eos> Now I could stand here and waste time explaining how your baby is in a mento-posterior position and how pushing a baby like that will hyperextend its neck, which can be fatal, or I can better spend my time prepping your wife... and baby for a delivery<eos> that will not endanger either of their lives.<eos> So... which do you prefer?<eos> We're having a C-section in the dark.<eos> Yes...<eos> The vents kicked on to battery power?<eos> I checked them all twice.<eos> They're working.
- Any luck?<eos> - No.<eos> No one thought about spare batteries.<eos> And pretty soon, all those machines are gonna die out there, and then all those babies are gonna die, and all because I didn't think ahead to stockpile batteries.<eos> And also, I cheated on my wife with that... woman out there, and I'm a horrible person.<eos> I'm horrible.<eos> I'm in love with that intern out there, but I won't tell her.<eos> And I keep saying to myself I won't tell her because everyone I love turns out to be crazy or mean or cancer-y or... or leaves.<eos> But the thing all those women have in common is me.<eos> They were all fine before they met me.
And now you think I'm horrible, too.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> If you hadn't gotten to him first, I probably would have killed the guy.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would you do that for me?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Why wouldn't I?<eos> We try so hard to protect ourselves, but it doesn't make a damn bit of difference.<eos> 'Cause when the bad things come, they come out of nowhere.
for the Internet to be neutral, nothing nor no one must modify the content that goes through the pipes.<eos> Network neutrality means:<eos> Wherever you are on the network, you see Internet in the same way, you can access the same things.<eos> This is what makes the Internet what it is. This means, a kind of big global database through which you can discuss with everyone and especially, this means that the intelligence isn't concentrated in one single place in the network, the intelligence is not at Orange, nor at Numericable, nor at any other specific service provider<eos> but intelligence is distributed across the numerous branches of the network. Thus, across the users.<eos> Network neutrality is the cornerstone of freedom of speech on the Internet.<eos> There is no freedom of speech if there is no network neutrality<eos> Otherwise, you don't know what you're watching.<eos> Actually, without it, you're in The Matrix.<eos> You're in the matrix, you are presented with things and you don't know if they are true, you don't know if the texts are really those written by the authors...
These are Brian's notes from his lesson plan for his class.<eos> "Decoherence and Schrödinger's Cat." He talked about this.<eos> Do you guys know what Schrödinger's cat is?<eos> I'm allergic.<eos> So, it's a, um... It's a thought experiment. There's a...<eos> There's a cat in a box... that has, like, a 50/50 chance of living... because there's a vial of poison... that's also in the box.<eos> So, regular physics would say that it's one or the other.<eos> That the cat is either alive or dead.<eos> But Brian would argue that quantum physics says... that both realities exist simultaneously.<eos> It's only when you open the box that they collapse... into a single event.
- I was a three.<eos> - You sure? Yeah.<eos> What's going on in the kitchen?<eos> - Pound cake.<eos> The girls are breaking out dessert... before the other house eats it.<eos> Hey, Mike, I need to show you something.<eos> The numbers that I remember... from the box that was brought here from the other house... are these numbers.<eos> But these are the numbers that I found here... in this notepad.<eos> And I just asked everyone if they can remember their number.<eos> Beth and Lee are from this house originally, because they have never left.
-That's right.<eos> -I like staying here.<eos> -I'll talk to Lilian.<eos> Go for it.<eos> The ship would leave in a week.<eos> So I stayed here.<eos> How many people knew about that?<eos> The crew, of course.<eos> The control personnel and the Port of Halmstad.<eos> When bees see smoke, they think it's fire then they calm down.
Diagnosis:<eos> CVA.<eos> Cerebral vascular accident.<eos> Intensive care unit.<eos> Head down, legs in the air.<eos> What a night!<eos> The sequelae depend on the area of the brain and the functions it controls.<eos> The bigger the area deprived of oxygen, the worse the sequelae are.<eos> After a CVA, some people will find it difficult to speak or write, and have memory problems.<eos> They can also suffer from a paralysis of the body.
That'll be all.<eos> So what happened?<eos> Drive-by drop-off, gurney completely destroyed.<eos> How do you replace a gurney?<eos> Uh, we took one from Lakeshore.<eos> Hey, Renee, it's Kelly.<eos> Listen, um... give me a call when you get a chance.<eos> All right, love you, bye.<eos> Transfers from a closed house is never good.<eos> They were closed for a reason.
- Don't make fun!<eos> "Nothing like beauties to renew boudin's image."<eos> No doubt about it, it's of global importance.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - To wake up Julie.<eos> Life doesn't stop for those girls!<eos> This can't go on.<eos> Something must be done.<eos> It won't last.<eos> Where are they?

Off we go!<eos> I'm not with you this time.<eos> Do you hear?<eos> I'm not with you.<eos> My dear Chang?<eos> Mr Girard, are they on the plane?<eos> We've decided to keep the girls here.<eos> - You've taken them hostage!<eos> - Kind of. But I can assure you they're perfectly safe.<eos> They're consenting.
My men have been protective and beyond reproach.<eos> And as for discipline, they could teach our recruits a thing or two.<eos> Smile!<eos> Soup!<eos> Soup!<eos> Want me to feed you?<eos> - The soup...<eos> - Soup is good.<eos> Very good.<eos> They've eaten too much cheese.
Hey, I'm looking for a tow service.<eos> Transcript by alth<eos> Welcome to the dark side of New Orleans.<eos> A supernatural playground where the living are easily lost the dead stick around to play.<eos> New Orleans?<eos> Why the bloody hell did Klaus go back there?<eos> Evidently their witches conspire against him.<eos> So knowing our brother this was a mission to silence the sloth.<eos> Well, the French quarter witches are not to be trifled with.<eos> You don't suppose they found a way to kill him once and for all, do you?
New Orleans?<eos> Why the bloody hell did Klaus go back there?<eos> Evidently their witches conspire against him.<eos> So knowing our brother this was a mission to silence the sloth.<eos> Well, the French quarter witches are not to be trifled with.<eos> You don't suppose they found a way to kill him once and for all, do you?<eos> Rebecca, in the name of our family you might try to dial down your glee.<eos> What family?<eos> We're three distrustful acquaintances who happen to share a bloodline.<eos> I've for one hope they've found a way to make that traitorous bastard rot.
For me.<eos> Fine.<eos> Why don't you show me what you've done with the place while you explain exactly what you've been up to in my town?<eos> Follow me.<eos> Look at that skyline, huh.<eos> That there, that's progress.<eos> More hotels, more tourists, more fresh blood.<eos> And the humans, I taught them to look the other way.<eos> And what of the witches?<eos> In my time they were a force to be reckoned with and now they live in fear.
So, do you...<eos> paint?<eos> If you're here to give me another pep-talk on the joys of fatherhood...<eos> I've said all I've needed to say.<eos> I've forgot how much I like this town.<eos> I didn't forget.<eos> All the centuries we've spent together and yet I can count on one hand the number of times that our family has been truly happy.<eos> I hated leaving here.<eos> Are you aware that the witches can't leave here?<eos> They practice ancestral magic, they draw their power directly from their dead in those cemeteries.

But know this, if anything whatsoever happens to that girl or her unborn child, you needn't fear Marcel, nor Klaus nor anyone more than you will need to fear me.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Whose life are we celebrating?<eos> Old Abe from the butcher shop.<eos> Nice guy.<eos> Handy with a meat cleaver.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> He broke the rules.<eos> Marcel's rules.<eos> But how does he know when they are broken?
It's generator powered.<eos> It's all independently wired, and it's set to record 24/7.<eos> Camera one's a wide shot of the road so we can monitor everyone coming in and out of the property.<eos> Camera two is wide of the house.<eos> Camera three is of the Western pasture.<eos> Camera four is of the corral.<eos> Camera five is the barn exterior. And camera six is inside the barn.<eos> That's it for the exterior cameras.<eos> CAMERON: What happens at night?<eos> They all switch to infrared.
Cody!<eos> Cody?<eos> Matt, Lisa.<eos> Get in here.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Matt, you go get her kit.<eos> We need to cast all these prints.<eos> Look at all these tracks.<eos> Where did they come from?<eos> These are definitely canine prints. But they're enormous.
What... what time is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> (Sighs) Come on.<eos> You want some tea?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Come in.<eos> Not many men could get away with those slippers.<eos> (Chuckles) Yeah.<eos> They have sentimental value.
I don't know.<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> (Sighs) Come on.<eos> You want some tea?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Come in.<eos> Not many men could get away with those slippers.<eos> (Chuckles) Yeah.<eos> They have sentimental value.<eos> They were my grandmother's. (Water running)
(Radio chatter) Why Chloe?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, I could have driven myself.<eos> We'd be there already.<eos> Think it's okay if we use these.<eos> (Click, siren wailing) Ident recovered five spent shells from a hunting rifle.<eos> The others probably went over the edge.<eos> They're looking for them now.<eos> Any recoverable prints?<eos> Several sets on each of the three exit doors, but they're old, probably degraded.
The others probably went over the edge.<eos> They're looking for them now.<eos> Any recoverable prints?<eos> Several sets on each of the three exit doors, but they're old, probably degraded.<eos> I pulled security footage from the building, but it only covers the parking garage, lobby, and elevators.<eos> So if he took the stairs, we ain't got him.<eos> Exactly.<eos> How do you think he got into the building?<eos> Maintenance crews have been working on the fourth floor.<eos> They prop the doors open for ventilation, and they've been open all week.
You do now.<eos> And you're gonna get all the candy and toys and good stuff your grandma bought you when you wake up in the morning.<eos> But right now, you go back to sleep.<eos> I'm not tired.<eos> Now, Sally don't remember, but I gave your daddy a watch, gold watch.<eos> And I got a new band for it and I wanna fix it up before he come back.<eos> You seen it?<eos> He has four watches.<eos> I'll know it when I see it.<eos> They're in the drawer by his bed.
Make him understand.<eos> Fucking bitch!<eos> She treats me like I'm going to kidnap my own daughter!<eos> Bad word, papa... 10 bucks.<eos> Easy.. I'm on my way.<eos> Papa !<eos> - Fucking traffic..<eos> You were there?<eos> Good joke, man.<eos> Indian women have a red dot on their forehead 'cos they're recording everything...!
Dad, are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You seem sad.<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> It's only Costa Rica.<eos> I'll be back before you know it.<eos> Oh, that's--that's sweet, but, no, it's not about that.<eos> It's, uh... something your grandmother told me.<eos> There comes a point in our lives when we have to stop fooling ourselves into thinking life's gonna be the way we want it to be.<eos> Start seeing things for how they really are.
Most of them met their husbands at work.<eos> It makes you wonder, doesn't it?<eos> You could meet someone, too, Lillian.<eos> No, I mean, where they'd be if they'd actually pursued careers-- all those women, putting their ambitions on the back burner.<eos> I'm not looking for a man.<eos> And according to Bill Masters, I don't need one.<eos> Didn't you say that was a big revelation from his study?<eos> It's not just his study, you know.<eos> Well... his will be the only name on it.<eos> Don't you find it ironic that, in the end, it's going to be a man who will tell women that they can find their own satisfaction?
"To be longing for someone to play with<eos> "and for somewhere to play."<eos> Elise is here.<eos> The swallows are back.<eos> - Think it's true he couldn't burn him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But I'm also sure he won't speak about it.<eos> Mute and blind.<eos> He will only ever see shadows.<eos> Think how far they've come.
- Any idea who leaked?<eos> Uniforms, Chief's people, Dispatch, Mayor's Office...<eos> - We work at the bottom of the sieve.<eos> - What are we looking at?<eos> My expert opinion, I'd say it's a homicide.<eos> Definitely postmortem.<eos> The cuts are crude, so probably done by hand, nothing mechanical.<eos> It was a hacksaw.<eos> Cuts are about a quarter inch deep, but jagged.<eos> They start and stop, but there's no hesitation marks.
_ _<eos> _<eos> I'll be back in a day or two.<eos> How much longer do you think it'll take?<eos> A week, maybe.<eos> If I get bodies.<eos> We're gonna need to boost a fryer if we're gonna start laying out chicken dinners, too.<eos> I got the back set up for it.<eos> - How many rooms for girls?<eos> - Seven upstairs, but they're big.
Without each other's permission, right?<eos> Okay, okay!<eos> Samantha's saying, "don't post this."<eos> Now show us.<eos> This is silly!<eos> Come on!<eos> You've been waiting a long time for your girls!<eos> Because she's with her friends.<eos> That photo wasn't for mr. Sutton.<eos> They look like women, but they're just kids.
We found all three girls' prints in the car.<eos> Whose are on the steering wheel?<eos> Wheel was wiped clean.<eos> What about evidence on the victim's body?<eos> No, nothing that connects him to one of them.<eos> Alibis?<eos> Each girl has one.<eos> Each of their parents said they saw her<eos> In bed the night of the hit-and-run.<eos> At least they're all cooperating.
We're shopping for a party. This store doesn't have a party section.<eos> Yeah, it does, and here we are.<eos> I have to say, Penny, I don't understand why you, of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this.<eos> Well, I'm his girlfriend, of course I'm gonna support him.<eos> Well, you're his girlfriend for now.<eos> Maybe you're not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other's arms and britches.<eos> Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay?<eos> He gets to work with Stephen Hawking, who, by the way, will not be on the boat, I checked.<eos> It's not that big of an opportunity.<eos> I mean, even if Hawking's theories are correct all they prove is where the universe came from why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be.
Ordinarily, we'd be taking your intakes separately.<eos> But if Dr. Masters is breaking with tradition today, I will find you some pencils.<eos> Now, the questionnaire is essential to our research.<eos> So just think of it as eating your greens first.<eos> Well, I think we can skip straight to dessert tonight.<eos> In fact, take the questionnaires home.<eos> You can mail them back to us.<eos> I'm sure Mrs. Johnson can provide a stamped envelope.<eos> Tell her to remove the pins from her hair.<eos> They'll interfere with the leads from the electroencephalogram.
Bill's gonna be working for you.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> "Too many qualified applicants"?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> And you already have a job with the university.<eos> I have a fellowship.<eos> I applied for a permanent staff position and didn't get it, which is the same as being fired.<eos> But why?<eos> Your patients adore you.<eos> They get pregnant just so they can hang around your office.
Uh, I... I have it.<eos> Uh, the meteorite is safe.<eos> It's in an undisclosed location until we sort this out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And, we'd like to help Mr. Kresge sort it out.<eos> He possesses one of the largest meteorites on record, and he wants to sell.<eos> But he can't unless he beats his landlord to the claim.<eos> It's worth the fight.<eos> Meteorites are worth more than platinum.<eos> They go for upwards of $1,000 per gram.
Now let us in on Karp.<eos> I can't let Damien's case strain my resources.<eos> Now, you can challenge my parenting skills, or you can finish the case you begged me for.<eos> Denny had a private dealer appraise the rock.<eos> $3 million.<eos> Not bad for an afternoon of bowling, huh?<eos> Oh, we need the firm to reimburse us for our bowling games...<eos> seven of them, 48 bucks.<eos> You're wearing bowling shoes.<eos> - They're comfortable.
- Even better. - [Laughs]<eos> You called us all in on a Sunday for a lewdness mis-D?<eos> But there's more, okay?<eos> The perp, William Lewis-- if that's his real name-- he's got no ID, he's unemployed, he says he lives at a halfway house in Brooklyn.<eos> - I've got a call in--<eos> - So he has a record.<eos> Yeah, he should, but I can't find anything,<eos> - because I can't run his prints.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> They're burned off.
You ran through a photo with your fly open?<eos> You know, there are kids playing in that park.<eos> I explained this to the blonde detective.<eos> This--this is such a misunderstanding.<eos> I was out running.<eos> I got, uh, chafed, and so I had to stop to-- to make a little adjustment.<eos> - An adjustment.<eos> - Have you tried powder?<eos> You know, these girls say you approached them, exposed yourself, and made sexually suggestive comments.<eos> Do they even speak English?

We'll see you in court.<eos> Lover?<eos> Client?<eos> Nice freudian slip.<eos> - It wasn't.<eos> - I got that.<eos> It also means she's gonna fight like hell for him.<eos> I arrested the defendant two weeks ago for public lewdness.<eos> Alice Parker was on the witness list, it--<eos> Those charges were dropped, weren't they?
- All right, you take the right.<eos> Boston police.<eos> Put your hands on the wheel now.<eos> Do not move your hands.<eos> Keep them on that wheel.<eos> All right, when I tell you, you clasp your hands behind your head.<eos> Do it now.<eos> All right.<eos> Now slowly get out of the car.<eos> Keep your hands where they are.
Bookies keep odd hours.<eos> He leaves when he leaves.<eos> We'll just have to wait here until then.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> Just those things I said earlier.<eos> About Nate?<eos> You just said what you needed to say.<eos> Those things weren't true.<eos> Except they were.
You deserve better.<eos> I'm glad you have that now.<eos> What do you need?<eos> It shouldn't be too long.<eos> The consulate opens at 9:00.<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> It's my first kidnapping.<eos> I'm not exactly in a hurry to start.<eos> Well, just follow my lead.<eos> These things are usually much easier than they sound.
You're keeping an eye on them and me.<eos> So there's nothing going on between you two?<eos> I'm appalled by the insinuation.<eos> Nothing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean your hands.<eos> They're on your waist.
Thank you.<eos> - Late night?<eos> - No.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Why?<eos> No, you just left 13 voice mails on my phone at three o'clock this morning.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> Did you bring my house keys?<eos> Oh, I haven't unpacked all the boxes yet.<eos> They'll be in there.
Like Mountain climbing? Yes, or skydmng, drag racing, big-game hunting.<eos> I think it's a little early to narrow our search parameters to big-game hunters.<eos> I know your work well, Dr. Pierce.<eos> Please, I'm sure we'd all love to hear your thoughts.<eos> I'm just saying, if we're gonna play "guess the identity of the serial killer," we... we can't just assume things like "he's a thrill seeker."<eos> The audience element of his m.O. Indicates a personality type attracted to risk.<eos> Or it suggests someone who simply wants attention.<eos> Do you think that the victims are connected to each other?<eos> No.<eos> Yes. I believe the victims are connected only in that they represent archetypal authority figures, probably from the killer's childhood.
Do you think that the victims are connected to each other?<eos> No.<eos> Yes. I believe the victims are connected only in that they represent archetypal authority figures, probably from the killer's childhood.<eos> How did you come up with that?<eos> A ref and a judge symbolize authority.<eos> The killer flaunted what he did in two different courts.<eos> Dr. Pierce, you believe the victims are connected in some other way?<eos> Dr. Pierce?<eos> Daniel.<eos> I-I'm not sure how they're connected.
But you can't go back to your normal life.<eos> I know.<eos> But if I step down,<eos> Becca steps up, and you get shipped out.<eos> The mafia is a burden that I now have to bear.<eos> And I accept that you can't accept it.<eos> But remember, I do it for you.<eos> Aw, fuck it.<eos> I love you.<eos> And if that means that I just have to enjoy the nice things and not ask where they come from, I will do that... for you.
This is awkward.<eos> I don't have anymore money if that's what you mean.<eos> Sarah we haven't heard from you yet.<eos> I think my third foster home's a match.<eos> The Olmsteads have really gone out of their way to make me feel welcome.<eos> - I saw your shots on Instagram.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> I'm gonna say this once:<eos> Stop asking questions and stay the hell away from Sarah.<eos> Do you think our moms are telling the Riveras - they bought Lexi the pill? - What?
I remember this.<eos> My "Nite-Nite!"<eos> You dragged this thing everywhere with you.<eos> You would scream your head off if I even touched it.<eos> Moms gave us this at our adoption day.<eos> "We didn't give you the gift of life, but in our hearts we know<eos> the love we feel is deep and real, as if it had been so.<eos> For us to have each other, is like a dream come true.<eos> Though we didn't give you the gift of life, life gave us the gift of you."<eos> What if they don't want us anymore?
I'm making my peace with it.<eos> If I'm going to marry you, I'm going to marry all of you.<eos> The scar, the bullet, and the cop.<eos> [Stewart] Welcome friends.<eos> Now that the Supreme Court has finally seen fit...<eos> [Cheering]<eos> It has finally seen fit to recognize that all people are entitled to equal protection under the law and have the right to the same challenges and triumphs, benefits and burdens, as everybody else.<eos> I'm very proud to welcome you here to the marriage of my daughter, Lena Elizabeth Adams, to stefanie Marie Foster.<eos> And we're honored that you are here to witness this magical event.<eos> The moment when two souls declare that they have become one.

The science of the mind.<eos> Hey, you think he'd look at my painting?<eos> I don't see why not.<eos> This woman is extremely troubled, Daniel.<eos> What's he saying?<eos> He says it's beautiful.<eos> Zoey?<eos> Zoey?<eos> Her delusions are very dark.<eos> Perhaps they overpower her.
- I don't sleep much.<eos> Gives me more time to learn things.<eos> So, why...<eos> Why would Creak go after Zoey?<eos> What, did she, did she do something wrong?<eos> Maybe she didn't believe he was real.<eos> She believes now, though.<eos> Virgil's an idiot.<eos> He roams the halls at night, listening to the nurses gab.<eos> As if they know anything.
Bullshit.<eos> You just got intimidated by your old crush.<eos> And since you couldn't find a pen to draw on pubes quick enough, you found some other way to make yourself look good.<eos> There's nothing wrong with embellishing a little when you're talking to a pretty girl.<eos> Yeah, I used to play it like that.<eos> I used to tell chicks lies about myself just to get laid.<eos> One night, I'd be a pilot;<eos> the next, a doctor.<eos> But these women weren't having sex with a pilot or a doctor.<eos> They were having sex with a lie.

The clue--"Who's the worst," but you know what?<eos> We're fighting back.<eos> I've broken my defense initiative into 40 phases.<eos> We are currently in phase 26: "No problem too small."<eos> Anyone can come to me any time with any problem, no matter how petty or small, and I will fix it personally, and let me tell you, some of these complaints are pretty damn petty and small.<eos> Okay, Gretel, how can I help you today?<eos> There are slugs everywhere on the sidewalk in front of my house.<eos> I want them gone but not killed--I love animals.<eos> But get rid of them.<eos> They're gross.
You think this is gonna help, Wallace?<eos> Shut up!<eos> You can't hurt me.<eos> Too late.<eos> Just let me go.<eos> I won't tell anyone.<eos> Shut up, Heather.<eos> Dinnertime.<eos> The M.E.'s report came back from the first two vics.<eos> They also had skull fragments and human remains in their systems.
He either has a job working with dead bodies, or that's from his first victim who we haven't found yet.<eos> If we stick with the religious theory, it could be some sort of communion.<eos> Body of Christ.<eos> If we can identify this victim, it'll help lead us to our unsub.<eos> Let's bag it and run the DNA.<eos> We're ready to give the profile.<eos> We believe that this unknown subject is a white male in his early 30s.<eos> Initially he targeted white, blond women in their 20s but is expanding his victim pool.<eos> His M.O. is to rape his victims and then shoot them in the heart.<eos> At the disposal site, he poses them as if they're praying.
I know this sounds crazy, but I think our unsub is obsessed with the praying mantis.<eos> That also explains why he poses the victims' hands like this instead of like this.<eos> The praying mantis can kill any of a multitude of creatures, but the most interesting fact is that oftentimes the female mantis engages in sexual cannibalism, meaning she'll bite off the head of her mate once copulation is complete, sometimes even during intercourse, actually.<eos> So that's what someone did to our unsub.<eos> It also explains why he shoots his victims through the heart.<eos> But the center of our unsub's anger didn't bite off his head.<eos> No, but she hurt him so badly that she got into his brain.<eos> So he's flipping the script.<eos> He's completely taking it over.<eos> He basically sees the victims as the praying mantis out to destroy him, so before they can get to him, he rapes them, forces them to engage in cannibalism, thereby taking away their control of the situation.
I'm in the doghouse.<eos> It might be over.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Steve.<eos> I thought I'd go backpacking for a few days.<eos> It's gonna be cold, though.<eos> - You should stay here.<eos> Okay, you guys,<eos> Marina totally checked out my boobs in the shower.<eos> Those girls hate me.<eos> It's, like, weird how much they hate me.
Fresh air will do you good.<eos> We'll be there in a second, Mack.<eos> Okay.<eos> I got to tell you, hon...<eos> That sounds awful.<eos> [Sighs]<eos> Hey, where did you get a Ridgefield shirt?<eos> - I have my ways.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Well, they suck.
- at muscle man competitions. - I was supporting Rick. It's what grown-ups do in relationships.<eos> Whatever.<eos> This is a pattern. You date these total losers and become completely dependent on them, and then they dump you, and we're homeless. Rinse and repeat.<eos> That is so untrue.<eos> Seth, Teddy, Lamar, Rico.<eos> Hey, everybody, can I have your attention, please?<eos> Looks like we had a little bit of company out here on the trail.<eos> Which one of you C.I.T.S wants to tell all these fine folk about what animal left these tracks?<eos> Kip, what about you?<eos> These look like they belong to the American badger, which are common in this area.
All right. You two -- da-da.<eos> Honey, I'm home.<eos> What's for dinner?<eos> I Uh, sleep with a side of sleep.<eos> I'm heading out.<eos> I see you go the flowers.<eos> Oh, my God. Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> They're beautiful.
Th... then you'd be together.<eos> We missed you growing up, Emma, and it haunts us every day.<eos> And that's why we're here now.<eos> We don't want you to have to go through the same thing, too.<eos> And you won't.<eos> We are gonna get our family back.<eos> How can you two be so infuriatingly optimistic?<eos> It's who we are.<eos> Why? !<eos> Ever since you got your memories back, ever since you remembered that you're Snow White and Prince Charming, your lives have... they've...

Be more specific.<eos> If you've got a weapon, then grab it!<eos> What's out there?<eos> A shark?<eos> ! A whale? !<eos> A kraken?<eos> Worse.<eos> Mermaids.<eos> Mermaids? !<eos> Yes, and they're quite unpleasant.
What did you do? !<eos> Let me go.<eos> Not until you tell us.<eos> Or we make you tell us.<eos> Threatening her isn't the way to motivate her.<eos> Well, I'm all out of fish food.<eos> Doesn't matter if you get her to talk.<eos> You can't trust her.<eos> Mermaids are liars.<eos> Of course they are.

It's Bill. He's the one with the problem.<eos> His sperm count.<eos> It just... It doesn't seem right, you blaming yourself.<eos> Bill always means what he says.<eos> But that doesn't mean Bill always knows what's best for him.<eos> We can resume the capping with Bill's frozen sperm.<eos> He knows the odds are essentially a million to one.<eos> We are owed a miracle.<eos> It's your hormones.<eos> They increase the blood flow to the baby.
So this really isn't about tempering your views, it's about changing them.<eos> If, that is, you want a job... in my CIA.<eos> Your bird, I think.<eos> - Salaam.<eos> - Salaam.<eos> Welcome, sir.<eos> My name is Navid.<eos> This is Aram.<eos> Your cases came yesterday.<eos> They're upstairs.
Okay.<eos> I'd like to take your pulse.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you add the percussive hits now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hank, watch his eyes.<eos> The hits match his blinking.<eos> And the strings match the wave of his pulse.<eos> There are flutes that chirp.<eos> They could be in sync with cranial pressure changes.
Then he will be.<eos> Or they'll make every effort.<eos> Can you be sure of that?<eos> You have the word of the King and Queen of France.<eos> I had their word that we would be married.<eos> I'm not sure words mean anything here.<eos> I'm not sure who you fear... the English or the French court.<eos> The English have threatened me for years, but Colin is the only one who knows who, at French court, wants me gone.<eos> And you think the word of an accused traitor will matter?<eos> If the right people believe him... and I think they might-- then yes.
I don't know how far it goes...<eos> Or where, but...<eos> Could they have gone through here?<eos> No. No, they'd echo.<eos> We'd hear them.<eos> These passages are all stone, nothing in them, but I didn't know one connected to this room.<eos> You know about them?<eos> This castle's been built over centuries.<eos> The passageways-- they connect the older parts to the new.<eos> They're mostly sealed up now, dead-ends.
Don't move.<eos> - My mate Justin. - Hey there.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I love him.<eos> All I want is what you want.<eos> To have these people locked up, so they can't do any more harm to anyone else.
- He's in his bedroom.<eos> - Said he wasn't hungry.<eos> - This is all our fault.<eos> - We have to help him get Reese back.<eos> - Seriously? When does it end?<eos> Oh, Harris? What are you doing to me, man?<eos> I knew they were meant to be together.<eos> I give it a week.<eos> But the truth is we all need boundaries.<eos> They make us feel safer, connected, cared for.
Tom, hang up the phone.<eos> She never answered about the toothpaste!<eos> It's not cinnamon, dad.<eos> Okay, good. 'Cause cinnamon hurts my tongue.<eos> Tom, hang up!<eos> Debbie, we'll see you tonight.<eos> Nathan, did Janice read the article I sent her about fertility tips?<eos> Um... uh, yes, I think she did.<eos> Were the positions helpful?<eos> They looked dangerous.
I can't figure out their coffeemaker.<eos> What kind is it?<eos> It's a white one.<eos> Okay, you're gonna have to start reading all the buttons to me.<eos> Let me find my glasses.<eos> The only reason I'm helping you with this is so you'll learn to live on your own.<eos> I know.<eos> Did you find them yet?<eos> No.<eos> Are they on your head?
- What are you doing here?<eos> - Um... studying...?<eos> You let Violet have boys over while you're gone?<eos> No, I do not, and don't worry about her, she's not your kid.<eos> I know, but this sets a bad example for Roscoe.<eos> Oh, you're worried about setting a bad example?<eos> You had Roscoe pee into a sippy cup so you could pass a drug test.<eos> And it worked.<eos> I like bananas.<eos> They have their own carrying case.
You're back in town.<eos> Yeah, for the V3 charity event.<eos> I was supposed to RSVP to that. - I'll have dress and shoe options for you by lunch tomorrow.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I should have called.<eos> It was last minute.<eos> Did you like the flowers?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They were beautiful.
I'm last on the referral list when women call and ask for an OB/GYN.<eos> 12th.<eos> You're 12th on the list.<eos> And you know why?<eos> We can't sell you.<eos> - To whom?<eos> - To women.<eos> I brought you here because of your impeccable credentials and the hunch obstetrics might be opening up for female physicians.<eos> But I was wrong.<eos> Because when we do refer you, women make it very clear they don't want another woman looking up their skirt, except for the odd gal who thinks that's just swell, and those 16 women are your patients.
Let's hear it for the little guys, huh?<eos> Right, Bob?<eos> And so, let's move on to the girls.<eos> This is the vaginal canal during sexual stimulation.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Note the uniform lubrication-- actually a "sweating" phenomena.<eos> Nobody knows it's you.<eos> Note the wall color, the darker, purplish hue, as we arrive at the orgasmic phase, when the entire vaginal barrel undergoes contractions during orgasm, similar to an accelerated labor.<eos> Until now, no one knew these contractions existed.<eos> And yet here they are.
And yet here they are.<eos> And we can measure them.<eos> But that's not the whole story when it comes to the female orgasm.<eos> Note the muscle contractions in the hands and feet-- myotonia.<eos> The skin flush...<eos> - Who is that? - ...vasocongestion.<eos> The erect nipples perspiration, hyperventilation.<eos> Physiological reactions are uniform and consistent.<eos> Which brings us to the heart of the study and the most radical discovery of all-- when it comes to sex, women have capabilities vastly superior to men.<eos> They can achieve multiple orgasms, they're orgasmic after menopause, and the sexual satisfaction they can achieve on their own is equal to, and sometimes even greater, than the satisfaction they achieve with men.
And, Libby, you can go, too.<eos> We have guests tonight.<eos> We should be ready for them.<eos> And I need a quiet office.<eos> I have a lot of work to do.<eos> The sky this far above the earth is purplish-black, and against that is... well, many heavenly wonders.<eos> He's up there right now.<eos> 19 miles above the Earth.<eos> Beyond the haze, there are thin bands of blue etched against the night sky.<eos> They appear to be thin shells of dust that hover over the Earth like a succession of halos.
I'm reaching into my pocket for my glasses.<eos> It is you.<eos> The one and only.<eos> - We got about four hours.<eos> - I thought we had all day.<eos> Your dad's a CSO with level-one clearance.<eos> If he doesn't check in, NSA starts looking-- it's protocol.<eos> Now, does he have a comm device or not?<eos> It's the glasses.<eos> They're full duplex.
Oh, it's Patrick.<eos> That's all of 'em.<eos> I got it.<eos> Whew... It's happening, isn't it?<eos> You're in shock, okay?<eos> I want you just to lay back.<eos> Lizzie and Mica, you care about them.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> I don't have anybody else.<eos> Kids on their own, they don't have a chance.
I'm not trying to be mean here, they told me this.<eos> And eventually they're going to tell you this.<eos> Or they're not.<eos> Which would be even worse, because you two would be married to them and they don't want to be married to you.<eos> They just don't want to tell you that.<eos> And now they don't have to.<eos> He broke up with you, didn't he?<eos> What?<eos> Adrian, I've known you for years, and if you're miserable, you want everyone else in the world to be miserable and you don't care how you achieve that, just as long as other people don't have the love that you've always wanted.<eos> So, as your friend, let me tell you, this was a really despicable thing to do, to say these things to Jack and me, whether or not they're true.
Now, fellas, I know it sounds like not a great plan, but I think Chris is gonna be okay.<eos> ♪ Alas, you've passed through the fiendish gate ♪<eos> ♪ Heed my words, lest you seal your fate ♪<eos> Ugh, can I at least not die listening to this awful music?<eos> ♪ Beware the Porcupine of Doom ♪<eos> ♪ Swerve left now, lest you fill your tomb ♪<eos> Aah!

My name is Stephen Jameson.<eos> This is me.<eos> This is my breakfast.<eos> These are my friends.<eos> At least they used to be.<eos> This is where I live.<eos> This is my mom.<eos> And this is the worst part of my day.<eos> You see, lately, strange things have been happening to me, and they're only about to get stranger.
Growing up in Cleveland, my dad would take me right on Lake Erie.<eos> But, eh, water's gone bad now.<eos> You should go to Florida.<eos> Saltwater.<eos> Down off the Keys<eos> - where the marlin run.<eos> - Write your own Hemmingway story.<eos> And if you don't catch anything, you have to blow your brains out.<eos> So, Ross, where do you take your kid fishing?<eos> I just got the two girls, and they could never keep their mouths shut.
- In fact, all women have some kind of personal connection to Avon.<eos> But that doesn't turn into advertising, now, does it?<eos> Why don't you tell us your biggest challenge?<eos> We're here to listen.<eos> It's just hard to hide our enthusiasm.<eos> It's true.<eos> Well, they don't bring in a new guy unless they're expanding or sales are flat.<eos> I'm afraid it's the latter.<eos> Women are working.<eos> They're not home.
When the hell did you have a "productive breakfast"?<eos> You and Peggy ditched me.<eos> Peggy didn't know.<eos> There was some confusion and then it was too late and I thought since I mixed things up--<eos> There was no confusion.<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> - I bet you are.<eos> Were you coming in here to celebrate what a fool I am?<eos> You upset the girls.<eos> They have nothing to do with this.
Martin Luther King?<eos> Vietnam, for Christ's sake?<eos> Studies show Jesus had a bad year.<eos> Well, I'm afraid there's not one true believer in that list.<eos> What the hell did you just say?<eos> I told you before to get out and not come back.<eos> - Be on your way.<eos> - This is a house of sin.<eos> You can't keep these girls from the righteous path.<eos> - They belong to the Lord.
And I'm driving a minivan.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> More of this.<eos> Max, where are you driving?<eos> Uh, I'm driving to the market, where I'm gonna get flowers for my beau-tee-ful wife.<eos> While I make a pot roast for my black lover.<eos> So I put a butterfly thingy together to practice.<eos> Nailed it!<eos> Oh, and F.Y.I., mom, there's a jar of caterpillars in the fridge, so if you have any sleeping pill-induced night eating, be aware.<eos> If they're in the fridge, they're fair game.
You know, I actually thought he cared about me.<eos> So dumb.<eos> Pretty much ruined my year.<eos> Well, that guy's a dick.<eos> - Mm.<eos> And he's dumb.<eos> Wow, you're joining the pariah table.<eos> I don't judge.<eos> You shouldn't let those girls get to you.<eos> They're stupid and jealous.
Quietly.<eos> Speak English.<eos> He is offering $500,000 each.<eos> You were going to keep them to yourself.<eos> Huh?<eos> 50-50.<eos> Mikey, you awake?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know those dirty little stones?<eos> They're worth a little south of two mil.
Tara's been up there a bunch of times blasting them bastards to pieces.<eos> She says they just keep getting back up.<eos> I told her no more.<eos> Can't afford to waste her bullets.<eos> You got kids?<eos> No.<eos> When my girls were born, that's when I finally figured out what it was to be a man.<eos> You know, a real man.<eos> You protect them, you keep them safe.<eos> You just try to make them stronger until they can look out for themselves.
Shumpert?<eos> He was never the same after Woodbury.<eos> Oh! Yeah. He got reckless.<eos> Biter took a piece of him right over there.<eos> I swear, he didn't try to get out of the way.<eos> I put him down myself.<eos> Right over there.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There's some things you just can't come back from.<eos> They become a part of who you are.
We're gonna have this one tracked.<eos> It's your only means of communication over the next few days.<eos> Got it.<eos> So, what's my new story?<eos> I got a couple ideas.<eos> Come on.<eos> So... tomorrow night...<eos> No!<eos> Toby, my friends can't wait to meet you.<eos> Well, they're gonna have to wait a little longer, ok?
No. No, I can't.<eos> - God.<eos> - We can reschedule ASAP.<eos> We're not getting another reservation at Pronto any time soon.<eos> You know what, let's...<eos> We can do it at my house.<eos> I can show off my cooking skills.<eos> I want to meet your girlfriends.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I do. I think they're gonna like me.
So...<eos> Who's Peter?<eos> Was that the vet?<eos> No, he was my bunny, Peter the rabbit.<eos> I was having him put down.<eos> Oh.<eos> And, honest to God, I abso...<eos> Fucking hell, I loved that rabbit.<eos> He had these massive big floppy ears.<eos> They felt like... honestly, it was like furry velvet on your skin.
I can't wait for you to meet the others.<eos> You are superheroes, guys, you are.<eos> The jumper posse?<eos> Tomorrow's the one-year anniversary of the storm.<eos> We're having a party here at the Community Centre.<eos> There will be vodka and drugs and people fucking each other.<eos> You know ecstasy reverses your power?<eos> That's not how it looked, Finn.<eos> You and me, we're finished!<eos> Women don't know what they do to us.
Should I compare thee to a summer's day?<eos> Thou art more lovely and temperate.<eos> You laughing at that?<eos> I am allowed to laugh.<eos> See you tomorrow.<eos> OK.<eos> See ya.<eos> Women are the fucking mystery.<eos> I mean, even their genitalia's mysterious, what, with all the little different crevices and folds, different compartments, just...<eos> You know, sometimes I wonder whether there's stuff up there they're just not telling us about.
You don't know that!<eos> It's very difficult getting a good likeness in wool.<eos> I will not let you screw up the future for all of us.<eos> Gah, whatever.<eos> Refuted!<eos> I refute you, sir!<eos> Do you think I should go over and put a good word in for him?<eos> What are you going to say?<eos> I could tell her about his strangely weighty balls.<eos> They're like... hairy apples.
Where? !<eos> I'm saying.<eos> One minute, you're... spitting tea and biscuits in their face and they're being all coy and shy and the next minute, they're acting like they don't even know you.<eos> I'm done with this bullshit.<eos> Wahey, where's he going?<eos> Come here.<eos> You mean, like, done with all women?<eos> Everywhere?<eos> Jesus, man - women are beautiful.<eos> They've got lovely little... ..shapely eyebrows, smell of pain au chocolat...
I think you'll find she's already been handled.<eos> By me.<eos> In there.<eos> Can I just say in my defence...<eos> Just don't, just stop!<eos> Jess! Please, just...<eos> There are things I need to tell you and I just...<eos> You need to listen.<eos> The business with the defecation, perhaps that was an error of...<eos> No, it was, it was an error of judgment on my part, but my motives, they were true and bloody noble.
And then the storm happens and everything gets fucked.<eos> Not that... this is a date.<eos> Come on.<eos> Where...? Where are we going?<eos> We're having a dance.<eos> How's your night?<eos> Yeah, pretty...<eos> Pretty shit.<eos> Just found out me best mate's been having sex with... probably the only girl I've ever really loved.<eos> Women don't know what they do to us.

Carmen?<eos> - Oh, I'm the getaway driver.<eos> - All right.<eos> Hecklers rest!<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's a valiant effort, Mr. Infeld.<eos> But this nonsense, while annoying, in no way affects my ability to do my job.<eos> Are you certain, your honor?<eos> Because I-I see the veins in your neck.<eos> They're ... they're beginning to throb.
When the child is wailing in the night, every night. Who's going to be going over to the room?<eos> You know?<eos> When are you going to be getting your sleep?<eos> If you agree to do this, it's a generous act on your part to help me be happy.<eos> This is not your responsibility, it's mine.<eos> I'm making the decision, I'm a hundred percent responsible.<eos> Anything after that is gravy.<eos> As I was spraying the Steri-Fab in all these crevices, literally, they started just popping out.<eos> Amy is my best friend, and at the moment she's battling bed-bugs.<eos> At night is when they come out and that's when they're gonna bite you.
Look, Ethan and I may have decided to end our marriage, but he was my best friend.<eos> Nothing was gonna change that.<eos> We shared too much.<eos> Like his clothes, for instance?<eos> I do this to honor the women who fought so bravely yet invisibly during the civil war.<eos> Oh, and here I thought you were just hiding.<eos> As many women had to do back then.<eos> Many had no other option but to take up arms.<eos> Women have never been properly recognized for their contributions, then or now.<eos> But they were patriots just the same, just like my brother Tommy.
I wrote plenty of music without Ethan that they were interested in.<eos> Not according to the contract.<eos> It makes me wonder, what was so special about the music you two made together?<eos> Or at least what Ethan brought to this party.<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> I-I-it was just this thing that came out of him when he got back from Iraq.<eos> He was going to school on the G.I. Bill.<eos> I guess he just needed to purge all this twisted war shit out of his system so he could feel something again.<eos> His lyrics are so real, you know?<eos> They touch people.
Remember?<eos> You'd pretend to muzzle me, and you'd be like,<eos> "No more accent.<eos> Enough with the accent."<eos> It was hilarious.<eos> Know that I could expedite a liquor license for any stadium we build.<eos> I'm sorry to hear about your marriage ending a little while back.<eos> Must be tough to meet women in such a small town.<eos> - Um... - I don't see any.<eos> Where are they?
Did you call your dad?<eos> No, I don't know if I should.<eos> I mean, what if Caleb's right?<eos> I don't want to push my dad to help and then him just go the other way.<eos> Yeah, well, why aren't you waking up caleb?<eos> You don't think I've tried?<eos> He's camping with his dad.<eos> The closest thing he has to a phone is an empty can of beans.<eos> What exactly brought all of this on?<eos> Her muddy shoes, they're gone.

Yeah, sure. I could do that.<eos> Great.<eos> Phew.<eos> She found the gun in your bag, Ashley. In your closet.<eos> Hanna, how could you say that?<eos> Because it's true.<eos> Let her talk.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I was looking for your shoes and then...<eos> They were ruined.
Thank you.<eos> This college is tiny.<eos> Is it worth even filling out an application?<eos> Why not?<eos> Well, if there's hardly any slots... well, let's not write our own rejection letter quite yet.<eos> You probably have a better shot than most people.<eos> Mr. Fitz, I don't swim anymore.<eos> No, I'm talking about your work outside of the pool.<eos> These little colleges are looking to build communities.<eos> And they'd probably be pretty excited about the work you did last summer in Haiti.
So I can take you through some starters.<eos> We don't have that.<eos> Bye.<eos> You don't have what?<eos> Sorry?<eos> We don't have this.<eos> OK, so, this is what we've got.<eos> Unfortunately we've run out of that and that.<eos> You see, the scallops?<eos> Are they fresh?
Actually, you came twice.<eos> You know, actually, I think I am going to go.<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Because, Stephen, we're on a date.<eos> I don't know what this is but it's not a date.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> How?<eos> Because... even though you may feel all messed up or whatever about debasing me... you still kind of wanna fuck me.<eos> All I have to do is... just sit up straight and go all wide-eyed, let you tell me about the menu and giggle at your jokes because they're funny.
When the boss's son is getting married, you go.<eos> - Don't they have their own friends?<eos> Ouch! - Silver shoes!<eos> - Have you asked Matilda?<eos> - Matilda!<eos> - Have you seen...<eos> - Hans Engman.<eos> Yeah, hi.<eos> - Why would I take your old lady shoes?<eos> - They are not here!
- Dad, sit down.<eos> - Night, Odi.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Odi!<eos> Have you seen my keys?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Two flat and two round.<eos> - Have you seen my keys today?<eos> - No.<eos> - Damn, they must be somewhere.
Watch this.<eos> Is it me or is it hot in here?<eos> Well, my phone says it's 68 degrees.<eos> I guess it's just you.<eos> That did not just happen.<eos> Okay, okay, the guy's a little coy.<eos> Just give him a minute...<eos> Let him warm up.<eos> Remind me why we take these cases again.<eos> Because they pay better than skip traces, and there's less running.
Just... what do you feel?<eos> What do you wanna say?<eos> Wade, sometimes I wonder what it would be like... if we'd never met.<eos> Marion, sorry.<eos> Your car's blocking me in.<eos> Any chance I could move it?<eos> Uh, yeah, fine.<eos> Did you know I bought a sex toy?<eos> Keys. Forgot the keys.<eos> - Yes, they're...
Bye, cheers.<eos> - I'll hold down the fort. Buh-bye.<eos> - ( scoffs )<eos> Oh, you look so cute.<eos> Come on in.<eos> - You look skinny. - Jane:<eos> You guys look adorable.<eos> Oh, this schmuck again.<eos> Sir, I told you, you can't come in without a reservation.<eos> Uh, no, I don't have a reservation, but I'm actually with these ladies and they do have a reservation.
There's not much to say.<eos> Still the same.<eos> Work, plenty of work.<eos> And my pupils.<eos> But I'm not complaining.<eos> I get long holidays.<eos> - And the other?<eos> - Fine.<eos> Your hands.<eos> They've changed.
Mrs de Beauvoir isn't back.<eos> She isn't here!<eos> Yes?<eos> - Is Mrs de Beauvoir home?<eos> - No.<eos> - May I come in?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> You're insane!<eos> Don't forget, these women hate themselves.<eos> They hate their condition and, above all, they hate themselves.

They hate their condition and, above all, they hate themselves.<eos> They are incapable of loving.<eos> All that remains is the erotic ritual.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Their hatred of Madame is their hatred of themselves?<eos> Obviously.<eos> Please get back into your positions.<eos> Firstly, it is a rite. It must be as tragic as possible.<eos> This is Racine.<eos> The women don't achieve their ends, they destroy themselves.
Well, we'll celebrate when you get home.<eos> I'm not leaving until tomorrow.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, we'll just have to make good use of that time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How many times did Will text you today?<eos> Just twice.<eos> See?<eos> That's progress.<eos> Don't fan the flames, and they will die out eventually.
Now, once you apply for a license, they send someone from the city manager's office.<eos> They do an inspection, make sure everything's legit.<eos> I could probably help with that.<eos> How deep is that inspection?<eos> Do they look at my books?<eos> Yeah, everything.<eos> And they can drop by any time.<eos> Nero will show you how to protect the in-house income.<eos> Girls got to be willing to do things by the book, though.<eos> They know.
Yeah.<eos> I woke up this morning and guess what's on my mat?<eos> I've been chosen, innit?<eos> Hey, what for?<eos> It's a new promotion, I get a free crate of beer and all I got to do is fill in the form and tell them whether it was shit or not.<eos> Based on what I say, they launch it to the whole country.<eos> So happy days, innit.<eos> So is it 24 bottles or 24 cans?<eos> Cos the cans are much heavier, innit?<eos> That's if they're the 440mls, yeah, not that that's a problem, cos I got my boy to help out, though maybe we can just drink a few to ease the load, you get me?
We won't be party to extortion.<eos> You've got no choice.<eos> Without him, your client's getting life.<eos> Stick Yuri on the stand, you'll not only free an innocent man but get the real killer convicted.<eos> He saw who did it.<eos> And not only that.<eos> He's got photos.<eos> You've seen them?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But he says they're ours for a price, along with his testimony.
It's interesting for a pigeon.<eos> I meant is anyone coming yet?<eos> They'll be here soon.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Hello, Yuri.<eos> You.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> Your call's been cancelled.<eos> Now, you said you had some photos of me.<eos> Where are they?

This is bullshit, Cameron.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> A deal where your client admitted to bribing a foreign official.<eos> That Colonel that she paid off?<eos> After that, six people were killed by his troops.<eos> I give my driver a tip, and then he runs over someone.<eos> Doesn't mean I had anything to do with it.<eos> But if the person he hit was me, sure would look like that.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> All six people did whatever they could to stop your client from getting her pipeline.
What is it with you and Africa?<eos> I want to be the go-to person on something around here.<eos> There's nothing I can do for you.<eos> If there's anyone who wants this to be a story, it's me.<eos> - Something's going on.<eos> - Yeah, something's going on.<eos> Coming back in five, four...<eos> Copy. 0036 to 41.<eos> Presidential candidate Michele Bachmann thinks our troops are the best.<eos> They are the best.
Get your mind in the gutter.<eos> O-okay.<eos> All right. Easy, boy.<eos> Attack!<eos> It was worth it!<eos> But why?<eos> Bowsley!<eos> Of course!<eos> Those pills you ate didn't kill you.<eos> They made you into the smartest dog that ever lived!
Mama!<eos> I'm sorry, madam.<eos> Master Fitzwilliam just...slipped away, and you so busy with the ball...<eos> It's no trouble at all.<eos> Main dining room, quickly.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Bidwell, you'll have time for the silver?<eos> It will be polished to perfection, madam, down to the last fork.<eos> And the fires in the bedrooms, Mrs Reynolds?<eos> They're being prepared as we speak.
Not really.<eos> Oh, dear God!<eos> How can a man think with such a racket going on?<eos> Could you please ask them to stop?<eos> That wouldn't be helpful, Fitzwilliam, dearest...<eos> It is a fine Pemberley tradition for the master of the house to be irritable on the eve of the ball.<eos> And for the lady to do everything in her power to assuage him.<eos> Quite.<eos> Perhaps some traditions need updating.<eos> They've worked perfectly well so far.
Welcome back to Pemberley, madam. I would've come sooner, but I've had social engagements to attend to.<eos> Longbourn's quite a whirlwind in its own right, you know.<eos> I was told to give YOU this, but it's the last favour I'm doing for you, Wickham.<eos> I want no part in this.<eos> Denny, please.<eos> This one last thing and I promise I'll be done with it.<eos> I'm not playing this game.<eos> It's been deceit from start to finish with you.<eos> You're selfish, utterly selfish!<eos> You know nothing, do you, of women or how they truly feel!
I'll never forget the day they hanged him.<eos> Wickham and I were under 'strict orders not to leave the house 'but we found a way out and found a way there.'<eos> Get lost. Darcy, I know another way.<eos> His mother, naturally, was inconsolable.<eos> A few weeks later she went into Pemberley woods and killed herself.<eos> Darcy, I'm so sorry.<eos> And now there's this foolish superstition that her ghost appears in the woods every time misfortune's about to strike.<eos> Mrs Reilly's ghost!<eos> Yes. No...<eos> Two servant girls, Betsy and Joan, ran into the kitchen yesterday saying they'd seen her in the woods.
What did you put together, buzz?<eos> Uh, two chapters of make-up algebra.<eos> Two chapters?<eos> Buzz, we brought you burgers.<eos> Hey, you want to spend an extra year in high school, that's fine with me.<eos> But I've already got a complete handle on algebra.<eos> Okay, explain quadratic equations.<eos> Uh, sure.<eos> Quadratic equations are something else that nobody needs in daily life.<eos> They also help form the foundation for something we call logic, which I hear is very useful in chess.
We'll get a slap on the wrist, but his career will be over.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm telling him that.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> I don't know who's scaring me more right now, you or him.<eos> I'm not gonna let him win.<eos> Win?<eos> My God, I don't care about winning. I just want to stay out of jail.<eos> We have an opportunity here to make some real change with this guy, to keep directing him towards votes that will actually help people.<eos> If we let him scare us off, things will go right back to the way they were.
It's nothing official yet.<eos> I mean, I've asked her, and she said she'll check her schedule...<eos> I'm not exactly sure what that means.<eos> Maybe it means she's gonna check her schedule.<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> You two are getting pretty close.<eos> I hope I just don't screw it up.<eos> Bob, you've been married a long time.<eos> What's the secret?<eos> Ah, relationships take work, they need to be nurtured.
- Detective.<eos> You look somewhat overdressed.<eos> Not a social outing, I take it?<eos> Mr. Garland, I understand that you are a judge in the Miss Purity competition?<eos> That?<eos> Oh, yes,<eos> - I suppose so.<eos> - And especially friendly with one of the competitors, a Miss Katherine Buchanan?<eos> Detective, all these girls are friendly with me.<eos> They all want to win, and I'm an impressionable sort.
But Miss Nicholson ruined Mason Alexander's competition.<eos> I believe he sought revenge.<eos> What was his motive for killing the first girl?<eos> That I don't know.<eos> How do you explain the bite marks?<eos> - That I don't know.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Let's flip the chalkboard back, then, shall we?<eos> Sir, the number of links between these 2 young women makes it difficult to altogether ignore George's line of investigation.<eos> They were both at the beach, they were both bitten by a monster in the lake.

Checkmate, Tang See, wake up.<eos> Open your eyes, listen.<eos> I cannot go slower.<eos> Frank, I am thinking on the physical level, the metaphysical level, the pataphysical level.<eos> Every time you open your mouth, you drag me down into the mud, and-and really, my-my...<eos> What?<eos> You got a pain?<eos> Charlie, I'm telling you.<eos> Those pills are no good for you.<eos> They're hurting you, those pills.
One of the oldest tricks in espionage is the false surrender of a prisoner.<eos> It's a desperate move used only when you're completely outmanned and outgunned.<eos> It means approaching your enemy alone and unarmed.<eos> It's not ideal.<eos> But it will get you close enough to attack.<eos> [Speaks Spanish]<eos> [Rock music]<eos> ♪<eos> Gotta say, Mike.<eos> Don't always enjoy these little tropical vacations, but they're never dull. [Grunts]
Let me show you the science lab.<eos> Okay.<eos> How goes your sting operation?<eos> About an hour ago, two kids were making out.<eos> It got so steamy, I swear to God, I had to turn away.<eos> Are you keeping me company?<eos> My case, too.<eos> So, how do you like being a lawyer again?<eos> I'm sure you don't miss those judges' robes.<eos> You always said that they were itchy.
We rarely imbibe, but this is the rarest of days.<eos> To you, here, safe.<eos> To this fine home.<eos> And to Lincoln, for what he has done and what he will do.<eos> When the president first took office, I realized real pride, national belonging, could rise in my chest.<eos> I felt connected to this country, as to a grand being.<eos> Unfortunately, that grand being was more comfortable with you as a slave, and you still aren't allowed to elect your fair hero.<eos> Well, Lincoln is a champion of education, land for the poor, and, I believe, in the end, true emancipation.<eos> We will have the right to vote.<eos> Well, I don't trust a white man's good intentions, until they're gone so far, he can't undo 'em.
And then you put her to rest.<eos> For you, the real escape is living.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> ♪ I like my bitches tight ♪<eos> ♪ even better without sight ♪<eos> ♪ screw 'em blind, they don't mind ♪<eos> ♪ 'cause Jacko's king of the night ♪<eos> I got to take a piss.<eos> Hey, take one of these whores with you, Jenkins.<eos> They'll aim it for ya.

(Sabina) I have no idea where they are, if they're coming with help or not. It's...<eos> I don't know.<eos> (Sam) That first cup of coffee tasted like shit.<eos> (Chuckles) Still, it was the best damn cup of coffee I ever had in my life.<eos> (Joyce) It's a bit surreal.<eos> We're in this place in the middle of nowhere.<eos> Hopefully, we can... (Inhales, exhales) get to Irene and the others before it's too late.<eos> I know they did have some food that we left from the producers' camp.<eos> The girls disappeared.<eos> And, I mean, they're probably...

I mean, why wouldn't you? And then we had that deer and that blood all over the place.<eos> I mean, I just think that right now we should lay low and just keep a fire burning and... and be smart about it.<eos> It was the first time in my life that I've eaten like a pig.<eos> I had grease everywhere.<eos> I enjoyed that deer like it was the last meal in someone's life.<eos> We couldn't completely enjoy it because we were literally (Bleep) ourselves about the fact that there's a tiger out there.<eos> We're in quite a bit of danger.<eos> And then I'm just thinking, oh, are we attracting them more by the smell of meat?<eos> It's a possibility that they... they were... that the girls are trying to scare us, but by the look in their eye, it was like...<eos> I could tell that it was of... they believed what they saw, you know, and... they maybe put the tiger out when the girls coming, and then as soon as they ran off, the tiger goes back into its cage, you know?
Previously on Siberia... (Jonathon) There is a safe zone with a button that will summon a helicopter.<eos> Once you cross the line at the safe zone, you are out and have forfeited the competition.<eos> (Neeko) I went to check on the bullets, pulled out the case, and-- and they was all gone.
It's cutting-edge.<eos> Perfect for me.<eos> Have you gotten a second opinion?<eos> Well, this is the second opinion.<eos> A third opinion, then.<eos> Have you done any research on this treatment process?<eos> Is it safe?<eos> Doc, what is with the whole "Anderson Cooper 360" vibe?<eos> I thought you'd be happy for me.<eos> It's just we both know that when things sound like they're too good to be true, they probably are.
She's dead.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What happened?<eos> We don't know.<eos> I...<eos> I had no idea.<eos> I'm... that's terrible.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Girls...<eos> I hope they both realize that I was just trying to do the right thing.
I won't touch anything else.<eos> Oh, I touched that.<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> Hands up.<eos> Sir, do you know if Mr. Dagby had any enemies?<eos> Uh, you mean other than us?<eos> 'Cause, uh, we all hated him.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't say anyone wanted him dead, but all these new rules and half-draining the pool. Where Vera and I did our water aerobics.<eos> Anything else odd?<eos> Well, after Norm died and Ed moved into his apartment, we would have these "power failures," and they only happened...
The call was made 15 minutes after Briana Mathis' death using VOIP software routed through multiple proxy servers, but listen.<eos> I'd like to report the body of a woman 210 yards below Mulholland Drive,<eos> 35 yards west of Coldwater Canyon.<eos> Not a very emotional report.<eos> Now, listen again after I drop out the voice and bring up the background.<eos> Footfalls, coughing, paper shuffling...<eos> Your basic office environment.<eos> And that tells you what?<eos> How many offices are there in L.A.?<eos> Look, why don't we turn our limited resources back to where they belong...
Why do I sleep in the kitchen?<eos> I like to mix it up.<eos> Should we be worried about Nolan?<eos> I mean, I had no idea he was living in such abject poverty with only a bird to talk to.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> When I was his age, I was sloshing through the jungle dodging enemy fire with nothing but a necklace of ears to talk to.<eos> Which is why this baby is my best friend.<eos> Ed, would you please put that thing back in your... belt bag.<eos> It's called a holster, Patrick.<eos> And if you knew anything about guns, you would know that they don't go off randomly.
That crime scene was a mess because of that party, the alibis are a blur, 'cause everyone was drunk.<eos> You see where I'm going with this?<eos> The necklace...<eos> Fall Fest... Is the most important day of the year for Green Grove.<eos> You know that. Anything goes wrong, I'm holding you personally responsible.<eos> Are we clear, Kyle?<eos> Crystal clear...<eos> John.<eos> Come on, buy warm pi pies.<eos> They pun and they taste great.
Screw you.<eos> Lacey, I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> ( Sighs ) Lacey, wait wait wait.<eos> Hey. Hi.<eos> So Danny and I are meeting up at the diner soon.<eos> Do you wanna join?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> My feet are pretty uncomfortable in these shoes.<eos> I think they're giving me, like, a bunion or something.
Yeah, it was...<eos> Okay.<eos> What happened?<eos> [Sighs] Well, he had all these boxes lying around.<eos> I-I... accidentally opened one...<eos> - You were snooping?<eos> - No, I wasn't.<eos> But I couldn't help but notice it was full of all these unopened letters.<eos> Unopened?<eos> They were addressed to some guy named "Kirkland."
This is Christine Helm.<eos> We're attorneys for the Jensen Prop Gun Company.<eos> We're here about the recall.<eos> What recall?<eos> Well, uh...<eos> There've been reports... uh, isolated reports... That some of the guns manufactured by our company may...<eos> Discharge improperly. We rent these guns.<eos> What do you mean, "discharge improperly"?<eos> Boom!<eos> They explode. They blow up in the actors' hands.
I don't know if it's the brand you use, but get used to it, because I'm not going down again.<eos> Manuel, are you okay?<eos> Now where am I going to go?<eos> How do I go on.<eos> You'll stay here for a few days and I'll take care of that later, Okay?<eos> Everything's going to be fine.<eos> Everything has a solution.<eos> Everything.<eos> I'll get some towels from here...<eos> Is this where they are?
How do you know that?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> I made a judgment call.<eos> You had a prime opportunity to embed yourself right beside your target, and you turned it down because you despise him.<eos> You made an emotional decision.<eos> Wrong.<eos> Henry wanted me to see it as a chance to spy on him, but I saw it for what it really was-- a ploy to keep me close.<eos> Still, an interesting decision.<eos> Don't worry about my decisions.<eos> They've served me well so far.
What can I do for you?<eos> I'm going through my operative's report from the Dion Stavros mission, and I wanted to take a look at the crime scene photos, but your lazy ass hasn't uploaded them to the server yet.<eos> Let's look at them together.<eos> What exactly are we looking for?<eos> Well, nothing specific.<eos> I was just curious about their injuries.<eos> Wounds look big.<eos> You know the caliber yet?<eos> Well, the victims were shot with a .45.<eos> What were they packing?
- What?<eos> I got a facial recognition hit on the Chens at Union Station.<eos> - I'm going.<eos> - Well, what do I tell Auggie?<eos> Tell the boss I'm doing my job.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Uh, that couple that just bought tickets, they--they dropped these glasses.<eos> Can you tell me what train they were headed to?<eos> I'm sorry, I can't, uh--<eos> Um, they--they look really expensive.
We're done here, Hal.<eos> You'll have to draw on me if you want to stop me.<eos> To hell with you.<eos> Don't lose him.<eos> Almost home free.<eos> Get the pictures out, make the exchange, and then it's frisco, here we come.<eos> I'll be watching you.<eos> Anything goes wrong, it's your life.<eos> Where are the pictures?<eos> They were here, I swear.
It's the Palace of Versailles.<eos> It's a casino...<eos> A place to separate rubes from their paychecks in the middle of nowhere.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> It's in the middle of paradise...<eos> Where gambling is legal.<eos> It's a license to mint money.<eos> You, of all people, should see the potential, meyer.<eos> You've always been a man of vision.<eos> You were the man who saw the way things were and how they could be.
NYPD.<eos> (Elevator bell dings) Thanks.<eos> Webster confirms Castigan was killed by a single shot to the head a few hours before we arrived on scene.<eos> Okay, so either some buyer figured out he bought a fake, kills Castigan to settle the score, or the guys who make these cars want their little scam kept quiet.<eos> Would explain taking out Ezequiel, if he'd tripped to what was up.<eos> You guys okay?<eos> I heard about Castigan.<eos> Oh, the place was trashed, but whoever did Castigan was long gone.<eos> And, uh, how were the cars?<eos> I think they're gonna pull through.
But it confirms what we're thinking... he knew his killer.<eos> What else?<eos> Aha, check this out.<eos> On Castigan, I tried to get an idea of what kind of inventory he moved, so I ran a search on Heritage Classics...<eos> Google street view, satellites, maps, anything.<eos> These are over six months.<eos> But take a look: It's always the same cars.<eos> He shifts 'em around, but I don't think he's selling anything.<eos> So Heritage is what, just a front?<eos> You order the cars, they gotta come from an importer, right?
We gotta find who's bringing in these cars.<eos> Problem is, whoever killed Castigan cleaned out his files.<eos> Yeah, the DMV keeps records of where cars are purchased.<eos> You don't even have to wait in line to get 'em.<eos> Voila, all the buyers whose cars came by way of the late Mr. Castigan.<eos> Our diplomat Emminger's name's on here twice.<eos> Jay: Three times, actually.<eos> The Ferrari and Aston Martin DB7 Vantage and a Lamborghini Gallardo.<eos> Are you serious? Give me a few hours in that garage.<eos> They're fake, Jay.
- We're almost there.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You got it.<eos> - Ready?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Open your eyes.<eos> You don't mess around on first dates.<eos> Uh, j... just dinner.<eos> Really?<eos> I also rented some doves to circle us, but they got loose in my car, and...

3 to 5?<eos> Years?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But I didn't kill her... and I can't take a plea.<eos> How about this?<eos> You are a ghoul, a freak who can predict the time and circumstance of anyone's death with frightening accuracy, which doesn't make you a killer.<eos> It makes you the best damn actuary in the world, and those deaths... those are the proof.<eos> Those skills don't make you homicidal.<eos> They're what make you so good at your job.
I said one arm.<eos> No.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Karp and bees.<eos> - Killer bees?<eos> - No.<eos> Damn.<eos> Ah, damn.<eos> I'm told Summer's honeybees are harmless.<eos> They don't attack you if you don't attack them.
No.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Karp and bees.<eos> - Killer bees?<eos> - No.<eos> Damn.<eos> Ah, damn.<eos> I'm told Summer's honeybees are harmless.<eos> They don't attack you if you don't attack them.<eos> They're harmless unless provoked.
I'm sorry. What... what are you saying?<eos> What I'm saying is, for you to get to the next level, you have to take risks.<eos> You have to take chances.<eos> No.<eos> Not taking risks has gotten me where I am.<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> I mean, Rachel... she really wants this, and you know how I hate to lose.<eos> So I just have one question for you... do you have any allergies?<eos> Most of you know bees as social insects.<eos> I mean, they gather to do their work.

- Yes.<eos> And you worked on Noelle's life settlement, too, right?<eos> And you and Noelle e-mailed.<eos> Well, I e-mail most of Wendell's clients.<eos> I'm interested in one specific exchange where you introduced Noelle to feast delivery service.<eos> So you knew the delivery-service times, and you also knew about Noelle's allergy.<eos> Given your actuarial skills,<eos> I'm wondering if you can help me analyze some research I've gathered.<eos> Uh, between women and men, women take their time to plan a murder, while men are more... impulsive.<eos> Now, men tend to kill people that they don't know, while women tend to kill people that they have some personal connection to.
Injured man, coming through.<eos> Oh, my God, sweetie. Are you all right?<eos> I'm okay, beauty.<eos> I just...<eos> I rolled my ankle. Rolled it? What does that mean?<eos> It means he had to forfeit the game, so I won.<eos> ( Chuckles ) Give me my ball.<eos> Why you gotta be so competitive, Charlie?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> He's a kid, he'll be fine. Just stay off it a while and give him some Flintstone chewables. They've got calcium.
- Grab the phone, would ya?<eos> Some yahoo's been calling every ten minutes or so,<eos> - asking about some Karen.<eos> - What? Yeah. Said there's a big reward for information.<eos> Hardly had time to do my prep.<eos> You gonna answer it, Red?<eos> I actually have to go to the washroom.<eos> Uh, your kicks are gone all ghetto.<eos> Oh, you want to borrow my kitten heel fly boots.<eos> They are trés gorge and they might make this, um, homeless-persons- nighty-thing you're rockin' look like an actual fashion choice.
Sorry.<eos> Sorry, my bad.<eos> No, it's not bad.<eos> It's, um...<eos> We're both tired.<eos> Things get blurred when you're tired.<eos> Totally.<eos> So, starting over?<eos> ♪ 'Cause ladies are obsessed<eos> ♪ They're blowing up my phone They won't leave me alone
Turns out the concierge got fired from his last job in L.A.<eos> For tipping off the paparazzi to when celebrities were arriving.<eos> And after I explained to him accessory to murder's a little more serious than pissing off Kim Kardashian, he admitted to setting up guys at the back door, which, as it turns out, is how the beautiful people check in.<eos> You're thinking, if a photographer was out there last night, maybe he caught our guy coming in the back way.<eos> Someone was there.<eos> Our concierge tipped his pal that Megan Fox was arriving yesterday evening.<eos> Guy sat out there shooting for 4½ hours.<eos> You get all the photos?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> They're actually owned by his magazine.
Except for then he lost his nerve and became a liability, so you shot him with your "stolen" gun, and you were about to run off to Costa Rica because of their extradition treaties...<eos> Or lack of...<eos> With the U.S.<eos> Okay, well, you missed one tiny detail...<eos> My gun was stolen. [ Cellphone chimes ]<eos> Call the Star Island police.<eos> Our security system caught the whole thing on tape.<eos> Oh, believe me, I will, just as soon as I get my roses from the delivery guy.<eos> Can you put these in the evidence cooler?<eos> Are they for Callie?
And, yes, I rigged the 18th green so he would lose to Glen.<eos> I was hoping that he would get discouraged and find some other course to ply his ugly trade.<eos> Yeah, you just didn't know how ugly until you caught him poisoning birds.<eos> Then it became life and death, as in shooting Austin to save the life of Palm Glade Municipal from Glen's development plans...<eos> Plans he pitched at every Parks and Rec Community Meeting for a decade.<eos> And every time, who made the opposing argument?<eos> Oh, look, it's you.<eos> [ Groans ] Yeah, okay, I already told you that I would do anything I could to protect the course...<eos> Anything but commit murder.<eos> Last week, I found three storks, and Fish and Game said that they had been poisoned, so I knew Austin had to be behind it.
- Slump-buster.<eos> - All right?<eos> Slump-buster, my ass.<eos> What's a slump-buster?<eos> It's just a chick you bang to end a dry spell, man.<eos> Maybe that's what I need. As if.<eos> Well, you should come to Long Beach, man.<eos> - Yeah? - The girls aren't all stuck up and shit like in LA.<eos> - Really?<eos> - They'll have sex for days.
You were that way when you took Jai away from me, and you're still that way.<eos> But now there's nothing more you can take away from me.<eos> I hope you realize that before you die trying.<eos> I'm done talking with you, Henry.<eos> Your actions have already spoken, loudly.<eos> Good-bye, Arthur.<eos> Nothing.<eos> - What do we got? - Frankfurt is wired.<eos> CCTV cameras on almost every block, and all of them work, but but Henry's smart.<eos> He knows where they're placed.
Water.<eos> Clean and clear.<eos> Cures cholera.<eos> I'll find us some.<eos> What are you expecting us to do?<eos> Well, get to work, if you're well... infirmary if you're not.<eos> Spread the word.<eos> Shit.<eos> Y'all check your hands before you head to the cut.<eos> All right? They're yellow like this, you go to the infirmary.
Do you think his mother is still alive?<eos> I hope so.<eos> Every hour she's gone diminishes the chance of us finding her alive.<eos> What do you tell a small child when someone dies?<eos> I've never considered that.<eos> What you would tell a small child.<eos> Well, you say the same thing that you'd say to an adult.<eos> What do they say?<eos> You tell them that the person that died has gone to a better place.<eos> Why would anyone say that when there's no way to really know where living things go when they stop living?
- Hi, sweetheart.<eos> You are nice-looking!<eos> - Thank you!<eos> Can I get a Colt 45, please?<eos> He's got his jim dog out.<eos> That thing's about like that!<eos> Hey, big boy!<eos> Is this one of them stripteaser shows?<eos> Yeah, it's males.<eos> That's perfect, because I like to catch these women when they're soggy.
So, how many pageants have you been in?<eos> I've probably been in a thousand pageants.<eos> And how many of them did you win?<eos> I won every single one!<eos> - What?<eos> - Every single one!<eos> - I'm supposed to talk.<eos> - It's competitive, it's a sport. - And my friends...<eos> - And so moms get...<eos> You know, they get into this competition and if you're going to do it and do it right...
Marcel is my family.<eos> And yet Marcel is someone who delights in harming the witches, those people, I would think, you would consider family.<eos> This doesn't trouble you?<eos> No. They deserve it.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> Because they're liars, all of them.<eos> They made me and my friends do this harvest ritual.<eos> They said our participation would bring our family strength, health... that we'd forever be celebrated as saviors of the community,<eos> but all they really wanted was more power.<eos> So I left before they could get it, and now they're running out of time because after the harvest comes the reaping, and if they don't complete the harvest, there won't be a reaping.
Because that is what you'll be dealing with if you go through with the harvest.<eos> Everything OK in here, Uncle Kieran?<eos> We were just finishing, Sean, right?<eos> I believe I've made myself clear.<eos> We'll take this matter to the elders.<eos> Continue to study, Sean.<eos> Your uncle is an excellent role model.<eos> The witches were furious with Kieran.<eos> Sophie tells me that the witches put a hex on his nephew Sean, made it seem like he was slowly losing his mind, in order to distract Kieran while they kept planning for the harvest.<eos> So they attacked Kieran's nephew.
I might have read about that.<eos> The boy killed a twin, or he was a twin or something.<eos> Oh, no, no. They said that he had a twin sister.<eos> So enlighten me.<eos> What did you mean when you said you had to die?<eos> That's what the harvest was.<eos> They said they'd put us four girls in a state of, like, peaceful limbo as part of the offering, and then later at the reaping, we'd awaken and be reborn.<eos> I never got as far as the limbo part, which means the harvest isn't complete.<eos> That's why the witches are so freaked out.<eos> The reaping is just around the corner, and if they don't finish it before then, it's over.

Why else would I be here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe to make sure I didn't get too drunk and spill secrets better left unspilled about you and me.<eos> I know better.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Because you don't want to end up on the wrong side of me.<eos> Oh, Rebekah Mikaelson, you do not want to be on the wrong side of me.<eos> Tomas, I presume.<eos> Marcel asked me to find out what you know about the dead witches.<eos> I heard they were going after some pregnant werewolf.
I have been attacked by French quarter vampires.<eos> I've had to live in a house with a secret dungeon full of coffins, and I was nearly murdered by witches who are convinced that my baby is Lucifer.<eos> Milk.<eos> They've been...<eos> Fine...<eos> Weirdly protective.<eos> I know I have you to thank for that.<eos> I'm just happy to see that you're in one piece.<eos> So back to the murderous witches, I have some concerns.<eos> They're evil, and my life is still magically linked to Sophie Deveraux, which is not comforting.
I swore you would not die by my brother's hand.<eos> I said nothing of my own.<eos> No one hurts my family and lives.<eos> No one.<eos> I've been away from this home almost 100 years, and you haven't changed a thing in my bedroom.<eos> I guess I was holding out hope that you'd come back to it, although I imagine it's not quite as comfortable as those beds at the palace royale.<eos> It's plenty comfortable.<eos> I'm famished.<eos> Nah. Apples aren't my thing.<eos> They were your favorite once upon a time.

I can't do that anymore, Michael.<eos> You do whatever it is you have to do.<eos> And I will do whatever I have to do.<eos> Some people say that democracy is a Western idea, that it is incompatible with the Middle Eastern way of life.<eos> Personal security uses a method called "arm's reach."<eos> In an attack, if you're closest to the client, you shield them.<eos> If you're closest to the attacker, you focus on the threat.<eos> One man tries to defend against danger, and the other one tries to find it.<eos> Of course, if personal security has to get involved, something's already gone very wrong.<eos> A good security setup stops threats before they ever get close.
It was supposed to be our way out if police come.<eos> - Is it guarded?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, it can't be any worse than the front.<eos> Might be worth a shot.<eos> There are many techniques for dealing with guards without raising alarm.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm gonna go take a leak.<eos> They all boil down to two basic steps-- a stunning move to stop your target from crying out and a subduing move to keep him quiet.
- Stay with him!<eos> - Michael, are you gonna--<eos> - Don't lose him!<eos> Pull up alongside him.<eos> Get closer.<eos> Closer, Fi.<eos> - Michael, are you sure?<eos> - Stay with him!<eos> Michael?<eos> Small explosive charges won't penetrate an armored car, but that doesn't mean they're useless.
I killed Katie.<eos> You what?<eos> There's no way our little suicide witch wasn't gonna try and take out Marcel with her.<eos> I saved his life, and in doing so,<eos> I now have him exactly where I want him.<eos> Sophie trusted you.<eos> I trusted you against all my better instincts.<eos> Wake up, Rebekah.<eos> The witches are on no one's side but their own.<eos> This girl Davina, that's all they want, and when they have her, what do you think happens then, a truce?

I've been busy standing by Genoa.<eos> What about you?<eos> I have no problem standing by it.<eos> You were well trained.<eos> Guys, another demonstration's broken out.<eos> - In Cairo?<eos> - In Libya.<eos> Outside our consulate in Benghazi.<eos> Your kitchen faucet has washers.<eos> They keep water from leaking through the joints in the fixtures.
- And you're going to confirm it happened.<eos> - It happened.<eos> What was Operation Genoa?<eos> An extraction.<eos> Two Marines were taken by the enemy and I won't say more than that.<eos> Who carried out the extraction?<eos> MARSOC-- Marines Special Operations Command.<eos> Were any exceptional measures used in the operation?<eos> Exceptional measures were called for.<eos> Were they used?
- I'm not sure about the hand.<eos> - I know.<eos> - They're so delicate.<eos> - Yes, and soft.<eos> And pasty, skeleton.<eos> I have been ill, and still am.<eos> I've lost a lot of weight.<eos> Yes, but the illness doesn't make your hands small.<eos> Like a child's.<eos> Yes, that's it, they're so difficult to capture.

Do I have to wear bike shorts?<eos> Okay, good.<eos> I've been a little concerned ever since I found out Divya was moving in with you, knowing how you feel, 'cause sharing space with anybody can be tricky, even if it's someone you know really well.<eos> Even with me and Paige, I mean, sure, we've definitely had some...<eos> I wouldn't say problems, but hiccups, adjustments to living together.<eos> Nothing major, just...<eos> Women can be very touchy about stuff.<eos> She bought a plant and a blanket kind of thing.<eos> That's exactly what I'm talking about.<eos> They see something, they want it, they have to have it, even if it's utterly ridiculous, even if it's nonsensical and ugly as sin.
- Good night, daddy.<eos> - Lights out before 10:00, I mean it.<eos> Mm.<eos> All right, I love you, kiddo.<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> - Don't stay up too late.<eos> I won't, I won't.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Girls just, uh, they just went up to bed.
Why do you care so much?<eos> It's my heartbreak, not yours.<eos> 'Cause we're friends.<eos> Friends.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Aren't we?<eos> Hey, man, that song... way better than those jingles you were writing the other day.<eos> You know how many songs I've written since I've been here?<eos> Two, and they both sucked.<eos> - No, they didn't.

What happened to him?<eos> Your father... ..walks among the dead.<eos> My mother?<eos> I was told that she died shortly after I was born?<eos> Is this true?<eos> Who was she?<eos> There are some things that even I... cannot see.<eos> Then, if my father's dead, why am I here?<eos> Why was I brought here?<eos> You were drawn here... ..by forces so powerful that they stretch between the worlds.
You know, maybe I should stick around and skip the tournament.<eos> It's lawn bowling, you know.<eos> Don't be so neurotic.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hmm.<eos> - Honey...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Don't forget your bowling shoes.<eos> Nah, they don't fit anymore.

There was a DVD and some instructions on what to do if I wanted to get back at him.<eos> What did he do to you?<eos> He ruined my life.<eos> How?<eos> I was a paralegal at a law firm.<eos> It's where I met my fiance.<eos> One day, some of the assistants were looking people up on this website, Lifetrace.<eos> They found some pictures.<eos> What kind of pictures?<eos> They were taken by an ex-boyfriend, of us, in his bedroom.
How about we get to know each other a little better first?<eos> Lunch at the Metropolitan Club.<eos> I find it takes years of business meetings to learn the kinds of things that a few martinis can bring about in one meal.<eos> We can talk about cyber-security, or whatever else might really be on your mind.<eos> I'll have my office set it up.<eos> You know, I thought I could handle this.<eos> But seeing the two of them together, it takes everything I have not to scream right now.<eos> Let's walk it off.<eos> They say when you're pregnant, the hormones change the way you feel, but I think it's simpler than that.<eos> I think they help you understand what's important and what isn't.
I check mine every day.<eos> An opiate called codeine was found in Mr. Fenton's system.<eos> - Do you know of it?<eos> - All kinds of drugs on the circuit, but never heard of codeine.<eos> Why would he make himself lethargic before a race?<eos> How did you know it would make him lethargic<eos> - if you never heard of it?<eos> - He said it was an opiate.<eos> I don't use drugs,<eos> - but I know what they do.
Had to send her off on a merry chase before she could melt me.<eos> Told her you boys kept the keys in the kitchen.<eos> You do have a kitchen in this crap hole, don't you?<eos> Damn it, I just cleaned in here.<eos> Really?<eos> Looks like we got a witch here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We raided your gun range.<eos> Made us some poppy bullets.<eos> They won't kill the witch, but they will stun the crap out of her.

I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I believe Applejack has made the better argument.<eos> These vampire fruit bats sound downright dreadful.<eos> So let's get to rounding' 'em up so that they don't destroy the rest of my orchard.<eos> Fruit bat round up! Fruit bat round up!<eos> Um, excuse me, but what if instead of rounding them up, we let them have part of the orchard.<eos> Have you lost your pest-lovin' mind?<eos> They're only here because they're hungry.<eos> If we built a sanctuary for them, they could have their own apples to enjoy.<eos> After a while, they could even help the rest of your orchard.<eos> The Vampire bats don't eat the seeds of the apples and when they spit them out, they grow into even more productive apple trees.
I'm sorry, I just don't like the idea of taking away the thing that really makes the vampire fruit bats vampire fruit bats.<eos> It just feels wrong.<eos> But if we don't do this, there won't be any apples left for anypony here in Ponyville.<eos> Doesn't that feel wrong, too?<eos> So what's it going to be, Fluttershy?<eos> Will you do your stare on the bats or not?<eos> Um, um OK, I'll do it.<eos> Good choice.<eos> I knew you wouldn't side with those icky bats.<eos> They're not icky.

I didn't get a last name.<eos> - What about the truck?<eos> - Just a regular old truck, no markings that I can recall.<eos> But he must have been in on it with her. How could I have been so stupid?<eos> Well, even smart women get conned sometimes. Hey.<eos> What's our status?<eos> We've got some units out looking for Bridget Connoly.<eos> - Still nothing.<eos> - OK, what about her vehicle?<eos> We got her plates from a security camera. They were stolen from a car parked at the airport long-term parking. No reports of a stolen Mercedes.
When I was asleep, I...<eos> I could've sworn I heard him calling for me.<eos> Really?<eos> It must've been a dream.<eos> Well, how can you be sure?<eos> Because... 'Cause my dad's dead.<eos> I'm sorry, Henry.<eos> It makes sense for us to dream about the things we've lost and the things we hoped for, like your father being alive and your mother coming to find you.<eos> But eventually, you'll find new things to dream about.<eos> And when you do, they'll start to come true.
And she won't hate me because it's her idea.<eos> Yes, the corner stone of great parenting, being like by kids making bad decisions.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really should write a book, how to be right and pretty at the same time.<eos> You're staring at my pizza.<eos> Do you want a bite?<eos> You know I can't.<eos> I've been a Vegan my whole life.<eos> My moms are so Vegan, when I was born, they didn't even eat the placenta.
There go my chances of being sexually harassed.<eos> I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad.<eos> That's so much better than the old, ugly ones.<eos> Dr. Koothrappali. Mrs. Davis, nice to see you.<eos> You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.<eos> Okay. So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they're adorable.<eos> It was better when you couldn't talk to women.<eos> I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.<eos> Oh, brain lesions are fascinating.<eos> Unless they're yours, then they're a drag.
So, uh, about what time did you discover the body?<eos> About 9:00 a.m. -- my usual pickup time.<eos> I come in every Wednesday and Sundays, uh, to collect the entrails.<eos> The animal organs.<eos> Ah. After Max would, uh, dig them out and work his magic.<eos> He, uh -- he was a real artist, you know?<eos> Strange thing is, though, uh, bins were empty this morning.<eos> Why is that strange?<eos> Well, because it's a Sunday.<eos> Weekend hunts are pretty much a given in this neck of the woods, so they're usually, mm, chock-full of guts.
Uh, would you mind switching rooms?<eos> Say no more.<eos> The best man is on it.<eos> Hey, buddy, listen, the wedding doves got here early, and I don't know where to put 'em...<eos> Say no more.<eos> The best man is on it!<eos> Poor guys.<eos> All cooped up.<eos> I guess there's no harm in letting you out for a bit, huh?<eos> They carpet-bombed my entire room.
For another six days and then I'm off to Rome for a year.<eos> What are you gonna do without our Saturday morning brunch with a side of sassy gossip?<eos> A one-shot power play? !<eos> Why not drop your hockey pants and actually take a dump on the ice next time?<eos> !<eos> I love it!<eos> See?<eos> It is just too horrible to even think about.<eos> Yeah. You... need another female friend.<eos> Whenever I try to talk to women, they look like they want to punch me.
Is that it?<eos> That is it.<eos> Would you, uh, would you mind giving us a minute, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> So the, uh, the girls are with me this week?<eos> Till Sunday.<eos> Never thought it would end like this.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> But we love our daughters.<eos> And, Rayna, they are our daughters, so...
Previously on Witches of East End...<eos> Ishouldn'tbe here.<eos> Killian?<eos> I figured my big brother's getting married...<eos> I should come congratulate him.<eos> The girls don't know what they are.
Is it possible that you've gotten more stubborn over the last hundred years?<eos> Just because I'm not dealing with this in the way that you want me to...<eos> You're not dealing with this at all, Jo.<eos> And you lied to the girls last night, telling them that you banished the shape-shifter.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> You don't know who it is.<eos> I lied so they don't have to worry, so that they can get back to their carefree, normal lives.<eos> Things are not going back to the way they were!<eos> That's over.<eos> The girls know who they are.

Vidar...<eos> - You turned them in?<eos> - Well, it had to be done.<eos> - What?<eos> - To keep our secret safe.<eos> It was the only way.<eos> No...<eos> But you... you took my girls...<eos> No!<eos> They were all I had in this world!
Look, why don't we take a break?<eos> Maybe we should grab some lunch?<eos> Archibald.<eos> I got another letter from Freya!<eos> She's settled in San Francisco and says she's met the love of her life.<eos> - What else is new?<eos> - Oh, I miss her so.<eos> Edith, tell me what the problem is.<eos> My hands are so sore I can barely lift 'em.<eos> And I'm afraid they'll never work again.
Because you can't deal with what you did to him.<eos> Or maybe you...<eos> just don't care.<eos> It broke my heart, Wendy.<eos> There's not a day that goes by that I don't regret leaving him there.<eos> What do you think the girls are gonna say when I tell them that you left their brother behind?<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - Oh, that's right.<eos> It doesn't really matter, does it?<eos> Because they're gonna die soon anyway.
You can't believe what it's telling you.<eos> No, it's opened my eyes.<eos> I now see that you're the evil one, Joanna.<eos> No wonder your husband left you.<eos> The only man that you ever really truly loved.<eos> And you destroyed him as well!<eos> Leave him out of this, Wendy.<eos> The girls don't know about that one, either, do they?<eos> What have you told them about their father?<eos> Don't they have a right to know that he's alive and so close by?
Don't they have a right to know that he's alive and so close by?<eos> He left a long time ago.<eos> He knows where we are.<eos> He chooses to stay away.<eos> I wonder why he chooses to stay away.<eos> Is it because he can't stand the sight of you?<eos> Because that one, I can understand.<eos> Or is it that he can't forgive you for leaving Frederick behind.<eos> Or is it losing the girls...<eos> Over and over and over again, because it's your fault that they're cursed?
What?<eos> Well, Breena's a mortician;<eos> I'm a medical examiner-- we both work with dead people-- and, uh, the lawyer seemed to think that that might be kind of a turn-off for a young woman putting her baby up for adoption.<eos> But, uh, you know, I think it'll be fine.<eos> I'm feeling really optimistic.<eos> You should be, because as soon as they get to know you two, they're gonna love you.<eos> Thank you for saying that.<eos> Hey, McGee. Well, I got my creds back.<eos> Great!<eos> Where were they?
- If you want I can give you some of my stuff.<eos> - No, I'm good.<eos> - Tangerines?<eos> - I got some, I even have husks.<eos> - Give me one, brother.<eos> - I don't have any.<eos> I want to study, I'll start studying.<eos> I'll do the officials exam. Give me your book, that way I can study.<eos> I got 2 "Hong he" packets, but I only need one.<eos> "Yunyan" and "Yinxiang" cigarettes, and how did they end up here?
- I've had my share of birds.<eos> - More than those you actually had, right?<eos> How much money do you have?<eos> Shi Guangdiao: hospitalized for 2 years. 500.000 or 600.000 yuan.<eos> - So much?<eos> - Yes Zeng Weichen: hospitalized for 15 years.<eos> With those you can buy 5 wives.<eos> No!<eos> As if 100.000 yuan were enough to buy one!<eos> - They're not that cheap!
- It's a delicacy.<eos> It's rotted Korean skate fish.<eos> Fantastic with, um, kimchi and rice wine.<eos> I thought you'd like some.<eos> All right, if you are gonna live here, you can no longer cook here.<eos> Jealous of my refined palate?<eos> I am surprised that one even exists.<eos> Good night, Cinderella. You were saying.<eos> Oh, it's a combination of GHB, ketamine, and flunitrazepam.<eos> The girls give it to their Johns, and then they do whatever they want while under the influence.
What? You took my pills?<eos> I took your Wednesday.<eos> That's gonna mess with my immune system.<eos> What about my digestive system, Ted? !<eos> It's gonna wreak havoc.<eos> - Oh! I gotta Yobogoya!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Yeah! Whoo!<eos> Where's the nearest bathroom?<eos> I think they're pretty far.
Yeah! Speech!<eos> Hi, everybody.<eos> Hi.<eos> We're so proud of you, Andre, and our lovely new daughter.<eos> You're gorgeous.<eos> It was just such a short time ago that he was a little boy.<eos> That's really what it feels like.<eos> And he never really knew very much about-about women.<eos> Remember, you guys, you guys, you told him that women didn't have anything down there.<eos> Oh, that's right. That they were like Barbie dolls.
Please.<eos> For me?<eos> What have I done?<eos> It's not you.<eos> It's the shoes.<eos> All the darkest parts of myself... all of them.<eos> - Here.<eos> Now.<eos> - We're going to get you out of this.<eos> - They won't come off.

That's not our understanding.<eos> We took the pictures to an expert.<eos> She said they were nowhere near figuring it out.<eos> Can you tell us her name?<eos> Uh, Tanya Barrett.<eos> She wrote a bunch of articles on P versus NP a few years ago.<eos> You talk to her, she'll confirm everything I just told you.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you everything I knew yesterday.<eos> I just didn't think my work with Linus had anything to do with Felix Soto's death.<eos> Did you know when you reviewed the pictures of their work that they had been obtained illegally?
Where the hell is Henry?<eos> (Pan) A map will lead you straight to your son.<eos> (Hook) Careful. He may look like a boy, but he's a bloody demon.<eos> The heart of the truest believer.<eos> You are the lucky owner of that very special heart.<eos> - Robin Hood.<eos> - What are you doing trespassing in my castle?<eos> (Whoosh) Oh, no. Emma's in Neverland.<eos> (Hook) Watch out for their arrows. - Aah!<eos> - They're laced with poison.
What I always do.<eos> Wanna fly?<eos> You got it?<eos> And then some.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> Helping you find your happiness, saving you... That's what's gonna save me.<eos> This isn't your pixie dust, is it?<eos> Well, when you think about it, does anyone really own pixie dust?<eos> The fairies are quite proprietary about it.<eos> They find out you stole it, they would...
- Told you it was bad. - Hmm.<eos> I thought you'd be running for the sink by now.<eos> - I drank my breakfast.<eos> - Hey, me too.<eos> So this looks like it could be an animal attack.<eos> I'm thinking, like, a bear maybe or...<eos> I think that we would've noticed a bear roaming through the station.<eos> Is he always this interrupt-y?<eos> Yes. Well, then zip it so I can point out that animal bites are usually a bitch to clean.<eos> They leave behind a lot of bacteria, saliva.
Madam Lyon, did the Deputy Commissioner ever visit Lavinia at your club?<eos> He may be a hypocrite, Miss Fisher, but I'm sure he's not stupid.<eos> This is the man who calls my establishment morally corrupt.<eos> Who declares war on our clubs.<eos> But I'm quite prepared to believe he indulges his dark desires in secret.<eos> He wouldn't be the first.<eos> Do you think he had a private arrangement with Lavinia?<eos> My girls understand the exclusive nature of the club is their protection.<eos> So you don't know?<eos> They know better than to talk.
Like... like from "Zoolander."<eos> "Blue Steel"... his classic move.<eos> More or less.<eos> Less.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> If Ashley was posing, that means she knew someone was taking her photo.<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But teen stars live their lives online.<eos> They tweet and blog about everything they do.
Neither one is gonna be the first to apologize.<eos> That is why it is up to us to broker a rapprochement, as they say in certain parts of Canada.<eos> - I don't see how.<eos> - But I do.<eos> Owen, what excites these smart, lovely ladies?<eos> New shoes?<eos> Cleanses?<eos> Gluten-free muffins? That's a big one.<eos> And... romantic comedies.<eos> They watch the same ones over and over.
And, cut! - Pretty powerful.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> Check the fucking gate.<eos> - That's you, son. You did it. - That's me, Daddy.<eos> - Whoa. - I did it.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> You're great too, yeah.<eos> If a man doesn't have a dream well, guess what, his soul begins to die.<eos> So after you've accomplished your dreams, the best thing to do is to come up with new dreams.<eos> That way, as the years roll on, as they will do, you'll always look to the future with hope.
Won't be a moment.<eos> Whoa! Whoa, whoa, you can't just do that!<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> During the war, we built a series of subterranean tunnels beneath the city... to allow us to transport munitions and supplies in secret.<eos> This entrance... should connect us directly to the annex.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Mind the rats.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> End of that tunnel bares the bones of convicted witches.<eos> Why are they buried down here?
Come on.<eos> I need help looking through this stuff.<eos> No.<eos> I'm staying in the hallway.<eos> - This is a breach of trust.<eos> - Should I cut her mattress open?<eos> No!<eos> She's a good kid, and that's a good mattress.<eos> I've seen enough local news to know what teenagers do these days.<eos> I saw this thing where these girls have these parties where they wear different-colored turtlenecks based on the kind of sex they want to do.
Well, I've seen her destroy a guy, so...<eos> You've heard of the cavalry?<eos> Wh-- everyone at the academy talks about st--<eos> She's the cavalry?<eos> I told you never to call me that.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Oh, we're sure to get out of here now.<eos> Um, how do we get out of here?<eos> Can't go through the doors.<eos> They're bolted, tied to the pressurization lines.
Holy cow!<eos> Kid's got a cannon. Probably gets that from his mother.<eos> Is it just me, or does this playground look like a sex act?<eos> You know, I was thinking the same thing.<eos> I'm, like, "This kid looks like he's about to be ejaculated right out of that thing.<eos> He's about to be a money shot." I mean, who puts a pink curtain on a slide?<eos> I know.<eos> Jungle gym is about to plow that piece over there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This kid just keeps rubbing these balls like they're gonna do something, you know?
I was up all night.<eos> I couldn't sleep.<eos> I told you I didn't need anything on Tanner yet.<eos> I'm not here to talk about Tanner or the lawsuit or the merger, I just...<eos> I want to know how you do it.<eos> How I do what?<eos> Not let people in.<eos> I need to know.<eos> You don't know what I do and don't do.<eos> What I know is that you seem to have relationships again and again and they don't eat you up or spit you out or seem to affect you at all.
Now I'm...<eos> I'm not calling you a bad parent. I-I'm just saying, we need to make sure this never happens again.<eos> My girls are immature?<eos> Your son got on the phone when I was in the middle of a business call,<eos> - and made fart noises.<eos> He...<eos> - Shh!<eos> Tom, he's right in the next room.<eos> You're gonna hurt his feelings. And also, he's 11.<eos> Your girls are 15 and 17, and they should know better.
I wanna make my own hours.<eos> I don't want one word if I ever have to drop everything to be with the kids, and I wanna be home for dinner at least three nights a week, no questions asked.<eos> Oh, and, uh, I also want season tickets to the Rangers.<eos> Box seats.<eos> Done.<eos> Good.<eos> I hope you're not ruining those girls.<eos> What, by focusing on them?<eos> Exactly.<eos> They'll be totally screwed up with crazy expectations about men.
Oh!<eos> What exactly is going on here?<eos> Um... I can explain.<eos> That was a rhetorical question, Carrie.<eos> You do remember what "rhetorical" means from my class, don't you?<eos> Listen, just... this wasn't her fault.<eos> I'm... you can explain it all to the principal.<eos> Oh! I am so sorry, Mr. London.<eos> How are those college applications going, Maggie?<eos> Um, they're not going.
You can't do that.<eos> You owe me three rents!<eos> I was waiting for the roofer!<eos> It's raining in my room! Fix it and I'll pay.<eos> Pay and you'll get the key!<eos> -You thief. -Yes.<eos> And my stuff?<eos> Bastard!<eos> Can you lend me some clothes? Yes.<eos> Somatic cells are diploid cells. They have 23 pairs of chromosomes.
I mean, it's just something you say, right?<eos> I never thought it would happen, but then, poof.<eos> Trouble-free Haven.<eos> So wwait, you just wished the troubles away?<eos> Yeah. My family always said there's a dark side to every wish.<eos> They were right because she's alive again, but she doesn't even know that I exist.<eos> Now she thinks I'm some kind of creep.<eos> I just wanted to see her again.<eos> Why don't you just try wishing for something different?<eos> That could make things worse than they already are.
OK, she handled the weapon.<eos> Doesn't mean she killed him.<eos> I think he's right.<eos> Her behaviour doesn't indicate guilt.<eos> She's acting like she's in denial.<eos> We don't have the whole story.<eos> Leave it to the lawyers.<eos> We just pick 'em up and hand 'em over.<eos> Your hunches aren't always right.<eos> They're not always wrong either.
It's Mrs Dangerfield.<eos> And?<eos> She used to be the club nurse.<eos> Used to?<eos> Yeah, before Myra Gibbs died.<eos> Two years ago, Stan Baines telephoned me.<eos> I delivered his first kid here, and perhaps he thought I was discreet.<eos> I had to be, at times.<eos> Women would come to me for... all kinds of help.<eos> If they were in trouble?
Of course!<eos> Blindfolded, in the dark.<eos> (Door slams)<eos> Put that down.<eos> Huh.<eos> Hey, Annie Oakley.<eos> I think you'll find she uses a rifle.<eos> I'll tell ya, this is one crazy country.<eos> Back home, society dames are holding tea parties.<eos> Over here, they're packing pistols.
Immediately, Collins.<eos> Shall I send Mr Fletcher to O'Shaughnessy too, sir?<eos> You telephoned him yesterday, asked him to come in.<eos> He and your wife... your ex-wife. Ex-wife.<eos> Y-yes, Collins.<eos> (How many times do I have to say that? )<eos> So, why were you locked in there?<eos> This time?<eos> I put Epsom salts instead of sugar in the sisters' tapioca pudding.<eos> They were up all night with the shits...
How'd they get there?<eos> Bernadette had them with her when she returned to the convent, and she used the glass to scratch this into the wall.<eos> 112 De Vere.<eos> An address?<eos> Possibly.<eos> Of the man she referred to.<eos> Why scratch it into a wall?<eos> Why not tell the nuns?<eos> Well, according to Mary, she tried.<eos> But... perhaps they didn't listen.
You wouldn't let me take my vows, so I was serving the church however I could.<eos> By sending those girls away?<eos> £10 a piece De Vere paid me.<eos> And every penny of it went into the good works fund, Mother.<eos> I swear it. £10 a piece.<eos> And Fletcher made sure all the chosen girls were white, fair-haired and virtuous.<eos> What's known in the trade as White Gold.<eos> You used innocent girls to further your own cause.<eos> Innocent?<eos> They were born out of wedlock, most of them, the offspring of whores.
[ Glass thuds ] I'll be right back.<eos> What's going on?<eos> He just called from the police station.<eos> [ String quartet playing classical music ] Vic: I'll take one.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> I'm participating in a sacred Polish death ritual.<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> [ Exhales deeply ] Connie.<eos> Did you see these amazing flowers?<eos> They came this morning.
It's been there 100 years.<eos> I'm not going to lunch, Thatcher.<eos> I can't do it anymore.<eos> What, eat lunch?<eos> I can't help you.<eos> Not this time.<eos> I need this one, Monica.<eos> I wouldn't ask if it wasn't vital.<eos> I know.<eos> But things aren't like they used to be.
Who was that in there?<eos> Okay, maybe I was out of line, but weren't you a little bit glad I said what I said?<eos> But what came over you?<eos> I thought I was doing my job.<eos> Janet's writing a total puff piece.<eos> And we run those sometimes.<eos> Why?<eos> Does Boyd's company buy a lot of ads or something?<eos> Look, Sara, we can't use these pictures, okay?<eos> But they are fantastic, so I'm gonna call my friend at the New York Times and see if they want to order up reporting.
I-I get it.<eos> My pops wants me to take over the diner, but that's not happening.<eos> So, what do you really want to do?<eos> I want to be a photographer and see the world, go to strange lands, eat crazy food.<eos> I want to be a rock star, but... I also really like cars.<eos> Being a mechanic seems rough.<eos> What?<eos> No, no. Not at all.<eos> Cars are freaking cool as hell.<eos> Fixing them is like a puzzle, and the best part is when you're done, they leave, and you're not responsible for them anymore.
Yesterday was a setback, but I am not giving up.<eos> I appreciate everything you've done.<eos> Mm. Thank you.<eos> But the courts won't find justice where the Lord cannot.<eos> Maybe so, but if Zack hadn't messed up, we would be sitting pretty.<eos> I never trusted Zack.<eos> When we shook hands, I sensed falseness.<eos> Really?<eos> - Look at my hands. - Hmm.<eos> - They're rough. - Yeah.
Do you have a sister who's maybe... I don't know, a little more put together than you are?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She grew up near power lines.<eos> Where were you?<eos> I bought some shorts.<eos> They looked great on the mannequin.<eos> Well, they look ridiculous on the dummy.<eos> What the hell's going on with your socks?<eos> They don't match.<eos> They're both black.
He was lead engineer at North America's number two manufacturer of non-woven fabrics.<eos> The guy practically invented the moist towelette.<eos> Our father is a smart, capable man who, if left to his own...<eos> What's going on over there, Dad?<eos> It appears I forgot to pay for the shorts.<eos> We're gonna have to see your I.D.<eos> I... I must've I left my wallet in my pants.<eos> Where are my pants?<eos> Oh! You might want to try the ladies' dressing room.<eos> They hustled me out of there in a hurry.
Give me a little, walking bass line.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can't believe it's not butter!<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> You want to catch this guy or not?<eos> ♪ Yang, you're such a pretty girl ♪<eos> ♪ and sweet girls love to sing ♪<eos> ♪ and when sweet sirens ♪<eos> ♪ lift their voices ♪<eos> ♪ they can tell me anything ♪
- Stop.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Give it to me. Give it, give it, give it, give it.<eos> Give it.<eos> That's my script.<eos> Do you have a sec?<eos> - Of course, Janet.<eos> - Audra. Damn it.<eos> You know, I want to be as sensitive as a businessman can be.<eos> These people up here, they've work too hard to see all of their efforts destroyed by one deranged individual.
- Man.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hi, Shawn. - Yang, what are you...<eos> Doesn't fresh air become me?<eos> Look, I'm at a loss here.<eos> You got to give me something.<eos> Did you check the room?<eos> Yes, I checked the room. I got the letters.<eos> All of them.<eos> One a week, every week, but Yang, they were never sent.
We interrupted a deal.<eos> AK-47.<eos> Serial's burned off.<eos> Ammo disguised as seeds.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I know those shoes.<eos> Those are Mozzie's shoes.<eos> How much did switching shoes with that guy cost you?<eos> Oh, a Benjamin Franklin and exposure to athlete's foot.<eos> At least they're comfortable.
Jeff's gonna have my nuts in a vise all because you're too... shortsighted to see the truth of things.<eos> Truth of things?<eos> The truth is, you should have asked before you promised<eos> - something you couldn't deliver. - No, no!<eos> You're jealous!<eos> - What?<eos> - You're jealous of what I got.<eos> That's why you're holding on to this damn song, and that's the damn truth.<eos> I gotta tell ya, I'm a little surprised you're doing this.<eos> Well, you made my options perfectly clear, and since they all suck, I may as well pick the one that makes the most business sense.
I mean, he's racist as hell, but he did not have the assistant D.A. killed.<eos> He was way too surprised when we broke the news.<eos> He was way too angry at us to even be happy about it.<eos> This is the only case the assistant D.A. was trying he has not other know enemies, which means he wasn't the specific target.<eos> Ok, well, who else uses a .308 rifle?<eos> In Texas?<eos> Hunters, the minutemen, housewives.<eos> Which unfortunately doesn't narrow down the field.<eos> Well, the 6 bullets that didn't hit people have all been found.<eos> They were in the cafe sign, planters, and a couple of trees.
That can't be the easiest of jobs.<eos> Let's see if her boss can shed some light.<eos> Alice seemed anxious this morning.<eos> I asked her about it and she said her mother was having a medical procedure done.<eos> So being stressed was out of the ordinary for her?<eos> Well, I won't lie.<eos> Working here does take an emotional toll.<eos> Escaping an abusive situation can be incredibly difficult.<eos> I imagine your job's frustrating.<eos> The victims are a mess, physically, emotionally, and they often go back to their abuser.
What about you?<eos> Someone has to distract the sniper.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> But we could--<eos> I'm a pragmatist, remember?<eos> Living on borrowed time.<eos> Now go.<eos> We have to hope Maya follows the rules.<eos> The shelter says the women are supposed to remain in hiding for at least two months.<eos> They're supposed to stay behind closed windows, closed doors, volunteers bring supplies and food to them.
This has taken time.<eos> More time than with an ampoule.<eos> She's been gassed.<eos> Yes.<eos> I was almost worried.<eos> Am I disturbing you?<eos> No.<eos> I've got pictures.<eos> What should we take?<eos> They are good all along.

- What he didn't want us to find.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Here you go.<eos> In here.<eos> Flink came with a change of clothes for you.<eos> I'm sorry that I didn't tell you about the cameras.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It was good that they were there, otherwise we couldn't have proven anything.
Get Kent and Mansell to track down Lee Bysack.<eos> I think you might have singed your eyebrows.<eos> Dark forces, gentlemen.<eos> Thermite charge, battery, and arming switch.<eos> This is proper international espionage.<eos> You were lucky it didn't blow your hands off.<eos> So the tramp was a spy?<eos> These were used by the Darzhavna Sigurnost, the CSS, or Bulgarian Secret Police.<eos> Or he found it dumped in a skip.<eos> Think about the scars, the history of violence they suggest.
I get that, but how did you know that someone was gonna come after me?<eos> We had inside information that someone wanted you dead.<eos> Or maybe it was the other way around.<eos> Wait.<eos> W... you th... you think I'd hurt someone?<eos> We've seen your stalker stash, Ian.<eos> It's not stalking.<eos> It's research.<eos> Women like that I can anticipate their needs.<eos> They're used to guys doing the bare minimum.
It's not stalking.<eos> It's research.<eos> Women like that I can anticipate their needs.<eos> They're used to guys doing the bare minimum.<eos> I go above and beyond.<eos> Try it sometime.<eos> You're hunting them.<eos> I want their info, they're giving it to me straight up.<eos> And, yeah, I get a little overly efficient in my due diligence, but...<eos> They like it.

But where?<eos> I overheard Hale mention some kind of sonic stonework on Bamber's estate.<eos> - Come on, let's go.<eos> - There's dozens of Baraqians.<eos> We have to warn them all in person.<eos> Go get 'em, Wolfy.<eos> Bo! Hale is gone!<eos> Missing.<eos> Oh... what?<eos> These bird women, they could hurt Fae with their voices.
It's Nisa. We're letting it ring.<eos> Oh, hey, Mom.<eos> How was shopping?<eos> Oh, so much fun.<eos> Grace got three dresses.<eos> You know she wears a uniform.<eos> She doesn't need dresses.<eos> Well, she does for dances.<eos> Am I going to approve of these?<eos> They're perfectly appropriate evening attire for a young lady.
I think he should reconsider Barry's candidacy.<eos> He'll look into it.<eos> I was promised unfettered access.<eos> All due respect, you're not the governor-elect.<eos> Yes, thank you for your respect, and this is unfettered access to the governor's chief of staff.<eos> - We should be on the same side, Eli.<eos> - We are on the same side. You can't keep disagreeing with me and pretend it's an agreement.<eos> - I agree.<eos> - Heh. Okay.<eos> Ethical issues are never obvious, and they never go away.
- Yeah.<eos> - Poor guy.<eos> Ah! Seriously that's the worst breath I've ever smelled.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can smell it.<eos> It's much smaller in the postcards.<eos> What are you...<eos> Argh!<eos> French girls sound really sexy when they speak with an English accent.<eos> They can pull off, short hair and they're always halfway through a book.
They can pull off, short hair and they're always halfway through a book.<eos> Awesome!<eos> This is already way better than our last backpacking trip.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This is our first backpacking trip.<eos> No, no.<eos> Remember that time in second grade where you ran away from home 'cause you broke your retainer?<eos> - Ah. What's the deal with Dutch girls?<eos> - Oh, Dutch girls are so hot!<eos> But they don't like it when you ask them to have a threesome
Kind of quiet, actually.<eos> Well, there were no clients on the books the night before she was killed, so...<eos> Did she have any regulars?<eos> These girls are free to take outside work.<eos> Look, I'm trying to give you a chance, here, man.<eos> You come clean with me now...<eos> that goes a long way if we find something in your truck.<eos> Sheriff, I was a junkie thug pimp for a lot of years.<eos> Okay? I served my time.<eos> What I do now... it's about giving these girls a better, safer place to do the thing that they're gonna do anyhow.
I'm sorry.<eos> No more, brother.<eos> Get me the hell out of here.<eos> - Yeah, hold on.<eos> - I got it.<eos> The charters have been alerted.<eos> Tacoma are on their way down to help.<eos> All right.<eos> How are the girls doing?<eos> They're shaken up.
The story is...<eos> Oh, hey, Sue, what did you want to talk to me about?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> Uh, it was just about the air conditioner and how it's broken and can never be fixed.<eos> But we waited too long to fix it, so I guess that's our fault.<eos> Well, regular air-conditioning maintenance is important.<eos> It really is.<eos> What are you doing sitting alone in the dark?<eos> Oh, light bulbs are hot.<eos> They heat up the room.
You did all that?<eos> To every one of those women?<eos> I don't care if you don't understand me.<eos> No one understands me.<eos> Not even mom.<eos> But I understand.<eos> So wait. While--while we're sitting here talking, are you thinking about--<eos> Killing you won't make me feel any better.<eos> It's those women.<eos> The way they look at me.
I can't comment on that because of attorney-client privilege.<eos> Except the fact that she is your client, which means she an Jesse know each other and probably have for a while.<eos> I... It's complicated.<eos> It's actually very simple.<eos> We can now prove that Jesse is a killer.<eos> Which makes you an accessory.<eos> Hold on there.<eos> I'm their lawyer.<eos> And you can threaten me all you want, but they're entitled to representation, and you know that.<eos> And I also know you, and all those cameras that you love so much, they're all downstairs waiting for your perp walk.
Be happy your career's not over.<eos> This is not Hetty's fault.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> In this game, Agent Blye, somebody always takes the blame.<eos> There has got to be something that we can do.<eos> This is an Oval Office nightmare now.<eos> What do the Russians want with L.A.'s nuclear detection system?<eos> The Cold War's heating up.<eos> Friend or foe, nations collect intel on each other.<eos> Never know when they'll need or use it.
- We'd like to hire you, Ms. Tascioni.<eos> Actually, we're considering<eos> - hiring you.<eos> - We're being sued by a female paralegal<eos> - for being a hostile workplace.<eos> - And... how long has this paralegal worked for you?<eos> - Two years.<eos> Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I keep asking questions until they make sense.
Bysack must be connected.<eos> That's what I was thinking. Wow.<eos> Wow.<eos> Wow.<eos> Spare us the drama, what is it?<eos> The positioning would suggest apotropaic marks.<eos> Protection against witchcraft.<eos> Protection?<eos> You find them carved into doorways and around windows and fireplaces in 16th century houses.<eos> They were used to ward off evil along with witch bottles and the practice of putting a dead cat in the walls.
All these women were smuggled into the US and given fake identities?<eos> By whom?<eos> It's not our priority right now.<eos> Who has been leaking these new identities to those hit men?<eos> You think it's someone here in Afghanistan?<eos> It's why I'm calling you.<eos> You are the liaison to the only. UN women's rights group in the country.<eos> If these are honor killings, the girls' families probably got together to hire your hit man, which means any of a thousand people could be the source.<eos> The targets are all on this same list.<eos> They've got to have something in common.

They're lucky to have this.<eos> They get zero support from the community.<eos> That's putting it mildly, Tom.<eos> The locals think women's shelters are fronts for brothels, which is why they're all run by foreign NGOs.<eos> You must be Agent Gibbs.<eos> Catherine Tavier.<eos> I manage this shelter.<eos> Well, let's talk inside before someone thinks you're customers and shoot at you.<eos> The girls don't know about Nadira.<eos> They don't speak English.
Were you aware that after Nadira left here, she was smuggled into the US and living under a false identity?<eos> On the record, no.<eos> Off the record, I may have heard a thing or two.<eos> Though, sadly, that conduit to the US has closed.<eos> Nadira was found because someone leaked her real identity.<eos> We're bringing those women into protective custody, but to really protect them, we're gonna need to find out who's leaking their cover names.<eos> I'm the only one who knew them all, aside from the girls here.<eos> We were the only ones who could be trusted.<eos> Gonna need to talk to them.<eos> There is simple no way they would have shared that information.
This is long-distance.<eos> What do you got, DiNozzo?<eos> I have a headache, boss.<eos> Susan and I got all the women from the hit list.<eos> She's looking into safe houses, and, uh,<eos> I got a call into immigration.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, because all these women are here illegally, boss.<eos> We're not sending them home, DiNozzo.<eos> They're not safe here, Tony.
That's almost now.<eos> Planning what?<eos> It sounds like another bonfire.<eos> They're usually a little too close for comfort.<eos> Well, we need to call the police.<eos> Not a good idea.<eos> They usually bring the gasoline.<eos> My office has already dispatched an urgent request to any UN forces in the area, but we've been ordered back to base.<eos> Maybe your girls can find someplace else to go as a precaution.<eos> Well, you know as well as I do, they don't have any place else to go.
I call it a damn joke.<eos> Your side of the story, obviously.<eos> You still the one feeding Pouch?<eos> Get out.<eos> Where's Severide?<eos> In the change-out room, bangin' another secretary?<eos> I said get out!<eos> Don't forget to vote.<eos> I heard what happened with your paramedics this morning.<eos> How are they holding up? Are they all right?

Are they all right?<eos> They're working through it.
I want intelligence.<eos> Yeah, well, we'll see what we can do about that.<eos> You know... this doesn't have to change things for us.<eos> I wish that were true.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean that when we first met... I didn't sign up for this.<eos> My brother and sister-in-law have the best relationship I've ever seen... except for when he goes undercover.<eos> It changes people.<eos> Maybe if the circumstances were different.<eos> Maybe one day they will be.
You gotta get somebody out there you're comfortable with.<eos> -Well, make a list.<eos> -All right.<eos> Hey, how about that Avery kid?<eos> You want him in the band?<eos> No. I do not need him.<eos> I want to thank you for... For seeing me today, Teddy.<eos> What do you want, lamar?<eos> I think it's time that you and I bury the hatchet.<eos> I mean, my granddaughters are your daughters, and they deserve to have a family that isn't warring with itself.
Well, on that note, is there any chance you would consider coming back out on the road with me?<eos> I said the doctor's great.<eos> The hand?<eos> Not so much.<eos> Which reminds me, I'm glad you came over.<eos> There's something I've been meaning to give back to you.<eos> - Whoa, the Martin? - Yeah.<eos> A guitar like this deserves to be played.<eos> All right? And I'm just not in a position to do that right now.<eos> We'll just say it's a loan, till things change, if they change.
You either stay on script, or you can go home.<eos> The choice is yours.<eos> I really just want to be myself.<eos> Get her out of here.<eos> All right, Buck, I'll see you there.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I let myself in.<eos> Are... the girls here?<eos> I can leave.<eos> No, they're not here.
Wait, really?<eos> Yeah. And you know what we're gonna do to celebrate?<eos> We are gonna go away, just the two of us, to Cedar Woods, under the stars, a bottle of wine, nobody around...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> But you still have to kill two people, right?<eos> Two beasts.<eos> Who are still people.<eos> Vincent, I get it.<eos> I do.<eos> The beasts that you've taken out already, they're bad, they were hurting innocent people.
Oh... that's a very stereotypical picture.<eos> - I'm sorry. Did I get something wrong?<eos> - Yeah, I don't like grapes.<eos> This is just a joke to you.<eos> You sent the car back.<eos> What?<eos> In a world full of people trying to get something off me, you sent the car back.<eos> I love that. (Scoffs)<eos> No, you love that I'm not your wife.<eos> I do, but that's because Olivia... (Sighs) Let's just say that things aren't always as they seem.
Oh, yeah. He would be grateful.<eos> You did exactly what he wanted.<eos> I'm not dropping the project.<eos> You were right.<eos> I was doing it for her.<eos> And now I will do it for a million people I'll never even meet.<eos> And for Mickey.<eos> I could really use your help.<eos> We were just starting to learn the extent of the brain's connections...<eos> How far they reach, how deep they go.
We're not...<eos> Look, I wanted to know what was up.<eos> So you followed me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Friends don't follow friends.<eos> I'm not a client, Quinn.<eos> You don't fix me.<eos> - But those meetings do?<eos> - Those meetings are supposed to be anonymous.<eos> They're also supposed to be for alcoholics.
Now, truth is, I don't really need much of a campaign manager.<eos> Then why did you just hire me?<eos> Because you fix problems, and I've got a big one.<eos> I had a baby at 15.<eos> Gave it up and never looked back.<eos> How many people know?<eos> My mother, God rest her.<eos> She covered her tracks.<eos> Candi doesn't even know.<eos> But I'd say there are about five other people back in Red Springs who could talk if they wanted to.
I wrote my senior thesis on your time in Kuala Lumpur.<eos> I was going through a very bad time.<eos> And in some ways, I think you helped me through it.<eos> Do you have children, agent Keen?<eos> Elizabeth. And...<eos> If all goes well...<eos> There is no work more meaningful than being a mother.<eos> I didn't have kids of my own.<eos> This is my one regret.<eos> But these girls that I'm trying to protect, they are my family.
I forbid you to talk to my son or to set foot in this house again.<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> Both of you!<eos> Get out of my house!<eos> We'll pray for you.<eos> I didn't know you could do that.<eos> Neither did I until now.<eos> Hank doesn't know I'm here.<eos> He's out of town bidding on a construction project.<eos> We tried alternative methods, but... they didn't take.
So...<eos> Second half?<eos> I think we're gonna pass.<eos> - We're getting a little tired.<eos> - We'll show ourselves out.<eos> I apologize.<eos> What?<eos> You got nothing to apologize for.<eos> That's what parents do.<eos> They-they can't understand that two people can be happy just the way they are.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> - Whoa! Settle.<eos> Sorry, sarge.<eos> Ugh, Halloween is the worst.<eos> Everyone's drunk, wearing a mask, and carrying a fake gun.<eos> Plus all the girls think they have to dress sexy.
I...<eos> I can't.<eos> I...<eos> I tried.<eos> I did, really.<eos> I think I need to do a little less research and a little more, you know... time thinkin' about it.<eos> Clearly, you're gonna keep coming around here to visit Carrie.<eos> Are you gonna ban me from the place?<eos> I'm gonna ban those shoes.<eos> They are ghastly.

I'm not gonna spend $300 on a pair of avant-garde shoes like you do.<eos> And by "avant-garde," I mean "ugly."<eos> I don't buy my shoes, luv.<eos> I get them for free.<eos> Hello!<eos> I work at "Interview" magazine.<eos> We have a wardrobe closet.<eos> And if you're gonna keep hanging around here, I at least need to look at something beautiful.<eos> I don't like 'em.<eos> They're boring.
Oh.<eos> And that is a wire transfer for over 900 grand she received five months ago from the estate of her last boyfriend.<eos> Estate?<eos> Yeah, he died.<eos> But not before he changed his will.<eos> Two dead boyfriends back to back.<eos> Looks like Kelly Goodman never worked on those anger issues.<eos> I found fracturing around the bony wall socket of the victim's two upper front teeth.<eos> Well, I'm not an expert on everything, but doesn't that happen when your teeth knocked out?<eos> They weren't knocked out, they were yanked out.
The only holes in my body are the ones God gave me.<eos> We all know which one you talk out of.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Good.<eos> Get the SOCOs to give you a full set of photos.<eos> I want you to go over every inch of this man's body. Yes, sir.<eos> The rest of you hit the mug books.<eos> I want a name!<eos> Sarge, did we get the victim's prints at all?<eos> No, they were all sliced off too.
Lady bin?<eos> Laundry basket.<eos> Oh, little boo-boo.<eos> Can you go be depressed over there?<eos> You're bumming out my whole area.<eos> Baby, I've got some bad news.<eos> Someone painted a giant penis on our minivan.<eos> No, you cannot have an SUV now.<eos> Those things roll, baby.<eos> They roll!
No, you keep that. I...<eos> I don't want it.<eos> Your wife is aware that you didn't like him, correct?<eos> Your feelings were... clear to her?<eos> Only for the last 30 years, yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, it's just...<eos> interesting, out of... all the men she could have entertained, she chose the one most likely to elicit a reaction from you.<eos> Maybe she thought I deserved it.<eos> Pictures of you around the house, it's odd that they're still on display.
You've just caught a mass murderer.<eos> People have been hunting for this guy for a decade.<eos> Well done.<eos> And thank you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Be right back.<eos> I just got a call from Latent Prints.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> We just compared that guy's prints to the ones we found at all the murders.<eos> They don't match.
Fox hunting, actually.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Mm. My father was a nobleman.<eos> I had a rather regal upbringing.<eos> That's one thing I'm pleased to have left behind.<eos> These footprints are different from Thomas'.<eos> Right.<eos> He was barefoot.<eos> You can see the outline of his toes, but not in these.<eos> Maybe they belong to the girl he mentioned.

I just need you to...<eos> Permission to yawn, sir.<eos> Go home.<eos> Please, I'm begging you.<eos> - Oh, fair enough.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's for women.<eos> - These your glasses?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> They're gigantic.
Go home.<eos> Please, I'm begging you.<eos> - Oh, fair enough.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's for women.<eos> - These your glasses?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> They're gigantic.<eos> My contacts dried out, thanks to you.<eos> And they're cool.

We are so desperate at this point.<eos> The baby will not stop crying unless she's breastfeeding and I don't know how much more Jasmine can take.<eos> She needs a break, and the baby will not take a bottle from me.<eos> Well, sometimes they don't want the dad.<eos> You know, it's that simple.<eos> The whole thing is not what I thought it was gonna be.<eos> I mean, I know jabbar was five years old when I met him, and I can't really compare the two situations, but it just felt a lot easier.<eos> There was a, you know, an instinct connection with him the moment I saw him, and...<eos> Girls are complicated.<eos> You know, they're different.

This is detective Tutuola. SVU.<eos> - Nice place. - Thank you.<eos> Can I get you a table?<eos> Actually, we just have a few questions.<eos> Okay, let's take this in the back.<eos> I saw you caught another rapist.<eos> This new suspect may be responsible for all the West Side rapes.<eos> But what about the victims who I.D.'D my attacker?<eos> Well, sometimes victims could get details wrong.<eos> They can misapprehend the situation.
There's nothing further.<eos> Detective, does Jolene Castille fit the profile of the rapist's other victims?<eos> Yes. And Mehcad Carter's appearance...<eos> The way he was dressed and how he followed her, does that match the rapist's profile?<eos> You're asking me if he was a young, black male on a public sidewalk?<eos> Your honor.<eos> Answer the question, detective.<eos> Um, yes, he fit the pattern.<eos> Initially, didn't two prior victims identify Mehcad Carter as their attacker?<eos> From a photo I.D. They later recanted.

"You can't let them into the kitchen, they'll rob you blind."<eos> "Field hands"?<eos> Mmm. Those statements were legally obtained.<eos> These are more prejudicial than probative, your honor, in an already emotionally charged case.<eos> We've been blindsided.<eos> Really?<eos> By your client's own words from a civil suit in which your firm represented her?<eos> You care to tell me how that rises to the level of blindsided?<eos> Mr. Cohen, were you unaware of these depositions or simply hoping the prosecution wouldn't gain access?<eos> They were subsequently sealed, your honor.
We find the defendant not guilty.<eos> [Gavel bangs] Order! Order!<eos> Jolene Castille, you're free to go.<eos> The jury is dismissed.<eos> The state of New York thanks you for your service.<eos> Jolene, do you feel vindicated?<eos> What do you say to Mehcad's parents?<eos> We are disappointed in the verdict, but ultimately we respect that the jury has spoken.<eos> Do you think there will there be rioting tonight?<eos> If there are protests, we ask that they be peaceful.
As always, we would like to make a friendly wager with Eagleton.<eos> If you beat us this year, we will give you a basket of apples from our Pawnee orchard.<eos> Ew, pesticide. Yuck.<eos> Oh, no, these are pesticide-free.<eos> I ate one of these for breakfast this morning, and I found a worm in it.<eos> So, I bet somebody feels pretty stupid right now.<eos> Well, Leslie, I think we had similar ideas.<eos> If you win, Eagleton will give you this basket of oranges.<eos> Of course, it's silly to compare apples and oranges, but what the heck.<eos> These are made of Swarovski crystal, and they're worth $700,000.
- Where are you going?<eos> I'd tell you, but I know that you're squeamish about homicide.<eos> Call me!<eos> - Where are my freaking flowers?<eos> ! - What are you talking about?<eos> Don't screw with me!<eos> Adam said he dropped 'em off with a pasty-faced guy in a nice suit.<eos> Nice suit, pasty face!<eos> - I prefer fair-skinned, but okay.<eos> - Where are they? !
-They took my toes.<eos> -I know, I know, I know.<eos> It's gonna be okay. Come on now.<eos> Easy now, come on.<eos> All right, one more step. Okay.<eos> Mm, please I'm stuffed!<eos> You know, all the girls around here are well enamoured of you.<eos> They are?<eos> I took a good ribbing over our acquaintance.<eos> "Detective Looker", they call you.
Let me just have a quick look around.<eos> Um, hmm, okay. Uh, wait. Hold on.<eos> It's got to be around here some- - Oh!<eos> Here it is.<eos> Ah, my Math homework was in my Philosophy folder, which I may have turned into a paper airplane.<eos> Axl, this is completely illegible.<eos> Thank you, 'cause my teacher said he couldn't even read it.<eos> Oh! Here we go.<eos> Here's my notes I took in Philosophy class.<eos> Oh, they, uh, sort of reek.
Motive, means and methods.<eos> The motive's gotta be revenge.<eos> Punishing the guilty that got away.<eos> Maybe the killer was a victim of a crime himself.<eos> It was probably unsolved. That sense of injustice.<eos> I'll get a list going.<eos> See if you can find Buchan, I want his input.<eos> I'll go.<eos> All right, what about means?<eos> How does he know about these cases if they never went to court?
Studies show, due to extended life spans, the American male is most likely to make a career change in his mid- to late 20s.<eos> Supraorbital ridge indicates the victim was male.<eos> He's just taking his vacation time.<eos> - Sounds healthy to me.<eos> - Are you saying we're not healthy because we work all the time?<eos> Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying.<eos> And there's no tissue for me here.<eos> No DNA after a cookout like this.<eos> We ran the plates.<eos> They're stolen, from out of state.
Something struck the vertebra.<eos> It might have been the axe.<eos> I found the earrings.<eos> ria varado would rather put herself in danger than help the police.<eos> If she bypasses the gang and cooperates with us, she'd be the next victim.<eos> Maybe she got those bruises from Delcampo.<eos> Maybe she's the one who killed him.<eos> No, men call the shots in a gang.<eos> Women tend to facilitate the murders;<eos> they procure weapons, they lure prey.
Then she comes by, and my mother goes out.<eos> Okay. Javier, you tell us where she is, and we'll go pick up the gun.<eos> She only comes to us.<eos> When my mother calls.<eos> Maria's cell phone's in holding.<eos> Javier, will you call Anna for us?<eos> I have Javier's mother's cell number on the grid.<eos> It'll allow us to trace the location of where he's calling.<eos> And you can feed all of that to the FBI?<eos> Booth and his team are waiting to find out where the guns are and when they're being moved.
Of course!<eos> I know where the boners have gone.<eos> All right, if you're gonna drop a steamer, do it in the bushes, all right, buddy?<eos> As Ruxin was so kind to remind us, he's been taking his dog for longer walks recently.<eos> I think the coast is clear, Kale.<eos> And we all know Sofia's strict, no-porn policy.<eos> Yeah, there's such a plethora of free sites now.<eos> Look at this.<eos> These girls are sisters.<eos> They fight a lot, but they actually love each other.
Who knows, seems like it might.<eos> It's interesting.<eos> You know, sometimes I might think... about the world ending or something.<eos> I'd never say that to a child.<eos> This is important.<eos> Children are what keep me going.<eos> Not any particular child, children in general.<eos> In December, we bring out the goats.<eos> The kids remember them.<eos> When they're gone, they notice.
Torn, actually.<eos> Missing phalanges, bone fragments from the skull.<eos> Probably a hawk fed on him.<eos> Don't you want to discuss it with our friends, Booth?<eos> Oh, really?<eos> I mean, you really want to get everyone's opinion on what they think our wedding should be like?<eos> What, "You can't have pigs in a blanket," huh?<eos> "No, no, you know what, you should have "radishes that are shaped like hummingbirds and wear dandelion hats."<eos> I've never even seen those things.<eos> They exist.
I can cross this off my list.<eos> I was able to reconstruct the skull with fragments that the bird barfed up.<eos> The fracture to the parietal would have caused the dura mater to be torn.<eos> Very good, Dr. Brennan.<eos> I say "very good," Dr. Wells.<eos> Not you.<eos> Why can't I verbally recognize your small triumphs?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Note the series of radiating depression fractures.<eos> Normally, radiating fractures on a skull terminate when they encounter a previous fracture.
How are we gonna get dates?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who-who are guys that get lots of girls?<eos> Celebrities?<eos> You're right.<eos> We need new head shots.<eos> Dude, our head shots almost got us the OshKosh B'gosh campaign.<eos> I'm keeping 'em.<eos> So, in summary, we're hoping you can tell us how we can land two willing ladies to go to the prom with us.<eos> Now, they don't have to be smart, their breasts don't need to be prizewinners, but we should know they're there, and their asses should...

Oh, it's okay, though. I can always get the next bus.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Yeah, it's fine that I spend my days taking care of other people's kids while my own kids are raised by my bitch mother.<eos> That's a super sad fake story, but we're not the only late ones.<eos> What about those girls' parents?<eos> Actually, those are your girls.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Yep, they did a lot of growing today.<eos> When they got here they couldn't even sit up, and now I taught them to-- girls, do it!

Floating in the air?<eos> That's what healed you?<eos> I realize it sounds fairly stupid.<eos> It's just a lot to take in.<eos> But you see what I mean, right?<eos> What happened to me wasn't a miracle.<eos> It wasn't God giving me a poke.<eos> You still don't know why it happened, right?<eos> Look, if the word "God" makes you nervous, call it whatever you like, but someone or something told these machines to save you.<eos> They chose you.
So that explains why she ran.<eos> Well, it's a good thing she ran, for the Cotchins, anyway, because if this guy doesn't co , they are out a lot of money.<eos> Yeah, somehow, I don't think the groom is gonna see that silver lining when we break the news to him.<eos> Well, this goes to show you why people should never, under any circumstances, get married.<eos> Why? In case you marry a con artist who's after all your money?<eos> No, Steve.<eos> Because people are never who they say they are.<eos> And even if they are, they end up changing.<eos> Relationships, they don't work.<eos> They don't last forever.
But why is he coming after Adam?<eos> I thought they were allies.<eos> They were.<eos> But something's changed.<eos> This isn't about revenge for Michael's death anymore.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> Because they don't just want Adam dead, they want me, too.<eos> Chin, I can handle this.<eos> Well, at least let me call the Hong Kong police department so they can get you to a safe place.<eos> No. No, Sato has strong ties to the Chinese triads, and they own the police.
I also pinged his cell phone in case it was still on the body. No signal.<eos> Whoever cleaned the cabin got rid of the car and destroyed the phone.<eos> Yeah, that fits with what CSU is telling me.<eos> The place is spotless.<eos> No prints, casings or shells inside or out.<eos> There were traces of blood in the living room, but they were too contaminated to test.<eos> So we've got nothing?<eos> We do have this.<eos> Set of tire tracks consistent with a commercial van.<eos> Okay, if they're the only tracks at the scene of the crime, then the van belonged to our cleaner.
Don't make fun.<eos> I'm not making fun, buddy; I am serious.<eos> Okay, which one's Besner's car?<eos> This is the middle of nowhere.<eos> What are all these doing here anyway?<eos> Come on, baby, come over here.<eos> Boys, you guys going up to the party or what?<eos> You gonna get an evidence bag or are you gonna put that thing on?<eos> - Huh? You know what I never understood?<eos> What it is about Halloween that makes girls dress the way that they dress.
So we got two people abducted a year apart from each other, both of whom were used as subjects in a human experiment.<eos> Okay, well, if we can figure out how and why they were selected, it might help us identify who took them.<eos> Let's start with Marshall Demps.<eos> He spent most of his life in and out of shelters, foster homes.<eos> If you're gonna go snatch somebody off the street, maybe better somebody that won't be missed.<eos> Right.<eos> Yes, but Lisa Mills was living with her parents at the time she was abducted.<eos> So it looks like the only thing these two had in common was that they both had juvenile records.<eos> Actually, that's not the only thing they have in common.<eos> It turns out that both victims had MRIs ordered when they were children.
'Paris, my sweet, 'is thoroughly French in every way.<eos> 'We do business over coffee and cognac the day long 'and everyone is in a race to dream up fashions 'still more daring than were worn yesterday.<eos> 'I brought back silks from Tangier 'and, in no time, they were in the window of the Bon Marche 'as the most audacious gowns I've set my eyes upon.
I was sorry to hear about your father.<eos> He missed his home.<eos> I think it took its toll on him.<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> Katherine, I'm grateful you have permitted me to return...<eos> You have been brought back to restore the fortunes of an asset my family now owns.<eos> Yes, what I meant was...<eos> I did not wish this moment to pass without acknowledging how...<eos> Really, Moray.....difficult... ..gallantry would be an unwelcome touch of sentimentality when there is no call for it.<eos> I would not wish for things to be any different than they are.
The sale must prove to him that The Paradise and you are a glittering success.<eos> Miss Flora.<eos> Can we go to The Paradise again, Mama?<eos> I did love it so.<eos> I'm glad to hear you are so taken with the store, Flora.<eos> And Denise.<eos> Can we see Denise again?<eos> You are confident that your exotic imports will return The Paradise to its former glory?<eos> I am.<eos> They must.
Mr Moray is buying you all a drink tonight.<eos> Isn't it marvellous how your thirst swells when the bosses are buying?<eos> Hey, I warned you about Nathaniel, didn't I, Mr Dudley?<eos> No, you didn't, Sam.<eos> Well, I meant to.<eos> I warned you though, didn't I, Denise?<eos> Show a little consideration for Susy, Sam.<eos> Susy'll recover.<eos> Women have a hardy constitution when it comes to men.<eos> You know what girls do when they get their heart broke by a bad fella?
Stevie Ray Vaughan.<eos> So why wasn't it there tonight?<eos> About a month or so ago, I... I pawned it.<eos> I had to keep the power on somehow.<eos> Yeah, if it wasn't for that cash, uh... club would've been closed tonight.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> And without a stack of old National Geographics, like a proper doctor.<eos> David's still prepping the last victim, but here's what we have so far.<eos> Kevin Ellis. C.O.D.'s intracerebral hemorrhage due to multiple blunt force trauma.<eos> Steel-toed boots may be the punk style, but they definitely clashed with his skull.
Yeah, well, we're the highest rated culinary competition show on air, so any of our rivals could've pulled a stunt like this to try and sabotage us.<eos> Or an eliminated contestant.<eos> The prize money is just the beginning.<eos> Your past winners have gone on to open their own restaurants, become celebrity chefs.<eos> A win is worth millions.<eos> I doubt any of them are involved.<eos> The eliminated contestants are sequestered at a nearby hotel-- we don't want viewers knowing who's been kicked off.<eos> We're gonna also need to see your footage from the last 48 hours.<eos> We have 13 cameras on this stage, seven in the house set where the remaining contestants live.<eos> Are they on all the time? No.
Did the glass come from Witten's lamp?<eos> No.<eos> Density and refractive index don't match.<eos> "Silica, sodium oxide, with a broadband anti-reflective coating."<eos> Sounds like a flashlight lens.<eos> That's what I was thinking.<eos> I followed up on Emily Bridwell, our girl in the hospital.<eos> Turns out, she was questioned in a string of burglaries in Summerlin, along with her roommates, our girl in the morgue, Gwen Onetta.<eos> Flashlights, burglaries... maybe these girls weren't invited to Witten's house.<eos> Maybe they invited themselves.
The look in her eyes says that there was a lot more to the relationship than that.<eos> This film proves that everything he said about Darcy is a lie.<eos> Not only did they know each other, they were probably having sex.<eos> Well, Witten was released today.<eos> I say we go over to his house, shove those in his face and force a confession out of him.<eos> Uh, wait a minute.<eos> If we know he's guilty, somebody else does, too.<eos> Whoever sent our thieves in there to steal the film.<eos> Well, it's got to be someone who knows Witten.<eos> They knew the house, they knew the security codes, and they knew that he had the film.

He posed as an explosives specialist.<eos> Last night was his big drop.<eos> You gave him two dud bombs that seemed very real to plant at The Mediterranean.<eos> He planted the first one.<eos> When he went to plant the second one he slipped into the flood channel and got washed away.<eos> After that, we had to abort the op.<eos> We picked up the bomb at the loading dock.<eos> Scratching your agent's arm in the process.<eos> How does planting dud bombs help your undercover op?<eos> We planned to discover the bombs very publicly first, then release to the media that they were very dangerous and expertly made.
Did I mention my fondness for you?<eos> I like her.<eos> All right, so where are we on this rape case?<eos> Victimology shows no links between the three rape victims.<eos> None of them knew each other.<eos> No shared routines.<eos> No overlaps in their lives.<eos> Other than being this guy's type-- early 20s, single, brunette, living alone in a first-floor condo.<eos> The M.O.'s consistent, right?<eos> I mean, he waits until they're asleep, uses a bump key on the back door lock to gain entry.
Get out of here.<eos> Get to higher ground.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> I will not be the reason something happens to you.<eos> Then we're in agreement.<eos> Because I make my own choices.<eos> You are a strong woman.<eos> When I care about someone, there's nothing I won't do for them.<eos> Another thing... we have in common.<eos> The burns, they're lowering your body temperature.
A most dramatic turn.<eos> City officials are urging calm, hoping to avoid widespread panic.<eos> Deputy Mayor Levitz has...<eos> The Count has turned Starling into a city of junkies.<eos> Any leads on where he's holding ADA Donner?<eos> Hmm, no.<eos> As cold as it sounds, I've got other concerns.<eos> Laurel?<eos> Adam's trial notes are very thorough.<eos> They better be.
Not neutered.<eos> And we really hope that you don't, but if you choose to take your accounts elsewhere, we will understand.<eos> And miss all this delicious complication?<eos> Not a chance.<eos> You three... so delightful.<eos> And so American.<eos> The recording is completely finished.<eos> And your toad-licking lad there grew a pair.<eos> A magnificent pair.<eos> Indeed they are.
- Yeah. - And they didn't find - his body on the plane?<eos> - No. Well, I don't know how you guys handle family issues, but I hope you're not gonna let him get away with this.<eos> Hey, it's gonna be okay.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> You must become accustomed to the smell of death.<eos> What do you want me to do with these?<eos> Place the flowers in her.<eos> Then sew her shut.<eos> The flowers must become part of her before they can be effective.
- And I don't trust you.<eos> Then we are nowhere, and we will be crushed.<eos> This might be a good time for you to say something.<eos> I can understand the reluctance that some of you feel.<eos> However, my blood gives me access to people that we need.<eos> I understand wesen in a way that many of you can't.<eos> And I have a Grimm.<eos> No one else brings all this to the table.<eos> Now, there is no guarantee that that will be enough, but we must trust each other or there will be no stopping the royal families.<eos> They will dominate the world again, and those of us who are still alive will be kneeling before them and begging for whatever crumbs they throw at our feet.
Seven months ago, the annual competition "CEO of the Future '.<eos> 2000 participants have registered from which the 80 best were chosen.<eos> From which 80 best we have chosen the 20 best participants ... today as finalists participate in the competition "CEO of the Future '.<eos> Here a billion market.<eos> A market that the economic future will change dramatically.<eos> We want both areas to conquer the Asian market.<eos> We are undervalued.<eos> There is a risk of a hostile takeover.<eos> The good news is that your shares are worth more.<eos> They can be sold above market value.
I was born in Paris and grew up.<eos> German is not my mother tongue.<eos> What characterizes my youth, is the fact that I did not go to school.<eos> I also had lessons from my parents.<eos> I tell the story of a happy childhood without school ... because I want to show that things can be different.<eos> I've always been interested in things that I have encountered in my life ... and I could devote myself to it always undisturbed.<eos> On my third hit I open a book and I said to my parents ...<eos> I saw egg cups and eggs.<eos> They were astonished when they saw that I pointed to the letters C and D.<eos> They said the letters were, and I wanted to know how they sounded.
It's like there's been this fog around my life, and with you, all of a sudden it's gone.<eos> I love that you can express your feelings now.<eos> Yeah, it's a weird feeling.<eos> It's kind of like gross but also good.<eos> You know?<eos> It's like an egg broke.<eos> And then, like, all the yolk comes out but it's good.<eos> I'm happy to admit I like love songs.<eos> I understand them.<eos> They're really sad.

You know, I got to tell you, if it wasn't for you pushing me the way you did, I'd have never met, uh, Barb here.<eos> And so thank you.<eos> Is there a pool in this house?<eos> Oh, that's not a clean thing.<eos> Is she terrific, or what?<eos> Cannon, I just passed Barb.<eos> She's turning blue.<eos> Oh, it's a touch of Emphysema.<eos> She'll shake it.<eos> Why do they make these things childproof if they're for children? !
Every single part of that sentence would get me expelled.<eos> - You got your eye on a girl?<eos> - I just don't know what to do.<eos> Look, it's like I told you in practice, right?<eos> You got to commit.<eos> You just go up and tell 'em how you feel.<eos> Now, if she doesn't like you back, she's a bum and you don't want her anyway.<eos> So, I just walk up and tell her?<eos> I mean, if you want to make a real impression, right, then, uh, just do something, uh, you know, thoughtful.<eos> You know, girls, they, uh... they eat that crap up.
Oh, as a friend, I got to tell you, you look terrible.<eos> I would never have sex with you looking like this.<eos> Okay, I need you to stop using your ability to have sex with me as a barometer for how I should dress.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> It's ingrained.<eos> Morgan, I've been working non-stop.<eos> I don't have time to look my normal, glamorous self.<eos> Okay, no, I'm sorry.<eos> Being busy is not an excuse.<eos> You know, feminism nowadays, it's all about reminding working women that they have to look hot, too.
Yeah?<eos> No, don't...<eos> I like this side smooth.<eos> Great.<eos> Cozy.<eos> (Male narrator on TV) A thrilling sex ritual so vigorous and titillating it is said to have inspired...<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> [Giggles] Okay, don't... no.<eos> Stop.<eos> Of all the things frogs do, all the very interesting things they do, you're gonna show me this?
I'm doing background on all of Dawson's personal contacts right now.<eos> No flags yet, but...<eos> I organized everything into that master spreadsheet.<eos> - What'd it get us?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Hard to believe.<eos> BOLO's not doing any good, either.<eos> We need to get proactive about our SUV.<eos> I told you. I scoured those videos.<eos> They don't give us anything other than that Dawson was being followed.
- I do love it.<eos> - I just don't want it.<eos> - Why don't you want it?<eos> I do want it.<eos> I just can't keep it.<eos> It costs more than my rent, and I don't want to be a snob.<eos> Well, you're worse than a snob.<eos> You're, like, a reverse snob.<eos> How dare you, and what does that mean?<eos> It means that you purposely don't like things because they're expensive.
The Attorney General?<eos> That unweaned whelp Hoover?<eos> United States Capitol Police.<eos> What is the alleged transgression?<eos> Perjury before a Senate committee on March 14th of this year.<eos> To what precise aspect of my testimony is exception being taken?<eos> All of it.<eos> Everything okay, boss?<eos> Smell any skunks out there?<eos> I don't think they walk on sand.
Thank you, Mr. Harrow.<eos> No further questions.<eos> I, uh... begging the pardon of the court,<eos> I only received the particulars of this case last--<eos> I notice you're wearing glasses,<eos> Mr. Harold-- Harrow.<eos> Are they for cosmetic purposes?<eos> What?<eos> Are they for reasons of vanity or do you need them to see?<eos> They keep...

And part of that is I don't need you to drive me to class every day, you know?<eos> Maybe I'll be lonely, but I'll be okay 'cause I know you'll be waiting for me.<eos> And I'm okay, too.<eos> Except for a searing feeling of betrayal from someone I used to think of as a second mother.<eos> Oh, Kyle!<eos> Come on!<eos> I didn't mean to... Honey, honey. You meant it.<eos> You know, I just want what's best for her.<eos> And you don't want grandchildren with webbed feet. I understand.<eos> You know, I worry about our daughters a... and the men they choose.

(chimes) Ooh, I got one, too.<eos> The ladies are coming to us.<eos> Oh, man, if I'd started this years ago, I'd be divorced two or three times by now.<eos> (chimes)<eos> What...?<eos> Another one.<eos> You know, it... it's weird.<eos> When they're reading your profile, does it... does it make you feel exposed?<eos> Like they see you naked?<eos> Well, they're not running away screaming, so, no.
Blow the bank on it.<eos> Is there anyone that doesn't have a fan site?<eos> I don't.<eos> Did you find anything new?<eos> The Axeman killed eight people, scared the crap out of the city, never got caught.<eos> Listen to this. "If women will not dance<eos> "to the sound of my axe,<eos> I shall gladly make them dance with the other."<eos> Do you know a saxophone is called an axe?<eos> So he chopped women up 'cause they wouldn't be his groupies?
They probably feed you Shake 'n Bake and watermelon for dessert.<eos> They don't care that I'm black.<eos> I just think that...<eos> they just don't like me.<eos> Oh... they care plenty.<eos> Hmph. Their power is built on the sweat of our backs.<eos> The only reason you and I in this country is 'cause our great-great-grandpas couldn't run fast enough.<eos> We'll never be welcome here.<eos> And those witches are the worst.<eos> They're not so bad.

Even right now, they got evil sleeping under their roof, eatin' alongside of 'em.
I hear they're not seeing anyone right now.<eos> Stop it! Stop it!<eos> Right now.<eos> Like it or not, Fiona is your Supreme, and you need to start treating her like one.<eos> And you... You need to stop accusing Auntie Myrtle.<eos> We both know she's not the one who blinded me.<eos> The real danger is outside these doors, not inside.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> I need to lie down.<eos> When the girls get in, make sure they stay in.
When the girls get in, make sure they stay in.<eos> It's dangerous out there.<eos> Of course, baby bird.<eos> You go rest your new eyes.<eos> We'll see to absolutely everything.<eos> Wait... Hug me again.<eos> Of course I will, my darling girl.<eos> Nothing.<eos> My visions...<eos> They're gone.
♪ Oh... I wish I was in the land of cotton ♪<eos> ♪ Old times there are not forgotten ♪<eos> ♪ Look away! Look away!<eos> ♪ Look away, Dixieland...<eos> Marie Laveau sends her regards.<eos> What's happening to me? !<eos> You're feeling the wrath of broken promises.<eos> Where are the heads of the white witches?<eos> I'm trying!<eos> They die tonight or the next needle I use will put a hole in your heart.

You thought it was you, didn't you?<eos> Well, I knew it wasn't you, because when Fiona cut your throat, you died.<eos> It could be any one of us.<eos> Not really. It's pretty obvious.<eos> And what does that mean?<eos> Being the Supreme isn't something to wish for.<eos> It's not a gift.<eos> It's a burden.<eos> How many of these women had happy lives?<eos> They had the power, but with it came the crushing responsibility of the coven.

I could never pull off the corals.<eos> Make sure they hang my portrait in the place I chose.<eos> Don't let them store me in the basement with that disgraced...<eos> Half of it's paste, but goddamn half of it's good.<eos> Madame.<eos> You need to take this.<eos> We must purge you of this poison.<eos> You can speak.<eos> Yes.<eos> I was murdered. Those idiot girls thought they could silence me, but they've only given me voice here in the spirit world.
Take this.<eos> No, Spalding... you don't understand.<eos> I am finally... trying to do... something decent... something noble for e coven.<eos> Horseshit.<eos> You're making a martyr of yourself by giving up.<eos> You've been tricked.<eos> You've allowed a pack of lesser witches to buffalo you into this ignominious end.<eos> I won't permit it.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> They've been running a number on you.

Madison Montgomery is not the next Supreme.<eos> She didn't conquer death.<eos> She was brought back by some dirty little... swamp witch.<eos> They've been leading you to your doom with lies.
- Because it's my job.<eos> - My private life falls way outside your job description.<eos> Not when it impacts the counsel you give the governor.<eos> - Let's get something straight.<eos> - I have been with Peter since...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't do this right now.<eos> Oh, spare me the rigors of pregnancy BS!<eos> Your Honor, blood feuds are a recognized ground for asylum.<eos> Yes, in places where they exist.
That's what I said.<eos> Look, I think the real problem here is the D.A.'s last living witness belongs in a puzzle factory, not giving testimony on a witness stand.<eos> Hello, my fellow law enforcers.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> But I thought you might like to hear this.<eos> We all know that facial replication technology exists, DNA can be fabricated, fingerprints can be planted.<eos> The human vocal chords can't be faked.<eos> Recorded, yes.<eos> Duplicated, yes.<eos> And to the human ear, they can seem identical.
Whoa, where is that coming from?<eos> I'll tell you where it's coming from.<eos> All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls' night and now you're here ruining it for everyone.<eos> Raj, cool it... he's gonna make us hair diamonds.<eos> How am I ruining anything?<eos> I'm just trying to help you make better jewelry.<eos> But this isn't about the jewelry.<eos> This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.<eos> Since when can't you open up with me?<eos> There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won't make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my "Koothrapanties are in a bunch."
He can't.<eos> He really can't.<eos> Oh!<eos> Wait here.<eos> I'll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye's house.<eos> As long as I'm not within 500 feet of it.<eos> (giggles)<eos> So, you, uh... you have...<eos> you have any... single grandmothers?<eos> Sorry, they're both married.
Right on the edge of the Glades.<eos> A.R.G.U.S. has them all over the country.<eos> They store relief supplies- food, clothing...<eos> Medicine.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> I can't believe I'm actually saying this.<eos> The way this arrowhead is bent...<eos> It means our thief's muscle density is at least 120 pounds per cubic foot.<eos> That's almost the same density as common concrete.<eos> Your arrows may cut this guy, but they will not stop him.
I'm sorry.<eos> I don't think you can ask me this legally in a job interview.<eos> Oh, of course not.<eos> Of course not.<eos> No. You know what?<eos> - Forget I asked.<eos> - I haven't given much thought to kids.<eos> (clicks tongue) Please, never mind.<eos> But if I do, or when I do, I imagine girls... two.<eos> I know that they'll be hell in junior high, but, uh... I grew up with sisters.
But, Miranda, I-I'm glad I'm home, because something's clearly going on.<eos> Between the checking and re-checking the drawers, and pulling at your fingertips?<eos> ♪ something they can't hide ♪<eos> You need help.<eos> What happened today in that O.R., you and I both know that there was no bubble.<eos> (scoffs) Uh, there was a smell.<eos> Look, apple slices.<eos> Probably with peanut butter on them at one point.<eos> I found them in Tuck's soccer bag, and he hasn't been to soccer in weeks.<eos> So, you know, god knows how long they've been rotting in there.
He's been praying in his cell since he was arrested.<eos> Fundraising to open a school in Ghana, you set up a soup kitchen in Potters Lane.<eos> And you've won awards for your work with the homeless.<eos> So what's a good man like you doing with a group of degenerate cannibals?<eos> Our group is devoted to the celebration of God's bounty.<eos> -We're not savages.<eos> -I saw what was on that table.<eos> Nature is his gift to us.<eos> We enjoy the beauty of his creations when they are alive.<eos> What better way to show our appreciation than by eating them when they're dead?
Wild animals are reservoirs of viruses and bacteria waiting to jump the species' barrier.<eos> Consuming them unleashes zoonotic diseases we can't survive, like Ebola.<eos> -Do I wanna know?<eos> -No, probably not.<eos> It's a virus that dissolves you from the inside, so you bleed out through your mouth, your ears, your eyes.<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> You saved Whitechapel from the plague.<eos> They knew the dangers to us all, that's why no-one will talk.<eos> As far as the search teams can tell, Josie Eagle isn't in the sewers.<eos> -Have they checked all the tunnels? -Under Whitechapel, yes.
I'm afraid to use the boys' bathroom.<eos> I can't. I just don't feel comfortable in there.<eos> I make sure to only come in here during class so no one finds out or gets upset.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Your secret's safe with me.<eos> And that's how it all started... the Great McKinley Bathroom Gender Riot of 2013.<eos> Bree figured out that the boys' room was a great place to make out in and not get caught.<eos> You've been avoiding me.<eos> Whoa. Stoner Brett started using the girls' bathroom because it was cleaner and it smelled better, and he heard a rumor that the toilet seats were heated.<eos> And then the girls started using the boys' room when they realized that boys never had to wait in a line.
I should be teaching her how to drive or punching out her soccer coach...<eos> Which I can't really do, 'cause he and I kind of hooked up last summer.<eos> I could never have gone bra shopping with my dad.<eos> Although he did once take one of my college roommates to a lingerie store.<eos> Ellie told me she wants to go alone.<eos> But isn't it, like, a rite of passage thing?<eos> Shouldn't somebody be there with her?<eos> Definitely.<eos> Breasts are delicate.<eos> Hell yeah, they are.
Back in the '80s, before you could buy anything you wanted with a click of a mouse, shopping was more of a contact sport.<eos> And no one was better at it than my mom.<eos> Remember, dented cans are 50% off.<eos> I made it easy for you.<eos> They're all dented.

Most kids ignore their mom's high praise, but Barry wasn't most kids.<eos> He really believed the hype.<eos> Unfortunately, that confidence did not translate to his moves with the ladies.<eos> - Hi...?<eos> - Yo.<eos> Locker strike! Hyah!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> My hands are like rocks.<eos> But they're soft, too.
Would you like me to come back?<eos> No. Stay!<eos> Carey Zepps, you're fired.<eos> We need you to get out of the offices right now.<eos> No, that stays.<eos> You take nothing.<eos> My car keys are in my office.<eos> Your things will be collected and sent to your home.<eos> If you need your car keys, wait in the lobby.<eos> They'll be delivered to you.
How's it hanging?<eos> That's funny.<eos> No, seriously, Deeks.<eos> If you're injured, you don't need to be here.<eos> Go back to your desk, walk it off.<eos> Nell, tell them what you found.<eos> Our hacker, Cindy Chang, is a sophomore at Eastgate Prep, one of LA's most sought-after private schools.<eos> Yeah, it's a feeder to the Ivies.<eos> And a breeder for the city's worst d-bags and princesses.<eos> Just because they didn't want to date you in high school does not make them princesses.

I said, "I'm gonna go get the songs," you said, "okay."<eos> But I didn't really think you would possibly be able to pull it off.<eos> Well, that was your mistake.<eos> You didn't believe in me.<eos> But look at me.<eos> I got the songs.<eos> - Listen, you said- by giving away my labor...<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> - You pulled it off.<eos> - You said they're good.

Even if what you're saying is true, that doesn't mean I murdered Alice!<eos> You did hire Hawke to get that diamond back.<eos> I had to.<eos> I was afraid Vonroenn would find out.<eos> Vonroenn, the diamond cartel?<eos> What do they have to do with this?<eos> When I was in engineering school,<eos> I developed a process for lab-grown diamonds.<eos> But all I could manage were small flawed stones.<eos> They were worthless.
Where you going? To work.<eos> Uh, my truck is blocking you in the driveway.<eos> - Let me drive.<eos> - I'm fine, Wayne. Hey, maybe you don't remember what happened the last time I let you drive in this condition.<eos> Oh, it doesn't matter anyway.<eos> I'm never gonna see my grandsons again.<eos> Hey, man, I'm feeling, um... feeling really light-headed.<eos> Would you get my pills?<eos> - What, the heart ones?<eos> - Yeah. They're in my bathroom in a white bottle.
Why didn't people come?<eos> We had 45 maybes on our Evites.<eos> Hayley, "maybe" means no.<eos> The only place that "maybe" means maybe is sex.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Okay, I'll bite.<eos> What's up with the gyroscope on his junk?<eos> Stan was... injured and went into a rare condition known as...<eos> "testicular retreat syndrome."<eos> His, um... nuggs were so traumatized, they ran up into his body to heal.

Audrey seems to suddenly believe that to marry would be a betrayal of her sex.<eos> That'll be Mademoiselle's doing.<eos> I heard 'em all talking in the inn.<eos> Audrey in the Three Crowns?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't even go in there.<eos> Oh, it was quite the party.<eos> And here's me without a breath of sleep fretting about whether my marriage is on or off?<eos> What I know about women is this - you promise them undying love, marriage, faithfulness, they're away in a wisp.
The government's gone mad.<eos> First they got wiretapping, then they got stand your ground.<eos> Now they got the feds showing up at normal folks' home for no damn reason.<eos> Lyle, I told you, this is standard procedure.<eos> The remains of two bodies were found in your yard.<eos> That has nothing to do with us, and as soon as you figure that out,<eos> I'm gonna sue you guys for emotional distress.<eos> I can tell from the pelvic and hip measurements that both victims were female.<eos> What about their ages?<eos> The hardening of the sternum puts them both in their early 30s when they were killed.
Smoke weed.<eos> Hang out with my gang, you know?<eos> Do you take care of the yard?<eos> Oh, yes, sir.<eos> I mow the lawn, sir.<eos> Now, you want me to mow your lawn, sir?<eos> Have you been able to determine approximate time of death yet?<eos> Well, the degree of decomposition and bone pitting suggests these women were killed about 10 years ago.<eos> Do you know what killed them?<eos> Like I thought, they were beaten to death, but there is one other thing.
Sir?<eos> Why do you feel so powerless, Lyle?<eos> Powerless, sir?<eos> It would explain why you took your power back by mutilating your victims' genitalia.<eos> Mutilation?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You think I killed those people?<eos> I think you tortured them and you buried them in your backyard.<eos> You're tripping.<eos> Did you become enraged because they wouldn't have sex with you?
Well, I know you've done your best.<eos> Thank you. Mary...<eos> Why don't you share your wisdom with all of us.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Always at my wife's ear.<eos> What do you whisper?<eos> I hear emperor maximilian Has a seer in prague who can... Tell fortunes using playing cards.<eos> Tell the fortunes of queen mary And her ladies.<eos> Forgive me, your majesty, But I'm not skilled at cards and I don't control my visions.<eos> They come and go as they will.
Like a little mini bitch.<eos> Is that what your name means in French, or Italian, whatever it is?<eos> I'm... I tend to talk too much.<eos> I'm used to dealing with boys far prettier and considerably stupider than you.<eos> Look, I agreed to meet with you because I trust Barb Brownfield's eye.<eos> And I must admit, I do respond to your look.<eos> Your Midwestern eyes have the vacant stare of a cow's.<eos> I don't have any of those on my roster.<eos> And you have a unique mouth.<eos> It's, like, your lips, they're kind of like...
I don't have any of those on my roster.<eos> And you have a unique mouth.<eos> It's, like, your lips, they're kind of like...<eos> Trouty.<eos> Yes! That's it.<eos> Trouty mouth.<eos> Can I have, uh, one of these...<eos> No. So, this is how this works.<eos> These pictures...<eos> - Mm-hmm. - They're nice.
Fact: he didn't, and I think you forgot to tell us about that.<eos> So I'm gonna skip college, too,<eos> - and become a male model.<eos> - Impossible.<eos> And I don't care what you or Ms. Bichette or anyone says.<eos> I like me just the way I am, and I'm not gonna<eos> - change for anyone.<eos> - Well, that is just the screw-you spirit employers love.<eos> Honest to God, I cannot imagine what goes on in your lumpish, sexually ambiguous heads.<eos> 'Cause they're nuts.
Here are all our symbols.<eos> They didn't seem to relate to each other until you add this one--the one susannah drew on her hand.<eos> The one she found at the chapel the night she was killed.<eos> They all fit together.<eos> Final piece.<eos> Without it, the others didn't fit.<eos> That's why the killer scraped it off her hand.<eos> He didn't want her or anyone else to be able to figure it out.<eos> Okay, so the pieces fit together.<eos> What do they mean?
RAY: Not really my thing.<eos> LISA: Oh, let me see it.<eos> MATT: Well, just pass it along.<eos> Thanks.<eos> If I could, I'd like to propose a toast.<eos> Uh, I just want to, um... Thank you all for coming up here.<eos> Uh...<eos> Since my boy's been gone, the help's been few and far between.<eos> And I just-- I really appreciate it.<eos> And I want you to know that whatever this thing is, I believe it's still here. And it's really smart.

You know, she deserves a personal touch."<eos> Anyways, seven days later, she shows up like a lunatic.<eos> Um, she leaves, and I realize all my jewelry's gone.<eos> What services do you provide, exactly?<eos> Love spells, money spells, cleansing, hex removal.<eos> - It's Wicca stuff.<eos> - You're a witch? Yeah. I'm a witch.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Wait. Do you have a spell that would make my hair grow back?<eos> Your head is perfect the way it is.
- my face will flash on my phone!<eos> Let me show you...<eos> switch on your camera, please!<eos> I'm still confused...!<eos> So now when we take your photo...<eos> - You clicking me?<eos> We need your photo, right?<eos> - Then it'll flash on my phone...!<eos> No!<eos> If the photo's taken on this phone, it'll flash here... not there!
Very funny. There was a smash and grab last night.<eos> Security footage shows a guy in a Halloween mask.<eos> - Same mask as from the hospital?<eos> - Same dollar-store quality.<eos> He matches the physical description.<eos> It's gotta be our guy, Aidan.<eos> - What'd he take?<eos> - [Three wedding dresses.]<eos> Nice ones too.<eos> He busted open the till, but it was empty.
Mr. Blaylock, open up.<eos> I think our plot just thickened.<eos> I'm pretty sure this wasn't a suicide.<eos> How can you tell?<eos> See that diagonal ligature mark running up his neck?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, that's what we'd expect to find because the weight of the body pulls the cord into a vertical line.<eos> But?<eos> But this other faint ligature mark--<eos> See how it runs horizontally across his neck?
- Wasserman.<eos> Other half of the crack team that couldn't manage a simple arrest.<eos> We were not part of the arresting team.<eos> We have to find Fabien Vincent, get him back into custody in the next 48 hours or heads start rolling.<eos> Do you have better people to replace us with?<eos> What?<eos> If anybody is going to find him, it will be us.<eos> Elise, I don't... That is not arrogance, I just believe it to be true.<eos> Don't worry, I don't have any problem with arrogance.<eos> If it's backed up with ability.
(music playing in distance)<eos> (distant chanting)<eos> Chanting.<eos> (intermittent beeping)<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> I'm getting closer.<eos> It took going back to Aster Corps... but I'm finally making progress on the sequence.<eos> We're getting so close.<eos> Maybe ten digits away.<eos> When it's complete, then it'll all make sense.
None of that is going to happen, because Calvin here is going to help us avoid all that.<eos> Now, thank you for coming.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> You have the updates from the sleep clinic?<eos> Yeah, we got another four digits last night, so the sequence is now 97 numbers long.<eos> How predictive is it?<eos> Uh, 40% one day, 70% the next.<eos> We won't really be able to apply it until it's completed.<eos> And when will that be?<eos> When it wraps back around to the beginning, to 318.
This happened postmortem.<eos> There's a lot of, uh, freighter traffic up on the river up there.<eos> Currents kick up.<eos> If the car's underwater and Brendan's cuffed in tight, if a tanker sailed by, could it jostle him enough to snap his wrist?<eos> I'd say so.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> - What about the water in his lungs?<eos> - What about it?<eos> You haven't tested it.<eos> Does it match against the river?
We're trying to find someone the police might have missed who can confirm Damien accidentally hit Judge Dinsdale.<eos> Well, they interviewed my entire staff.<eos> Right, but it could be, like, a maintenance worker or a caddie, someone who's afraid to lose their job for speaking up.<eos> Well, our GPS system tracks every golf cart and maintenance vehicle on the course for liability purposes.<eos> The cart system also displays how far you are from the green, keeps score, even lets you order food and beverage.<eos> It's really innovative.<eos> Yeah, I don't want to buy one, Karp.<eos> Now, as you can see, there were only two carts on the 14th hole... you and Judge Dinsdale in cart number 43 and Mr. Infeld and Mr. Hughes in cart number 26.<eos> Okay, so, that's us in the gully, right?<eos> Hold up... what's the time stamp on cart 26 when it drove by the gully?
If this was an arrowhead, I'd return it in a heartbeat.<eos> But the fact is that Mr. Kresge's meteorite... well, it... it could save the future of mankind.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Hall.<eos> The future of mankind?<eos> ♪ Bum-bum-bum ♪ Wow.<eos> Dr. Hall, I'm confused about JXP's custody policy.<eos> Why is it that you returned three other meteorites you secured the same week that you acquired Denny's?<eos> Our research on those particular specimens was complete.<eos> Oh. Denny's meteorite is rare.<eos> In fact, it says here that your company has recently determined it is from Mercury, correct?
- get his DNA into CODIS.<eos> - Or maybe he's just innocent.<eos> Look, we have three reliable witnesses.<eos> Two of whom are tourists.<eos> His attorney may be legal aid, but she's smart.<eos> She knows that if they leave the country, the judge will throw the case out.<eos> We have Alice Parker and her photo.<eos> She came on the scene after the fact, the photo is not definitive.<eos> Look, this case was a dog from the start.<eos> It just got fleas.
Good. I'm going down to autopsy.<eos> Puncture wound is 0.5 centimeters at the apex.<eos> 12.7 centimeters of jagged tear.<eos> Ugh. It's like someone pulled her throat open with claws.<eos> What kind of murder weapon does that?<eos> It snagged the carotid.<eos> Notice I said "snagged."<eos> I noticed.<eos> Notice how much I would love to know what the murder weapon is.<eos> - Carotid artery was pulled until it tore.
Really?<eos> That's nice of him.<eos> You know, if you had some start-up money,<eos> Yeah, and if I had a degree in accounting, Then I could have a real, grown-up job.<eos> Ah, touche.<eos> Cook for me tonight?<eos> You know I will.<eos> Love you.<eos> Have a good day!<eos> Yeah, that caffeine, It chemically stimulates your stress responses.
Just give me a few more days, and I will find you your money.<eos> I promise.<eos> You have three more days.<eos> Three.<eos> And just remember one more thing--<eos> I own you.<eos> Okay, remember, we get in, get the truck, and get out.<eos> We got one shot at this.<eos> One shot's all we need.<eos> The key to getting through a high-security fence is understanding how it works.
Well, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were jealous.<eos> Of a week in Tahoe?<eos> I'd rather spend a month in Jersey.<eos> Well, don't worry.<eos> I'll be back before you know it.<eos> You don't mind walking to lunch, do you?<eos> You didn't fix it yet.<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> Your driver's side window is completely blown out. And your passenger door doesn't open.<eos> It does too open. You just got to lean into it is all.
You too.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I know.<eos> He is so freaking hot.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> Well, if he didn't like you, then why would he text you 25 times?<eos> What's this?<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> It's Kelley Blue Book.<eos> I figured out my new car and exactly how much it's gonna cost us.
Can I show you something?<eos> It was my dad's.<eos> It doesn't open anymore, but I just like the fact that he carried it around.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, what happened to your dad?<eos> He's in jail.<eos> Well, he was in jail, but then he had to leave the country and now he lives in, um, on an island.<eos> He made a lot of money and some people got mad, so he had to leave.<eos> But he'll come back and get us.<eos> And he's gonna take us to his really nice house, and it's right on the beach, and there's a pool and these really awesome cars.
But, uh, for now, I've been getting by with the help of a, uh, tongue on a stick.<eos> Wilfred, your weight has gotten out of control.<eos> You're gonna give yourself a heart attack.<eos> For the last time, I am not fat.<eos> I'm just a little on the husky side.<eos> Come on, we're going for a walk.<eos> - Pick up the pace, big guy.<eos> - "Big guy"?<eos> Do you not see this Hawaiian shirt I'm wearing?<eos> I reckon it makes me look like one of the Strokes. Ah.
That actually sounded kind of cheesy when you said it.<eos> She's so...<eos> comfortable with herself.<eos> - Why was I so threatened by her?<eos> - Maybe you were jealous?<eos> That's true.<eos> I could never live like her. - Why not?<eos> - Come on.<eos> You know what my life is like.<eos> It's pathetic.

That's how you get the ladies?<eos> No.<eos> Sitting is the new smoking.<eos> That'll kill Hotch, and you know that.<eos> Well, it's the same as last time, except this woman has light-brown hair.<eos> Looks like she threw up.<eos> Maybe it was nerves.<eos> She knew she was going to die.<eos> She had on a wedding ring.<eos> It's right over there. He must have tossed it.
Let's talk about you as a goddess.<eos> - Please let's not.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Put you in a warrior-princess costume.<eos> Fanboys would be all over that.<eos> I'm getting some coffee.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Thanks anyway.<eos> Why are you watching Clyde Ritter's assassination?<eos> The light in the ballroom, Sean... it's off course.
Or maybe Liz has a second phone.<eos> We need to find out everything we can about her.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> That's the living room, but that's different.<eos> There was a picture there... a print of Monet's "Water Lilies."<eos> 256 in the series.<eos> Now it's just a dust frame.<eos> It was removed recently.<eos> It was taken down for a reason.<eos> Whatever it was, someone didn't want us to see or know.
It's easy to change your name, not so easy to change who you are.<eos> Did you see that calendar in her kitchen?<eos> Soccer games, karate tournaments, date nights...<eos> It was packed.<eos> This is not a woman looking for one last score.<eos> Her family is her life now.<eos> You know what this means, don't you?<eos> 10 years, if we get caught.<eos> The print gave me away?<eos> Actually, it was taking it off the wall.

You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system... a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
Wait, you don't understand who you're screwing with.<eos> Who?<eos> A man with no gun and no backup?<eos> Maybe we keep our money and your diamonds.<eos> We don't renegotiate.<eos> Another fine Navy day.<eos> You must be Maksim.<eos> You said 50 cents on the dollar.<eos> That was before I saw the merchandise.<eos> You failed to mention it's from Africa.
Nolan Ross, you're under arrest.<eos> Nothing that's gonna keep me from making Grayson<eos> - pay for what he's done.<eos> - Jack, don't do it.<eos> Don't throw your life away because of the choices that I've made.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm Amanda Clarke.<eos> Fear...<eos> It's a fire that burns from birth in even the coldest heart.<eos> It motivates and paralyzes the best of us... Or is used as a weapon by the worst.
One day before its debut, and you're still missing the depth in my eyes.<eos> Arctic pools, Laila. Arctic pools.<eos> You know what?<eos> Uh... Give me a minute.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Finally achieving the immortality you've always hoped for.<eos> Oh, no, my legacy lies in the work I'm getting done.<eos> It's a springboard both for the state's rehabilitation and my ascension to the higher offices to which I'm destined.<eos> To that extent, I've been going over the specs of the party<eos> Ms. Thorne's been kind enough to throw in your mother's dormancy, and while security is acceptable for a typical Hamptons hobnob, it's sorely inadequate for a future presidential candidate, so we will be adding handheld metal detectors
Gave me an ultimatum.<eos> Well, that's heavy.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Have the wedding of the century.<eos> Take down Victoria once and for all.<eos> When's the big date?<eos> August 8th.<eos> A fitting end... To a path of revenge.<eos> Fear is the most primal of emotions.<eos> It can linger as a memory burned into one's mind of a parent taken too soon.
- I was just looking out for Boyd.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> You were just looking out for yourself, dad.<eos> Okay, this isn't about Clark and Wilson.<eos> This is about you wanting Boyd around your house more.<eos> Tucked that kid in for five years.<eos> Maybe I'm having a tough time letting that go.<eos> [Scoffs] I can't believe you just ganged up on me - in front of my dad like that!<eos> - Aw, come Kris.<eos> You would jump at the idea of switching schools if it came from anybody but your father.
"And its rider held a bow.<eos> "And his name was Death.<eos> "And then a voice like thunder said,<eos> 'Come and see.'"<eos> This tells of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.<eos> Come on.<eos> The Redcoats had just ambushed us in the Hudson Valley.<eos> And in a desperate hour, Washington called me to his tent.<eos> The revolution, he explained, wasn't merely a war for the future of our country.<eos> It would determine the fate of every man, woman and child on Earth.
Let us do our job.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Katrina?<eos> Forgive me, my love.<eos> This is the only way I could reach you.<eos> I've been trying to lead you.<eos> The gravestone.<eos> My body was never buried in that grave.<eos> It hides the true location of the Horseman's skull, guarded throughout time by one of my coven.
This is Aram.<eos> Your cases came yesterday.<eos> They're upstairs.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let's see what you have.<eos> Can I get you anything, sir?<eos> A drink, some food?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I need to change my shirt.<eos> It's stained.
Beltway 14 minutes after that, then heads north on 270 towards Germantown.<eos> Pulls into a truck stop.<eos> Three men hustle Carrie inside.<eos> The drone is now useless.<eos> Truck stop security cameras?<eos> Limited to gas pumps, cash registers and bathrooms.<eos> Nothing.<eos> What about the car?<eos> They never went back to it.<eos> It's still there six hours later.
Well, I wanted to talk about that, too.<eos> I'm sure you do.<eos> Because when that bomb went off, killing all those people, many of them my friends, my first thought was not revenge.<eos> It was...<eos> "Something has to change."<eos> You hit us, we hit you.<eos> It's always the same.<eos> And... how does my going back as your spy change any of that?<eos> For years, we toiled in back rooms, you and I.<eos> We toiled while shallower men held the stage, waiting for our time to come, gradually understanding it never would.

Maybe I'm anxious about getting married because I'm nervous about sleeping with you again.<eos> What if the first time was only exciting because it was the first time?<eos> What if we're not compatible that way?<eos> Maybe we should find out.<eos> Grace, come on, we're going to be compatible that way.<eos> We don't have to sleep with each other right now to know that.<eos> All right, well, all I'm saying is, we could.<eos> Did you find whatever you were looking for?<eos> Yeah, I just needed my lotion.<eos> It's hypo-allergenic.
No, his fall may have caused cracks in the temporal bone in his inner ear.<eos> Santi, I think that your music reflects bodily sounds that you are literally hearing in your head because of a thin or cracked ear bone.<eos> You've been hearing your blood pulse, your eyes moving in their sockets, maybe even the creak of your joints.<eos> Well, so much for inspiration.<eos> When we did the C.T. scan for the concussion, it didn't show this?<eos> A C.T. wouldn't pick it up, but there are hi-def scans that can confirm Divya's diagnosis.<eos> And a soft-tissue graft can repair the damage.<eos> Will my hearing be fully restored?<eos> Yes.<eos> It will.
I think she's threatened.<eos> Blythe Ballard is threatened by me.<eos> Okay, that's ridiculous!<eos> Sorry. I didn't mean to sound so emphatic.<eos> Just think about it.<eos> She's used to getting her own way all the time.<eos> She manipulates the council.<eos> She manipulated me into this whole signature-gathering time suck, but this isn't about me anymore.<eos> What this town needs is dissent, Paige.<eos> It needs an outside voice.

He threatened me here at French court.<eos> He wanted me to know that they tried to poison me at the convent.<eos> He's heard things about my reluctance to marry you.<eos> Then they're aware.<eos> That I don't have your country's protection here.<eos> You do. You do.<eos> There are dozens of English here, hundreds more camped on the coastline.<eos> I'm at your side.<eos> We'll prove to them our union is strong.<eos> But it isn't.
For the New Socialist Campaign, the authorities will be visiting us.<eos> Everyone must clean their home, inside and out.<eos> Also, a sacred yak belonging to Lahmo Tso has been stolen.<eos> There must be strangers around.<eos> We'll investigate it.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Wait!<eos> Come and sit here.<eos> - The motorbike's a good idea.<eos> - Yes, it's brand-new.
He was with the lifeguards.<eos> They might have made an announcement.<eos> - They gave him a ride.<eos> - I got lost.<eos> I'm naughty.<eos> Never do that again! Do you hear?<eos> You scared the life out of us.<eos> Shall we go?<eos> Look at the big wheel!<eos> It's so big!
I don't understand it.<eos> Do jellyfish breathe?<eos> Er, no.<eos> But it's alive.<eos> Yes, but it doesn't breathe. Like a fish.<eos> A fish doesn't breathe?<eos> Like an oyster.<eos> So, when it's washed up, it's dead?<eos> Yes.<eos> How can it sting you if it's dead?
I'm watching my dad try and figure out how to work the TV.<eos> There is no way he's gonna figure that out on his own.<eos> You should've seen me earlier when I was trying to teach him how to use the ice dispenser.<eos> You know, I started yelling at him and he was panicking, and I just...<eos> I felt really bad, so I started crying a lot, you know, and there was ice all over the pla... it was like the last ten minutes of Titanic in here.<eos> Because if he gets frustrated enough, maybe he'll realize he can't live on his own, and he'll go running back to my mom.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think he just opened the garage door.<eos> Uh, that closed it again.<eos> Uh, it's opening.
Wait.<eos> She kissed me back.<eos> Well, it's gone now.<eos> Hi.<eos> You kissed me back.<eos> What?<eos> Your lips moved just as much as mine, and your tongue was everywhere.<eos> My tongue was just hiding from your tongue.<eos> Really?<eos> It was hiding in my mouth?
Uh, do you have Life of Pi?<eos> No, but I have some home movies of me on a canoe with a big dog.<eos> People who have never seen a movie say it is a good movie.<eos> We can't afford Christmas.<eos> And when you can't afford Christmas, you've failed as a family.<eos> That's what all the big stores say.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> I'm so sorry to bother you, but my kids are exhausted and the town is sold out.<eos> Is there any chance you'd have a spare room for us?<eos> Well, there's a rec room off the kitchen, but sometimes it's there and sometimes it isn't.
You shouldn't get too close to anyone that might have been exposed, at least for a little while.<eos> Carl.<eos> All of you.<eos> Patrick was fine yesterday, and he died overnight.<eos> Two people died that quick?<eos> We'll have to separate everyone that's been exposed.<eos> That's everyone in that cell block.<eos> That's all of us. Maybe more.<eos> We know that this sickness can be lethal.<eos> We don't know how easily it spreads.
Uh, how y'all doin'?<eos> Chief Wiggum, how come every time there's a terrorist chatter in this town, you come to me?<eos> Lay off, Apu.<eos> When I look at people, I don't see colors.<eos> I just see crackpot religions.<eos> Chief, is there really a terrorist threat to Springfield?<eos> Yeah. I got a very important phone call.<eos> Yello?<eos> Is this line secure?<eos> Uh, it's a little jiggly but it'll hold.
The Ottomans sit on a sea of oil.<eos> If we do not secure those reserves for England and the West then soon, very soon, with the turn of the spigot, they will have the power to shut down Western industry, and when we are defenseless<eos> their hordes will rise up and crush us.<eos> But...<eos> If I may?<eos> Please.<eos> If what you say is true, then Mr. Grayson's energy scheme will utterly strip the Ottomans of their greatest weapon.<eos> With geomagnetic power, we'll have no need for oil.<eos> Grayson's technology is a dead end.<eos> A distraction, and if it continues, one that may prove deadly.
We need your help.<eos> You'd have me play Judas?<eos> To bring down a false messiah, yes, and in return, power and connections that would ensure the brightest of futures for you and Miss Murray.<eos> Join us, Mr. Harker.<eos> Help us to win this Holy War once and for all.<eos> You're not leaving already.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> The demonstration.<eos> Tell Harker I'll see him there.<eos> But it doesn't start for another hour, and Jonathan's not here, although he promised.
Is that actually possible?<eos> To poke around someone's brain to change the way they act?<eos> - Have you heard of Phineas Gage?<eos> - No. The American rail worker who had an iron rod thrust up through his skull and lived to tell about it.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - Lived, yes.<eos> But apparently he was a changed man. He became unreliable, rude, and altogether opposite of the person he was before the accident.<eos> And in our cases, the same area of both Mr. Fuller and Mr. Johnson's brains was specifically targeted.<eos> What does that part of the brain control?<eos> Phrenologists believe that it controls one's knowing faculties.
Second...<eos> How about this?<eos> - If you tell me...<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> I won't have you suspended...<eos> Without pay.<eos> Oh, that sounds great.<eos> Okay, the deal is if Amy gets more arrests,<eos> Jake has to give her his car.<eos> It's an old Mustang, and it's pretty sweet.
Seth was a lawyer.<eos> He provided legal counsel from time to time.<eos> 55 calls?<eos> Well, it makes sense, that you'd have a lawyer on speed dial.<eos> It's not every day that you meet a man who's been in prison for treason.<eos> Then released.<eos> Commutation of sentence has nothing to do with innocence.<eos> Need to know every place this car has been.<eos> How far back you need to go?<eos> Since it drove off the lot.
Don't worry about me, guys.<eos> I'm good.<eos> This way.<eos> - Wait, how did you...<eos> - I teleported.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> So you've decided to come home.<eos> Did you think he was gonna help you find your promised land?<eos> Is that it?<eos> It doesn't exist.

You and everyone you love.<eos> I'm coming for all of them.<eos> Hey, Scott, you okay?<eos> It's just books.<eos> You brought homework?<eos> Well, should I let you get back to it? Hell no.<eos> What's that?<eos> I have two of them, from a surgery I had to correct misshapen cartilage I was born with.<eos> I had a bar put in when I was 14.<eos> It stayed there for two years to support my sternum, so my heart and lungs wouldn't be crushed.
- What's wrong?<eos> Don't play dumb.<eos> You don't know that your boyfriend Manolo kidnapped my mother, married her at gunpoint, then threw her off a ship?<eos> Slow down.<eos> I know you're exaggerating and you're being hostile.<eos> If you want to run, I'd do it now.<eos> Because you're an accessory to murder.<eos> I will never, ever let this go.<eos> Manny wouldn't hurt a fly.<eos> Even if he thought it was rich?
Prostitution.<eos> Massage parlor.<eos> And you two pretty boys are bait.<eos> It's not my neck that's stiff.<eos> Um... Beaumont police.<eos> You are under arrest.<eos> Greg Carlyle owns the Lucky Lotus?<eos> You give me that list or you're gonna get back on the pole.<eos> The client list holds a lot of power.<eos> Make sure it's good and hidden.
Um... Beaumont police.<eos> You are under arrest.<eos> Greg Carlyle owns the Lucky Lotus?<eos> You give me that list or you're gonna get back on the pole.<eos> The client list holds a lot of power.<eos> Make sure it's good and hidden.<eos> Someone broke into my house.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> And the client list is safe, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, it's safe.
(chuckles) Are you listening?<eos> This is important.<eos> Yeah. Sorry. (phone vibrates)<eos> WILFRED: Ryan, who is this imposter?<eos> And why aren't you walking...<eos> Ooh, Wilfred, look.<eos> Do you see the squirrel on the grass? Ooh.<eos> I see the squirrel, bitch!<eos> (sighs) Oh, Dad, um, told me about the job offer.<eos> It sounds tailor-made for you. Yeah.
Smell what?<eos> The stench of death.<eos> It's over here.<eos> No, I don't sm...<eos> Whoa. I do smell something.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> It's a... a hot dog from 7-Eleven.<eos> It probably fell out of Gene's trash can.<eos> The death smell isn't coming from that.<eos> It's coming from that.
Hey, Jane!<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I am so tired.<eos> Between baking, accounting, and restocking,<eos> I worked 18 hours yesterday.<eos> Who knew owning a business would be so much work?<eos> You know, maybe you should hire more help.<eos> I can barely pay my bills.<eos> I just figured once the pakery was up and running, it would take care of itself, you know, like children, but the bigger it gets, the more attention it needs.
You need to stop before you say one more word.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll start searching for the intended parent agreement.<eos> They have to be filed with the court prior to IVF in all surrogacy arrangements.<eos> Good. Well, Amy's almost full term, so the agreement would've been filed 9 to 12 months ago.<eos> I'll keep you posted.<eos> As Pam's wedding planner, did you help her pick out her dress?<eos> Yes.<eos> As you can see, it complements her silhouette.
We were there about a day and the skin-eaters showed up.<eos> Killjoys, man.<eos> Jackin' it up for the whole world.<eos> I thought everybody was an asshole before this all went down.<eos> Now I love people.<eos> How did it happen?<eos> When they were coming in through the door,<eos> I tripped crawling out the other side.<eos> Pulled the glass out, but my shoulder... it still hurts like a bitch.<eos> It's dislocated.
Don't think about that now.<eos> Think about getting better.<eos> Positive thoughts.<eos> Positive vibes.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Daryl's got a group going out.<eos> They're getting medicine.<eos> Someplace Hershel knew about.<eos> That veterinary college?<eos> - It's far.
Estevez, seen here with his only known friend, hired hitman Sal Winnik, was known mostly for the long list of restaurants from which he's been banned.<eos> I'm not possessed by Martin Sheen.<eos> I'm possessed by his deadbeat brother Joe Estevez.<eos> Grub time!<eos> I'm getting really hungry.<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> Let's go eat a lot.<eos> Sweet cakes!<eos> Look, you want to make with the check?<eos> I'd like to pay for the food while it's still inside me.
Perhaps we don't have to conquer the whole world.<eos> And perhaps I need a new hat.<eos> Cut!<eos> Oh, hey, hey!<eos> How was it, Josh?<eos> That felt really great.<eos> Yeah, Joe. It was great.<eos> And, uh...<eos> I wonder if I could keep this nice green shirt.<eos> It's got spaghetti stains on it, so it's not any good to anybody anyway, right?
I have to go.<eos> Hey, we got to get back to the stadium.<eos> We split up.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Give me some good news.<eos> Turns out the semen you got wasn't contaminated.<eos> It just didn't come from Bodacious, the champion bull.
Not long after that, our biggest competitor, Medivolt, funded his clinical trial to the tune of $4 million.<eos> You think I'm some sort of corporate spy?<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Where are you getting this?<eos> Oh, wait, don't tell me...<eos> Arthur Singh.<eos> That guy.<eos> He's a complete egomaniac.<eos> He is blaming me because he'd never admit to a flaw in his design, but his sabotage theory doesn't even work.<eos> It seems pretty simple to me.
Which is why we're in this classroom and not in the jungle eating bananas.<eos> Every day, we dream about new technological advancements...<eos> Upgraded cellphones, faster computers, new medical techniques.<eos> Science seems to have unlimited potential. And many of these advancements really do make our lives better.<eos> But sometimes I think...<eos> In our striving for improvement, we lose sight of something just as important.<eos> Maybe we should try to accept what's already pretty good about ourselves.<eos> And not everything needs fixing.<eos> Mozart's music is 200 years old.<eos> It doesn't require any upgrade.

You need to get dressed.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> Could you turn around?<eos> Oh, now we're being modest.<eos> Yeah, sure. But, Lynly, listen.<eos> even if I unintentionally gave you the signals that you should come over to my houseboat and lay down naked on my bed, which I didn't, you could not have picked a worse day to do this because Lavon is currently counting on me<eos> to get BlueBell...<eos> What is taking so long?<eos> The zipper's stuck.<eos> It won't move.
That tool may be the last one in the box.<eos> Now, on to the subject of the wayward Magnolia...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Uh, George Tucker!<eos> Mother, you remember your almost-grandson-in-law George Tucker who abandoned Lemon at the altar.<eos> Y'all probably want to catch up.<eos> I'm sorry, son.<eos> Survival.<eos> Between you and me, I'm crashing this party.<eos> It is kind of boring.
We are playing Celebrity!<eos> We are playing Celebrity, and no one's leaving until we have fun!<eos> I'll make us some drinks.<eos> So, I had a list made of the 20 most eligible bachelors in Alabama.<eos> I dated seven of them.<eos> Uh, two of them were unbearable, four of them vanished as soon as they heard that I ran a bar.<eos> And, oh, one of them proposed to me before we even ordered our entrees, and then cried in his French onion soup when I refused.<eos> My reputation took a hit.<eos> Oh, another hit.<eos> It already had suffered when I got left at the altar for having an affair with the mayor.
Lies.<eos> We're drowning, we're drowning, we're drowning.<eos> Whole damn city's out there watching us die.<eos> You're over there looking out for some damn lint!<eos> It helps me focus.<eos> Fu-- do you not see, Frank?<eos> Do you not see the sun creeping up in the sky?<eos> Man, you rode that high horse.<eos> You did. You rode it as long as you could.<eos> Working this case so it goes cold.
Let it go or it will come apart in ways that you cannot even imagine.<eos> Did you kill detective wilden?<eos> I've been protecting you since it started.<eos> The police have our names on a board with arrows and graphs.<eos> And not just ours, my mom's up there.<eos> I know you were here the night that Wilden was killed.<eos> She called me, came over, said she need money.<eos> And what happened when you told her no?<eos> I keep a gun locked in my desk.<eos> It's missing.
What did you say to mom to make her change her mind about Europe?<eos> The only reason you want her to go so bad is so you could start boffing your teacher again.<eos> That was Mrs. Grunwaltz, our former house mother.<eos> Legend has it she was fired.<eos> Apparently you couldn't get anything past that bitch.<eos> Detective Wilden, he's dead.<eos> Hanna's worried that they're going to try to pin it on her mom.<eos> They are both going to need help.<eos> I keep a gun locked in my desk.<eos> It's missing.
You got me a skateboard?<eos> It's for me.<eos> Now get in the back.<eos> And while you're there, use this cream to massage the leather.<eos> To the tooth-whitening kiosk!<eos> I'm sorry, but does Kirk know how silly he looks?<eos> Look at me!<eos> I'm afraid of dying.<eos> Oh, Homie.<eos> I'm so glad you're happy with your life just the way it is.
It seems a bit funny to be named that.<eos> Mimi!<eos> Remember when Mom gave you a note from Leo?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Is it still here?<eos> No.<eos> I memorized it.<eos> What was on it?<eos> It was a part of David Eischers code, right?<eos> David called it the "key", but it is useless on its own.
You did Matt a favor.<eos> He called twice yesterday.<eos> Case closed!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I don't think I'm ever gonna get used to that.<eos> That's lunch!<eos> Or that.<eos> Where is your tie?<eos> The back of my chair...<eos> Where it will stay.
To survive until the end of winter.<eos> Those of you who remain until then will have 500,000 dollars to divide amongst yourselves.<eos> Do whatever you need to do to get there.<eos> The choice is yours.<eos> In this experiment, you'll be allowed to govern yourselves completely with no interference and no help.<eos> We will abandon you with a camera crew to document your adventure, but the world you know is gone-- slate wiped clean, and you will start a new civilization.<eos> - Are you ready to begin? - Yes.<eos> Okay. 2 miles due east... are the remains of a primitive settlement, an outpost where fur traders would stop to barter their wares.<eos> But one day in 1908, this settlement was found abandoned, fire still burning, food still cooking in pots, but its 14 inhabitants had mysteriously disappeared, never to be seen again.<eos> We've recreated this settlement exactly as it was 100 years earlier.
For 500 years, the Quaqua have protected this land, even after the white man stole it from us, raped and pillaged its natural resources, systematically destroyed it.<eos> That's the problem with you white people.<eos> You never learn, and you damn sure never listen.<eos> I'm sorry, did you say something?<eos> I said I didn't kill Lane.<eos> Well, I'll be damned.<eos> It's a river.<eos> Lane drew a line on a map that we thought was where he believed the shale line was.<eos> But according to this Quaqua Nation map, there used to be a river here.<eos> Still is a river there, it's just an underground one.
By listening when I taught you how to do it.<eos> Transfer the call to my line.<eos> Alim, are you still with me?<eos> Samirah?<eos> - Yes. - I'm still here.<eos> We're working with authorities, so hang in there and breathe.<eos> - All right. - Okay.<eos> He talked up the American auto industry, praised the president's convictions, and repeatedly criticized the Republican candidates by name, accusing them of being out to protect the privileged.<eos> Our philosophy, ours is one that values the workers and the success of a business.<eos> It values the middle class and the success of our economy.
Eric, you know...<eos> It's fine.<eos> It looks good.<eos> I thought you had a job interview in Olalla today.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> I mean, I thought I did.<eos> You know, they called just as I was getting ready to leave the house.<eos> They said they hired someone already, don't bother coming out.<eos> I mean, it's tough.<eos> Like I said, you know, the economy the way it is, there's so few jobs in the area.
But where am I supposed to stay when I'm not at home with them?<eos> That's for you to figure out.<eos> Perhaps you could share the apartment in Tacoma.<eos> Rosie could stay there for the two weeks that you're here with the kids here.<eos> Your honor...<eos> I'm sorry,<eos> I really don't want to share my apartment with her...<eos> And I don't want to leave my house...<eos> My decision isn't about the two of you.<eos> It's about your children.
Look, I know it's old-fashioned, but I just always thought that my first time would be more meaningful if I waited for the perfect man.<eos> So I hope you're cool with waiting.<eos> Yeah. Of course I'm cool with waiting.<eos> I love waiting.<eos> I'm a master waiter.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey!<eos> How was the big date?<eos> Let me guess how long you held out.<eos> Was the car still moving or did you wait till it parked?
So you can't actually prove you were at home that night?<eos> I don't have to.<eos> I think it's your job to prove I wasn't.<eos> He's incredibly smart and he knows how the system works.<eos> As things stand, Peter Hopkins will be sent to prison and Tyrus will get away with murdering that young woman. OK.<eos> There's something else.<eos> If Judge Hopkins is convicted, and he will be, and the media portray him as the murderer of a young girl, it will open the floodgates.<eos> Every case he's prosecuted will be put under a microscope, there will be a raft of appeals.<eos> Murderers could be released to kill again.<eos> Now we have a press injunction in place, but it's likely to be overturned any day.
And he would have thought that before.<eos> Please do not stop me from going back to that board.<eos> Louis, you offered to do this.<eos> You're not doing this to Harvey.<eos> You're doing this for your client,<eos> Hessington Oil.<eos> Ava Hessington is Hessington Oil.<eos> - Not anymore. - Jessica.<eos> Enough.<eos> This conversation did happen, and it's over.
Yeah, dream come true for any lawyer.<eos> I don't have dreams.<eos> I have goals.<eos> Now it's on to the next one.<eos> When did you find out?<eos> Last night.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I shouldn't have to.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Meaning your focus hasn't been where it usually is.
She must have extended the force field. No wonder!<eos> No wonder she's late, dragging you around.<eos> You tricked me.<eos> I saved you!<eos> You didn't even say goodbye!<eos> I am furious with you!<eos> Well, I am not even talking to you!<eos> Ah, Doctor, fixing toys and fighting monsters.<eos> The turkey isn't done yet.<eos> Is it still asking the question?

- There you go.<eos> Satisfactory?<eos> Where are the pink ones?<eos> E-numbers.<eos> You're hyper enough as it is.<eos> So this is sweet.<eos> Middle of a siege and you two have little chats?<eos> She's right.<eos> This situation cannot continue.<eos> It can't end, either.
That's right, isn't it?<eos> OK, let's go.<eos> My first sex tape.<eos> Is it legal to film the staff?<eos> If they're warned by their employers.<eos> That's the case here.<eos> My USB stick.<eos> I've been looking for it everywhere.<eos> That's nice, but you could have posted it to me.<eos> We analysed it. It has a virus.
Thank you.<eos> AzizaAfgala.<eos> "Tea, talk, more tea, more talk.<eos> ♪Villagelife."<eos> If I ask nicely, you think your translator could take longer?<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Sorry about this.<eos> Hey, Zane, Sloan.<eos> What's with your chair?<eos> It was squeaky and now he's fixed it.
So he knew you were off before you got the flu.<eos> And it turns out the guy's Nina Howard's book agent.<eos> You told Nina's book agent?<eos> I didn't know he was her agent at the time.<eos> I knew he was an agent, but it wasn't until I Googled him--<eos> - Why'd you Google him?<eos> - You know, after drinks.<eos> - You had drinks?<eos> - This part doesn't matter.<eos> - It matters to me a little.
She's fucking crazy, even for me.<eos> This is an open channel, guys.<eos> Sorry.<eos> What about Richmond?<eos> Still open.<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> SCOTT: Two guys packing either side of us, Mikey.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Check the case.<eos> It's empty.
With my sister too.<eos> And your parents... They still live in Chechnya?<eos> In Chechnya, it was the war.<eos> One day, my father... left the house.<eos> He went to work. He didn't come back.<eos> Ever.<eos> He didn't come back? He died?<eos> After, a long time after, there was a lot of rain.<eos> And the river... got bigger.<eos> It came into the city. Everywhere.
How did you know? Cat's-paw causes a rash on the skin<eos> You've studied medicine<eos> I've been allergic to cat's-paw since I was young<eos> It always gives me a rash<eos> It goes away soon enough<eos> How did you get the keys?<eos> I stole them from the guard<eos> You know...<eos> That powder of yours works very well<eos> It melts in the mouth
Yes.<eos> But at 7:14 A.M., you called a phone number in the Cayman Islands that acts as a firewall so that forwarded calls cannot be traced.<eos> Your Honor, at this time, we ask for an immediate dismissal of all charges against professor Kane.<eos> The government agrees and asks that this witness be placed under arrest.<eos> So ordered.<eos> Your Honor, we're asking you to grant my client access to her embryos under California Probate Code section 249.5, which governs the posthumous use of a father's genetic material.<eos> The code is only relevant to posthumously conceived children if they were conceived within the two years of the father's death.<eos> And since Craig Bailey died two years and two weeks ago, the statute has no bearing.<eos> Nice try.<eos> But if you look at the statute, it actually says that a baby must be in utero within two years of the date of issuance of a death certificate.
Yes.<eos> Well done.<eos> You know, Henry, I've, uh...<eos> I've been riding trains all across this country for about the past three years, looking for the meaning of life.<eos> It was a total waste of time.<eos> Life... Is meaningless...<eos> Full of sound and fury but signifying nothing.<eos> Bill Shakespeare understood that, but it was Bill Norquist who really opened my eyes.<eos> I mean, this guy shows up to me out of nowhere with a gun and a simple proposition... kill my wife for $2,000.<eos> He showed me that, while life may not have any meaning, it certainly has value.
Just keep your mouth shut and let me do the talking.<eos> I know what I'm doing. Sorry, sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> Frank Reynolds, Paddy's Pub.<eos> These are my associates.<eos> Stand up, show him some respect.<eos> I stand for no one.<eos> Please, it's not necessary.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> You heard the man-- sit down.<eos> But I don't want to stand through an entire meeting 'cause I don't know how long it's gonna last, so I'll sit down.
Pretty sweet.<eos> Tell me, if you're so good, why are you looking for a job?<eos> A job?<eos> I had three patents by the time I was 30.<eos> I don't need a job.<eos> I need protection.<eos> We had a close call in San Francisco.<eos> We're not taking any chances.<eos> From what we hear, your security is top-notch.<eos> It is.
Security can't escort us down eight floors every time he needs a cigarette.<eos> And you don't want to see him in withdrawal.<eos> Cody, come on.<eos> Cody.<eos> Okay, but make it quick.<eos> You have work to do.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Okay, Fiona, the wire should be about a foot to your left.<eos> As a rule, the faster a drill turns, the louder it is.
Life in a CIA prison is still better than death face-down in the middle of some God-forsaken marina on some cockamamie mission that-- [cell phone rings]<eos> Don't get smug.<eos> [Beeps]<eos> Finley here.<eos> Senor Finley, this is Marco Cabral.<eos> How nice to hear from you, Mr. Cabral.<eos> How are you this lovely afternoon?<eos> Circumstances have changed.<eos> Your offer-- is it still on the table?<eos> Why, yes it is, indeed.
Unfortunately, that grand being was more comfortable with you as a slave, and you still aren't allowed to elect your fair hero.<eos> Well, Lincoln is a champion of education, land for the poor, and, I believe, in the end, true emancipation.<eos> We will have the right to vote.<eos> Well, I don't trust a white man's good intentions, until they're gone so far, he can't undo 'em.<eos> Are we certain that they celebrating'?<eos> With the Irish, sometimes celebration and riot are notes of the same song.<eos> "With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.<eos> On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war...<eos> Insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war...<eos> Seeking to dissolve the union... neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained... each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and less astounding."
I'm fine.<eos> Guys?<eos> - Guys?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Where's the beacon?<eos> - What?<eos> Where's the beacon?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Do you see it?<eos> Do you remember where it was?
- I thought the beacon should be here.<eos> I mean...<eos> The way we came from, I thought... this was the direction the beacon should have been in.<eos> Should be right here.<eos> But why did you think the beacon was in this direction?<eos> Basing it on what?<eos> What were you basing it on?<eos> - Why are we just walking around aimlessly? - I'm basing it on... from the fire that we came from, that we set up for your fucking foot.<eos> We were walking in that direction, and I thought the beacon would be right here.<eos> It's not here.
- What else is in there?<eos> - Let's just leave.<eos> Nothing.<eos> - What's in there?<eos> - Let's leave.<eos> - What else did you see?<eos> (Sabina) We have to try again.<eos> That's our only chance.<eos> If we don't find a gun, we have zero chances.<eos> Even if it's out there, how we gonna go find it in the woods now, huh?
(Sabina) It has to.<eos> (Miljan) They are watching us.<eos> Oh, my God. They're so close.<eos> Bro, if you got nothing constructive to say, shut the hell up.<eos> - (Miljan) I'm not afraid of you, Neeko.<eos> - Seriously. I'm only afraid of what's out there.<eos> Sabina, you got it secure? Huh?<eos> (Daniel) Sam, I didn't mention it, but the radio's in the other building, so... if we get the power going in here, that's not gonna help us.<eos> (Sam) All right, well, we just bring it over, we'll hook it up.<eos> (Daniel) It's from World War II.
I told her I-I know the shortcut to come to that place so we can get a gun, because she seemed very serious about this gun situation.<eos> She wanted it.<eos> I didn't come here to get laid, but if that happens on the way... awesome.<eos> - You find it? - Hey.<eos> Did you find it?<eos> Did you?<eos> You don't have it?<eos> No. I-I didn't find it.<eos> Why are you looking up?<eos> You think it's up?
Watch out now, guys.<eos> Be careful. Be careful, Sam.<eos> To me, I just see food.<eos> A snake is protein. They say it tastes like chicken.<eos> So my intention is to cut its head off, gut it, we cook it, cook it good, then we eat it.<eos> I could see the snake was over something metallic, you know?<eos> And when I looked again, it was-- it was a small little key.<eos> That's why they put it in there, too.<eos> Close to the snake was a key.<eos> It clicks in my mind, because I immediately knew what it was for.
My girlfriend--<eos> We were just walking down the street at night.<eos> We got jumped by three men.<eos> And, uh, one of the guys pushed me.<eos> And in my head, all I heard was "Run."<eos> She'd been stabbed six times.<eos> I take blame for it every day.<eos> I just need to prove it to Irene and to myself that I'm worthy, that I'm good.<eos> Life doesn't stop for you.<eos> It doesn't wait to give you a break.
You stole all this from the producers?<eos> Yep. Pretty sneaky.<eos> What's this?<eos> The tape.<eos> I found a camera in the woods.<eos> I just took the tape.<eos> Why?<eos> They told me that the camera that was filming me and Johnny got lost in the woods.<eos> Do you know what's on it?<eos> - Where the hell is it?
Your fingerprints are all over the handle.<eos> That's because I borrowed it from the office.<eos> I'm a realtor.<eos> I used it to plant a "for sale" sign the other day.<eos> Where?<eos> New listing, not far from our house.<eos> Why is that important?<eos> 'Cause the dirt on the blade of this shovel matches the dirt in your daughter's grave.<eos> And the dirt on these shoes of yours...<eos> It also matches the dirt from your daughter's grave.

You were fighting out of your weight class.<eos> The clinic's only 100 feet behind us.<eos> We're awfully close.<eos> Well, don't worry.<eos> I got eyes in the front and in the back.<eos> Huh.<eos> Rearview Cam.<eos> Super-sweet, dude.<eos> The clinic has a rotating I.P. address for security purposes.<eos> Every three minutes, it changes to block people like us trying to hack into the system.
Look what I found.<eos> Yo... Little Simba returning to pride rock.<eos> Yo, what's up, bro?<eos> How you doing? [Grunts] Good to have you back, man.<eos> Good to be back.<eos> You know, guys, there's not a set of faces in the world that make me as happy as these.<eos> [Clears throat] Five years ago...<eos> I had poison pumped into my veins.<eos> I'll tell you what... you think you're strong, but that drug will turn you into its bitch so fast.<eos> It'll take your sleep.

I mean, they're freaks, the lot of them.<eos> Total...<eos> Do I have some sort of sign on my head saying "sucker" or something?<eos> No, honestly. Do I?<eos> No, you don't!<eos> No.<eos> The best one, the guy brought his pet spider in a jar with him.<eos> No!<eos> Yeah, I am serious!<eos> He said it was poorly and he couldn't leave it at home on its own.

I think that my soul knew something that my body and my mind didn't know yet.<eos> It knew that our hands were meant to hold each other, fearlessly and forever.
It's the only way yours truly's gonna make it to this Sunday's game against the Hawks.<eos> So, any news on the island of Dr. Strauss?<eos> IGF1.<eos> Sounds like a winning bingo number.<eos> Insulin-like growth factor 1, a hormone.<eos> It has anabolic effects in adults.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I failed Greek and never took "geek," so try English.<eos> Your body makes this stuff naturally.<eos> But when a synthetic form is injected, it promotes growth and healing unlike anything the body itself is capable of.
The radio's still up, right?<eos> Divert everyone before we lose the whole system.<eos> So you're the MP?<eos> What'd she threaten you with to bring you in?<eos> Oh, I volunteered.<eos> I've been waiting for the Major to start up her team.<eos> You're a messed-up guy.<eos> How can you control this with the domination going on?<eos> This antique has some special specifications.<eos> It's in a whole different class from your friend's old clunker there!
Well, I came, I saw, I didn't exactly conquer.<eos> But no one spat on me. Right?<eos> Bonus.<eos> Do you wanna leave?<eos> Let's go get some food.<eos> Actually, I signed us up to work at Rico's mathlete booth.<eos> And I thought maybe we could go to the formal tonight.<eos> Jo.<eos> You wanna come tonight?<eos> Don't say no right away, but I saw a dress a few booths down and I think it would look great on you.
All right.<eos> One steering wheel for a 1970 Lincoln Continental Mark III.<eos> Thank you...<eos> Arnold.<eos> My pleash.<eos> Now, if you will just fill out these entry-log forms here... And these FD-92s.<eos> All three stacks.<eos> Right.<eos> If you want to know who set you up, you're gonna have to go back to the original evidence.<eos> Now, it's in a box locked in the FBI headquarters.
Edgar?<eos> Hey, we might be out for a little while.<eos> A little while...<eos> A figure of speech meaning a few hours at most.<eos> Edgar, I need you to find somebody for me...<eos> Somebody important.<eos> A whistleblower.<eos> Edgar?<eos> Can you bring me my loofah?<eos> It's on the desk!
What do you think, Agent Rigby?<eos> Where's the gun, Arnold?<eos> All you've got is me trying to climb through a ceiling tile...<eos> Agent Rigby.<eos> Any luck finding the gun?<eos> Agents are still searching the floor, but so far, nothing.<eos> You get anything out of Arnold?<eos> Nothing to write home about.<eos> That gun did not walk out of here.<eos> What if it did?
The only reason prom tickets aren't sold out yet is because everybody thinks<eos> "Barack O-prom-a"<eos> - is a lame theme. - [Laughter]<eos> Miss Kaplan, this is not a debate.<eos> Mr. Rosati, don't respond to that.<eos> This is a forum where people can just speak--<eos> Please.<eos> If it wasn't for me, that water fountain outside the cafeteria would have never been fixed.<eos> No one cares about that drinking fountain.<eos> With my soda machine initiative, it will be totally obsolete.
That's a pretty nice saddle for a wild horse.<eos> So you figure he was riding the horse and he got shot?<eos> Gunshot goes off, spooks the horse, he runs. Victim falls off, gets tangled in the ropes?<eos> That knot's a bowline.<eos> Someone tied him to the saddle.<eos> Why shoot somebody and then tie him to a horse?<eos> It seems like overkill.<eos> Murderer probably wanted to get rid of the body.<eos> That's where the trail ends.<eos> Let's see where it started.
Yeah, I could use a little more closet space.<eos> Mine is full of toys.<eos> Yeah, expensive ones.<eos> That tablet is your master control.<eos> The Chen's apartment is laid out basically just like yours.<eos> The wireless low frequency sensors we placed should pick up most of the vocals from next door, and we were able to put a camera above the Chens' parking space, so at least you'll be able to tell<eos> when they're pulling in and out.<eos> How is the rest of the place? Oh, you know.<eos> Typical agency rental. Yeah.<eos> I picked it, so I kind of know how awesome it is.
The Chens' package wasn't recovered.<eos> Joan has been briefed on everything.<eos> She is working from home.<eos> What did Henry do?<eos> I think you should come back home now, Arthur.<eos> You were right.<eos> The minute we thought we had it under control--<eos> We did have it under control.<eos> I still can't understand how that safe house was compromised.<eos> But it was.
- that was pretty fast.<eos> - A Swinger?<eos> - With the flower over the "i" in the logo?<eos> - Yeah, that's right.<eos> I'd forgotten.<eos> Aw, I loved that car.<eos> Okay, boss, if we're gonna work together on this case, there's something you got to understand:<eos> The Ferrari 458 is perhaps the highest achievement<eos> - of automotive engineering known to man.<eos> - I noticed it didn't have, like, a cup holder for the Super Big Chug from Stop Fill.
As a matter of fact, I was just getting to that.<eos> Our vic's prints aren't in the system, but it turns out the car was involved in a chase last night.<eos> Simple traffic stop...<eos> ran through the signal, then took off.<eos> So, what, some...<eos> - rich kid on a joyride?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> DMV confirms our Swiss guy bought it this week.<eos> That's why there are no plates...<eos> It's still too new.
What does he want with anti-matter?<eos> And try not to say it in 'nerd'.<eos> Ok, the simple version?<eos> He plans on becoming the richest man on Earth with what could be the greatest, if not the only, real alternative to fossil fuels.<eos> Assume it's not that.<eos> Think nefarious.<eos> Also, underhanded, amoral, and greedy.<eos> Are we still talking about Escher?<eos> Ok, theoretically, he could develop this technology to power the time travel device.<eos> If it ever gets whole again, the sky's the limit.
An hour.<eos> With this interface, it looks like I can trigger the device to create that moment in time.<eos> You're saying I can go home.<eos> Once I figure it out completely, yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You wanted me to come alone and look something over?<eos> What's up?<eos> Thought you'd appreciate the discretion.<eos> Over an abandoned car?<eos> Who's is it?
Were you the one who photocopied these financial statements?<eos> this is what they gave me.<eos> Did you see the original?<eos> I didn't.<eos> Window dressing...<eos> That can't be.<eos> that 500-million yen loan...<eos> Let's go.<eos> Window dressing refers to the manipulation by a company of its financial statements to improve the appearance of its performance or liquidity.<eos> or mislead the bank in order to borrow money it has no way of paying back.
I almost killed my wife!<eos> I almost...<eos> My name is Inigo Montoya!"<eos> "You killed my father."<eos> "Prepare to die!" "Prepare to die""<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> I loved that dress you cut in half.<eos> It was the perfect combination of slutty and classy.<eos> Well, what about your backup dress?<eos> Oh, it's just classy, Ted!
Bro!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - "Bro"?<eos> Man, I was on my way to a barbecue.<eos> Brought you something for your special day.<eos> Hey, little man, you being good?<eos> You got him a Rolex?<eos> No.<eos> Got a guy, got me a good deal.<eos> Looks real, don't it?
Ah!<eos> Speak of the devil!<eos> Devil?<eos> That's a bit unfair.<eos> All's well in Kat Land?<eos> See ya.<eos> I'm the driver of my own destiny.<eos> I'm in the express lane to fulfilment.<eos> We dance 60 hours a week.<eos> If this is the express lane, it's seriously congested.
You know, I reviewed your trust expenditures, and recently, you spent $56,000 on a first-class family vacation to the Bahamas.<eos> Now, that sounds like "pissing" to me.<eos> I'm the trustee.<eos> I control the expenses... end of story.<eos> Bill, mom and dad wouldn't have given you all the control<eos> - if they could see me today.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Do you see, Jane?<eos> Every bit of my life is controlled by this trust, even this antique watch from our mother.<eos> It's worth $20,000, which could help pay for the work at shelter house, but I can't sell it because, under the trust, I am bound to pass it down to my firstborn daughter on her 18th birthday.
Church?<eos> Nana? Hoo!<eos> I have fallen and I can't get up.<eos> Phil? I'm gonna need a minute.<eos> I think I know what's wrong.<eos> No, no, nothing's wrong.<eos> Please forgive me, Phil.<eos> I nearly corrupted you and took away your virginity.<eos> Take it!<eos> It's yours!
What do you mean "was"?<eos> "Seth was one of them"?<eos> He attacked Annie two days ago.<eos> She had to act in self-defense.<eos> I'm sorry, Joan.<eos> Where's the body?<eos> We don't know.<eos> Somewhere in the Potomac.<eos> Where did the attack happen?<eos> It started at Seth's place.
Keep your voice down.<eos> You told me I couldn't read her in, but the second your son is involved, you turn right around and tell her yourself.<eos> What exactly are you objecting to?<eos> That you weren't the one delivering the brief?<eos> You compromised my operative's trust in me.<eos> Oh, Annie understands the meaning of "need to know."<eos> I am her handler, Arthur.<eos> Trust between us is paramount.<eos> You are her boyfriend, and trust between you is paramount.<eos> Yes, I am, and, yes, it is.
Sorry, I'm late.<eos> I got stuck in Thousand Oaks dropping off some drug samples to a clinic.<eos> How come the clinics need samples?<eos> Because that's how they get the people addicted...<eos> I mean, familiar with the products.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I've got to stop using the no-no words.<eos> Lacey, we have two rules here.<eos> One, if you're going to be late, you have to call.<eos> And two, if you're going to wear a skirt, it has to cover at least some of your thigh.
I can wait.<eos> Don't touch them pistols or draw a breath unless you want an arrow through your throat.<eos> Tell 'em we came to trade.<eos> This is Red Bear.<eos> He wants your horse.<eos> I need my horse.<eos> Well, the trouble is I owe him a horse.<eos> Well, give him your horse.<eos> He likes yours better.<eos> This buckskin that he wears, it holds the ashes of his eldest son who was killed by the cavalry.
He said that people like us, sometimes we need a vacation.<eos> You know, from all the stuff in our heads.<eos> You more than anyone, because you were always the best of us.<eos> You admit it.<eos> So you want to know what the secret is?<eos> Adrenaline.<eos> We crave it.<eos> But not for the rush, not for the high.<eos> That's for other people.<eos> We crave it for the rest it gives us.
Already said.<eos> John. Detective Stahl needs to talk to us.<eos> Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> His vitals suggest that he is lying.<eos> Yup. Or he doesn't like you very much.<eos> Add him to the list of kids and cats.<eos> We got a hit for the silver sedan.<eos> The one that kidnapped Kristen Haseman in the parking garage.<eos> We picked it up on a plate scanner.<eos> Dorian, watch the sedan as it goes past the scanner.
- Yes.<eos> She died of vagitosis.<eos> It's kind of like bad breath, but the vagina.<eos> It wasn't the main cause, but...<eos> - It didn't help.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> Do you like this chair?<eos> That is pretty cool.<eos> It's only $25.
What is it?<eos> I can't tell you.<eos> It's so secret...<eos> I have to go behind that house so no one can see me do it.<eos> - Hey, no peeking! - Sorry.<eos> After "x"ing and un-"x"ing his arms,<eos> A wave of fire formed in space...<eos> Wave-of-Fire Secret Attack!<eos> ...And engulfed the entire earth.<eos> And it would only burn the bad guys.
How much are you going to pay me?<eos> Uh, I can pay you $15.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Flute Cop's takingmeto Hawaii.<eos> - Isn't he romantic?<eos> - How would I know?<eos> I mean, can you think of a better place to go on vacation?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Uh, so the baby food is in the fridge and the fresh diapers are in the dresser.<eos> Oh, and don't mess with Uni-Baby's horn, um, as it holds great power.
- Isn't he romantic?<eos> - How would I know?<eos> I mean, can you think of a better place to go on vacation?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Uh, so the baby food is in the fridge and the fresh diapers are in the dresser.<eos> Oh, and don't mess with Uni-Baby's horn, um, as it holds great power.<eos> - Okay, see you in a couple days.<eos> - Okay, see you later.<eos> Bye-bye, little Uni-Baby.<eos> Mommy wuv you. And don't mess with Uni-Baby's horn. It holds great power.
My brother seeks to manipulate others to procure my release, but I have my own plan.<eos> If this witch proves to be an enemy, I will stop her by whatever means necessary.<eos> You're the one they call honorable.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's what they call me, and yet I followed my brother here to New Orleans to engage in a war.<eos> So I ask you, does that sound honorable to you?<eos> You don't look well.<eos> Well, only this morning, I had a mystical dagger embedded in my chest.<eos> So I'd say I'm holding myself together quite well.<eos> Davina, I believe that you and I have the power to end a war between witches and vampires before it truly begins, I by keeping my brother in line, you by behaving as your true self, not some tool for Marcel or the witches.
Ha ha ha!<eos> Yah!<eos> It's sad, really.<eos> I thought I made you better.<eos> Turns out, you're quite the disappointment.<eos> Yaah!<eos> I guess I'm another one of your failures, like how you failed at making hybrids, how you failed your family.<eos> Now it looks like you're even gonna fail your own kid.<eos> And thus ends your tedious, little life.<eos> At least it was brief.
It's just-- it's just a fact of life right now.<eos> You know, sometimes, Michael, people get used to the wrong things.<eos> I can't afford to do that.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I've got Charlie.<eos> Just let it go.<eos> I can't do that anymore, Michael.<eos> You do whatever it is you have to do.<eos> And I will do whatever I have to do.<eos> Some people say that democracy is a Western idea, that it is incompatible with the Middle Eastern way of life.
According to senior campaign officials I've been speaking to all day...<eos> - It's not from you? - Mm-mm.<eos> ...was the high African-American turnout.<eos> And that's a pattern they said they've been seeing in a number of states today.<eos> But, of course, the night is early and we'll have much more later.<eos> - Will?<eos> - Thank you, Suzannah Marquez.<eos> - We'll be hearing more from you as the night moves on.<eos> - Battleground update.<eos> Checking in with our other battleground states-- in Florida with 84% of the vote in, the race is as close as it gets with the president holding a 50-49 lead.
Did you see it explode?<eos> No, but my dashboard camera caught it.<eos> You want to see this.<eos> Here we go.<eos> See that thing right there?<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Run that again. Okay.<eos> There's a light moving parallel to the ground right behind the car.<eos> Is that something flying there?<eos> Looks like it hits the car right before it explodes.
Other than the fact that it was disbanded 70 years ago, not much.<eos> There is somebody who could tell us more about them, but, uh...<eos> But what?<eos> Chin, who is it?<eos> Okay, don't say I didn't warn you.<eos> All right, a couple of ground rules.<eos> Don't mention that we're law enforcement.<eos> In fact, we should hide our badges.<eos> What about my gun?<eos> Uh, that should be fine as long as it stays holstered.
But legend has it, the League smuggled them out somehow.<eos> Is there any chance they could have been smuggled onto Oahu?<eos> That's what I always believed.<eos> But, to this day, the rings have never been found.<eos> But I bet this is the key to finding them.<eos> So this is all about getting their hands on these rings, and the Van Horns were just in the way.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay, uh, let's say<eos> I'm buying all of this, which I am not.<eos> Um, if that scrimshaw is a key, what does it open?
An empty table.<eos> Well, I, uh, I bought the extra large container...<eos> You bought it without consulting me?<eos> I'm on a deadline, Evan.<eos> Right. But, uh, when you're done...<eos> Jeremiah.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm going to clean this entire kitchen from top to bottom.<eos> It is going to look exactly as you left it, even better.
He doesn't care.<eos> I told Mr. Queen that this city's problems cannot be solved with his money; that he needed to stand up and be counted as someone who cares.<eos> So where is he now?<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> We got a Hood sighting, heading down Lemire Avenue.<eos> Let's go!<eos> I don't know where Oliver Queen is.<eos> All I know is that he isn't here.<eos> This city is dying.<eos> And it needs someone to stand up and breathe new hope into it.
Stay where you are.<eos> It's better to keep your leg elevated.<eos> We'll need something for traction.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'll go take a look.<eos> Ooh. Molly!<eos> No, it's... it's fine.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Can't you listen to Hank?<eos> It's fine. It's gonna be elevated, okay?
I didn't do anything!<eos> Exactly.<eos> See, her ex-boyfriend found her three times-- three times, using your Lifetrace.<eos> And every time he found her, we asked the company to take her information down, and they didn't do it, and so he found her again, and again, until the last time when he killed her.<eos> All because you and your company didn't do anything.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Listen to me, Stu.<eos> You do this, and your life... it's over.<eos> It's already over.
A trainer never reveals his secrets.<eos> Especially not to the competition.<eos> Despite my attire I assure you I am here on behalf of the police, not the competition.<eos> - Cocaine?<eos> Strychnine?<eos> - My potion is nothing more than a mixture of fruit and herbs.<eos> Room temperature, never give the stomach something cold<eos> - before a race.<eos> - Potion?<eos> Well, some people say it has magical qualities.
- (Brackenreid):<eos> Dr. Harwick was right, this is very complicated.<eos> I've prepared this chart to help explain everything.<eos> I've determined Joe Fenton had type A blood.<eos> If he had been injected with type A or C, he would have been fine.<eos> Only type B could have killed him.<eos> So, Joe Fenton was injected with someone else's type B blood?<eos> - That's right, Detective.<eos> - Very good work, Doctor.<eos> We now have a murder weapon, we just need to find out who it belonged to.
Fancy that.<eos> Like you said, I've been busy.<eos> So has Kensi.<eos> For the past few weeks.<eos> Without a partner.<eos> I'm gonna need a decision soon.<eos> Especially if I need to find a replacement.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll leave you to your storm.<eos> Hopefully it'll pass without too much damage.
Probably not.<eos> Guys, guys, guys!<eos> Try it again.<eos> We've been rehearsing all the livelong day!<eos> We're getting tired.<eos> Fine. We'll skip to my big impressive flying entrance.<eos> So you've done the do-si-do to the left, then the right, and there's the hoop.<eos> Then I come in... (thud)<eos> We'll just (sigh) try that part again.<eos> (grunts) I liked our routine the way it was!
Not without YOU, Scootaloo.<eos> What's gotten into you, Scootaloo?<eos> I didn't want to ruin their chance to win just because I couldn't fly.<eos> And who said you had to?<eos> But flying's what Pegasus ponies are supposed to do!<eos> YOU flew when you carried the flag in the Games.<eos> But that was me!<eos> You are you!<eos> And it just doesn't matter if you can fly or not!<eos> Your routine was amazing 'cause it represented exactly what makes Ponyville special.
Power Ponies!<eos> (evil cackle) How kind of you to join us.<eos> Huh?<eos> (evil cackle)<eos> Did she just call us "Power Ponies"?<eos> You're the... the superheroes from my comic book.<eos> It somehow zapped us all in here.<eos> So somepony zap us back out.<eos> My comic book...<eos> It said the way to get back to where we started was to defeat the Mane-iac.
What party is that?<eos> Uh, The Everypony Come To The Scary Old Castle And Hide From Each Other While I Play The Organ Party.<eos> Duh!<eos> I swear this is going right back where I found it just as soon as I've returned it to its former glory.<eos> Now don't go running off again.<eos> Ooh. I can't believe I was so frightened.<eos> I guess I let my imagination get the best of me.<eos> I think we all did.<eos> I always let my imagination run away from me.<eos> Then it comes back with cake.
- from this man who was obsessed with it.<eos> - Did you get his name?<eos> No, but he said he was really bad news.<eos> Maybe he was working with Sandra.<eos> - How long did you knew her?<eos> - About a month.<eos> And I must say, she didn't seem like a con artist.<eos> The good ones usually don't.<eos> But my connection with her was real.<eos> At least it felt real.
- I rarely understand her.<eos> - Few do, yeah.<eos> - So, Joe, I've got a proposition for you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> How about we go halfsies on this vintage pinball machine I found on eBay?<eos> You've been browsing the Internet for antiques?<eos> What, did you already go through all the porn?<eos> No, this is actually really cool.<eos> I played the same pinball machine in Andrew's garage when I moved the nightstand in there.<eos> It's in his garage?
That's... that's fantastic.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> I have to go tell your aunt!<eos> She's... Going to be so happy!<eos> Something's going on in this house.<eos> Hey, your problem is solved.<eos> Oh, good, did you bring vodka?<eos> Because this wine is wussing out on the job.<eos> No no, I know where the tape is.<eos> It's in the jerk's garage.
- So?<eos> - That's it.<eos> You can't film more than 11 minutes, no matter what.<eos> I don't get it, a movie has 90 minutes, maybe more.<eos> A movie yes. But no part of it can last more than 11.<eos> OK... And?<eos> And this limit determined a way of creating cinema.<eos> A way of seeing the world, or rather, thinking of the world.<eos> And?<eos> And with digital, the limit is much greater. One hour. And it'll keep increasing, infinitely.
- Can I help you?<eos> - Where is the bar?<eos> - It's written there.<eos> I saw the footage from yesterday, and it's not right.<eos> - Tomorrow we'll reshoot it.<eos> - I know.<eos> Liviu called and told me.<eos> I felt I wasn't doing it right.<eos> It's not about the acting.<eos> It's about the camera position, it's always on you.
His old lady got some connections with Frank Agnew.<eos> A-K don't know how tight.<eos> I'm gonna say something, and I don't want any talking back or attitude.<eos> You're just gonna shut up and like it, and that goes for both of you.<eos> I don't care if you want to go live with your moms, your place is here.<eos> So you're just gonna have to deal with that.<eos> You're gonna go to school, go to church, keep your nose clean.<eos> I'm watching you.<eos> What about your big case?<eos> It's over.
Good night.<eos> No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag.<eos> Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains...<eos> No.<eos> Well, now that I've piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess.<eos> Why don't you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?<eos> You overestimate his significance in my life.<eos> Oh... Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup?<eos> No.<eos> Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck?
It means there's a 41% chance that the work was plagiarized.<eos> The burden of proof for the plaintiff is a preponderance of the evidence.<eos> If there's only a 41% chance that the work was plagiarized, you need to side with my client.<eos> Well, hold on.<eos> We request time to review the report.<eos> You have one night.<eos> - Dinner was delicious.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, and I loved that story about your roommate.<eos> Oh, well, it's totally true.
- Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, no problem.<eos> Hi.<eos> Can I go to the beach?<eos> I thought you said that asians don't like the beach.<eos> They don't like the sun, but I like the surfers.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> The video of Robert's arrest.<eos> It's 15 seconds long.
It is.<eos> I recognise the ringtone.<eos> - Don't take me for a fool.<eos> - I'll switch it off.<eos> - Sorry, sir.<eos> - So I am.<eos> You're on the bench for the game.<eos> I said no mobiles.<eos> Have you thought about the preparation?<eos> It has gone on long enough.
I said no mobiles.<eos> Have you thought about the preparation?<eos> It has gone on long enough.<eos> Don't you ﬁnd it annoying to hear a novice telling us what to do?<eos> We'll pull a trick, seeing as we're here.<eos> But you know what trick we want to pull?<eos> Clean out the room.<eos> With swag bags, like gypsies?<eos> Your tranquillity is over.<eos> But it was killing me, my tranquillity.
She's taking them on a tour of the mountain.<eos> There's a special Grail tour.<eos> We take them to the Crusaders' Rock and tell them the legend.<eos> Aren't they literature students?<eos> Archaeology.<eos> She's not showing them the cave?<eos> No.<eos> Dad hasn't even taken us to the cave.<eos> We don't know where it is.<eos> It only appears to pure hearts anyway.
You need to go to bed.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm too freaked out.<eos> Because of that spell I did on you, someone I love is going to die, and I keep thinking about all the people I love.<eos> And you know what's strange?<eos> There are a lot more of them than I thought.<eos> I don't know if that's good news or bad.<eos> Ingrid, it may not happen right away.<eos> It could take a month, a year even.<eos> So it'll just be like a giant sword hanging over my head until it falls?
Look at the colors.<eos> This blue one is especially gorgeous.<eos> If you like that one, I got something you're gonna love.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wow.<eos> That's the...<eos> The jewel of my collection...<eos> Himalayan Stamped Crown.<eos> Oh, it's so unusual.<eos> The intensity of the color, the way that it shimmers.
Yeah, I know.<eos> Doesn't it seem a little bit off, though?<eos> I mean, it's awfully convenient that she just forgets that she saw me murder her husband.<eos> It...<eos> You're a free woman, Joanna.<eos> Let's not look a gift horse in the mouth, and let's not talk about this here, okay?<eos> So, what do you say we have some champagne?<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> My life is... is over.<eos> It doesn't have to be over.
Why are you here?<eos> There's something I need to talk to you about.<eos> I know where the door to Asgard is. And I know how to get through.<eos> There's no way through.<eos> There was only one key, and it was destroyed.<eos> The serpens clavem?<eos> Yeah, I know some things, too, Ingrid.<eos> There's a second key.<eos> This is what I've been trying to tell you.<eos> - Where is it? - Not where.
And with you being agitated all night long, I didn't get to sleep.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> Maybe it's better for you to go back to the hospital.<eos> You meds.<eos> Two pills today.<eos> Too many.<eos> Take them.<eos> - Did you sleep with this jacket on?<eos> - No. Why do you ask?<eos> It's full of saliva.
I ran into someone this morning.<eos> He's the son of an old friend of mine.<eos> He's trying to get this business off the ground.<eos> I thought I'd help him out.<eos> I just maxed out on my IRA contributions, so I cannot take money back, otherwise I will get massive penalties.<eos> You must really believe in this young man.<eos> Well, I'd like to see him take a shot at this.<eos> Not quite the same thing, though, is it?<eos> Sherlock! I know what the formula is!<eos> And it is a doozy.
I have faith that you'll charm them, just as you charmed me...<eos> Eventually.<eos> According to Rumplestiltskin, the weapon that will defeat Regina lies at the top of this hill.<eos> This weapon... what does Rumple say of its power?<eos> Was it made with dark magic?<eos> No. It was forged by a benevolent mage.<eos> His name is Merlin, from a realm called Camelot.<eos> There it is.<eos> Excalibur.<eos> It's beautiful.

(Sets down cup) Hmm? I can help people find what they need, Regina.<eos> And what do I need?<eos> You don't even know?<eos> That's so sad.<eos> Regina, love.<eos> You need love.<eos> (Chuckles) You're gonna help me find another soul mate?<eos> It is possible to find love again.<eos> I've never seen pixie dust fail.<eos> It will find you your perfect match.
Not murder, manslaughter.<eos> Then overwhelming remorse, self-loathing and a final attempt to obliterate it all with a good dose of whatever it was that smelled of aniseed.<eos> Suicide?<eos> But the maid returns before the job is done.<eos> I've known George Sanderson close to 15 years.<eos> You can't let your judgement be clouded by personal involvement.<eos> And when it comes down to it, Jack, how well can one man really know another?<eos> Morning, Inspector.<eos> What can you tell the papers about your investigation?<eos> It's continuing.
There's even a cop's badge.<eos> I haven't seen it, but the rumour is, that it belongs to the Chief Commissioner.<eos> Where does she keep it?<eos> No.<eos> It's just between us, Lola.<eos> She need never know.<eos> Promise?<eos> Look up there.<eos> There's a room.<eos> It connects to Madam Lyon's office.
What are you after?<eos> Looking to make a profit on the side?<eos> No.<eos> I'm trying to catch a murderer.<eos> And you haven't found them yet.<eos> Quite a way down, is it?<eos> This is a position I much prefer.<eos> That box contains information I need.<eos> Hand it over.<eos> It's not here.
No.<eos> I'm trying to catch a murderer.<eos> And you haven't found them yet.<eos> Quite a way down, is it?<eos> This is a position I much prefer.<eos> That box contains information I need.<eos> Hand it over.<eos> It's not here.<eos> Would you rather I asked the police to do a search?<eos> It's not here, because someone stole it from me.
I'm listening.<eos> Two weeks ago,<eos> Becca took me to a company party.<eos> Tamlin strikes up a conversation.<eos> He asks me when I'm gonna make an honest woman out of Becca.<eos> I tell him not until I can afford to buy the kind of ring she deserves.<eos> Then he says he's got this jeweler that can get me a deal.<eos> And he offers to loan me the money for the ring.<eos> Becca's not wearing a ring.<eos> It's at home in my nightstand.
Recognize the design?<eos> We were barely old enough to drink when you sketched the blueprint.<eos> That's just a miniature prototype.<eos> A theoretical machine powered by a theoretical substance.<eos> Frank, you were right.<eos> - You found it?<eos> - Gravitonium.<eos> It's an extremely rare high-atomic numbered element.<eos> That powers the device.<eos> It's so extremely rare that most people didn't believe it existed, much less the theory that an isolated positive charge ...
It was...<eos> - I like the... - Hmm? - The stage directions.<eos> - The stage directions?<eos> Uh, it's always very clear who was talking to each other.<eos> Dude, what about the story, dude? Did it connect for you?<eos> Kenny, it's all voice over.<eos> Show, don't tell.<eos> That's the golden rule. Jesus Christ.<eos> Dude, I think that gunshot wound gave you down syndrome. - - You need to work on your communication skills<eos> - with auteurs, OK? - But the ending, - it coulda been so much stronger...
This is the place.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Hello, welcome to the perfect match machine and wedding chapel.<eos> Before we get started, we're gonna need you to fill out this form.<eos> I don't fill out forms, Todd.<eos> Gimme that! I love paperwork.<eos> One time me and my buddy filled out like 10 forms at once.<eos> - It was like, what?<eos> - Now step into the machine.<eos> It will scan your brain and find your perfect match.
Why are you doing this, Tanner?<eos> I'm doing it for my client.<eos> You actually had me thinking if we ever met again--<eos> That I'd fight fair?<eos> I do in the ring, but this isn't the ring, and you know very well that you can stop me anytime you want.<eos> If I settle.<eos> There are lot of zeroes on that offer.<eos> You just need to decide whether you care more about money or your girlfriend.<eos> Donna told me that Stephen's affidavit is dead.<eos> It is, but it doesn't matter, because Tanner's gonna keep coming after you unless we sign this.
Oh, so it's my fault?<eos> I'm not taking all the blame here, buddy.<eos> How you can just sit there all calm and cool like always is beyond me.<eos> I'm not calm.<eos> Being without you is ripping me to shreds.<eos> How did we get here?<eos> All I wanted was to be Zen, like the gardenia.<eos> The flower?<eos> I saw this beautiful gardenia in the city, floating in a glass box.<eos> It was so simple and clean, and it smelled so good.
- Who are you to talk?<eos> That man is willing to die to end one Trouble, while you... You decided that your life. Is worth more than all of The Troubles.<eos> - So don't. - Hey.<eos> Your Trouble's gone.<eos> How?<eos> We cleared the ambulatory patients, but moving the bed-bound is going to take. More time than we have.<eos> Well, do whatever it takes.<eos> I don't want anyone near the hospital. When that generator blows.<eos> Thi-pressure bubble is over 1/4 mile across now.<eos> I thought it would have some kind of natural ending point, but it just keeps growing. Bodies are gonna start piling up.
Is about to arrive here in Haven.<eos> Okay, look, let's just calm down and think.<eos> We need to tell Lexie and Nathan.<eos> Maybe Lexie learned something in the barn. About this great evil. Before she stepped through that door.<eos> Could be she knows something she doesn't even know. She knows, you know?<eos> Does that make sense?<eos> Believe it or not, yes.<eos> Then there's Duke.<eos> He had to kill Wade, his brother, because... Because The Troubles haven't ended, because you haven't killed me.<eos> And his pain, the pain of everyone in this town, it's on us.
We could do that.<eos> But, if I were you, I'd be more worried about all the other people. In this town who have disappeared, ones I had nothing to do with.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> While you're sitting here wasting your time with me, there's a killer running loose, Chief Hendrickson.<eos> I'm surprised you haven't caught him yet.<eos> Haven't even narrowed down your list of suspects.<eos> We're gonna find out who you really are.<eos> And why those men took you.<eos> They just kept asking me about this box.<eos> And where it was and where I hid it and...
- If I had known earlier, I could have taught him. How to control it like I did.<eos> And maybe... maybe he wouldn't have turned into such a monster.<eos> Hey, you did what you had to do. To make him stop.<eos> She's right.<eos> We've lost too many people to The Troubles.<eos> - So your Crocker thing...<eos> - Died with my brother.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I thought you'd be happy. That the Crocker curse was gone.<eos> I didn't like your ability, but it existed for a reason, to keep The Troubles in check.
We're in an alley about a block from the hotel.<eos> We found a gun.<eos> Is this the gun used to kill Frost?<eos> And there's duct tape on the barrel from the silencer.<eos> Well, get it to ballistics.<eos> Make sure it's a match.<eos> See if we can get any fingerprints.<eos> Will do. Bye.<eos> Looks like we've got the gun. Yeah?<eos> It's on its way to forensics now, but it's a pretty sure bet.
So he tried filing a wrongful termination suit, but he found himself being intimidated by Visualize.<eos> So he tried the hard touch, when Parkman came to the hotel for the conference.<eos> Now their relationship had always been a consensual one, but that wouldn't matter in the eyes of the public or the law.<eos> It was in Frost's power to transform Parkman from a--an olympic coach to a child molester with just a few words.<eos> He demanded that Parkman bring a large sum of money across the park in a brown paper bag.<eos> Or Frost would ruin Parkman's life forever.<eos> And Frost was right in his estimation of what Parkman stood to lose.<eos> What he didn't realize was how Parkman would react.<eos> The soda bottle silencer worked perfectly.<eos> Even if it did blow off, no one heard a thing.
- Okay. What are you gonna do?<eos> - Help Nathan.<eos> He's torn up about Audrey, and I just... I think he's gonna need someone backing him up...<eos> Even if I'm not as cute as his regular partner.<eos> I disagree.<eos> - Be safe.<eos> - Okay. See you soon.<eos> The bullet missed major organs, but I am not buying that you just dug it out.<eos> - Is it in there?<eos> - Better if it were.
- Help Nathan.<eos> He's torn up about Audrey, and I just...

See you soon.<eos> The bullet missed major organs, but I am not buying that you just dug it out.<eos> - Is it in there?<eos> - Better if it were.<eos> Could help staunch blood flow, like it's doing for that guy, who, save for the bullet, has the exact same wound.
Can you please get him out of here?<eos> He's embarrassing me.<eos> Is that my fanny pack?<eos> Just go!<eos> The merge! What the... the merge!<eos> Murray!<eos> - The merge!<eos> - Murray!<eos> Oh, my God, look at your ankle!<eos> It's all swollen and ballooning.
Memories make for powerful ghosts, and some people deserve to be haunted.<eos> Take his statement.<eos> - It wasn't Warwick.<eos> - Hamilton was after retribution.<eos> You said it yourself.<eos> Why are you now defending him?<eos> Because what he says makes sense.<eos> Freddy Ashmead was a dying man.<eos> The only reason to hasten his death would be to stop his quest for the truth.<eos> And the person who knows the truth doesn't want it revealed.
But she also had a terrible reaction to my gloves, after I touched the West Melbourne scarf that was tied around Harry Harper's neck.<eos> Perhaps I...<eos> I just patted Scotty, and then I touched that scarf.<eos> You didn't go anywhere near that scarf after Harry Harper's body was found.<eos> Did you murder him, before you tied the scarf around his neck?<eos> No!<eos> You'd better explain, then.<eos> One of the younger blokes stole the scarf from West sheds.<eos> I gave it to Scotty to sleep on.<eos> So how did it end up around Harry Harper's neck?
That's why she undid the wheel nut.<eos> But Gerty...<eos> Millie didn't kill Gerty.<eos> I know.<eos> The thought of her being taken away from you was too much.<eos> I was furious.<eos> And I knew Gerty would end up at the VAA Lounge so I went round there to just have my say and maybe I could change her mind.<eos> By the time she came out, she was gone before I could catch her and...<eos> Why did you take Antony's car?<eos> Well, because it was there and I knew how to start it.
I called you both in because I want you to work together.<eos> I need this case solved.<eos> Phryne Fisher, Professor Bradbury,<eos> Dean of Medicine and Head of Jude's College.<eos> Delighted to meet any man who can inspire Elizabeth MacMillan.<eos> Pity the occasion is so tragic.<eos> You said Professor Katz was left in the holding annexe of the furnace.<eos> Who would have had access?<eos> Oh, well, apart from the staff, we kept a key in the cabinet over there.<eos> It's missing.
But we have proof you were attempting to dispose of evidence, Mr Street.<eos> Constable Collins, charge Mr Charlie Street with being an accessory to a murder.<eos> Take him down to the cells.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And we'll have to inform Professor Bradbury, so I hope it won't affect your future at Jude's College.<eos> Alright, I found it.<eos> Well, you need to tell us where.<eos> Night in the cells might loosen his tongue.<eos> The key was with Beatrice's things.<eos> But I'm sure she had no idea it was there.
In that case, I'm sure the Bishop will approve.<eos> Policewoman?<eos> Don't worry, Jack.<eos> You'll never get me in that uniform.<eos> Unless, of course, you cuff me.<eos> Mother!<eos> Mother, we've confirmed.<eos> Catherine is to be apprenticed to a milliner. Oh!<eos> What... now...<eos> If your needlepoint is anywhere near as good as I think it is, you're going to be a great success.
Vera and Quentin were lovers.<eos> This was in the back of the book.<eos> 'My phantom of delight<eos> My soul cries this wretched night<eos> Leave him without further ado<eos> Or with broken heart<eos> I must leave you.'<eos> Mr Wordsworth seems suddenly restrained.<eos> So Vera Mortimer was lured to her death with this love poem?<eos> And both Nicholas and Quentin knew it was in the Wordsworth book.
Phryne, where did you put my briefcase?<eos> I need that paperwork signed.<eos> I believe it ended up in my room, Aunt P.<eos> Well, what use is it there?<eos> (Huffs)<eos> Aunt Prudence, whatever's wrong?<eos> I loathe that song.<eos> But why did you bite poor Birdie's head off?<eos> Because I've heard it more times than I care to.<eos> It haunts me.
Six geese a-laying.<eos> What happened?<eos> I thought I'd go cross-country to Jamieson.<eos> I saw a sign. And then someone hit me from behind.<eos> Miss Fisher?<eos> Miss Fisher.<eos> JACK: Looks like fresh timber.<eos> Couldn't be more than a couple of weeks old.<eos> I thought the mine was closed ten years ago.<eos> It was.
Who could it have been?<eos> CHESTER: Must have been Quentin.<eos> Why would Quentin reopen the mine?<eos> Well, I have no idea.<eos> Why would he suddenly start killing people to the theme of the Twelve Days of Christmas?<eos> It beggars belief.<eos> What can you tell me about the cave-in?<eos> I've never forgiven myself for not trusting my own opinion.<eos> I didn't want the men to keep drilling, but we were getting close to a new seam of gold and I was issued with a report that said the mine was safe.<eos> But it wasn't.
Uh, you, my King, my not-so-loving husband.<eos> Well, maybe I can dance my way out of this doghouse.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Maybe later.<eos> Ooh, or maybe you can tell me what's going on with you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Bonnie died 3 months ago, and what was I doing?<eos> I was having the summer of my life with you.<eos> Ah, guilt.<eos> Don't know it, but I've heard it can be a real bitch.
So long as we understand each other.<eos> Oh, I think we do.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me show you what I'm doing here.<eos> My dad always used to say falling for Chicago is like falling for a girl with a broken nose.<eos> You might find other girls who are lovelier but never one so real.<eos> I love this view.<eos> You can see the whole life of the city.<eos> My life.<eos> It started over there, now it's here and with all the things I built in between.
- to the theater better.<eos> - That's true. The Ripper!<eos> script didn't do him any justice at all.<eos> We're dealing with somebody very calculated here.<eos> We never should have let Elisa refuse protection. No, Jules, here's the kicker,<eos> Elisa has absolutely nothing to fear.<eos> Sound theory, Spencer. You're right.<eos> Everything points the other way.<eos> ♪ The evidence is underwhelming ♪<eos> Oh, wait, it's not.
You haven't done anything wrong.<eos> Not yet.<eos> I'm sorry, Zach.<eos> That critic Scheck was gonna bury us.<eos> There was a scuffle, and he was dead, and you were just... you were there.<eos> We didn't mean to kill him.<eos> You stole my life and then you stole my play.<eos> Armitage wanted to run Ripper!<eos> I found your first draft.<eos> I didn't realize how brilliant it was then.
Front and side exits are weak spots.<eos> - We won't have long.<eos> - Well, we'll figure it out.<eos> Look, ever since I left this morning, I've been thinking about the window and the codex and us--<eos> Come on in.<eos> - Hey, Mozzie. - Good evening.<eos> That--the sketch.<eos> It wasn't here earlier.<eos> - Did you just draw that?<eos> - Of course it was.
Why would you leave me?<eos> Look, dad's getting remarried.<eos> Probably starting a whole new family that I won't even be a part of.<eos> You're still my sister.<eos> I'm still your sister.<eos> I learned a new song.<eos> Probably sound better if we sang it together.<eos> Is that the one you've been singin'?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's Deacon's, actually.
Hang on a second. His company can barely stay afloat.<eos> Then why'd the Navy let him out early?<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> When a person in the military comes into a lot of money, they can get permission to leave because it's felt that their service is no longer a first priority.<eos> Wait, that's an actual thing?<eos> It's an unwritten... thing.<eos> And it probably explains why Garrett's naval records didn't give a reason for his early discharge.<eos> But you said that Garrett's company hasn't made any money.<eos> Right.<eos> It's about to.
Was someone waiting for them in the car? Yes.<eos> Male or female?<eos> The only thing I remember, is that it was red.<eos> It doesn't help to say it more than once.<eos> How did it go?<eos> Technical Services are working on the boat.<eos> Three people were on the boat.<eos> A fourth was waiting for them in a red car.<eos> Is that all you know?<eos> Yes, it was red and small.
He needs her more.<eos> He was going to hit someone.<eos> Why did he tasks the camera?<eos> In order to film it.<eos> Then he would hide re.<eos> On the roof.<eos> God?<eos> There it is.<eos> The memory card is gone.<eos> It's here.
OK, I knew it was probably something illegal.<eos> But I never checked the barrels.<eos> I figured they were smuggling something.<eos> - How did they first approach you?<eos> - I got a letter.<eos> - You still have it?<eos> - No.<eos> What did it say?<eos> At first I thought it was one of those quick-money scams.<eos> - But... it was personal.
You'd miss an elephant at 2 meters.<eos> Which of you bastards shot a chamois in mid summer?<eos> César, you're tiresome.<eos> You didn't see it was a female with her young?<eos> Are you blind?<eos> This isn't the right time.<eos> We need your help.<eos> We've got to get rid of that beast.<eos> I saw its tracks on the Andagne ridge.<eos> It went further down.
Get lost, kid! [GER]<eos> Just try it!<eos> - Lemme go!<eos> - You brat!<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> Help me!<eos> A broken weapon, [FREN] an immobilized soldier.<eos> How will you settle that, Mr. Mayor?<eos> That beast isn't mine.<eos> I told you, it's dangerous.
I know your hunts.<eos> Full of holes.<eos> What else can we do?<eos> I want lots of people.<eos> 50 at least.<eos> 50 people!<eos> Tomorrow, 8: a.m. German time.<eos> Where will you hunt tomorrow?<eos> Do you know that beast?<eos> Why did it bite that Bosch?
I can't tell you.<eos> You'll kill her.<eos> Don't be ridiculous. I won't kill anyone.<eos> We don't kill sick people, we heal them.<eos> It's not a people.<eos> It's Belle.<eos> You mean that beast they killed?<eos> It's a wild animal, Sébastien.<eos> It's very dangerous.<eos> You never know how it'll, react if it's injured.

You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system... a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror but it sees everything... violent crimes involving ordinary people.

We need to get her away from Josh.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I've just thought of an amazingly awesome plan all on my own.<eos> I was watching this programme last night called The Boy Whose Face Melted Off.<eos> I saw that.<eos> His face melted off.<eos> Basically, he's got this disease and it's, like, really rare.<eos> Hardly anyone has it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's why it's rare.
- so if you know something...<eos> - Sir.<eos> Someone was writing an article about Dreamworld.<eos> You personally had that story killed.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Because the enemy reads newspapers, and there's no way in hell I'm gonna risk American lives by handing out operational details about a special ops base... if such a base existed.<eos> What about Bronson?<eos> What's his connection to that base?<eos> If it indeed does exist.
So none of the intelligence agencies can link Rasheed to known Al-Qaeda elements.<eos> And...<eos> He's got a solid alibi for the night of the break-in.<eos> He could still be involved.<eos> Is there any chatter about an imminent attack?<eos> No more than usual.<eos> What's your take on Rasheed?<eos> I don't think he's our guy.<eos> I mean, he said that he saw Bronson carrying a servant girl's body.<eos> I mean, the only way that he'd come up with a story like that was if it was true.
This is something you're gonna have to worry about once Geoffrey starts asking questions about your team name.<eos> Oh, "Pete Top/Kevin Bottom"?<eos> No, I didn't have to explain it to him.<eos> He intuitively understood that you were the submissive.<eos> (chuckles) Now that everyone's here, I have a big announcement to make... (inhales) Uncle Frank died.<eos> What?<eos> But the good news is he left me... his van.<eos> Whoa, rapist van!<eos> You got the van?<eos> It's like brand-new.
Eren!<eos> Eren...<eos> You shouldn't get up.<eos> Rest.<eos> The Female Titan?<eos> It got away.<eos> Why?<eos> What about the others?<eos> What about the plan?<eos> It failed...
I understand your surprise now, but this velociraptor couldn't wolf down the caper bush for ever.<eos> Are you trying to flirt with me?<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no. Women cannot live on pitta alone.<eos> I need a little kofte in my kebab.<eos> Well, I'm sure that comes as a relief to many, many men.<eos> I want you to know that I am... (back on solids.)<eos> We need to talk about Kevin.<eos> You can talk to me about anything you want.<eos> My door is so open, it's off its hinges.
Ah, damn it.<eos> - I'm sorry. - No, no, no.<eos> You... you're doing great.<eos> Hang in there.<eos> Stay tough for me.<eos> There you are.<eos> I was gonna show you how to dry the hoses.<eos> Is someone else wearing my dad's coat now?<eos> Nobody else is wearing it.<eos> It was, um... it was damaged in the fire.
We need to talk.<eos> If you're here to apologize about the limo again, don't worry. The damage those vandals did when you went to grab a bite Is completely covered by insurance, no harm done.<eos> It wasn't vandals, mr.<eos> Wayne. It was a member of the league of assassins named silver monkey.<eos> What's going on, alfred? Just listen, bruce.<eos> About a year ago, I infiltrated the league of assassins As a cia operative.<eos> While I was inside I discovered something of immeasurable value To the league.<eos> The soultaker sword.<eos> I saw this sword in action.<eos> It drains souls from helpless targets.
And maybe that's why you texted angelo last night and invited him over.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Look at your phone, Emma.<eos> Wait, I don't...<eos> No, I don't remember writing these texts.<eos> Just because you don't remember doesn't mean you didn't.<eos> Just like you only remember having one glass of scotch.<eos> But what if you had more?<eos> They found your scotch bottle, Emma.<eos> It was empty.
Now according to this video, you were inside that apartment searching for a good two hours.<eos> Damn...<eos> You didn't think to look... At the wrapped gift for Emma, did you?<eos> Oops. Her adoption records.<eos> Up until then, your plan was going perfectly.<eos> You spiked Emma's scotch bottle with knockout drops and you swapped it out for an empty one.<eos> Th-that was pretty clever.<eos> But not so clever to throw the dosed bottle away at your house.<eos> Yeah. We found the bottle in your recycle bin.<eos> It tested positive for chloral hydrate.
Very impressive.<eos> You are aware, then, that I'm due in court in three hours.<eos> Your case is about to go sideways.<eos> Why?<eos> What's happened?<eos> Lorca's people have reached out to me.<eos> Normally, I wouldn't give him the time of day.<eos> He's a vicious, little drug-lord thug.<eos> Certainly nothing there to hold my interest.<eos> But their request is of great interest because it concerns you.
No! Yes, you can, you stupid girl!<eos> No! Do it!<eos> And feel my power flow into you!<eos> I know, because I was standing where you're standing!<eos> Stop yelling at me!<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it! No!<eos> Do it!<eos> Bury her deep.<eos> God knows what all that shit in her body will do to the lawn when it comes up in the spring.
Like a good man.<eos> Sometimes it takes a long...<eos> Long...<eos> Long, long time.<eos> Hey, Ernie Cooper's old house is for rent?<eos> This place is great.<eos> No, this one's not for you.<eos> Oh, no. I've done house calls here before.<eos> This place is amazing.<eos> - Of course it's for us. - Oh!
I don't know, man.<eos> All I did was play it. I'm American, so I played it.<eos> I used to sing it in school, they made me sing it in school, so... it was a flashback, you know, and that's about it.<eos> The first six, seven, eight notes, I'm right with him.<eos> And then something inside me said,<eos> "Wait a minute, you guys didn't rehearse this.<eos> "You better lay off."<eos> And then there was one of the greatest renditions I've ever heard in my life.<eos> That rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner is so resonant, in terms of what our lives had been for that decade.<eos> It brought all those images to mind of what America's about, and what we were doing in these wars and all those things.
It is now the day of, and we still don't have a strong plan for this Katy song, and I think<eos> - it's pretty obvious what the problem is.<eos> - Uh, because we're a bunch of Gagas trying to out-Katy the Katys who just did a Gaga song featuring Marley as Katy?<eos> Besides, we did have a plan, but King Latifah dropped the ball. Uh-uh.<eos> Let me auto-correct that for you.<eos> I tried breaking into the zoo to get us live tigers. Plot twist:<eos> Lima doesn't have a zoo! Why'd we think it did?<eos> But I did get us a lion costume to make up for it.<eos> I'm really not okay with this.<eos> Guys, the real problem is, we're thinking gimmicks and spectacle, and, yes, both Katy and Gaga share that, but... what people love about Katy's music is it's fun and kind and real and girl-next-door.
Got the extended clips.<eos> AK's are original Russian stock.<eos> Fully updated, new action, quick load.<eos> - Military handles?<eos> - Aye.<eos> Absorb 50% more recoil.<eos> It's the new ElCan scope.<eos> Yo, Jax, Chinese.<eos> Try the scope.<eos> It can split a Protestant hair from three blocks away.
Does anyone else think it's hot in here?<eos> These overalls are really starchy.<eos> Yeah, maybe that's 'cause I turned up the heat to 90, and, uh, oh, the knob broke off in my hand.<eos> [Chuckles] Oops.<eos> Well, speaking of heat, we should discuss America's white-hot passion for voting rights and the men and women who help protect them, like the local city councilwoman who is starving and thinking about her husband's<eos> Reservoir Dog- themed birthday cake and wanting to eat it really badly.<eos> Oh, this is not a good sign.<eos> Once she starts thinking about birthday cake, she's basically useless until she eats birthday cake.<eos> Democracy is not unlike a cake.<eos> It's layered, delicious, chocolate, and I want some.
I can barely stomach one.<eos> Ah, you would've liked him.<eos> He was a thief and a liar.<eos> Yeah, you would've liked my brother.<eos> He could be a stubborn ass.<eos> Now wait here.<eos> What exactly does the King have to find on this island?<eos> A plant.<eos> We journeyed across the realms for a plant?<eos> Our sources say it's magical.
I could replace him.<eos> (chuckling)<eos> (others laughing as well)<eos> A female copper.<eos> (general laughter)<eos> That's a bloody good one.<eos> I just did what Mr. Pendrick told me to do.<eos> - Which was? - I was to enter the room and shoot the man who was escorting my partner in crime.<eos> - The gun wasn't supposed to be loaded.<eos> - But it was.
All right.<eos> You know what?<eos> Let's try this another way.<eos> Uh, in your romantic fantasy of our future, where is Jenny?<eos> She'll spend Christmas with us, but we're gonna want our alone time.<eos> Okay, let's focus on that word "alone."<eos> Having house guests is the best.<eos> You know, you get excited to see them, you put out the fluffy towels, you hold your farts, everything's nice... but, eventually, you have to fart.<eos> Here's what you do.<eos> Uh, you go out on the deck, and pretend to look at the ocean, wait for a big wave and when it breaks, so do you.
What's so confusing about that?<eos> It suggests two entrance wounds but no exits.<eos> Ballistics confirmed that the bullet Hodgins found in the car caused the wound to the victim's skull, so it had to get out of there somehow.<eos> I concur.<eos> There has to be an explanation.<eos> So Delcampo was shot twice?<eos> Two entry wounds, yes.<eos> But no exit wounds.<eos> But the bullet Hodgins retrieved was definitely one of the slugs that killed him.<eos> Yes, but we have no idea how it left his body.
You're a minor.<eos> You felt your life threatened.<eos> This was self-defense.<eos> I promise you, this lady and Dr. Sweets will make sure that you live in a good neighborhood, go to a good school. You'll be safe.<eos> If I give you the gun.<eos> If you don't do anything, cher.<eos> The good doctor here would make my life miserable if you don't wind up in the White House one day.<eos> I would do it.<eos> I would give you the gun.<eos> But I don't know where it is now.
Please, I need to borrow some money so I can go get some weed. No!<eos> I'm not subsidizing your weed habit, Taco.<eos> And besides, with the weed crackdown, the prices are through the roof.<eos> I can't afford it.<eos> Why is the government always cracking down on these small-time drug dealers?<eos> Because drugs ruin lives and they're illegal and that's the government's job.<eos> Ah!<eos> Make it stop!<eos> God, has your head always been that big?<eos> Think it's still growing.
You mean... alone?<eos> This bean... can open a portal, take you far away from this land.<eos> Even this realm.<eos> You could start a new life.<eos> But it cannot be with your father.<eos> But he's coming back for me as soon as he gets a job.<eos> The truth is, he's at the pub.<eos> He doesn't want a job.<eos> Or real responsibility.<eos> Family can be a strength, but it can also be a burden.
(Giggles)<eos> I'm tired.<eos> We're almost there.<eos> We can rest all we want after we get the pixie dust, do whatever your heart desires.<eos> Just wait.<eos> You'll see.<eos> What does it look like?<eos> Oh. It's just like dust.<eos> (Blows air)<eos> You never know the power it contains just by looking at it.

It's just like dust.<eos> (Blows air)<eos> You never know the power it contains just by looking at it.<eos> But when you believe in its power, it glows with magic and becomes something very special indeed.
So?<eos> It's just a silly video thing.<eos> A silly video thing?<eos> (chuckles) I think the 28 people who follow "Sabrina's Yolk of the Day"<eos> might disagree with you.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Strawberry Bonds.<eos> Oh, how dumb am I?<eos> - What's going on with your toe freckle? - I'm not sure.<eos> - I'm worried it's getting bigger.
- How about you?<eos> - Oh, I did everything.<eos> Everything!<eos> I carried the Eagleton department on my shoulders for years, and I loved every second of it.<eos> You don't even know!<eos> I'm sorry, was your name Jennifer? No, it's Tynnyffer with two y's.<eos> I used to be Jennifer, but then I decided to rebrand myself.<eos> Oh, wait, hang on.<eos> Um, well, nice to meet you.<eos> My name's April, and I just wanted to say that your dress is so cute it's bonks.
It's a curse, I assure you.<eos> Mostly for us.<eos> There must be a heart in there someplace, Oliver.<eos> I'm just trying to help; it's tough love.<eos> It's misguided, but I understand.<eos> I don't even think he had six weeks.<eos> Look at this.<eos> The cancer was spreading to his bones.<eos> Look at the marrow;<eos> see how porous it is?
Dr. Brennan, what are you doing here?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I asked him to come because you have your mani-pedi appointment.<eos> I can't, in good conscience, leave until I feel confident you are capable of handling the case.<eos> I'm gonna chalk that up to nerves and not be insulted.<eos> Good call.<eos> Would you just stop acting like the wedding is doomed?<eos> Brennan really wants this.<eos> Then why are we here? I mean, this case is over 30 years old.<eos> It could wait till Monday.
We don't need anybody out for the count tonight.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's Michael.<eos> Victim's name is Michael Besner.<eos> He's the chief administrator of King's Medical Center.<eos> Toxicology came back with high levels of a powerful hallucinogen called scopolamine.<eos> He had traces of it around his nose and mouth.<eos> Okay, that explains how Max was affected.<eos> In places like Colombia, people use scopolamine to drug and rob tourists.<eos> It leaves its victims very docile and very open to suggestion.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system... a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
I'll split it with you, 50/50.<eos> - 60/40?<eos> - Not a half bad deal, huh?<eos> Will you at least let me call Natalie before you kill me or arrest me or put me in a well in your basement?<eos> You have 30 seconds.<eos> Sorry to disappoint, con man.<eos> Seems the NYPD isn't bad at phone traces.<eos> I found your girl in 20 minutes.<eos> - I'll give you the ball.<eos> It's yours.
That's it.<eos> Your husband's in a Stalag, isn't he ? Yes.<eos> Is that a problem ?<eos> No.... if it's true.<eos> I wondered if Lucienne had read the letter.<eos> Just the beginning.<eos> Listen, your privacy is your affair...<eos> You're in the Resistance, aren't you ?<eos> I lied about the origin of the letter.<eos> It comes from a member of a group to which I belong. Well...belonged.
recognize this? what are you accusing us of?<eos> probably insurance fraud.<eos> definitely filing a false report now, you were wondering why we did this in the bathroom.<eos> it's because you're full of crap.<eos> blammo! jake hammer strikes again.<eos> jake hammer strikes again.<eos> i see we got eight recruits for the junior police program.<eos> outstanding.<eos> thank you, sir.<eos> but, as important as your praise is to me, it should actually go to gina.
Ooh, chicago!<eos> There is this pizza place called gazzola's.<eos> It's fantastic.
- Alice! - What are you playing?<eos> - Stop shouting. I can hear you.<eos> Are we really gonna play this game, Vincent?<eos> - Joey, go to your room.<eos> - Why?<eos> Do what your grandma says.<eos> Joey, you need to come with me.<eos> I'm supposed to be staying with Grandma.<eos> Please, sweetheart, this is not a safe place for you.<eos> Don't listen to the mutation, Joey. It'll fill your head with lies.
I conjure and command thee, dark lords to the vernacular, summon truth from lying tongues.<eos> Fie upon the wicked who dare to throw sand in our eyes.<eos> With force I command thee, let truth be spoken!<eos> Fiona aced transmutation and pyrokinesis.<eos> By this time tomorrow, we'll have a new Supreme.<eos> You notice how Spalding spends his life cleaning up Fiona's messes?<eos> If Fiona did do something terrible to Anna Leigh, Spalding knows about it.<eos> If Spalding does know something, he's not talking.<eos> He's not going to have a choice.<eos> I enchanted his tongue so it's incapable of speaking a lie.
Stand before us.<eos> 40 years ago, our Supreme disappeared.<eos> Shortly thereafter, you were mutilated.<eos> Some call it coincidence, others call it mystery.<eos> As to me, I can't imagine living under the same roof as the monster who dismembered me, making her breakfast, pouring her tea.<eos> But you have nothing to be afraid of now.<eos> Justice is so near.<eos> All you have to do is write the name of the witch who was responsible for severing your tongue.<eos> He's not going to have a choice.<eos> I enchanted his tongue so it's incapable of speaking a lie, and I happen to know the Council's calling him for a closed session tomorrow morning.
Everybody can't just throw a ball and get into college, Axl!<eos> Great.<eos> We're-- we're burning gas on something she's never gonna get.<eos> Yeah, and it's all coming out of my pocket.<eos> Did you not hear her? !<eos> She has no chance of getting Recording Secretary unless she gets this!<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir, we need to use your fax machine.<eos> Machine's over there.<eos> It takes cash and credit cards.
Something Catherine once told me about looking deeper.<eos> The Tin Man's rivet.<eos> Uh, for the most recent reissue of The Wizard of Oz they used a new restoration technique.<eos> Details that had been st had suddenly now become vivid.<eos> One of those being that the Tin Man had a rivet between his eyes that nobody had seen in 50 years.<eos> Maybe there's some detail in this film that we're not seeing.<eos> There's only one way to find out.<eos> I'll send this to FotoKem, have them do a wet print and rescan it.<eos> January 2001.<eos> The bank was torn down in '05, but I remembered it had a news ticker.
I know. I just didn't expect it, that's all.<eos> Things change, plans change.<eos> That sounds like another discussion we need to have.<eos> Yeah, but at another time.<eos> I can tell you're busy, sweetheart, and I can take a taxi.<eos> Hey, Doc, got your message.<eos> You have something for me?<eos> Yeah, still working on our alley John Doe, but I found this in one of the wound tracts.<eos> Maybe a piece of the murder weapon.<eos> Tip of the blade-- maybe it broke off.
You know them?<eos> Yeah, I-I thought it was my son, Tyler.<eos> I bought him a jacket like that last Christmas.<eos> He's 19.<eos> He comes home every couple of weeks.<eos> I try to get him to stay, but then he wants to use in the house, and then he's gone and...<eos> He's just out there.<eos> You said you don't sleep.<eos> You worry.<eos> No I.D. on our victim, so we're hoping that the trace from the outside of the ball will help us determine its path, and where it came from will help us with who he is.
Now... say it.<eos> Well, so much has happened, I forgot what it was that we were gonna...<eos> No.<eos> Wait.<eos> You put those headphones back on.<eos> You're not done until I say you're done.<eos> Erase my browser history!<eos> You're shaking.<eos> Like a young Chihuahua.<eos> You followed your fear and it brought you here, right into my arms.
But look at me.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm perfectly fine.<eos> I just can't taste vanilla.<eos> No big deal, right?<eos> Terry Jr.: Hey, guys.<eos> Look. There are moments in your lives when you have to conquer your fears.<eos> That's where we are now.<eos> Look, being afraid of getting hit by the ball is normal.<eos> But even if it does hit you, it only stings for a second.
uh, uh, great.<eos> You know, the Cannon used to bring me to a place like this when I was young.<eos> Yeah, we'd hit the cage, share a slice.<eos> He'd drink four pitchers of beer, punch a guy,<eos> - and we'd take the bus home.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Uh, yeah. Your, uh, no-slice policy is ridiculous.<eos> Uh-huh. This should be a place where I can bring my kid when I just want to spend five bucks and have 10 great minutes with him.<eos> And I know he'll leave happy, even though the slice was so hot it took a layer of skin off his roof.
Fitz-Simmons is checking.<eos> The system went dark for an hour.<eos> - They think it was hacked.<eos> - It was the same thieves each time?<eos> Yes, but it was just one thief... a woman.<eos> - And she did it all with her eyes closed.<eos> - Eyewitnesses I.D. her?<eos> Black, athletic build, late 20s, early 30s.<eos> So, you asked how she could have cracked the system.<eos> I have a pitch, but it's way outside the box.
I want to end this.<eos> If you say so.<eos> What, you think 'cause I went out on my own, I want to save him?<eos> It's my mess.<eos> I just want to bring him in, look him in the eye and figure out what the hell went wrong.<eos> The only reason he's not in custody is he got the drop on me.<eos> Boss, I think I found something.<eos> If you wanted him in custody, DiNozzo, he would be.<eos> Got fingernail scratches and finger smudges on the window.<eos> It's also broken.
I'm celebrating.<eos> I thought I was gonna die.<eos> I didn't. So now I'm free to be whatever I want to be.<eos> Heh. It's a good day.<eos> Love the hair, by the way.<eos> Bold choice.<eos> Sync corrections by Saman 22 This is nice.<eos> It is nice.<eos> Quiet, still, peaceful.<eos> I like our life when it's like this.
What the hell kind of mischief you...<eos> Gabriel said,<eos> "Keep your servant also from willful sins."<eos> Breathe. Breathe.<eos> "May they not rule over me.<eos> "Then will I be blameless."<eos> Breathe.<eos> "Innocent of great transgression."<eos> The bridegroom has got the ring<eos> And it's such a pretty thing
Uncle looking for you.<eos> He real restless.<eos> - Do you get to choose where?<eos> - Well, where would you like?<eos> Whatever is farthest from here.<eos> - Japan.<eos> - Closer, please.<eos> Uh, California.<eos> What's our house gonna look like?<eos> It'll be smaller than the one you have now.
His... his skin was very different back...<eos> You know what?<eos> Never mind. Okay.<eos> Um, Paul and I broke up because I wanted the whole college experience, including meeting new and interesting men... college men.<eos> If I hadn't, I never would have married your father.<eos> So I guess that's a vote for tag face.<eos> Hey, Kyle. Just the guy I was looking for.<eos> At your service.<eos> Listen. Some kid hurled up on the rock wall.<eos> You got to hop up there, clean off the "lava" before it rains down on the villagers.
It's just... it's nice and quiet down there.<eos> And there's a drain in the floor in case it gets really ugly.<eos> We are not fighting, mom, okay?<eos> So, is the strike over?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Not quite yet. They met our wage demands.<eos> But they pushed back on overtime, so I convinced everyone to hold off for the whole package.<eos> Okay, now we're fighting.<eos> Why would you not accept that offer?<eos> Because it's not good enough.
- She can hit him...<eos> - Zhush-zhush!<eos> I'm taking Boyd home.<eos> I don't know where you're going tonight, but I don't want to see you there.<eos> How did that go for you?<eos> She told me not to come home.<eos> Well, you had a good run.<eos> Hey, Mike Baxter... here for Outdoor Man.<eos> Why do people feel like they need to go with the flow?<eos> I like to chart my own course, use my effort to make my boat go where I want it to go, but some people love conformity.
Then I shall see you tomorrow.<eos> Good night, Dr. Fowler.<eos> Good night, Dr. Cooper.<eos> Good night, indeed. What a rube.<eos> Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?<eos> You were really quiet during dinner.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was.<eos> Yeah, I bet it sucked.
Who what?<eos> Who... who died?<eos> No, he does not get to add me to his souvenir collection.<eos> - Miranda... - He won't come near me when I'm alive but thinks he can keep some of me when I'm dead? !<eos> He thinks he can rip me apart and shove me in a cabinet? !<eos> Want me to try?<eos> No, I got it.<eos> I may not know a pawn from a rook, but I definitely don't need lessons in busting locks.<eos> Doesn't go to this door.<eos> It's rusty.
Yeah, it was the Ravenswood savings loan.<eos> It was the first bank on main street, built in 1918.<eos> How do you guys know these things?<eos> It was relocated to the first mall in Ravenswood.<eos> I wrote a paper about it when the new mall became the old mall.<eos> Once again we're talking about the year original Miranda and original Caleb died.<eos> You mean the year they were murdered.<eos> So you believe it now?<eos> That they died because of the curse?<eos> I can't make it go away unless I accept that it's real.
From now on... we watch each other's backs.<eos> Look, I've been taking care of myself for a really long time, so I'm not sure<eos> I need some white girl sorority sisters to cover my ass.<eos> And what is this green shit?<eos> It's not a sorority.<eos> It's a coven.<eos> And this is absinthe, drink of the divine.<eos> Which we are.<eos> Where'd you find the spirit board?<eos> More like it found me.
As long as you don't let anyone use you.<eos> Or me.<eos> The next time you want to correct my behavior, come to me.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I don't know what you think you saw, but if you're trying to score points with Peter...<eos> - I'm not trying to score points.<eos> - Then why bring it up?<eos> - Because it's my job.<eos> - My private life falls way outside your job description.<eos> Not when it impacts the counsel you give the governor.
Just this morning, Mrs. Ruiz received this bullet in her mailbox, with the letters "L. C." written on the side.<eos> That's Lalo Hierra's calling card.<eos> It's a clear threat.<eos> Hold on.<eos> We have no way to verify...<eos> Your Honor, as soon as this was brought to our attention we brought it to you.<eos> Okay, enough.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, Mr. Agos, I'm sorry, but blood feud is a very specific claim, and I'm just not seeing enough here to support it.<eos> Your Honor, this bullet is clearly a warning of violence to come to Mrs. Ruiz and her family.<eos> But it isn't relevant to asylum.
Who sails the shots?<eos> Those bastards think they can steal from me?<eos> Then they're gonna reap what they sow.<eos> Finch, you doing a little spring cleaning?<eos> I wish I was.<eos> I received numbers this morning.<eos> 38 of them, to be precise.<eos> Maybe the machine blew a belt or something.<eos> It's not a lawn mower, Mr. Reese.<eos> It's also never wrong.
Go, damn it!<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Why you, Aaron?<eos> The nanites in your body are behaving in a highly individual way, repairing your cells, oxygenating your blood.<eos> But why?<eos> Why only you?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> You think of me as your enemy.<eos> But we're partners now.<eos> You know, my father believed there was a magic, invisible power all around us, and if he prayed hard enough, it would grant him a miracle.
Why only you?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> You think of me as your enemy.<eos> But we're partners now.<eos> You know, my father believed there was a magic, invisible power all around us, and if he prayed hard enough, it would grant him a miracle.<eos> He was a horrible, stupid man who based his whole life on a fairy tale.<eos> But it's ironic.<eos> Turns out he was right... sort of.<eos> There is an invisible power that can save people.<eos> It just doesn't come from heaven, that's all.
Ugh! - You got it?<eos> - Ah!<eos> I can! I can!<eos> Let me... got it!<eos> See?<eos> That didn't backfire.<eos> Where did they go?<eos> Well, the protection spell's still up, so they can't leave Storybrooke.<eos> Well, then what are they gonna do with the box?<eos> Well, if I wanted to make sure it doesn't end up in Neverland,
How could... a part of me not want you to leave this place?<eos> I would happily build a tree house and spend the rest of my days dodging poison arrows and lost boys, as long as I had you by my side.<eos> - But you should have told me.<eos> - I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You didn't believe, David.<eos> You needed to believe in us.<eos> So we just wait for Pan's shadow to show up?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And when it does, we'll be prepared.
He probably stole his wallet, too.<eos> You know, if you guys are interested, there's a technique where I can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust, and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond<eos> with your DNA in it.<eos> Oh, that's amazing!<eos> Yeah.<eos> See Bernie's engagement ring?<eos> That came right off my mom's back.<eos> BERNADETTE:<eos> He's kidding.<eos> If that were true, it'd be so much bigger.
Should be proper now.<eos> Great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Troop leader's name was Adam Cross.<eos> Apparently, he said he heard something in the woods, went to check it out.<eos> That's where the electrostatic anomaly occurred.<eos> What I don't understand is, usually, they're caused by a massive electrical storm...<eos> But there wasn't a storm within a thousand miles<eos> - of here last night.<eos> - This anomaly's different ... it has a side effect we've never seen before.
Nice to finally put a face to the name.<eos> Likewise.<eos> These are Agents May and Ward.<eos> Well, now that we've gotten that over with, here's what you can know.<eos> The intel you recovered from Agent Shaw tells us that a separatist group from South Ossetia has built a weapon called "ezbiitomet."<eos> - The overkill device?<eos> - A little dramatic for my taste.<eos> I imagine something was lost in translation.<eos> We've intercepted chatter that tells us they plan to use the weapon in the next 24 hours to declare their independence from Russia and Georgia.<eos> We believe it creates sonic vibrations powerful enough to trigger weapons from a great distance ... anything from the missiles on a helicopter to a nuclear warhead sitting in its silo.
Depends on the cartridge.<eos> What happens if you, like... you know, pause it?<eos> Start something else?<eos> You'd be stuck with a hunk of junk.<eos> And then Dr. Grey would have to start over, sending her back a whole day in her research, resulting in her desire to murder me.<eos> Hmm.<eos> (folder closes)<eos> Great.<eos> Vertebral artery is tortuous.<eos> See, it's compressing the facial nerve which is the source of the twitch.
(breathing heavily)<eos> (water dripping)<eos> We're not closing.<eos> There's a leak.<eos> There's a leak.<eos> I see a small bubble, so there's a leak.<eos> We'll patch it.<eos> - A bubble?<eos> I don't see anything.<eos> - It's there.
Jenny?<eos> It-it's 3:00 in the morning.<eos> I know, and I'm still awake!<eos> And I'm still wasted!<eos> Oh, no, your fingers aren't glowing!<eos> Oh, that's because he's poor.<eos> Oh, I am sorry, Alan.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Your skin is so soft.<eos> Guys, feel Alan's skin. It's so soft.
But he's coming down, he's depressed.<eos> Could be that just makes him more aware of what's at stake, if he confesses.<eos> So, when you went to visit him yesterday, you were already tweaked out on meth?<eos> I didn't see Gary yesterday.<eos> That's interesting, 'cause the rehab said that you did.<eos> Oh, yeah, I-I was there, but three days ago, not yesterday.<eos> Are you sure you're not mixing things up?<eos> You were pretty high.<eos> No way.<eos> Um, meth hypes you big-time, but it doesn't dull your memory.
You guys, this place is so gorgeous.<eos> I was just in the neighborhood dropping off papers at the Taylors' place.<eos> - Oh, I heard they sold.<eos> - They did. 30% over asking.<eos> Five solid offers.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> This place is a goldmine.<eos> Did the Taylors have to do a lot of work to their house before they put it up on the market?<eos> Because we haven't done anything in so long, and tell you the truth, we need a new roof.<eos> Sure, the Taylors' house was modernized, but it doesn't have the charm that this place has.
Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head.<eos> Just please, let me stay on this path, and I'll try to be cool about it.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You should apologize to Kenny too.<eos> I'm sorry, Kenny.<eos> That's okay, Kyle!<eos> What is the new information?<eos> The red cow... I saw it too.<eos> It came down from the sky in a flash of light.
Think about what I said.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Full view of the street.<eos> You can strip a man of his clothing but he's still got layers.<eos> He can still hide.<eos> Mindy, this is the longest you've ever gone without speaking.<eos> What are your feelings on it?<eos> What aren't my feelings on it?<eos> The way that there's a certain sadness to his... Thigh meat.<eos> The light, how it is refracting off of, um... The nads.
So Kurt Cobain threw his guitar and it hit you in the head?
I got bit... by a delusional, psychotic drug addict who think he's the undead.<eos> And I'm waiting for the guy's H.I.V. results.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I'm trying to be easy peasy.<eos> My first needle stick happened on a Tuesday.<eos> It was the second month of my third year in my internal medicine rotation.<eos> And my patient was suffering from end stage A.I.D.S.<eos> We had just switched over to these retractable needles.<eos> And when I went to put his into the hazardous waste, I...<eos> And it jammed right into my palm.
Wait, hold on a second.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Why the hell didn't you dicks show up to our balalaika concert?<eos> !<eos> I've got bigger problems right now than supporting your commie music!<eos> Stop!<eos> So what if I sound a little feminine?<eos> Stop laughing and treat me with the respect I deserve!<eos> My voice is not that not that high.<eos> It's a little higher than usual.
So...the only way is for me to leap.<eos> Leap?<eos> If I dither, I will die a spinster.<eos> I have some savings.<eos> A cottage that my brother left to me by the sea.<eos> I have told Mr Moray that I am leaving.<eos> Marrying.<eos> Leaving.<eos> Oh, I do so love the long trains.<eos> And the cut, what it does for a woman's body!
I see that now.<eos> Let us have ale, Landlord.<eos> The night is younger than I am!<eos> Let me show you this.<eos> You see this coin?<eos> OK, we're going to put it in this hand.<eos> Can you say, "abracadabra"?<eos> Abracadabra!<eos> And now blow.<eos> Oh, it's not there!
Why am I here?<eos> I lost a test subject last night, and you're gonna replace him. ♪The Vampire Diaries 05x09 ♪ The Cell Original Air Date on December 5, 2013<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man Dear diary, so here I am alive.<eos> Stefan saved me from killing myself.<eos> Now he's got me on suicide watch.<eos> He says it will be therapeutic for me to write down my feelings about the fact that I'm dying and there's nothing I can do about it.<eos> Deep thoughts, mortal coil, blah, blah, blah.<eos> Ugh. My hand's tired.<eos> What kind of sentimental idiot writes down everything they feel?<eos> Is what the prophecy meant when it said that all the doppelgangers were drawn together like magnets?
I know you're the woman I want And I'll do whatever it takes to keep from losing you.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Returning the basket.<eos> So, how did it go, lady only the special cheese for me?<eos> Your important friend like it?<eos> Is he a punishing man if he doesn't get The exact thing he wants the moment he wants it?<eos> Hard to imagine a more uncomfortable conversation About one's father.<eos> You don't even know what I'm talking about specifically.<eos> I know exactly what you're talking about.<eos> His attention drifted to you And now it's drifting elsewhere.
- Absolutely.<eos> - Great! - But I won't do it.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I put it to bed, okay?<eos> It's over. He'll do anything Keaton says.<eos> The letters are too powerful.<eos> I'm lying to my best friend.<eos> And I also feel like I'm betraying the real Keaton, who I really love.<eos> Well, then why did you tell me that whole story, Nick?<eos> Because it's a great story, and I'm a teller of stories.
Can't wait to meet the lucky broad who gets stuck having to listen to you snore for the rest of her life.<eos> Kids, dinner!<eos> Come eat now so this day can end and everyone can go home to their house that isn't this one.<eos> Has anyone seen my wife?<eos> She's going to miss this revolting bird-on-bird-on-bird action.<eos> Debbie used your stuffing recipe, Mom.<eos> Dad, that's your favorite, right?<eos> Tell Mom how that's your favorite.<eos> I never liked her stuffing.<eos> That's because it's too good for you, you nincompoop.
In actual fact, it's exactly the same unit as in Jeremy's Mercedes SLS.<eos> It's just Ferrari have put their own mapping, their own computer control on this particular one.<eos> And it's set up so that when you change, it spikes the engine revs so it surges when you change.<eos> Dear God!<eos> This body isn't just pretty, it's been sculpted to maximise the air flowing over it to generate down force to stick it to the road<eos> There have been a number of Black Special Edition Mercs in the past and almost all of them have been, well, dreadful, really. Undriveable.<eos> They generated too much torque. So every time you put your foot down, it felt like they were trying to tear themselves apart.<eos> You'd be going along and it'd be sucking birds and trees and squirrels into the engine and then ripping up the road and hurling chunks of tarmac out of the back and it was just...<eos> They were ridiculous.<eos> This, though, Mercedes has been clever because, yes, it generates more power than a standard SLS but 11 fewer torques.
But we decided instead to use the finest switchback roads in the world.<eos> This meant ditching the Mercedes and the Ferrari and opting for these instead.<eos> On a road like this, you need something small, you need a hot hatchback.<eos> And if you're going to get a hot hatchback, why not get the king? This one.<eos> The Golf GTI.<eos> I loved the Mk1 and the 16-valve Mk2 wasn't bad, either.<eos> But since then... I mean, they weren't bad but the magic went missing.<eos> With this one, though, the Mk7, it is back.<eos> This car can do everything.<eos> It's well made, it's sensibly priced.

He's got it wrong again.<eos> The Golf GTI, it's a brilliant car, it's probably the best all-rounder in the world.<eos> But that's... That's the point, an all-rounder is exactly what you don't need.<eos> An all-rounder is inevitably compromised.<eos> I just want pure distilled essence of hot hatch.<eos> And that means only one thing right now.<eos> The Fiesta ST.<eos> When Ford put this car together, they assembled all the right bits and thought, "Yeah, I reckon that would be good."<eos> I don't think they could possibly have known quite how good it was going to turn out to be, because it's astonishing.<eos> It's down on power compared to the Golf, yes.

Eventually, though, our ice creams melted completely so we set off.<eos> You know we were talking about the perfect road trip?<eos> How wrong would the Lamborghini and Bugatti have been here?<eos> Or the Ford Fiesta.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The problem is that when we arrived in Saint-Raphael, the traffic was predictable.<eos> And so was the E-Type.<eos> Hammond's car is sounding poorly.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Will it be able to do the traffic jam into Saint-Tropez?
Nissan 350Z.<eos> Three-and-a-half-litre V6, 276 brake horsepower, rear-wheel drive.<eos> Now, you might be looking at it, thinking, "Well,<eos> "it doesn't look much like a rally car."<eos> But hold on, this car is a direct descendant of the Datsun 240Z, a car that owned world rallying.<eos> So this has got history.<eos> It's going to be brilliant.<eos> I've got a BMW.<eos> No history of rallying at all, it's one of the reasons I like it.<eos> Well, come on, tell us about it, what engine has it got?
It doesn't seem right... us talking in here like this.<eos> I wanted to be somewhere private.<eos> - So let's get on with this, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Um... so can you think of anyone who would do a thing like this?<eos> No.<eos> Who have you been with in the last six months, besides me?<eos> I mean, I know we're not exclusive.<eos> No one.<eos> I need the truth... whatever it is.
Touché.<eos> What if Dr. Nieman isn't our killer?<eos> Castle, you saw her in there.<eos> She was toying with me.<eos> She's involved in this.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> I admit... she's not warm and cuddly.<eos> But that doesn't make her guilty.<eos> How can you of all people buy her story?<eos> Because at this point, it makes more sense than ours does.
This is really good.<eos> Why did I ever fight this?<eos> Have you thought about a concession speech?<eos> Oh, concession speech?<eos> Yeah, I wrote one.<eos> "Eat my shorts, Jabronies.<eos> Knope, out."<eos> I thought it best to revisit the concession speech at a later time.<eos> But we should focus on the haunted house.<eos> And you know what I think it needs, actually, is a papier-mâché li'l Sebastian!
A simple request from a man that I idolized.<eos> I just... never realized it would blow up into this.<eos> I should have just come out and asked you.<eos> It's not like I didn't suspect that you knew, but the chance that you didn't always stopped me.<eos> I hate that my first instinct is to protect her after everything she's done!<eos> You're not alone.<eos> Why do we do it?<eos> Because we see the broken and betrayed little girl inside.<eos> I understand if our relationship is finished.<eos> If it is...

Considering the trust between them is at an all-time low, they're going to want to account for every last bit.<eos> Which will keep them busy and bound together until my wedding day.<eos> We should have given it to them in pennies.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I had a fight with Nolan.<eos> His priorities are different now.<eos> Everything's off-balance.<eos> That's because you're caught between two worlds, Emily.<eos> And this life we've chosen it's a...<eos> It's a selfish one.
Here, the gigantic star, Eta Carinae, is the father of numerous baby stars.<eos> Eta Carinae has a mass 100 times greater than our sun.<eos> The star dust this nebula is made of consists of crystals, amorphous substances and molecular chains.<eos> This matter is blown apart by the radiating emissions of Eta Carinae.<eos> The particles are pushed away at different speeds, depending on their density. The results are chaotic shapes of fascinating beauty.<eos> Many different patterns emerge, with finger-like tubes being quite common.<eos> Here is a famous example that has been named the "Pillars of Creation".<eos> Quite fittingly, because in each of these fingertips, new stars are born.<eos> The matter here is very dense, compressed by solar radiation and gravity.<eos> Eventually, the pressure gets so high, it triggers an atomic explosion.
Back then, Earth was much closer to the sun, and was very, very hot.<eos> Its surface was made of one big ocean of lava.<eos> There was no solid crust, no land, not even water, just heat, lava and fire.<eos> Comets kept crashing into that brooding surface, raising the temperature with every hit.<eos> Eventually, the young planet suffered a massive collision with something huge, another planet in the making.<eos> The impact was so severe, it ripped off a part of the Earth's mantle.<eos> The debris then formed a ring around Earth.<eos> Again through the process of accretion, this rubble formed the moon over the course of millions of years.<eos> Earth, on the other hand, was thrown into a furious rotation by that horrendous impact.<eos> It was spinning so fast, a day lasted only six hours.

That makes them the subject of many old scriptures and legends.<eos> These suns were created when dinosaurs were still roaming the Earth, about 100 million years ago.<eos> Some experts believe that our sun also was born in a dense star-forming region like the Pleiades, and moved to its current position over the course of millions of years.<eos> All this information can be deduced from today's opportunities to examine the incredible clockwork that is space.<eos> Early astronomers didn't have that luxury.<eos> In the very beginning, they had to use their naked eye to make out the different stellar objects.<eos> One of the brightest in the night sky was Jupiter, so the Romans named it after their main god.<eos> As telescopes were invented and improved, vision got clearer and clearer.<eos> Today, especially thanks to human space probes like Voyager, we have a very good understanding of this largest planet in our solar system.<eos> The Babylonians called Jupiter the "King's Star", and, indeed, it reigns over its own little realm.

Proof of this is the fact that the axis of Uranus is severely tilted.<eos> Seen from Earth, we look at it almost from above.<eos> Neptune, on the other hand, has an internal energy source and, therefore, displays a lot more weather effects.<eos> In the upper layers of the atmosphere, we see gigantic clouds, several thousand miles long.<eos> They form in stripes, because of the high rotation speed of the planet.<eos> At the poles, we have auroras, northern lights that look much more complex than those we have on Earth.<eos> This phenomenon occurs when charged particles of the solar winds enter the atmosphere.<eos> Jupiter's auroras are even bigger, though.<eos> No surprise, as the planet is almost too big to be true.<eos> If it had gathered some more mass during its creation, it could have ignited to become a sun all of its own.
And scientists have been very busy here.<eos> The first planet that had a human-built visitor was Venus<eos> The probe Mariner 2 flew by in December, 1962.<eos> Venus is the second brightest object in the night sky, after the moon.<eos> Sometimes we can even see it during daytime. The reason for this is Venus' dense light-reflecting atmosphere, combined with its close proximity to Earth.<eos> And, in addition to being our nearest neighbour, Venus is even called the "sister planet" of Earth. This is because the two of them share approximately the same size, density and mass.<eos> Likewise, the gravitational force on Venus is close to 90% of ours.<eos> But, in spite of these resemblances, there are major differences that spoil any potential for Venus to serve as a holiday destination<eos> The number one barrier is Venus' atmosphere.<eos> Comprising almost exclusively of carbon dioxide, it is toxic for us.
Sulphuric clouds, acid rain and active volcanoes are all on the list of local attractions.<eos> In addition, the heavy clouds are rocked by lightning and thunderclaps.<eos> The surface is adorned with huge volcanoes.<eos> Among them is Maat Mons, a giant 5 miles high, towering over the other Venusian volcanoes.<eos> In total, there are over 50,000 of them.<eos> Another distinctive feature of Venus are its lava channels of incredible size.<eos> One of them even out-competes the Nile, Earth's longest river.<eos> It's called Hildr Fossa, and measures 4,200 miles long.<eos> Even though Venus is our nearest neighbour, the best-explored extraterrestrial planet is Mars.<eos> This makes sense, as it would be much better suited for actual human visitors.
Even though Venus is our nearest neighbour, the best-explored extraterrestrial planet is Mars.<eos> This makes sense, as it would be much better suited for actual human visitors.<eos> Scientists are currently expecting a manned mission to the Red Planet in the '30s or '40s of this century.<eos> So what do we know so far?<eos> Mars is a rocky body, just like Earth.<eos> But it's only half the diameter of Earth, which makes it the second smallest planet of our solar system.<eos> Its red colour comes from high amounts of iron oxide, also known as rust, that is spread throughout the planet and its atmosphere.<eos> The air here consists of carbon dioxide and is very thin, so Mars cannot store much of the sun's warmth.<eos> Near the equator, temperatures are around 32 degrees Fahrenheit during the daytime.<eos> At night, it plummets to minus 121.
Makemake is a Polynesian god,<eos> Sedna, the Inuit goddess of the sea, and Haumea, the Hawaiian goddess of child birth.<eos> Still, all of these are hardly more than asteroids, drifting through cold, dark space.<eos> The real wonders are outside the boundaries of our solar system.<eos> After all, our sun is only one star of an estimated 400 billion in our galaxy, the Milky Way.<eos> And recent calculations have come to the conclusion that over half these suns could have one or more Earth-sized planets.<eos> So let's have a closer look at the structure of our home galaxy.<eos> From Earth, you can see parts of the Milky Way with your naked eye.<eos> It's made from the light of millions of faraway stars, arranged in a disc-like structure.<eos> Since we are looking at it from the inside, it appears to be a band of milky fog across the sky.
The constant eruptions hurl scorching lava up to 180 miles high.<eos> Aside from the huge lava pools that are up to 250 miles wide, there are also rivers of lava, that flow hundreds of miles.<eos> Next to the burning heat of the lava, the temperature instantly drops to minus 200 degrees.<eos> Extreme conditions like these can't exactly be called life-friendly environments.<eos> Our next stop in the vicinity appears to be even colder.<eos> We're closing in on Europa.<eos> This moon is covered with an ice crust 6 miles deep.<eos> Europa has a very thin atmosphere, mostly made up of oxygen.<eos> The surface is very bright and is among the smoothest and youngest of all moons.<eos> It features a network of chaotic ridges and trenches which is visually striking.
We have less than four hours.<eos> You think we don't know that?<eos> What, is Zanetakos gonna come out of surgery by then?<eos> Because that was the only lead we have!<eos> I told you to calm down.<eos> The bomb...<eos> What do you know?<eos> We know what you know.<eos> It's built into a car, German-made.<eos> It's dirty.
The bomb's not just inside the car.<eos> - It is the car.<eos> - Well, we've got minutes here.<eos> What we've got is a big-ass problem.<eos> There's over 2,000 people who work in this harbor.<eos> - It will take hours to evacuate.<eos> - We've only got 10 minutes.<eos> Can I explain something?<eos> This thing is radiological.<eos> When it detonates, it will go airborne, and everything within a five-mile radius will be contaminated.
Regret will haunt you, if you let Daniel go.<eos> I want to tell you my plan for August 8th--<eos> The day Victoria goes down for the murder of Emily Thorne.<eos> I'm not asking you to commit to anything.<eos> I just can't commit to Emily, not when I feel this way about you.<eos> - I went to the doctor.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> We're pregnant.<eos> When facing your enemy, no amount of training can trump nature.<eos> It separates the strong from the weak.

Man, I came on too strong. Gosh dang it!<eos> My dad warned me about that when I turned 14.<eos> He said, "son, you're about to be the man of the family.<eos> "You got to learn to give people time to see how special you are."<eos> Why were you the man of the family?<eos> - He sort of died.<eos> - How?<eos> I don't want to bring you down, little man.<eos> Neither did my dad.<eos> He'd say, "my disease can't be all bad if it rhymes with 'answer.'"
He did.<eos> Wendell Kaiser.<eos> McGee... see if Sergeant Dunne had a gambling problem or any connection to this guy.<eos> Check out Olivia Chandler.<eos> With pleasure.<eos> Thank you, Boss.<eos> May I help you?<eos> I hope so.<eos> I love this car.<eos> It's smoking hot.
And who lie about how they found each other.<eos> So, please leave now.<eos> Just...<eos> Ugh!<eos> Ugh!<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> We shouldn't have lied about our story.<eos> I love our story.<eos> Sure, it's messy, but it's the story
You see a lot of them, because they're easy to buy.<eos> Did you examine the Lobera .38<eos> - that killed Tim Sorrentino?<eos> - Yes. I compared it to five separate Loberas that I bought<eos> - from five different stores.<eos> - Why?<eos> To ensure that my test sample was random.<eos> And what did you find?<eos> The trigger mechanism had a faulty spring, and the resistance was 75% less than normal.<eos> So with this kind of hair trigger, could a gun discharge if it hit the ground?

Okay, what about after the war?<eos> I tried. But the police said there wasn't enough evidence to open an investigation.<eos> Okay, when did this alleged crime take place?<eos> May 24, 1943. Approximately 3:15 in the afternoon.<eos> Why would Ezra Clark kill your father?<eos> Our katana.<eos> Ezra Clark shot my father for it.<eos> A samurai sword.<eos> That's right.<eos> And it belonged to my family for centuries, passed down from generation to generation.
Chin, was Joseph a GI?<eos> No, but I'm guessing he must've paid his brother a visit at the camp, and then used his access to rip off some internees.<eos> What else you got on Archer?<eos> Well, he was in and out of trouble his whole life.<eos> Mostly petty stuff, uh... property and auto theft.<eos> Uh, then in 1952, he graduated to the big time and was arrested for murder.<eos> He died in Halawa serving out a life sentence.<eos> We need to run down that homicide report.<eos> I'm way ahead of you.<eos> The murder weapon was a .38, and it's still in HPD custody.
Okay, get him on vanc and clinda, stat.<eos> Call upstairs. I need an O.R. right now.<eos> What about the murmur?<eos> Could the infection have traveled to his heart?<eos> His vitals are stable.<eos> So first, we've got to clean out that joint, okay?<eos> We can't afford any delays.<eos> Okay. Should I call Yang?<eos> All right, if she's not available in the next five minutes, she waits until post-op.<eos> We've got to get in there and kill this infection before it spreads any further.
I'm going to need your help.<eos> But most of all, I never want to lose your friendship.<eos> Denise!<eos> Kippers!<eos> I don't even LIKE kippers.<eos> I'm sure Susy'll help you out.<eos> What are you doing in my shop?<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> What are you doing in my shop?<eos> ! It was empty.
I prefer to honour the tradition that has been observed down the years.<eos> You've earned your place, ma'am, the title is a gesture of respect.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> If I may... there is much talk of loyalty in a place like this.<eos> Most of it is talk and no more.<eos> I had no wish for Susy to...<eos> Please, ma'am, let me go on.<eos> Loyalty is a special gift.<eos> It binds people like no other cause.

You have an idea in mind, sir?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> What is it?<eos> I'd rather not say.<eos> There is no room for hesitation.<eos> You must go after her, Moray, with all those charms you're famous for.<eos> I realise that this is something I need to ask your husband about, but I felt obliged to seek your permission first since it's such a personal matter, such a tender issue to you.<eos> What could be so sensitive?<eos> Your father's watch.<eos> I can't shake off the idea that it would make the most magical centrepiece for a display...

Yes.<eos> I... He asked me and...<eos> Then you must make the most of the occasion.<eos> I have had a change of heart.<eos> My father's watch.<eos> I appreciate now that your intention is to honour my father by putting it on display.<eos> I see no good reason not to concede to your wishes.<eos> Then I am most grateful.<eos> Sam, it seems we have your centrepiece for you.<eos> It is over a hundred years old.
Her father bequeathed that the piece was to be passed on to the man she married.<eos> Now you see, sir, why this is impossible for me to tell.<eos> Carry on.<eos> She has decided not to tell you of her father's wishes.<eos> You heard her telling Moray this?<eos> She asked him to keep it a secret, between them.<eos> I see.<eos> Mr Weston, I'm afraid I can't accept your kind of offer of a trip to Paris.<eos> I promise you, gentlemen.<eos> When I closed up my counter it was there.
Don't you, Moray?<eos> Non. I've never seen him before.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Not at all, Clemence.<eos> We appreciate your trying.<eos> We could use his money to buy a plot and pay for a burial.<eos> A headstone can come later, if his identity is ever learned.<eos> Find somewhere to put him until arrangements can be made.<eos> Moray can't be expected to share his office with a corpse.<eos> I love the river when it is like this, don't you?

Or perhaps he was exactly where he wanted to be.<eos> Just happy.<eos> What would it take to be so fulfilled?<eos> Every man has to decide for himself what it is that makes life worth living.<eos> And if a man loses the things that makes his life worth living, what then?<eos> That would depend on the man.<eos> I have lost The Paradise.<eos> I've lost Denise.<eos> I've not been able to win either of them back.<eos> I thought that this would grow easier, but every day, the pain, it gets worse.
In case you ever make it back to the states.<eos> You are on U.S. soil now, I am the federal government, and I am telling you that this... is the deal.<eos> That is a napkin.<eos> Take it or leave it.<eos> I'll leave it.<eos> Kim?<eos> Agent Fischer.<eos> Agent Fischer.<eos> Have you seen the stapler?<eos> It busted yesterday.

Give you the horrifying death that you so deserve.<eos> Then do it.<eos> Yeah. When it's time.<eos> You see, sadly, this isn't my surprise party.<eos> I am merely the hired help.<eos> My job was to get you to the venue.<eos> And while I would pay a high price to silence you forever, others have paid much more for the chance to hear what you have to say.<eos> Anesthesia blocks the impulses to the brain so one doesn't feel the sensation of pain.<eos> The drug that the kind doctor is giving you does the opposite.<eos> It enhances the impulses received by the brain.
He's never gonna get in.<eos> You missed.<eos> Really?<eos> Tell me you saw that.<eos> Untraceable? !<eos> It is $40 million!<eos> Find it!<eos> How did he do it?<eos> His war on Starling City's cancerous criminal elite had begun.<eos> But Oliver never imagined the extent of the disease... or just how far it had spread.
Does Frederick know he's Ethan's real father?<eos> When Ethan was 5, he... he developed Kurz, and they... they told us it was untreatable.<eos> Frederick wouldn't accept that.<eos> He had contacts in the pharmaceutical industry.<eos> He reached out to them to secure research funding into the disease, but everyone turned him down.<eos> Why?<eos> Kurz is too rare.<eos> Small disease means small profits.<eos> That's why Barnes is killing.<eos> He wants to infect enough people th Kurz disease that it gets on the public's radar.
- Pan?<eos> - He's dead.<eos> His curse remains.<eos> Can you stop it?<eos> Or should we all start preparing our souls?<eos> 'Cause mine's gonna take some time.<eos> It's here!<eos> It's here!<eos> The curse!<eos> It's here!
Henry?<eos> I can never see him again.<eos> I have no choice.<eos> I have to undo what I started.<eos> The curse that brought us to Storybrooke.<eos> That created Storybrooke.<eos> It doesn't belong here.<eos> And neither do any of us.<eos> Breaking the curse destroys the town.<eos> It will wink out of existence as though it were never here.
And you have to go back there.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> This isn't over.<eos> I'll see both of you again.<eos> That's quite the vessel you captain there, Swan.<eos> There's not a day will go by I won't think of you.<eos> Good.<eos> Emma... there's something I haven't told you.<eos> What now?<eos> When the curse washes over us, it will send us all back.
Maybe we should've stayed in the palace.<eos> It's fine.<eos> We just... need to find a way out of here.<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Snow!<eos> Don't look back! Aah! Charming!<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> The shadow.<eos> It killed her.
Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Snow!<eos> Don't look back! Aah! Charming!<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> The shadow.<eos> It killed her.<eos> Pan's shadow?<eos> I trapped it on the sail.<eos> Yeah, well, it got free.

Law firms there will perform your document review for pennies on the dollar.<eos> And your markup...<eos> - Zach, I'm in a meeting.<eos> - Someone's ratting your computer.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Remote Access Tool.<eos> RAT.<eos> The hacker infects your computer with it, and they can use your webcam to spy on you.<eos> Is someone doing that with my computer? Yeah.<eos> I came in here, the webcam light was on, and then it shut off by itself. - When?
One last question before we come back for the official evaluation later in the week.<eos> Why do you want to be a principal?<eos> Now, I know everyone wants to wear the crown, but the fantasy of it can be quite different from the reality.<eos> Well, more than anyone I have ever met, I was born to be in charge.<eos> Test scores are up.<eos> Kids are showing up.<eos> Our sports teams are winning.<eos> Heck, even the Glee Club is back competing for the national title of clubs no one really cares about.<eos> And all of this is happening because I can finally manifest my vision without having to clear it with some fool.<eos> You give me this school, and in one year it will be the top school in the state.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
He's got defective genes, just like you.<eos> You touch him, and I'll send you to hell.<eos> Is that a promise? Huh?<eos> Because when I make a promise, I keep it.<eos> Where's the safe deposit box?<eos> Which bank?<eos> Or I kill you and your kid.<eos> You know what?<eos> Put the kid out of his misery before he turns out like his old man.<eos> Bank's in Hoboken, Jefferson and 9th, but it won't be open this time of night.
Good!<eos> All right, next up, we have a very special guest joining us.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for...<eos> - Harold Grossman!<eos> - Wait.<eos> What?<eos> Uh, never really done anything like this before.<eos> Uh, some of the gang down at the pharmacy talked me into it, so...<eos> Turns out Harold Grossman, our pharmacist, is a rock star.<eos> His voice is the drug he should be dispensing, because apparently, it's the cure for everything.
That means... what?<eos> Go. That's what we want him to investigate.<eos> Right.

"Man you love die in space so you marry Bah Bah now."<eos> We need find you new man.<eos> Thanks, Mah Mah, but I'm just not over Jeff.<eos> That's because you still surrounded by him.<eos> Reminders everywhere.<eos> You need to get rid of his stuff.<eos> Hey, that was mine!

Brilliant engineering.<eos> Wow, this guy must've cut the beaver's work in half.<eos> Yeah, we can't take him out until we build another dam upstream, so this area doesn't flood and destroy all the evidence.<eos> Based on the supraorbital margin, narrow nasal aperture, and minimal dental wear,<eos> I'd say the victim is a Caucasoid male between the ages of 28 and 32.<eos> Insect activity indicates he's been here about three days.<eos> Agent Booth.<eos> Yeah?<eos> We found a blood trail at the top of the hill by the maintenance shed.<eos> It leads down the slope to the river bed.
Axe Cop, you gotta help me look for Uni-baby's horn.<eos> No time, Dinosaur Soldier.<eos> We need to see if this thing can do stunts.<eos> Look, roundhouse.<eos> I wish to be a bad guy.<eos> Flute Cop, Uni-baby, how was your day together...<eos> Oh my gosh.<eos> Where's her horn?<eos> ! Uh, where's her horn?<eos> It was just her baby horn and it fell out.

Was she a genie as well?<eos> No, she was quite human.<eos> As was I when I was born.<eos> You mean... you haven't always been a genie?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Oh, because I'm a genie now, and I fear I shall be a genie for the rest of my days.<eos> My life as a human was a long time ago.<eos> And your mother? Is she still...<eos> I don't know.<eos> This compass... it has great magic.

We're closed.<eos> Party's over.<eos> I'm not here for that.<eos> I'm here for your help.<eos> Hmm. I've been called many things.<eos> Helpful isn't one of them.<eos> I've heard you can make people disappear.<eos> People who never want to be found again.<eos> But the cost of such a thing is significant.<eos> I own but one thing of any value, but you help me, and it shall be yours.
In my experience, when I have to work too hard to find an answer, there isn't one.<eos> Maybe the reason we can't crack this case is because there's nothing to crack.<eos> What if Angela really did commit suicide?<eos> She was depressed, she jumped off the bridge into the Chesapeake, and her body washed out to sea.<eos> So, you think I've lost my mind?<eos> I think certain people never know when to give up.<eos> You're probably right.<eos> I can be stubborn.<eos> But not on this one.<eos> I have a new lead and it points to someone in the White House.
Say "Yes" and you'll have your man.<eos> He's willing to actually get married, too, which is more than your family is offering.<eos> - It's Bash.<eos> - While Bash was riding to six different companies, it appears someone loyal to the English rode straight to Calais and warned them.<eos> France can't help.<eos> There are no more troops to send.<eos> You should marry Tomas.<eos> Who designed the target?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Well, they say it looks like the castle ghost.

ABOUT THIS SAME TIME,<eos> ROME WAS BREAKING GROUND FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MAGNIFICENT NEW SAINT PETER'S BASILICA.<eos> THE CHURCH SENT JOHN TETZEL, A DOMINICAN FRIAR, TO GERMANY TO SELL INDULGENCES IN ORDER TO RAISE THE FUNDS NECESSARY FOR THE CATHEDRAL.<eos> THE CHURCH BELIEVES, NOT ONLY THAT ITS SERVICES AND OFFERINGS CAN HELP THE DEAD,<eos> THE CHURCH CAN SIMPLY DECLARE THAT SOMEONE'S PENALTIES OWED AFTER THEY DIED ARE JUST WIPED OUT.<eos> THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED AN INDULGENCE.<eos> THE FULL PLENARY INDULGENCE ABSOLVED A PERSON OF ALL THE SINS THAT THEY HAD COMMITTED UP TO THAT TIME<eos> AND THUS SPEEDED YOU, ACCORDING TO CHURCH TEACHING, THROUGH PURGATORY DIRECTLY INTO HEAVEN.<eos> BY VERY LATE IN THE MIDDLE AGES,<eos> THE CHURCH HAS GOT INTO ITS HEAD THAT IT CAN SAY TO PEOPLE,
It says here that she was taken from a school parking lot.<eos> Bonnie was a teacher's aide at a preschool.<eos> One night, she stayed late to decorate for Halloween, But she never came home.<eos> There were signs of a struggle near her car.<eos> A few weeks later, they found her.<eos> That fits his pattern with two of the other women.<eos> When bonnie was found, They said she'd been held for 11 or 12 days.<eos> Now I wonder if he had had her Up at this parents' house on oneida lake.<eos> The bundsch family has a second home?<eos> Well, it's just his now; his parents passed away.
Better that than losing my life!<eos> That's not going to happen.<eos> You said it yourself.<eos> "Because we are men of pluck...<eos> "..of mettle...<eos> ..and unfailing courage."<eos> It was unnerving...unerring courage.<eos> I hate this desert.<eos> I wish for you to retrieve... ..a box.<eos> It is to be found in Campe's lair in Hades.
You're Asian.<eos> I get the feeling he's one of those Asians that loves Mexicans.<eos> Yeah, that's exactly what I am.<eos> And if he says stuff like that again, I will kung fu his Mexican black ass.<eos> All right, well, this was a complete train wreck.<eos> Experiment's over.<eos> Turn in your signs.<eos> You don't know what it's like in prison, Charlie.<eos> Your race defines you.<eos> It helps you survive.
Look, I'd better go.<eos> It's full of fluids.<eos> Look, let's just leave it.<eos> It clearly wants us to.<eos> Look, about what I said last night.<eos> It didn't really come out how I'd imagined it.<eos> What's that?<eos> Is this ours?<eos> Well, I don't think anyone else had sex in the tent.<eos> It's empty.
Is this ours?<eos> Well, I don't think anyone else had sex in the tent.<eos> It's empty.<eos> I mean, were you definitely wearing it?<eos> Yes, Miss Marple.<eos> Look, just chuck it in with all the other detritus.<eos> Are you sure you had it on, you know, when you actually...?<eos> I think so.<eos> You made me drink about a gallon of booze.<eos> I remember it going on, but maybe it... popped off.

Sometimes it's hard to get purchase.<eos> So, I'm now pregnant because you've got a thin penis?<eos> It's not thin, it's just smooth.
Oh, funny that you should say that, because there's nothing honest about you, and I can finally prove it.<eos> Here's the "after."<eos> Clearly not you.<eos> Ready for the "before"?<eos> And there you are, Emily.<eos> Looks just like you, but with a billion fewer dollars.<eos> What do you want, Lydia?<eos> For starters, I want my house back.<eos> It helped being next door to land a Grayson, didn't it?<eos> It's yours.
You go.<eos> It's cool.<eos> Henry and I will sit back here and gongoozle our asses off.<eos> Now who's the Scrooge?<eos> Be careful, Crane.<eos> Who's there?<eos> As you so proudly boast of your clairvoyance, your query suggests you're lying or merely playing coy.<eos> Show yourselves.<eos> Curious.<eos> Your aura, it's...
A saint's name is a sign.<eos> When you know my meaning, war will take form.<eos> And the End of Days begins.<eos> There will be no End of Days.<eos> You hear me? !<eos> Your death is assured.<eos> You and the second witness.<eos> Face me, coward!<eos> I touched her soul once.<eos> Soon it will be mine forever.
Normal.<eos> Car Four at Island Eastern Corridor. Normal.<eos> Island Eastern Corridor, eastbound.<eos> One driver plus two persons. Enough.<eos> Add me in.<eos> Should be interesting.<eos> Does he need to be that serious?<eos> Is it your first day with Inspector Lui?<eos> According to the Observatory, a tropical depression is forming in the north of the South China Sea.<eos> It's moving north slowly at 30 kilometres per hour, and generating waves four or five meters high.
Well, there is.<eos> It's a ferrule.<eos> Anyway, he accidentally pressed the button, which opened the umbrella whilst it was in his arsehole!<eos> Did that really happen?<eos> You bet your sweet bippy it happened.<eos> My gap year 'dotes are the stuff of legend.<eos> Do you have any more?<eos> I have seven more.<eos> Are you drawing an outline of your head?<eos> I think it's swelling up, so I'm taking hourly measurements.
The character Hilda, who is in no way based on you, is bad.<eos> Have you told her yet?<eos> I tried to, but my head's throbbing and I keep vomiting air.<eos> Huh! Faking illness to get out of the high jump.<eos> Old school.<eos> I like it.<eos> I'm not faking it.<eos> I think the drugs they're giving us are causing my system to shut down.<eos> Look, I need to try this anecdote out on you.<eos> I've been told it's hilarious, but it went down like spunk soup.
Yet another useless invoice that smells like cinnamon.<eos> Excuse me for making a bold deodorant choice.<eos> I like it.<eos> It's like sleeping next to a snickerdoodle.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> I think I found something.<eos> "Waste disposal procedure.<eos> Must be dumped in the..."<eos> We need the second page.<eos> Well, it's not here.
Well, I can't drive past a sad grocery store ho.<eos> Fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you fill Sean's car with manure.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Poo? Caca?<eos> Doo-doo?<eos> That guy cheated on me, then he lied about it.<eos> He's full of crap, so I want his car to be, too.<eos> I want it full, I want it stinking.
We don't date below AEPi.<eos> Say, uh, how long do you think this is gonna take?<eos> 'Cause I'm supposed to meet Lauren for coffee.<eos> - About that...<eos> - Okay.<eos> Here it comes.<eos> The talk.<eos> Look, I know you and I had a moment, but this thing with Lauren...<eos> it's completely blindsided me, but it seems to be moving forward kind of fast.<eos> So, if you want to stop this rocket ship, just speak up now before it leaves the station that rocket ships... that they take off from.
All right.<eos> Deal.<eos> You did it, baby.<eos> You're a genius.<eos> Oh, God...<eos> Oy, vey! That genius just huzzed on the house treasurer.<eos> Whoo! Sorry, Avi!<eos> Okay, people, toss 'em out.<eos> There are no bad ideas.<eos> If we put really small furniture in the room, it'll look bigger.
I am a man of my word.<eos> Perhaps there is a way for you to keep your head upon your shoulders.<eos> Tell me what it is you wish for me to do.<eos> I will spare your life if you perform a simple errand for me.<eos> I wish for you to retrieve a box.<eos> What's inside this box?<eos> That, you do not need to know.<eos> You must deliver it to me unopened.<eos> Where will I find it?<eos> It is to be found in Campe's lair in Hades.
There is more mould on this bread than there is bread itself.<eos> If we are to eat breakfast today, we will have to visit the market.<eos> Hercules. A dozen more paces and he would have actually made it to his own bed.<eos> Wake up, you drunken fool!<eos> I am ashamed to call you a friend.<eos> They've taken Medusa.<eos> If I don't deliver the box by midnight, Kyros will kill her.<eos> What's inside the box?<eos> Kyros wouldn't say.<eos> He said it was to remain unopened.
We won our freedom.<eos> We're not actually dead, as in DEAD dead.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> And we don't have much time...<eos> We are here to retrieve a box.<eos> Medusa's life depends upon it.<eos> What is in this box?<eos> We don't know.<eos> All we know is it's to be found in Campe's lair in Tartarus.
It's such a small box.<eos> What could be inside it?<eos> I've been wondering the same thing myself.<eos> Where's this Campe that guards the box?<eos> Fortunately for us, she's not here.<eos> Let's retrieve the box and leave before she returns.<eos> You must not open the box.<eos> It will cause great suffering.<eos> What's inside it?<eos> It is said that it once belonged to Pandora, the first woman on Earth.

Where will you go?<eos> How will I find you?<eos> You won't.<eos> I don't want you to search for me.<eos> You can never look on me again.<eos> You must think that I am dead.<eos> I will not do it.<eos> This is all my doing.<eos> I will not rest until I find a way to lift this curse.<eos> I have seen the evil that it can do.
I will not rest until I find a way to lift this curse.<eos> I have seen the evil that it can do.<eos> You must keep it somewhere that no-one can ever open it.<eos> It will be done.<eos> Did you know?<eos> Did you know that this was going to happen?<eos> We both knew what would become of Medusa.<eos> I did not know how, or when it would happen.<eos> How can the curse be lifted?<eos> It cannot.
Chirac, Prime Minister?<eos> Chirac, Prime Minister.<eos> - We'll think about it.<eos> - You must've expected it.<eos> He's led the deputies who campaigned for Giscard, but you are the inspiration.<eos> Because Marie-France Garaud and I are Chirac's advisors, just as we were Georges Pompidou's.<eos> Exalting task.<eos> So, what do you think of our candidate for Matignon?<eos> We also thought of Robert Boulin.<eos> Whatever the future president's decision may be, it'll be the right one, since it'll be Gaullist.
There is another solution, Valéry.<eos> The dissolution of the Assembly.<eos> A new election would give you the majority, without de Gaulle and Pompidou's ghosts.<eos> Michel...<eos> We'd lose that election.<eos> My advance on Mitterrand is not significant.<eos> The French aren't stupid.<eos> If a majority is needed for their new president, they'll give it.<eos> But I already have it.<eos> It needs to be appeased, and that's why I want Chirac.
Only your dialogue.<eos> Your prose is much better.<eos> You've never read any of my prose.<eos> So, is this where you live now?<eos> Oh, God, no!<eos> Ha-ha-ha! Only during the week.<eos> At weekends I'm back at Mum and Dad's.<eos> Just an accumulation of various shit things, really.<eos> It's funny, you think your life's all sorted.<eos> Then one thing leads to another and before you know it, it's not.
Why are you looking at me like that?<eos> Because there's something I need you to do and I'm not sure you're going to like it.<eos> I did not know when I would see you again.<eos> I thought you saw everything.<eos> Only that which the gods permit me to see.<eos> Is there something you wish to know?<eos> It is not knowledge I seek.<eos> I need Pandora's box.<eos> Why would you ask for such a thing?<eos> You've seen the horrors it can unleash.

Poke, poke, poke...<eos> Stop poking me.<eos> He meant no harm.<eos> The box.<eos> Show him the box.<eos> Ah. This is the box you told me about?<eos> It's a source of great evil.<eos> It seems such a simple little box...<eos> Don't be fooled by its appearance.<eos> It must remain unopened.
- In the dead of night.<eos> What time is that?<eos> Can't help you with that either.<eos> Thanks a lot, jerk.<eos> Hey, don't shoot the messenger.<eos> But feel free to flash him your bra.<eos> Damn it.<eos> _<eos> You found a dress already?<eos> It found me.
Fine.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I will no longer actively try to destroy you.<eos> _ _ _<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I've seen it all.<eos> Heck, I've done it all.<eos> But I'm going to need your key back.<eos> Right.<eos> I don't know where it is.
Okay, lady. Let me buy you a drink.<eos> Actually, you should buy me one since I did this pro bono.<eos> - You want a ride?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Buddha was definitely onto something with this whole cosmic punishment-reward system.<eos> My desirable act of getting Val's job back had produced a corresponding good result.<eos> I was going to prom with Matty.<eos> And if the super-chill Asian guy was a man of his word, it wouldn't be long before I was calling him my boyfriend.<eos> By him, I meant Matty.<eos> If I was putting that thought into the universe, I wanted it to be crystal clear.
- I meant that as a compliment.<eos> I don't wanna bring you down.<eos> Well, that would be impossible.<eos> Matty's gonna ask me to prom.<eos> - You need a dress.<eos> - No more shopping.<eos> I actually already found the perfect dress, but I only have $400 in savings.<eos> - How much is this dress?<eos> - 750.<eos> What is it, made of $20 bills?
She's not really in the Social Care Group.<eos> Her father is...<eos> Her father passed away.<eos> - Her mother.<eos> - Eat.<eos> It's my older brother.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm glad you're here.<eos> Where did you park this car two days ago?<eos> It's always in front of my house.
Mm. Is that what the kids are calling it now?<eos> Why is the Japanese family at table six wearing surgical masks?<eos> Because they're paranoid.<eos> Are you sick? Uh!<eos> No, I've got allergies.<eos> Well, either way, you don't look too good.<eos> Maybe you should go home.<eos> Maybe I should, Gabriel.<eos> Maybe we should all go home and be with our loved ones 'cause death is coming!<eos> It's coming for you and you and you and you!
That is so...<eos> Something sisters usually share.<eos> Well, yeah. We started dating right after Lewis and I got divorced.<eos> Before that, it was totally platonic with a little bit of Skype sex.<eos> Good to know.<eos> So banging more than gavels, are we?<eos> Well, the jury may have convicted her, but as the presiding Judge, I believe...<eos> The only thing Meredith stole was my heart.<eos> How's that serenity coming?<eos> It just came back up.
I wouldn't speak. I wouldn't defend myself.<eos> I wanted to pay the price.<eos> For not having saved my mum.<eos> Then I went to jail.<eos> He did it.<eos> The descent is the hard part.<eos> And this one is a hell of a drop.<eos> It was too soon.<eos> His shoulder is still bad.<eos> It could dislocate.
- Do what you like.<eos> Victor?<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> - Aren't you eating with me?<eos> I'm not eating on my own.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Your thyme crust is delicious.<eos> How do you make it creamy like that?
In fact I was wrong.<eos> You're irredeemable.<eos> There's nothing in you to be saved.<eos> I resign.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> That's right. You go! Go!<eos> You'd have sold it anyway, like your father's company!<eos> What?<eos> Your thyme crust is delicious.<eos> How do you make it creamy like that?
What did you just say?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - No, I believe...<eos> I'm sure that we would all like to hear it.<eos> Didi, I understand that your husband is a tradesman?<eos> Um, yeah.<eos> Darnell does masonry...<eos> Concrete.<eos> I wonder if he would like to have a crack at my driveway.<eos> It needs repaving.
You understand me?<eos> Who drove that Impala in here?<eos> Where was the gun?<eos> In the trunk, in the lid.<eos> Who found it?<eos> I did.<eos> What did T.J. say when he realized it was gone?<eos> Nothing.<eos> He didn't realize it was gone.<eos> He never knew it was there.
And if I refuse?<eos> Need I remind you that you swore an oath?<eos> If you fail, it will not only be YOUR life I take.<eos> Wait!<eos> That will not come out.<eos> We're going to have to get a new table.<eos> Perhaps we'll have to trek to Circe's cave and demand she pays for it.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> I'm very fond of this table.<eos> It has sentimental value.

Mitchell, how's that donkey coming along?<eos> It arrived from Romania about an hour ago.<eos> Oh, amazing.<eos> Have you got the certificate?<eos> What certificate?<eos> Right, here's half the donkey.<eos> The rest I gave to the kitchens.<eos> I figured you couldn't eat it all.<eos> Alfredo, this meat is lovely!<eos> It's so bloody moist!
Bériot had nothing to do with yesterday's events.<eos> He's still an Anti-National. And the attack took place at his school.<eos> It really seems like you're protecting him.<eos> If you want to transfer me, don't hesitate.<eos> When I want to transfer you you'll be the first to know.<eos> Now listen, the Mayor has been shot.<eos> This is serious, even if it is Chassagne.<eos> Have you made any progress on the attacker ?<eos> He's wounded, we're checking with doctors. We're following up on the smock.<eos> It doesn't come from the school, but elsewhere.
Come on.<eos> From Sean O'Connell... who has never, I'm told, been willing... to speak with the executives here.<eos> Well, he broke his long silence and shared his thoughts with us... through that old man.<eos> Sean O'Connell.<eos> "I expect full consideration of negative 25 for cover.<eos> "My most grand.<eos> "The quintessence of life."<eos> What is that?<eos> It means like the fullest and most rich.<eos> So our cover will probably be the most famous ever... because it really will have the big quintessence of all time.
Yeah.<eos> I wanted to tell you, that song, "Major Tom"?<eos> Back there, when the beard guy was--<eos> He doesn't know what he's talking about.<eos> That song is about courage and going into the unknown.<eos> It's a cool song.<eos> Rich!<eos> Yo!<eos> Where's my thing?<eos> It's in a silver bath.
I will hurry to the palace and fetch you an escort!<eos> Go, and do not fear for me;<eos> I am Don Carlo's betrothed.<eos> I can trust the honour of a Spaniard!<eos> Page, hurry to the palace!<eos> This man will protect the daughter of your King!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> In war, when the sky is our only shelter, we have to beg the earth for kindling!<eos> The wood has given us the spark we need and the flame is burning brightly!<eos> When it shines this brightly on the battlefield, it heralds victory or love!
By doing so, it will gather the cigarette leaves finely.<eos> And you can suck it well. Then it tastes tight and thick, and the smoke comes out nicely.<eos> Light it first.<eos> That's just surface smoking.<eos> Breathe in more deeply.<eos> Stop smoking only on the surface but breathe in!<eos> Yeah, that's it.<eos> I have something I am curious about.<eos> Why did you use it (as a cigarette)?<eos> Because if you cook the sausage, it's more tasty.
Change is healthy, you shouldn't fear it.<eos> I'm not scared of anything.<eos> Not even an elephant, which is interesting, because there's one in this room.<eos> - Wanna know his name?<eos> - Pat Farrell.<eos> It's Pat Farrell.<eos> Pat's audience is old.<eos> Old people, much like dogs, are blindly loyal.<eos> And if Pat hi-tails it to Cedar FM and they follow, you've got a grey exodus on your hands. A grexodus. Hm.<eos> That prejudices box doesn't seem quite so cool any more, does it?
Who are you?<eos> Eep.<eos> Let me clarify, Eep.<eos> The world is ending.<eos> What?<eos> I'm calling it "The End."<eos> How do you know?<eos> I have seen it.<eos> It's coming this way. First, the ground is going to shake.<eos> Then it breaks open.
Is something wrong?<eos> You can tell me if something's wrong, mate.<eos> Can I?<eos> Course you can.<eos> Don't be weird.<eos> I went to the doctor a few days ago, because I've been depressed.<eos> And they found a...<eos> I've got this thing in my head.<eos> It's a brain tumour.<eos> And the doctors say it's big.
I told you not to run with this, and what do you do?<eos> You let Woodburn just shotgun it all over the internet!<eos> Now, the publishers want me to sue you!<eos> Well, if it makes a difference, I'm dropping it.<eos> - Whoa, just like that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What happened to your leads?<eos> - They didn't pan out.<eos> The story was smoke.<eos> Or perhaps it just didn't get the attraction you hoped it would.
Yeah, I guess.<eos> No, no, I just...<eos> I just wanna...<eos> What?<eos> Ice cold beer, bull ride again.<eos> Take my woman dancing, you know?<eos> I want kids.<eos> I mean, I got one life right? Mine. But I want somebody else's sometimes.<eos> Sometimes I feel like I'm fighting for a life I ain't got time to live.<eos> I want it to mean somethin'.
What does that have to do with ma...?<eos> Oh.<eos> Let's start over.<eos> I'm Jody Sanders.<eos> Yes, my dear.<eos> I've been expecting you.<eos> Please, come in.<eos> They call me Christian grey.<eos> How do you like my blue room?<eos> It's red. Oh.
-Jump!<eos> -I can't jump that high!<eos> Did you see what I just did?<eos> Out!<eos> Jump out!<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Hey, over here!<eos> Fuzzy mousie.<eos> Nice tail.<eos> It's flexible.
And they escape up in the mountains.<eos> And they're gonna be happy, and they're gonna be drinking wine and they dance.<eos> They both like to dance with each other.<eos> There's scenes of them dancing.<eos> Which was boring, but I liked it, because they were happy.<eos> You think he ends it there?<eos> No! He writes another ending.<eos> She dies, Dad.<eos> I mean, the world's hard enough as it is, guys.<eos> It's fucking hard enough as it is.
- Patty! It's probably in the attic.<eos> Are you going in my study?<eos> It feels to me like you wanna hide my wedding video, Mom.<eos> - You think I can't handle it?<eos> - Please stop yelling!<eos> I'm not yelling, Mom I'm just frustrated, because I should have my fucking wedding video!<eos> Pat!<eos> Pat! - You're gonna wake everybody up! - I looked over there.<eos> - I already looked all over there.<eos> - It is somewhere!

Come on!<eos> Kick...<eos> Come on.<eos> S-Sounds b-boring.<eos> Boring?<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Who wants a chance to clobber old Artie?<eos> Right.<eos> - And then see him eat dirt!<eos> And then kick the can so hard... it goes in one ear and out the other!
It's a shame.<eos> You know, if you'd just been smart enough to love me, I would've let her go.<eos> Speak plainly, snake.<eos> I sent your little girlfriend over the cliffs once before.<eos> What makes you think I wouldn't do it again?<eos> I'm gonna offer you a business proposal, Barnabas.<eos> My final offer.<eos> Either you agree to rule this little pond of mine side by side... partners and lovers... or I put you back in the box.<eos> I have already prepared my counterproposal.<eos> It reads thusly:
Nobody likes scientists.<eos> They like what science gives them, but not the questions, no.<eos> Not the questions that science asks.<eos> Actually, I have a question.<eos> That is why you are a scientist.<eos> I was doing my experiment, my project, and the first time it worked great, but the next time it didn't.<eos> I mean, it sort of worked, but then it didn't.<eos> And I don't know why.<eos> Then maybe you never really understood it the first time.<eos> People think science is here, but it is also here.
So...<eos> What's all this supposed to be?<eos> What?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I don't speak bear.<eos> Find those by the creek, did you?<eos> They're nightshade berries.<eos> They're poisonous.<eos> Where did you get this water?<eos> It has worms.
See?<eos> Like this.<eos> Right there.<eos> Even Rufus catches on, eventually.<eos> There you go.<eos> Bugs on a stick.<eos> It's finally time for Oscar to leave his mother's side.<eos> For Isha 's little boy, this is independence day, and independence comes one step at a time.<eos> Well, that's enough independence for one day.<eos> Oscar's forest home is a prime piece of chimpanzee real estate that appears rich and lush, but it's a hard place to make a living.
God creates time.<eos> No man can prolong his allotted hours.<eos> He can only live them to the fullest in this world or in the Twilight Zone.<eos> You can give this program back to the Indians, as far as I'm concerned.<eos> - It's cool.<eos> - Now, Mr. Serling.<eos> Next time, we enlist the aid of a very talented scribe...<eos> There is a fifth dimension beyond that known to man, between light and shadow.<eos> At the end of the show, nothing is ever what it seemed.<eos> Real life's too much like what it seems.
I want to kill myself!<eos> My shirt!<eos> Be careful not to track any snow in.<eos> Hi, Grace.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> - I really like your dress.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Did you get it for Christmas?<eos> - Yeah, from my mother.<eos> - It's nice.
Man, this kid rules.<eos> Ruled.<eos> His parents found him OD'd in his room a few days ago.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Whatever he took, the lab has never seen it before.<eos> And as you can see, this kid is white.<eos> That means people actually give a shit.<eos> Sir, I just want to throw out to you that I would give a shit if he was black.<eos> Right now, H.F.S. Is contained right there at Sagan High.<eos> Now, once this drug breaks containment, it goes viral in a few days.
Where are you going?<eos> I don't want to look like it's like I'm wearing makeup. - Right.<eos> Whoa. What are you wearing?<eos> Potassium nitrate. Thanks for noticing.<eos> I need to borrow you.<eos> Now's not a good time, Brad.<eos> It's a really good time.<eos> 'Cause my pifiata is killing me.<eos> Is that code for a sex thing?<eos> It's leaving the parking lot.
You here to help them out?<eos> No. Actually, we were hoping they could help us out.<eos> We're camped just below here.<eos> We got clean water and bandages and another camp about six miles west of here.<eos> We were gonna try and push on after we ate.<eos> We're the Wolverines.<eos> I was afraid of that.<eos> So how did we get here?<eos> What happened to our defense?<eos> It went defunct.
Oh!<eos> Hey, man, that's nice.<eos> Hey, that's like your sister's ass, man.<eos> Man, fuck you, motherfucker! What?<eos> Man, she's only 13!<eos> Hey, man, shut the fuck up!<eos> Hey, what the fuck you laughing at, dawg?<eos> Don't fucking laugh at that shit.<eos> Damn, I like that watch, dawg.<eos> Yeah, it's kinda ironic and shit.
- I don't need a doctor!<eos> The Court thinks you need a doctor.<eos> Do you have any idea why?<eos> I like to drink.<eos> I like hookers with big breasts, and I like fighting.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> I am King!<eos> What if you weren't King. What would make you happy?<eos> "To sleep, perchance to dream."<eos> "Often expectation fails and most often there, where most it promises."
Have you previously tested this inoculation? Yes.<eos> On myself as well.<eos> - What is the survival rate.<eos> There's always some risk ...<eos> - 'Some risk'!<eos> But if it goes well, and I'm confident that it will, he will be immune.<eos> The Crown Prince is the heir to the throne!<eos> He's protected by God!<eos> A smallpox epidemic is not picky.<eos> It kills both kings and queens.
And one fateful day he push too far!<eos> Light the hoop on fire!<eos> He fly too close to the sun...<eos> and he got burned.<eos> Literally.<eos> The extra virgin olive oil is extra flammable.<eos> And he lost everything.<eos> His wife, she run off with a musician.<eos> He lost his dignity... his fame his passion... and his fur.<eos> And when it grow back, it is less soft.
Really?<eos> - I'm with you!<eos> - I'm in!<eos> But what do we tell them?<eos> We make it right by telling them how wrong we were.<eos> It's worth a shot.<eos> And if we go down in flames, so be it!<eos> - Yes, let's do this! - I like it!<eos> Is my neck getting longer?<eos> Feel my fur. It's so soft.
- I'm with you!<eos> - I'm in!<eos> But what do we tell them?<eos> We make it right by telling them how wrong we were.<eos> It's worth a shot.<eos> And if we go down in flames, so be it!<eos> - Yes, let's do this! - I like it!<eos> Is my neck getting longer?<eos> Feel my fur.

Your room has a mountain view.<eos> Enjoy your stay.<eos> What is he saying?<eos> - That we got a nice mountain view.<eos> Yusuf, can you help out, please?<eos> They can't see us, so don't worry.<eos> Can you pick up the kid?<eos> That's my husband.<eos> Will I get my chain back?<eos> It's real gold.

- Shrimp balls?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about Harvey Dent.<eos> I'll let him tell you himself. Commissioner Gordon.<eos> The truth?<eos> I have written a speech telling the truth about Harvey Dent.<eos> Maybe the time isn't right.<eos> Maybe right now all you need to know is that there are 1000 inmates in Blackgate Prison as a direct result of the Dent Act.<eos> These are violent criminals, essential cogs in the organized-crime machine.<eos> Maybe, for now, all I should say about the death of Harvey Dent is this: It has not been for nothing.
- No one knows why, or how he escaped. But they do know that once he did he was trained by Ra's Al Ghul, your mentor.<eos> Bane was a member of the League of Shadows?<eos> And then he was excommunicated.<eos> And any man who is too extreme for Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with.<eos> I didn't realize I was known for trifling with criminals.<eos> That was then.<eos> And you can strap up your leg and put your mask back on but that doesn't make you what you were.<eos> If this man is everything that you say he is, then the city needs me.<eos> The city needs Bruce Wayne. Your resources. Your knowledge.<eos> It doesn't need your body, or your life.
This is it, isn't it?<eos> The reactor is beneath the river so it can be instantly flooded in the event of a security breach.<eos> Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?<eos> I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one.<eos> I thought you might like to see what your investment built.<eos> No fossil fuels. Free clean energy for an entire city.<eos> Three years ago, a Russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions.<eos> One week later, your reactor started developing problems.<eos> I think this machine works.<eos> Miranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too great.
You were excommunicated by a gang of psychopaths.<eos> I am the League of Shadows.<eos> And I'm here to fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.<eos> You fight like a younger man. Nothing held back.<eos> Admirable, but mistaken.<eos> Oh, you think darkness is your ally?<eos> But you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it.<eos> Molded by it.<eos> I didn't see the light until I was already a man.<eos> By then, it was nothing to me but blinding!
He fell in love with the warlord's daughter.<eos> They were married in secret. When the warlord found out the mercenary was condemned to this pit.<eos> But then he exiled him instead.<eos> The mercenary understood that it was the daughter who had secured his release.<eos> But what he could not know was the true price of his freedom.<eos> She took his place in the pit.<eos> And she was with child the mercenary's child.<eos> Innocence cannot flower underground. It has to be stamped out.<eos> One day, the doctor forgot to lock the cell.<eos> But the child had a friend a protector who showed the others that this innocence was their redemption. It was to be prized.
I'll admit, I was a little let down.<eos> But I still think there's more to you.<eos> In fact, I think that for you this isn't just a tool.<eos> It's an escape route. You want to disappear. Start fresh.<eos> - I can't even get off this island.<eos> - I can give you a way off once you get me to Lucius Fox.<eos> Find out where they're holding him and take me in.<eos> Why do you need Fox?<eos> - To save the city.<eos> - Who says it needs saving?
Gordon. You gave him a way to block my signal.<eos> No matter.<eos> He's bought Gotham 11 minutes.<eos> Come on!<eos> Stay there!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Blake, MCU! I'm getting these boys to safety!<eos> You'll get us all killed!<eos> If anyone crosses this bridge, they'll blow the city!<eos> It's gonna blow anyway!
You'll get us all killed!<eos> If anyone crosses this bridge, they'll blow the city!<eos> It's gonna blow anyway!<eos> We need to open this bridge, now!<eos> Detective, if you take one step forward we will shoot you!<eos> If you take two steps forward, we will blow the bridge!<eos> Okay, go back by the bus and wait for me, all right?<eos> Go back and wait.<eos> Prepare a convoy.<eos> We must secure the bomb until it detonates.
I'm fine, thanks.<eos> Anyway, I passed out for a while, and woke up naked in the trunk of the car.<eos> Now, I'm sitting here with you three with a friggin' Korean janitor outfit on.<eos> I had a dog named Sylvia.<eos> I loved that dog.<eos> I think about her every day.<eos> There's so goddamn much I want to forget.<eos> Where was this warehouse?<eos> Show me where you found the car, and I'll show you the place.<eos> We stole the car on Rodney Street. It belongs to the Jargoniew brothers.
You're wasting time.<eos> Please.<eos> Tell me what to do.<eos> Can you get out of the closet safely?<eos> Yes.<eos> If you can, take the case with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm out.<eos> The combination is 23-28-84.<eos> Is it open?
I thought I lost you.<eos> Oh, yeah. My girl.<eos> Hey, I think I found a way off the beach!<eos> What was that?<eos> It's a scary noise in a dark cave. Keep moving. Keep moving.<eos> If this is heaven, I'm checking in.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...<eos> The Mysterious Island.<eos> What is this place?<eos> This island, it shrunk us!
Don't take another step.<eos> Papa, be careful.<eos> Don't worry, honey.<eos> I got this.<eos> See? No problem. Oh!<eos> Run, run, run!<eos> Head for the jungle!<eos> Faster! Faster!<eos> This way!<eos> It's right behind you! Hurry!
-Thank you for calling.<eos> -ls that about the job?<eos> Awesome.<eos> Thank you so much, man.<eos> Thank you, yeah.<eos> Talk soon. Okay, bye.<eos> -Was that about the magazine job? -No.<eos> But, Celeste, a swell came in last night.<eos> Northwest.<eos> Apparently, it is overhead and it is glassy.
Shrimp and bok choy.<eos> We're gonna be here for a while.<eos> That was just mean. What you did to Wu back there.<eos> Snatched his skirt off. That's just disrespectful.<eos> I used to play a game with my dad:<eos> What'll You Have For Your Last Meal.<eos> You could do worse than this.<eos> Okay.<eos> I played a game with my dad called catch.<eos> Except I'd throw the ball and it'd just hit the wall because he wasn't there.
Look at these trees!<eos> Hacked by men.<eos> I just saw cannons and cannonballs!<eos> This vessel looks like it's from that era!<eos> Could this be the Indestructible we've been looking for?<eos> Very likely.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> This chain rode...<eos> What is it doing here?<eos> It goes all the way into that tree!
We appreciate the young for expressing their views.<eos> The auctioning of historical relics from illegal sources, will only encourage more criminal activities.<eos> Those who plunder relics are worse than thieves!<eos> Yes!<eos> The golden mask of a pharaoh's Concubine and the secret smiling Buddha were passed in an auction today, affected by the increasing international uproar<eos> In breaking news, MP Corporation has announced it has won the right to auction off the bronze the piece will go to market as soon as possible.<eos> I've called you more than 7,000<eos> Just say the word.<eos> From now on, in future, forever and ever... I won't call or bother you again.<eos> We know where it is!
Let the Dragon Fly!<eos> What is this?<eos> A 4th diver has appeared<eos> Check over there!<eos> Wake up!<eos> Wake up!<eos> Save her!<eos> Thank you!<eos> He just let go of the Dragon-head!<eos> It's falling towards the volcano!
You got to see this.<eos> And here comes number two.<eos> Female.<eos> First one was a male, young but grown.<eos> It's a baby, maybe eight months old.<eos> Can they get free?<eos> No.<eos> This solid ice goes for five miles from the...<eos> This is solid ice, Adam.<eos> It goes for five miles from here to the waterways that lead to the open ocean.
Why won't you give us a chance to get them out?<eos> I have a barge that's just days away, but instead you want to kill a family?<eos> A baby, for God's sake!<eos> For sport!<eos> Hold on.<eos> It's what I feed my family.<eos> And it's what we feed our babies.<eos> The whale chooses the Whaler and they have chosen us.<eos> The whale told you this?<eos> Did it write you a letter?
They seem to be used to the sound of the saw, but the little one is having trouble navigating now.<eos> Sometimes hitting the side.<eos> Well, has anyone been down there yet?<eos> No, and no one is going to go down there.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because grays can take out 10,000-pound killer whales with one swipe of their fluke if they feel threatened.<eos> It would be suicide.<eos> Well, Pat, we have a big, big problem.<eos> Stretching for miles and dropping like a wall straight to the bottom of the ocean, this massive ice blocks any path the whales might take to freedom.<eos> An ice-blasting hover barge is on the way, but who knows if it will get here in time as this icy barrier, known as a pressure ridge, thickens by the hour.
Where are you going?<eos> We can't just abandon our house.<eos> - Yes, we can!<eos> - You're not even dressed!<eos> There is no way I'm staying in this house tonight!<eos> If it were a person, we would have seen them come in on the security cameras.<eos> I must have left a blind spot.<eos> Why aren't we saying what we're both thinking?<eos> Kel. Our house is too new to be haunted.<eos> It has no history.
I don't understand why you must be so proud.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> - It's because you've never been poor.<eos> Trying to scrape out some miserable scrap of an existence!<eos> I can't live like that.<eos> Like my father.<eos> Working to the bone, and then down on his knees, every week, praying to God that the next life will be better.<eos> Well, there is no next life.<eos> The flesh, it rots in the earth.<eos> It rots.
Darkness.<eos> That's the first thing I remember.<eos> It was dark, and it was cold.<eos> And I was scared.<eos> But then, then I saw the moon.<eos> It was so big and it was so bright.
Darkness.<eos> That's the first thing I remember.<eos> It was dark, and it was cold.<eos> And I was scared.<eos> But then, then I saw the moon.<eos> It was so big and it was so bright.<eos> It seemed to chase the darkness away.
Weyland was a superstitious man.<eos> He wanted a true believer on board.<eos> Cheers.<eos> So no response?<eos> I'm sorry, no.<eos> Maybe they didn't understand it.<eos> How are your lessons going, David?<eos> I spent two years deconstructing dozens of ancient languages to their roots.<eos> I'm confident I can communicate with them provided your thesis is correct.<eos> "Provided it's correct." That's good.
I'm not a fucking junkie<eos> Just wait till you start losing your teeth.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I got some info on the music box<eos> - What time is it?<eos> - It's almost noon<eos> Shouldn't you be in class?<eos> Shit<eos> - What did you find out?<eos> - It relies on the diminished fifth also known as diabolus in musica, a tonal interval banned by the medieval church because it was considered to be satanic.
Tell them!<eos> Keep it intact?<eos> Where?<eos> In my apartment there's sufficient space.<eos> I can make more space.<eos> The people need to see it.<eos> Let them buy it.<eos> Let them outbid me.<eos> Forgive the pissed way to say this, but the? chapel belongs to the world.<eos> It's mine if I buy it.
No, we wanna do it.<eos> And we will.<eos> We shall.<eos> We wanna have it.<eos> Sex.<eos> Yes.<eos> Because there isn'time not to have it.<eos> Time is a thing that grows scarcer every day.<eos> I like that bookshop. Do you know why?<eos> Because it's semi-underground.
This is why something will happen soon.<eos> Maybe today.<eos> To correct the acceleration of time and bring nature back to normal, more or less.<eos> You have to understand.<eos> The more visionary the idea, the more people it leaves behind.<eos> This is what the protest is all about.<eos> Visions of technology and wealth, the force of the cyber-capital that will send people to the gutter to retch and die.<eos> What is the flaw of human rationality?<eos> What?<eos> It pretends not to see the horror and death at the end of the scheme it builds.
The urge to destroy is a creative thing.<eos> This is also a hallmark of capitalist thought.<eos> Enforced destruction.<eos> Old industries have to be harshly eliminated.<eos> New markets have to be forcibly claimed and old markets have to be re-exploited.<eos> Destroy the past. Make the future.<eos> This is the thing about genius.<eos> Genius alters the terms of its habitat.<eos> Technology is crucial the civilization, why?<eos> Because it helps us to make our fate.
I took it up when I was fifteen.<eos> It's one of those things a girl takes up.<eos> It tells her she's more than a skinny body nobody looks at.<eos> There's a certain drama in her life.<eos> She notices herself. Then other people notice her.<eos> Then she marries one of them.<eos> Then, they go to dinner.<eos> You're wearing a cocktail dress.<eos> Yes?<eos> It's navy blue.
You wouldn't know it.<eos> Tell me your name.<eos> Sheets.<eos> Richard Sheets.<eos> Means nothing to me.<eos> Tell me: do you imagine that I stole ideas from you?<eos> Intellectual property.<eos> What does anyone imagine?<eos> A hundreds things a minute.<eos> Whether I imagine a thing or not, it's real to me.
Why us?<eos> They have the nerve to call us, bandits. More than get here.<eos> And now one of them... Has robbed me of my only brother.<eos> And now... I am... Alone in the world.<eos> Not quite alone.<eos> I mean, You've got me, your fourth cousin.<eos> Once removed, that's something, isn't it?<eos> Death is natural.<eos> - Budzo.<eos> It's just a part of the cycle of life.
Jack was getting jealous of Hillary and Charlotte.<eos> And he was getting jealous of Ward and Yardley, too.<eos> Ward wasn't somebody who attached himself to just anybody.<eos> Your dad's girlfriend, what's her name?<eos> Jack couldn't understand why he was so attached to that Yardley.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> What is the hottest temperature that you've ever been in?<eos> 125.<eos> How about you?<eos> Just put your hand out and it burns off.
I often find them here,these scraps.<eos> Must float down from someone's window.<eos> "She had meant to smother the baby as soon as it was born, but something made her look at it.<eos> She heard the thundering heartbeat, she smelled the baby's bloodied head and love confounded her. "<eos> It's just a scrap, like you say.<eos> But there's a story there.<eos> You can feel it.<eos> Shall we walk a little?<eos> My story starts with Clara.<eos> One day, it will end with her.
And I'll tell you one thing, we're going to go to Florida and see my mother next year for the full two weeks.<eos> You have forfeited your right to complain.<eos> Boy!<eos> I was thinking about you the whole...<eos> - Get away from the door!<eos> - I'm getting!<eos> What happened to you?<eos> I had to do that thing and the handle came off.<eos> Oh, me, too!<eos> And it broke, and that kid, he played bad.
Next step.<eos> That's great. Let's get with it.<eos> I mean, we're doing so well, we might be able to get out of here early.<eos> Okay, next step. What is it?<eos> Write a poem?<eos> Hold hands in public?<eos> Sing a serenade?<eos> Sex.<eos> We're going to talk extensively about your sexual history.<eos> When it started. What it included.
I told you one thing, and you almost ruined it all.<eos> I'll take care of myself.<eos> You gotta start trusting somebody. Please, tell me.<eos> What's going on?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You can't have delivered already, it's not possible.<eos> It's really uncool to let a messenger service deliver your illegal bullshit.<eos> - Where is my envelope?<eos> - It's hard enough out there.<eos> - Where is it?
- Where is my envelope?<eos> - It's hard enough out there.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - I gave it back to the front desk.<eos> Did a messengerjust come by and drop off an envelope?<eos> Yeah, and another one just came and picked it up.<eos> Who told them to change the address?<eos> You get your envelope back?<eos> Someone else come and pick it up?<eos> But it's going to the wrong place.
Vanessa always said you was the best at what you do.<eos> She says maybe she can never count on you, but at work, there's no one better.<eos> She said that?<eos> Is it true?<eos> Can I count on you?<eos> Let me see the name on the sheet.<eos> How come you don't answer my calls?<eos> Because I got a business to run.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You picked up an envelope from Nima at the college office at 5:30. Where is it?
- Shut the fuck up!<eos> - It's not you.<eos> - Shut the fuck up!<eos> - It's not you.<eos> You are asleep.<eos> Your spirit was free moving from body to the next body, free...<eos> Free for a moment.<eos> Then it was captured by an invader force bent on turning you to the darkest way.<eos> You've been implanted with a push-pull mechanism that keeps you fearful of authority and destructive.<eos> We are in the middle of a battle that's a trillion years in the making, - and it's bigger than the both of us.
I flew halfway across... You know, halfway across the world to see this woman who I never thought I'd see again.<eos> I don 't like that it defines me.<eos> I contacted Father Ben Rawlings and David Keane in hopes that they would review the footage of my mother.<eos> Luckily, they agreed and invited me to their loft.<eos> Isabella, hi, welcome.<eos> -How are you?<eos> -Good.<eos> It's hard to say why I wanted to be a priest.<eos> Maybe I was drawn to helping people.<eos> I think that duality exists within all of us and, occasionally, it can take form.
Not for long.<eos> An agreement is being discussed.<eos> Mexico and Rome are going to make peace.<eos> An agreement?<eos> No one wants this war anymore, Enrique.<eos> Mexico is bleeding on its own fields.<eos> Mexico is hanging from telegraph poles from Monterrey to Veracruz.<eos> Of course you need an agreement.<eos> But freedom has no compromise.<eos> By definition, it is absolute, and that's why we will be victorious.
Got an induced-pulse.<eos> Seven, six... - So why is there still counting?<eos> - Not done yet.<eos> Find the Vidadermic labeled "20 ccs."<eos> - Serotonin nor epinephrine.<eos> - What the hell do I do with this?<eos> It's a neurotransmitter stimulant.<eos> You've got to push the needle through the center of her right eye into the brain.<eos> Come on, you're kidding me, right?<eos> Move it around until it locates the thalamus.
Have you actually met your father?<eos> - Don't start that.<eos> We have to help them.<eos> - Look, i can't, okay?<eos> I would love to, but I can't.<eos> Mace told me where the case is.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - It was the last thing he said.<eos> Really?<eos> So where is it?
What's Bernie Kuntz doing here, are you guys buying a new TV or something?<eos> I told his mother, his biological clock is ticking. Mom.<eos> - Hey Bernie. - Hey Steph!<eos> Long time, right!<eos> Yes, a couple of years at least. How've you been?<eos> - Good, good.<eos> And you?<eos> - Great.<eos> I like your hair.<eos> Oh thanks, it's just the same as always.
I'd rather be shot than go in before I'm ready.<eos> So, you need my help with this, Plum.<eos> Believe it.<eos> $50,000 changes my world.<eos> Alright, I'm in!<eos> But, I think we both know that the money is secondary.<eos> Keep flappering your lips. I'm in it for the cash.<eos> Oh, that's a lie!<eos> It's a lie.<eos> See a little vein in your neck, it's pulsing.
- Hello?<eos> - Why'd you hang up?<eos> Yeah, I didn't know what to say.<eos> Why didn't you move your lips and something would have come out.<eos> Listen, are you free to meet?<eos> It's a bright, sunny morning in London town, with highs in the early 20$...<eos> I love this song.<eos> Oh, God, it's gonna stay in my head for the whole day now.<eos> Shooting star?<eos> It's going out in beautiful flames.
Whoa! Careful! Careful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, my God, I love this song.<eos> It's a good one.<eos> Isn't classic rock the best?<eos> Classic rock?<eos> This is classic rock now?<eos> Hey, you know, Kara, you should drink some more water.<eos> Where's that bottle I gave you?<eos> Oh, it's right here.
Allow me.<eos> Yeah, Kevin, allow him.<eos> This better be good, Stafler.<eos> It's Stifler, fucker.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Who the hell do you think you are?<eos> Are you acting tough in front of your girlfriend?<eos> Huh? Because we both know she's only with you for your money.<eos> Definitely not for your dick.<eos> Because anybody that's peed next to you knows it's the size of a leprechaun's pinkie.
History prefers legends to men.<eos> It prefers nobility to brutality. Soaring speeches to quiet deeds.
We're going to be late for the theater.<eos> Hold onto this for me, Henry.<eos> Mary, darling... have you seen my hat?<eos> It's on your desk in the office.<eos> Have you seen my hat?<eos> Abraham, let me make you immortal.<eos> Let us fight through the ages, side by side.<eos> Vampires are not the only things that live forever.<eos> History prefers legends to men.<eos> It prefers nobility to brutality. Soaring speeches to quiet deeds.
Savages.<eos> All right.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> This is the new stuff.<eos> You've never had anything like this before.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> It's good.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I can't find my prick here.<eos> That's because it's too fucking small.
We'll just have a nice little fellas night, a chill-out night.<eos> Let me tell you what happens, Janet Jackson gets AIDS at the end and some crazy guy throws his kids out the window.<eos> - Can we party now?<eos> Let's do it!<eos> - I hate you.<eos> - All right, put 'em up!<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Fine, I'm in, man.<eos> Life is great, fellas.<eos> May it never change.
I thought we could look it over. Research some new styles.<eos> Gotta zero in on a color palette.<eos> I know you like mauve. You know?<eos> There was that period you went through, where you were partial to salmon.<eos> Yeah, I'd rather watch Letters to Juliet with you again.<eos> I know you would. 'Cause you cried at the end when they got reunited.<eos> I wasn't crying, okay?<eos> I was having an allergic reaction to the perfume in the theater.<eos> You bought the soundtrack.<eos> It's a good soundtrack.
I need some gas money so I can go redeem the ticket.<eos> She gave me $20.<eos> Don't lie to her.<eos> I don't want to lie to her.<eos> Okay, hold up. You don't have to lie.<eos> You omit.<eos> Just, no, no, you omit.<eos> You just tell her you're a high-end chef that's in between gigs.<eos> Your car's in the shop.<eos> She think you drive an expensive car, you're not driving it 'cause it's in the shop.
Oh, no.<eos> Okay, got to defend ourselves.<eos> We got to shoot them in the head with, like, some sort of silver stake or something.<eos> Seven victims.<eos> I'm way too awesome to get eaten.<eos> Seven graves.<eos> Norman, are you listening to me?<eos> You really got to do something!<eos> The witch's grave!<eos> It wasn't there!
She turned away from everyone, and became sad and lonely, and had no one to turn to!<eos> Stop it!<eos> But the more she turned away from people, the more scared they were of her, and they did something terrible!<eos> They became so scared that they took her away and they killed her!<eos> No!<eos> But even though she was dead, something in her came back.<eos> Stop!<eos> And this part of her, it wouldn't go away. Not for 300 years!<eos> Shut up!<eos> And the longer it stayed, the less there was of the little girl.
And three quarters, sir.<eos> Well, you just used up your entire allotment of dumb luck.<eos> Here's a novel idea. On your next little date, why don't you go to the arcade... or pee-wee golfing.<eos> Or something that doesn't involve getting you killed.<eos> Because he likes to time the waves. Shh.<eos> What?<eos> You do.<eos> What do you mean, time the waves?<eos> Um, to see if the swell is building or dropping.<eos> The more seconds between them... each wave in a set, it means it's getting bigger.
Nobody, sir.<eos> Just figured it out.<eos> You just figured that out on your own?<eos> Thanks. Bye.<eos> Go straight inside, all right?<eos> Close the door.<eos> What now?<eos> How big you reckon that wave was, sir?<eos> It's a small world, kid... but how they gauge the size of waves, well, that differs... from place to place, so, hard to say.<eos> So it might be bigger somewhere else?
Just figured it out.<eos> You just figured that out on your own?<eos> Thanks.

I'm gonna train you for one thing and for one thing only:<eos> To survive that wave.<eos> You want to know why?<eos> Because I don't want it on my conscience.<eos> That's it.<eos> No questions, no arguing, end of story.<eos> I teach you what you need to know, and it's over.<eos> You got it?<eos> Got it.<eos> Now, the reason... no one knows about this wave... is because it only happens on big northwest swells.
Because I want the truth.<eos> I want to know what you're afraid of.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Or you don't wanna know?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, you better ask yourself... what do you want to leave behind?<eos> The truth of who you really are or just some words on a page?<eos> All that stuff that's burning deep down inside of you, what is that?<eos> That stuff you can't even look at because it scares you so much... that the same thing in that letter?
What you say reminds me of my childhood.<eos> My father spoke of a stone.<eos> On a magic stone and legendary.<eos> He said: "If you find this stone, and lay it before thee, "Talk to him about your suffering of your secrets.<eos> "The stone listens.<eos> "Whatever you dare ever tell others, "You say to the stone. You talk to him ...<eos> "She listens to all your secrets.<eos> "It means everything.<eos> "And one day, "Stone broke.<eos> "It falls to pieces.
I never kissed you.<eos> Never.<eos> And now ... I can do anything with you.<eos> I can do anything.<eos> I can talk to you all, everything.<eos> My stone of patience.<eos> Do you remember the first night?<eos> Without a word, you're thrown out on me, excited ... distraught.<eos> Your mother we watched.<eos> She was dying to know if a virgin was deflowered, if it could have a grand-son or not.
You know you can't read.<eos> Press on, honey.<eos> Is there anything you can't get in here?<eos> If the price was right,<eos> I could stage a Beatles reunion concert in the main yard.<eos> All I need is a name.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> And a pricey one at that.<eos> I'm all ears.<eos> Tomorrow at 2:15, I need that door locked tight, and I need it to stay that way for about two minutes.
Now, I need you to call your son.<eos> We'll have someone sent out to your home to test him.<eos> Not my house.<eos> I'll have him meet them.<eos> It's better that way.<eos> I don't think you understand what's at stake here.<eos> I'm a very private man.<eos> I can't have strangers coming into my house.<eos> Mr. Damour, in situations like this, the most important thing is finding the origin of the infection.<eos> If it's in your home, your son is in grave danger.
What now?<eos> You see the industrial air filtration system?<eos> The chemical vats?<eos> That means our rednecks are either opening up a dry cleaners in the middle of fricking nowhere or they're cooking meth, which means after they shoot you in the face, they're not gonna be too friendly to the guy zip-tied in the truck.<eos> If I'm shot in the face, I don't think I'll care too much how nice they are to you.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> How about if we come up with a plan where nobody gets dead, okay?<eos> Just wait for the rednecks to go back inside their crappy trailer and we'll pretend that it's a police raid.<eos> Actually, I got a better idea.<eos> And you'll be happy to know it doesn't involve guns.
So you've got to control your fears so you don't turn on yourself or each other if you wanna make it to Tartarus.<eos> There it is.<eos> There's our door.<eos> Everybody back!<eos> Which one of you prayed to him? !<eos> You betrayed our father.<eos> He betrayed me by choosing you.<eos> You beauty!<eos> Come on!<eos> It won't stay open for long!
I will try again.<eos> Anyone know what happens to a stagnant cell?<eos> What's he doing on the table?<eos> I don't know, something about cells.<eos> Malia.<eos> It's not good.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> It ain't good.<eos> People, a cell that is not in motion is not a productive member of the system.<eos> It ends up assuming all the other cells are gonna pick up the slack somewhere.
In fact, they imitate the stray cell until basically the whole organism begins to die.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you know what?<eos> Biology is an amazing thing.<eos> And here's the good news, all that decays can be restored.<eos> Is this hitting anybody?<eos> Like how a cut heals.<eos> Brian, my man.<eos> Look, you got one!<eos> And once that cell's back on track, it creates energy amongst the other cells. That's what happens.
Yeah.<eos> But you know what?<eos> Biology is an amazing thing.<eos> And here's the good news, all that decays can be restored.<eos> Is this hitting anybody?<eos> Like how a cut heals.<eos> Brian, my man.<eos> Look, you got one!<eos> And once that cell's back on track, it creates energy amongst the other cells. That's what happens.<eos> It starts getting a little movement going.
This is great.<eos> Come on!<eos> All right, Scott, let's go.<eos> Get up there, baby, let's go.<eos> What I believe in<eos> Holly holy<eos> Yeah, oh!<eos> Get up!<eos> Good song, man.<eos> Good song. it's a scary song.
You always want to fuck?<eos> It's disgusting, man!<eos> Here!<eos> Hey, you two, come!<eos> I need help!<eos> Come!<eos> You were bitten?<eos> No!<eos> This is my wife, she has a broken right leg!<eos> It is there further.
No, it's not...<eos> It's true.<eos> Linda, I think you just met Linda.<eos> You're an amazing woman.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I have one more question.<eos> Ask anything, my sweet soul warrior.<eos> Why is that grass crying?<eos> It's really loud.
I'm going to do this myself.<eos> No!<eos> No, that's a bad idea.<eos> It is the best idea the universe has ever come up with.<eos> This is the most natural thing that can happen to a person.<eos> I'm going to get Rodney.<eos> No.<eos> He'll be here soon enough.<eos> Look at the full moon right now.<eos> It's luminous.
Seth, are you all right?<eos> Seth, what are you doing?<eos> Stop punching me!<eos> I'm not punching you.<eos> I'm slapping you!<eos> I wish there was something we could do to help, but we're non-violent.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Stop!<eos> What happened to non-violence?<eos> Violence is justified when it serves the greater good.
Charlie! - Charlie!<eos> - Charlie!<eos> Charlie! - Don't be shy.<eos> Come out when...<eos> Yeah!<eos> What a display of man I have ever seen!<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - It's a surprise.<eos> Is this your room?<eos> It's so cool.
Every morning when they're emptying my piss bag,<eos> I think about eating the barrel of a shotgun.<eos> But a gun, it don't allow these little moments of bliss...<eos> To get you through your day.<eos> You're fucked.<eos> You're fucked, John.<eos> You're fucked!<eos> It's not safe here.<eos> We need to find that cabin.<eos> You remember where it is, right?
This is really, really bad.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> What's the worst that could happen to him?<eos> Okay.<eos> How about this?<eos> We split up.<eos> Cover more houses.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> So you can go to the party.<eos> - It's at a house.
Well, come on in, kid.<eos> Just watching some tape on a new fighter.<eos> Yeah, you were really something then.<eos> No one threw a left hook harder.<eos> You weren't even there, ronnie.<eos> How'd you end up with my medal?<eos> I just figured I'd hang onto it, you know,<eos> For safekeeping.<eos> Right.<eos> It looks good on you, kid.
Those men...<eos> They're the ones that brought back the gold.<eos> The queen told you that they were undesirables, but she lied.<eos> Huh?<eos> These brave men are the true heroes.<eos> They fearlessly raided the queen's caravan and and retrieved your gold.<eos> They're the ones that really deserve your thanks.<eos> Yay!<eos> Are you enjoying the quail?<eos> It looks delicious, Your Highness.
Hello.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Welcome to the party.<eos> Let's see what kind of moves you got.<eos> Dance, little Scrat fish!<eos> Dance your coconuts off!<eos> Happy dance.<eos> Look at him.<eos> Where's my bootie? Has anyone seen it?<eos> Dude, it's right behind you.
This is a hurricane, Hannah.<eos> You'd rather tell me what you're going to eat tonight.<eos> Spinach, full bread and water.<eos> It's good you're not in New York.<eos> They all blame you to defend Eichmann, Hannah.<eos> Scoundrel, these are just a few articles in a magazine.<eos> Darling, you're really naïve.<eos> She thinks her sarcasm will protect.<eos> He shows me his vulnerability.<eos> She tries to keep away from this story and in doing so, it appropriates all the more.
Read it to us.<eos> "Your photo shows a face as hard as stone and as cold<eos> "as the ice of the North Pole.<eos> "Contempt hovers on your lips, your eyes contain iron brutality.<eos> "The page<eos> " with your photo<eos> "in my opinion, has spread throughout the magazine.<eos> " I put on gloves, I couldn't grab the page with bare hands.<eos> "I tore it, and as I refused<eos> " that it burns with dignity,
You think that you've betrayed me.<eos> You've only succeeded in helping me.<eos> You knew! You knew I'd betray you.<eos> Sooner or later.<eos> The girl lives.<eos> The tomb.<eos> Help me.<eos> - I think it's time Jndeed.<eos> - You need to move the stone<eos> - It's too heavy.
It is fully connected to our environment.<eos> A millennium ago, there was an elite group so connected with reality ... that they were able to ontraffelen times.<eos> Decisions were seen for they were made.<eos> This special gift made the people are terrified ...<eos> A campaign was started for us to eradicate.<eos> All knowledge of our gift was wiped out.<eos> After a thousand years of slavery and genocide ... the Arid varieties forget who we are.<eos> See the future was a myth.<eos> The scorched planet ... made our women infertile.<eos> We are the light, it's not beyond.

So who are you?
- Thank you.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> Howareyoudoing on this thing?<eos> Oh, Jesus!<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> Hey, Ma!<eos> I was gonna go take a shower, then we should eat, then I want to go to the Bellagio.<eos> - We can see the fountain...<eos> - No, honey, look at this.<eos> Frogs. It has frogs!
Well, as a matter of fact, it's not my name.<eos> You see, my father was an assassin and he had to change all of our birth names because of that incident I told you about, about the KGB.<eos> So what is your real name then?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I can't tell you that.<eos> Even I don't know. / No.<eos> No one knows.<eos> Okay. / Yeah. / Okay.<eos> You gonna put on something nice, honey?<eos> So, did Mom tell you the good news?<eos> Who's it good for?
I'm going to let you live. Long enough to see me drain the Pegasus complete.<eos> You fool!<eos> If you kill the horse, we all die and the world ends.<eos> You can't be immortal in a world that no longer exists.<eos> Who told you that? Mayda?<eos> She also said the horse would kill me and my creature.<eos> She was wrong.<eos> Take him away.<eos> Immortality awaits.<eos> It'll have to wait a little longer, Orthos.
Let me pass.<eos> Where is the Pegasus?<eos> It's Orthos and the creature's problem now.<eos> You can follow him to your deaths if you like.<eos> You!<eos> You killed my father.<eos> I was just following orders.<eos> Orthos is the one you want.<eos> I'm so glad the Chimera didn't rob me of the pleasure of killing you.<eos> It can't kill me, I created it.
So, I'm embarrassed about this, but I have this giant astrology book.<eos> And it says that today, that my 29th birthday Saturn returns to the place of my birth and it turns my life upside-down.<eos> It says that Saturn is going to bring all of my shit to the surface and then I'm going to evolve.<eos> I'm paraphrasing, of course.<eos> I know that change is inevitable.<eos> But what if I don't want things to change?<eos> What if I like my life exactly how it is?
You do your time, then you can go straight.<eos> That's what they try and sell you anyway.<eos> The truth is different.<eos> You do your time.<eos> Then you do your straight time.<eos> There's no bars, no lockdown.<eos> But you're not free.<eos> It's fucked.<eos> The whole car's fucked.<eos> You want the truth, I doubt if it's gonna get us where we're going.
We couldn't have done all this without Porsche.<eos> We need her.<eos> Yeah, but we don't need you.<eos> Delta's right, Gerry.<eos> We don't need you, but we do need your car.<eos> We're happy to do you a deal.<eos> For the car?<eos> Yeah, Daddy, for the car.<eos> Okay.<eos> And just what do you think it's worth?
I'm not paying for his dinner tonight. I want you to know he's gotta get a job.<eos> - Yeah, like his Daddy,<eos> - Yes. Who has two, right?<eos> It's FBI profiling, 35 percent more money.<eos> 35 percent.<eos> Great health benefits, great dental, regular hours, not as unpredictable as these.<eos> Come on, Babe, I think D.C.'d be a good thing.<eos> Yeah, I know, I get it, I get it.<eos> That... here's the other side... Yeah.<eos> I have a career, too, and it is right here in Detroit.
So he skimmed a few bucks.<eos> He got drunk and over did it in a bar.<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> We used to call that felony larceny and assault with a deadly weapon.<eos> I understand Internal Affairs is going to water board him next week.<eos> Trust cops to deal with cops?<eos> - Just give it some thought.<eos> - We're retrying it.<eos> Wouldn't it be nice if life was all blacks and whites?<eos> Turns out, it's mostly grays.
It is. It's a great mattress.<eos> It is sublime is what it is.<eos> It's nice.<eos> - Sorry about your dad.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - What's the car worth?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - Five?<eos> - Triple that, at least.<eos> In Buenos Aires, it's worth 100.

- I'm waiting on my sandwich.<eos> - Who cares about your sandwich?<eos> I'm sorry, Theodore, I would, I swear.<eos> I have to meet with someone.<eos> It's important.<eos> - More important than my car?<eos> - Hard to imagine, but yes.<eos> Give me the keys.<eos> It's good news.<eos> We know it's still on the street.
Something wrong?<eos> How should I know?<eos> Investigating his death is your job.<eos> can't we cooperate like old times?<eos> That's how we've maintained our balance.<eos> He has your old job, right?<eos> Maybe he got too inquisitive.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Let's wrap up this Yamamoto case fast.<eos> If it drags on, my bosses might push the force to crack down harder.
- Where?<eos> Here!<eos> Run into.<eos> Turn!<eos> Continue.<eos> Stop her.<eos> Stop.<eos> Say what you saw in the house.<eos> - A room which looked like a hospital.<eos> - You know what it's for?
And she was adored throughout the kingdom as much for her defiant spirit as for her beauty.<eos> We found it in the woods.<eos> It's injured, Mother.<eos> It must have broken its wing.<eos> Don't worry, it will heal in time.<eos> I'll look after it.<eos> You possess a rare beauty, my love.<eos> In here.<eos> Never lose it.<eos> It will serve you well when you become queen.
I will have to rely on a few meager notes, meager, because I never expected to write this report.<eos> I'm afraid much of what I remember will be different from my real experiences<eos> All reports probably share this issue.<eos> I'm not writing for the joy of writing.<eos> So many things have happened to me that I must write, if I don't want to lose my mind.<eos> There is no one here to think and care for me.<eos> I am quite alone and I must try to get through the long, dark winter months.<eos> I have taken on this task to keep me from staring into the gloom and being frightened.<eos> Because I am frightened.<eos> Fear creeps up on me from all sides, and I do not want to wait until it gets to me and overpowers me.
It wasn't the first time in my life that I had had to survive like this.<eos> The less I resisted it, the more bearable it would be.<eos> I no longer remember what I did that morning.<eos> Maybe the hours that followed were so awful I've had to forget them, maybe I spent them in a state of numbness.<eos> I can't remember.<eos> I finally emerged from this state around 2:00 p.m. when I walked through the gorge with Lynx.<eos> This time I was better equipped.<eos> I had Hugo's binoculars with me, too.<eos> If the man at the well was dead, and there could be no doubt about that, then everyone in the valley was dead, and not only the people, but everything that had been live.<eos> If that was death, it had come very quickly and gently, almost lovingly.
On the 20th of July I started to harvest the hay.<eos> It took me three weeks to harvest the meadow.<eos> This wasn't only the weather's fault, but also that of my clumsiness and physical weakness.<eos> I was overcome by a wave of despair, and, for the first time, I understood quite clearly the hard blow that had hit me.<eos> I don't know what would have happened if responsibility for my animals hadn't forced me to do at least the most necessary things.<eos> I don't like remembering that time.<eos> It was 14 days before I could pull myself together and start living again.<eos> Autumn was always my favorite season, although I never felt very well physically.<eos> In the daytime I was tired yet wide awake, and at night I lay for hours in restless half-sleep with dreams that were more confusing and vivid than usual.<eos> My autumnal malaise didn't spare me in the forest, either, but since I could hardly afford it, it took a less extreme form.
It took only a few days for winter to set in.<eos> Then came the warm wind and licked the young snow from the mountains.<eos> It became disagreeably warm, and the wind hissed day and night around the lodge.<eos> I slept badly and listened to the baying of stags down below for the rutting season.<eos> Both cats were drawn outside into the warm, damp forest.<eos> I lay awake and worried about Pearl.<eos> The baying of the stags sounded sad, threatening and sometimes even desperate.<eos> I only hoped the wind wouldn't last too long, and that winter would finally bring us peace.<eos> The wind only held out for three days, just long enough to kill Pearl.<eos> Pearl was buried, and the wind died down overnight, as if it had accomplished its task.
He wants you to live with him.<eos> Is this acceptable to you, Mr. Shakusky?<eos> What do you think, pal?<eos> We're coming down.<eos> Over and out.<eos> They're coming down.<eos> Over and...<eos> Don't let go.<eos> The Black Beacon storm was considered by the US Department of Inclement Weather to be the region's most destructive meteorological event of the second half of the 20th century.<eos> It lingered through six high tides and inundated the islands with punishing winds and extreme high waters.
Sorry, I, uh--<eos> I thought maybe you wouldn't hear me, 'cause you--didn't.<eos> Is Dr. Matheson around?<eos> Uh--<eos> No, she's not.<eos> Mm.<eos> Can I leave the assignment with you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just watch the coin, okay?<eos> - Where'd it go?
What can you really know?<eos> What can you really trust?<eos> What are your doubts?<eos> What are your certainties?<eos> What do you call truth?<eos> When you look at the sky, what do you see?<eos> Shadows?<eos> Reflections?<eos> Distant echoes?<eos> You see the moon as it was more than a second ago.
This is why we never have sex.<eos> That's disgusting, you're gross.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You're so...<eos> God!<eos> Sadie, Sadie, Sadie, Sadie, Sadie<eos> Charlotte, I'm doing my homework.<eos> Okay, watch this. Watch this.<eos> There's a haunted cow back here.<eos> I'm pretty sure it does not have milk.
America--<eos> I say to the people of America--<eos> This moment is our chance to-- Enough-- To make of our own lives what we will.<eos> That pushes us forward.<eos> The American promise alive. It is that promise that's always set this country apart.<eos> It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom... to make of our own lives what we will.
- He'd do it for 15?<eos> - 15, asshole.<eos> I think in this economy, a quick 15 for two days work... would sound pretty good to Mickey.<eos> We'll sell him a party. Fly in, whack a guy, fly out, quick 15.<eos> Fly coach.<eos> America's financial system is intricate and complex.<eos> But behind all the technical terminology is a critical human factor.<eos> Confidence.<eos> Confidence in our financial systems is essential... to the smooth operation of our economy... and recently that confidence has been shaken.<eos> All of us have a responsibility to solve this crisis... because it affects the financial well-being of every single American.
Come on, Freddy run!<eos> You're robbing the wrong man.<eos> I'm broke. I just got fired.<eos> Shut up.<eos> - Give me the tablet.<eos> - What tablet?<eos> We know you have it, Professor.<eos> Ok, "A", I'm not a professor, I am a bricklayer.<eos> And "B", I don't have it.<eos> And "C", I know where it is.
Super Cookie.<eos> What's this?<eos> Dear daughter. Take care of this.<eos> I'm going to Machu Picchu.<eos> Do not let it fall into the wrong hands.<eos> - Tad, bring your backpack here.<eos> - Yes, I'm coming!<eos> - Hey, isn't that...<eos> - The other half of the tablet.<eos> - What's it say?
I changed Soaring Hawk.<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> Where's he going?<eos> - We do not expect you to, Legs!<eos> Watch your step.<eos> The house needs renovation, but it is habitable.<eos> - Look at it.<eos> It requires a lot of work.<eos> - But we can do it.<eos> It's so big.
I know.<eos> Maddy, it's me: Legs!<eos> Maddy, wake up!<eos> You let in or not?<eos> Quietly, the mother sleeps.<eos> I really do not believe in God and a shit. Immortality of the soul.<eos> Do not you think that we have a soul?<eos> It is with us. But that does not mean that it will live forever.<eos> It is like a flame.<eos> That's true - when it returns.

- He's a lunatic.<eos> I don't wanna die. I don't wanna cry. I wanna fuck!<eos> We gotta get the DVD and get the fuck out of here.<eos> Bruce, we gotta do movies where there's lots of fucking!<eos> Don't worry, I can see it in your eyes, I'm fine.<eos> Watch this, motherfuckers!<eos> Where's my addiction, Bruce?<eos> - Way back there, Jack!<eos> - Can you see it, Bruce?<eos> - It's fucking way over there!
Wait!<eos> Let me talk to you for one second.<eos> Okay. Here's the thing.<eos> I'm not from the candy tree department.<eos> Lying to a child.<eos> Shame on you, Ralph.<eos> But I wasn't lying about the medal.<eos> That is my medal !<eos> That's why I was climbing the tree.<eos> It's mine!

You behaved badly.<eos> Very badly.<eos> And who was responsible for that?<eos> Give me a cup of tea.<eos> How nice!<eos> Alexei Alexandrovich has arrived.<eos> I'm not sure my nerves can stand another Alexei at this moment.<eos> Were you glad to see me or not?<eos> So the Schuzburgs asked us to dinner.<eos> The sauce was said to have cost a thousand rubles, and it was ghastly.
He hasn't gone out for two days.<eos> Soldiers are restless.<eos> My Sheik.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Thank you, Mehmet.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Why doesn't your army fÄ±ght?<eos> We have been here for 40 days<eos> Patience is the second mind to men.<eos> It keeps your dream, your purpose alive.
Not to Ukraine or Kazakhstan but to Belgium.<eos> We had to participate in a symposium about the latest achievements in rock and soil science.<eos> In those times taking a trip abroad, say nothing of Belgium, was quite an event.<eos> Your mother asked me to get her a dress in Antwerp.<eos> I spent a whole day looking for a cheap store.<eos> Don't think I was a cheapskate but our daily allowance was 10 rubles.<eos> And for that money you couldn't get even a can of beer.<eos> Then I bumped into some store- the clothes there cost pennies.<eos> So, I got myself a suit and a dress for your mom.<eos> Week later she called me to tell that she washed the dress and it turned into a mush.
Oh, right yeah, the fake magical Jamaican.<eos> - What was his last name?<eos> - Marley.<eos> Ah. Of course.<eos> Robert Marley.<eos> And that guy's the one who gave you the...<eos> We were in the One Ball parking lot, right?<eos> Just passing around ajoint.<eos> That Jamaican guy... he pulls out this Sauce and goes,<eos> "It be opening doors to other worlds, man."
Oh, wait wait wait, John.<eos> This looks like the place.<eos> - Stay in the car.<eos> Oh shit.<eos> You know what's in there, right?<eos> We know Robert had a stash of the shit.<eos> Hey, man!<eos> You owe me a beer, man!<eos> And if he had a stash, he couldn't just cram it under his bed.<eos> That black shit moves, it has a will, an attitude.

Buddies and my camel friend, I am so glad you have made it.<eos> Babi, what happened to Pete and Grandpa Thomas?<eos> Babi was following boy and men and cat.<eos> Cat very scary.<eos> She find Babi, so Babi run and hide in oasis.<eos> - Are they OK?<eos> - Very much so, friend Mudbud.<eos> They are on their way to Cleocatra's tomb.<eos> That's great, dawg.<eos> Too bad we have no idea where it is.
Seti!<eos> Get the explosives.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Quicksand!<eos> How will we get across?<eos> No problem-o, dudes, I'm an expert in all things dirt-related.<eos> Just roll with it.<eos> You can make your way across now, dudes and dudette.<eos> The discovery of Cleocatra's tomb is priceless.<eos> - It belongs to the Egyptian people.
You know you're so nice that doesn't even seem dirty to me.<eos> Abby, I just wanted to introduce you to Connor.<eos> This is his party and he paid for all the booze.<eos> So drink up.<eos> Uh, Abby's moving into your room. Congrats!<eos> That's the lucky room.<eos> No one's died there.<eos> Yeah, Connor's pilot just got picked up, so he's leaving us common folk and moving into a big new mansion.<eos> It's just a house.<eos> It does have a bidet, though.
But then I got messed up with dope and I stopped.<eos> The photos you saw are part of a series called...<eos> - "I am a wall".<eos> - What wall?<eos> It's a metaphor, basically it's me becoming that wall, entering the wallpaper, going inside the plaster.<eos> Like a lizard...<eos> Not like a lizard.<eos> Virtually, I wanted to ale-materialize.<eos> Me and you, if we didn't have a point of view anymore, we'd be the same.<eos> Yes, I mean without a point of view, we'd stop being against each other and accept reality for what it is, without judging it.
- Remember Abner Louima.<eos> - Why did we let him go?<eos> - I mean, he--<eos> - No, he's gonna be better off out here than he is inside that system.<eos> Trust me on that.<eos> But that's not our decision to make, sir.<eos> - No. Look, let me tell you something.<eos> - You know, that's- - A few years inside that system and he would've been desperate enough to pull that trigger just not to go back inside.<eos> Now this lesson just ain't for him.<eos> It's for you too.
It is so windy.<eos> It's like the worst conditions imaginable.<eos> We got whitecaps breaking over here.<eos> I've never seen him so nervous.<eos> He has not talked at all today.<eos> We have a jump<eos> - Everyone, in my opinion, might be a little too close. But he is coming, and I gotta go watch this.<eos> That's so rough!<eos> Grab him! Get him, get him, get him!<eos> - Looks like your beard-it's a little singed.

Get him, get him, get him!<eos> - Looks like your beard-it's a little singed.<eos> - Is my beard good? It's safe.<eos> It's safe.<eos> There's no singes, bro.<eos> Came out clean.<eos> Then we're good.<eos> This is the ramp setup for Vegas, so test it out. See if it works.
Your shoulder's hurting a little?<eos> Stand on that car.<eos> Claim it! Claim it!<eos> Yeah, Gregg!<eos> Oh, that was fun.<eos> I'm glad you're alive, dude.<eos> Is that the battery?<eos> Yeah, that's the battery.<eos> As you can see, the battery is just toast.<eos> It just launched
# Let's see if your menu<eos> # Can fatten my sinews<eos> # I'm sure that if you Will give me a Sou<eos> # You'll feel better too<eos> # And also meee...<eos> # Ernest, Ernest, Miserable Ernest<eos> # I'm feathery light, I reluctantly diet<eos> # A mushroom, a wiener, Or a waffle for dinner<eos> # The waffle's delicious, Greasy and precious<eos> # It's running away
You know, Avery, if you planned this, it couldn't have turned out any better.<eos> But you're not gonna make it work for you in the police department.<eos> I promise you that.<eos> I didn't come here to be lectured, Dad.<eos> You tricked me.<eos> You said the pool would be good for my knee.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You know, I'm not as calculated as you.<eos> You know, my life's not a campaign.<eos> It's much simpler.
Whatever Christine wants, she gets.<eos> She's exactly the same in bed.<eos> But, she can be very generous sometimes.<eos> She gave me a very beautiful scarf.<eos> She gave you my scarf.<eos> - Oh, no!<eos> - Oh, yes!<eos> - Do you want it back?<eos> - No.<eos> It looks better on you.
That's Al Kaiser.<eos> There's Don Burke.<eos> He lives here full-time.<eos> Could use a little more lift in that jump shot.<eos> Girls, go in the house.<eos> Fill up all the pots with water and bring it on the front porch.<eos> We're on it!<eos> It's essential we remain calm in a crisis.<eos> I'd hardly call it a crisis, Mother.<eos> This house has been in my family for 83 years, and it's not gonna burn up on my watch.

Oh, well, bless you, sweetheart.<eos> Thank you.<eos> "One day, on the brightest of summer mornings, the littlest mouse heard a knock at the front door."<eos> Who's there?<eos> "She opened the door,<eos> "and there standing before her was the grandest elephant "ever seen by a little mouse,<eos> "or any mouse for that matter.<eos> "'I'm pleased to meet you.<eos> My name is Tony.<eos> "'I heard the beautiful music and wanted to see where it was coming from."'
What?<eos> It's cold in my head.<eos> Cold in your head?<eos> Yeah, pain.<eos> Go like this.<eos> Take your finger like this.<eos> Under your tongue.<eos> It's a little trick.<eos> It'll make it go away, okay?<eos> It doesn't wanna go.
When you know you may be lied to, it's best not to ask questions.<eos> That's what we learn from experience.<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> That you should give up on the idea of marriage.<eos> Why?<eos> I love her.<eos> Who said not to love her?<eos> I'm saying not to marry her.<eos> And from now on, not to ask her any questions.<eos> Or to accept her answer, whatever it may be.
C'mon, you've really lost it.<eos> I haven't lost it!<eos> It's a chance, don't you see?<eos> You're making my heart sink.<eos> Tell me this, you're focused on that show, how can we get by without our little trick, just selling fish?<eos> - I thought something else.<eos> - What?<eos> I thought I'd sell the fish stand.<eos> - Don't make me go berserk.<eos> - What's it giving us?

What are you doing here?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You're not blind!<eos> Why do you think so?<eos> I know how you cross the street.<eos> And how do I cross the street?<eos> You have to see the cars well, to cross like that.<eos> You are wrong.<eos> You can see... every car every car on the street makes a horrible noise!<eos> And then it passes by... you know how far is every car... and how fast it is.
I think so.<eos> I've lost my glasses.<eos> Where's my cane?<eos> Here.<eos> I'd prefer to have a cane.<eos> This cane is too short.<eos> Too short...<eos> How long should it be?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It should keep you further away from the danger.
I mean, nothing can fuck me more than this.<eos> Governor, have you had a chance to go over the briefing materials on the bailout?<eos> I really think we need to try and nail down a simple two-sentence response to the economic crisis.<eos> - It's gotta be supportive of the concept...<eos> - That's enough powder.<eos> Of the bailout, but also disappointed that we're at this point, making it clear that changes need to be made to the bill.<eos> You need it a little higher? I can do that.<eos> I can do that for you.<eos> That jacket looks fantastic on you, by the way.<eos> It's too open.

Hundreds of thousands of people are coming to see me speak, not John McCain, God bless him.<eos> They are coming to see me.<eos> So if I am single-handedly carrying this campaign,<eos> I'm gonna do what I want.<eos> Crowd:<eos> Sarah! Sarah!<eos> Sarah!<eos> Man: Several McCain advisers tell CNN they're annoyed by what one aide called "Palin going rogue. ".<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> I hate it when there's leaking and backstabbing after a campaign, let alone before it's fucking over.
Sir, what are you doing?<eos> - l don't want.<eos> Sir... he will die...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Sir... Sir...<eos> Sir...<eos> Sir... he will die...<eos> Master...<eos> Life is a lot more precious than this game, Kancha.<eos> Life is submerged underwater Master... it's begging and pleading.
Everything is going smooth, and he wishes you a happy birthday.<eos> Romania. Cucumbers.<eos> Leif?<eos> Are you home, sweety?<eos> I have a surprise for you.<eos> - Weren't you out for chemo?<eos> - No, I'm done with the chemo.<eos> I have just had a few additional blood tests taken.<eos> We have a lunch break.<eos> Well, it's over now.
Where are you going?<eos> Ida, I'm talking to you.<eos> Where are you going to go?<eos> Bye.<eos> Ida, dammit!<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I want to ask you a favor.<eos> I have received a letter from the hospital.<eos> I don't know what it says.
My Papa<eos> Antonio Villalta Seriously Wounded<eos> A Grand Wedding in Sevilla<eos> Jesus, please, I want to see my father.<eos> A gift from your father.<eos> Welcome to your new home, little one!<eos> You are strictly forbidden from the top floor!<eos> TO THE HENHOUSE!<eos> Don't you like your room?<eos> It's very cozy
Oh my god!<eos> I've got lumps on my face.<eos> What do you think of that sound?<eos> The sound of cicadas chills me out.<eos> But, it is a sad sound for me.<eos> I remember when my father died.<eos> I remember everything at that moment.<eos> Even the rotting smell.<eos> I heard that the smell of a corpse is difficult to get rid off.<eos> Sometimes it remains for the following six months.

Ask your father.<eos> Uh-oh...<eos> I'm so sorry, Jerry.<eos> I let you down.<eos> You should've seen his face.<eos> He knew it was terrible.<eos> It wasn't terrible, you know.<eos> Yes, if it was at La Scala would they be throwing fruit and vegetables?<eos> Yes, they would have. But, this was a cold audition room.<eos> It's all fantasy. You imagine his voice is better than it really is, because you're searching for an excuse to come out of retirement.
My dad had one, he was really good.<eos> Belinda really liked music, so...<eos> I always wished I could have played her something, so I've been writing her this song for when I see her again.<eos> Will you play it?<eos> - It's...<eos> - Please?<eos> No, it's not finished and it's really just not very good, so...<eos> Well, I'll tell you if it's good or not.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's only halfway done, so it's just like...
Piper!<eos> You suck!<eos> How about getting a real job?<eos> Take this and shove it up your ass!<eos> You're useless!<eos> Sir!<eos> I recommend that you do not threaten me.<eos> We got this footage about 20 minutes ago.<eos> It was taken from mr. Piper's patrol car last week, And it establishes intent.<eos> It establishes what we already know -- That tensions run high during traffic citations -- that's it.
Deserted beach in Cabo.<eos> - I like the sound of that.<eos> - Me too.<eos> Let's say good-bye to our closest 75 friends and family.<eos> Who wants a shot, baby?<eos> Come on. Little tequila for the bride and groom?<eos> I'm still good with champagne, Lumpy.<eos> Yeah, maybe when this dance is over. Okay?<eos> - Uh-oh. - Yeah.<eos> - It's over.
Psychic soldiers, able to turn our enemies against themselves.<eos> A whole frontline replacement.<eos> Jesus Christ, you're insane.<eos> What did they? Well, one man's genius can be seen as another man's insanity.<eos> What did you do to me?<eos> It is not what I did to you, it is what I did for you.<eos> What, a shitty haircut and a bad stitch job?<eos> When you came to this facility, you were suffering from chronic neurological seizures... you were dying.<eos> I had to remove the offending part of your brain and replace it with a donor's.<eos> The interspecies grafting procedure you have undergone has not only saved your life, it has made you unique.
Mr. Wright!<eos> TV TV TV!<eos> Turn on your TV quickly!<eos> Huh?<eos> Wha?<eos> What is it?<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> We were standing here like this to take a picture when there was a huge noise coming from behind us.<eos> and this gigantic creature since it came out of Gourd Lake was named Gourdy.
Your blood will not be shed,<eos> Kara Mustafa.<eos> - Look there.<eos> - Where?<eos> There, on the tower.<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> Is beautiful.<eos> It can be seen perfectly.<eos> Even without the invention.<eos> Here it is again.

What, you want to sue her?<eos> Spend 1,000 bucks, or you want to make a cash deal with me?<eos> Make up your mind.<eos> Make up your mind!<eos> I'll take 700 cash.<eos> You're a hairy little creep, aren't you? Some baseball bat bullshit. Seven hundred, my ass.<eos> There's 400 cash.<eos> Now be a good boy, grab that box and put it in her car.<eos> My car, it don't run.<eos> It didn't start this morning.
- It's throbbing a little bit.<eos> The blood's having a hard time getting back to your heart.<eos> Feels good, though.<eos> You going to shoot me?<eos> Or can I come inside?<eos> Yeah, come on inside. I'll shoot you inside.<eos> Listen, I thought we'd take a ride. There's something I need to show you.<eos> There it is.<eos> You can see on initial impact, the left wing hit the ground.<eos> Think if it would have sheared off completely, everybody would have walked away from this plane.
First Officer Evans' testimony confirms the same.<eos> I want to show you something.<eos> Nothing's happening.<eos> This remote isn't working. Apologies.<eos> I can do this manually.<eos> This is the jackscrew on the tail assembly that articulates the horizontal stabilizer, also known as the elevator.<eos> As you can see, the threads on this screw are almost entirely gone.<eos> This part was suggested as a maintenance replacement in January of 2011.<eos> It was never replaced.<eos> It had an additional 1,200 hours of flight on it.

Yes, chef.<eos> Obviously, you'd never have done that.<eos> No, chef.<eos> I'd have heard the eggplant scream.<eos> Jacky is the vegetable whisperer.<eos> And listener.<eos> That's important.<eos> What's this carrot saying?<eos> Grate me.<eos> It wants to be grated.
Darryl!<eos> Darryl?<eos> Come here, boy!<eos> Darryl?<eos> Darryl?<eos> Darryl?<eos> Darryl?<eos> I mean, he hasn't really gone missing before.<eos> Put your seat belt on.<eos> - It's on.
- Sorry.<eos> I can see half of everything perfectly, Thomas.<eos> Half of the world about me, half of this table, half of your ugly face.<eos> Honestly.<eos> But the other half is white.<eos> A patch of white.<eos> Look, here I can see everything.<eos> Here I can still see my hand and here it's gone.<eos> Here I can and here I can't.<eos> I don't know if it's there.

- I can imagine.<eos> You, Tarzan, me...<eos> - A faggot.<eos> Going to be able to manage?<eos> I can go to the loo by myself.<eos> Look.<eos> Look.<eos> My leg.<eos> That's my body saying, 'Fuck you, I'm not playing any more.'<eos> It bends upwards every night.

Well, positive...<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> I'm glad you came.<eos> There's something I'd like to say as I don't think you really understand me.<eos> I would think it awful too if Mario were to decide to die at some point.<eos> It would be terrible.<eos> - More than terrible.<eos> Yes, more than terrible.<eos> This law doesn't make him do it, it just gives him the opportunity to do it.
And they're given something at the end to stop their heart.<eos> Ah, Schubert.<eos> Hear that?<eos> That's drama in musical form.<eos> All the stories in this music can only be told with this music.<eos> No.<eos> I still can't hear it. - You still can't?<eos> He never finished his eighth symphony.<eos> It's strange, no one knows why.<eos> It lay there for years and then he died.
Becky's vagina's magic, and she used it to nab a perfect human being.<eos> Magic's not real, right? Magic is not real. Yeah?<eos> How do you think I feel? I've been planning this shit for six months straight.<eos> I'm ready to murder someone.<eos> I believe it.<eos> But wait, what's her dress like? I bet she looks beautiful.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Go get it. Go get it!<eos> Your mind's gonna be blown.<eos> It's in there, it's in the closet.
I've read your books. Neither do you.<eos> You got it right in Kentucky Blood. I'll give you that.<eos> It's a fine piece of writing.<eos> But Cold Denver Morning, you got it wrong.<eos> Blood Diner...<eos> Look, that wasn't my fault. All right?<eos> Your bad theory helped a killer go free.<eos> You ruined people's lives.<eos> Now, this town doesn't need that.<eos> It needs to heal.
The bleeding's stopped for now, but if it starts again or if there's any more swelling, call a doctor immediately.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> OK.<eos> This way. So...<eos> let's go see this hole.<eos> So you say you heard a loud thump and footsteps in the attic after the power went out?<eos> Yes.<eos> But the ladder wasn't down?<eos> No, it wasn't.
Modesto.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> I haven't got ID don't worry, I know the doorman..<eos> Come on, it 's time to have fun!<eos> Are you people dead or what?<eos> Here we go!<eos> You're lucky you can't see me, blondie.<eos> It's Pink Floyd.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> My head is killing me. like it's going to explode.
Yes!<eos> So, the first room we're coming into is the mash house.<eos> This is the mash tun here and it's massive.<eos> Come on, have a look at it.<eos> It takes 10 and a half tons of malted barley, and to that we add 40,000 liters of hot water.<eos> What we're doing at this stage is mixing the barley and the hot water for the conversion of starch to sugar.<eos> Here we are in the fermentation room.<eos> This is where we ferment the wort we've just extracted from the mash tun.<eos> It's also where we take the third ingredient, the third of the three simple ingredients, which is yeast, and we add it to the mix.<eos> And as soon as we add the yeast, because it's been dehydrated, as soon as we add it to the wort, it starts to ferment.
Looks like he's been a little busy too.<eos> You'll save some time, kill me.<eos> Come on. I won't blame you.<eos> Every man's got his dark side.<eos> Just shoot me.<eos> Come on.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Your gun broke?<eos> No.<eos> It works just fine.
- Yeah, me neither.<eos> Hey, if you need anything, give me a call.<eos> - Thanks, bro.<eos> - All right, brother.<eos> Call me.<eos> "Bad Ass."<eos> Come on, Baxter.<eos> My administration has organized a new initiative, which we are calling "Operation Street Cleaning."<eos> We've also enhanced and increased local law enforcement, in order to rid our neighborhoods of crime and gang-related activity.<eos> It is the top priority of this administration to return our city back to the safety it once knew.
- No, man.<eos> This is government-issued Armed Forces shit.<eos> I rarely see this stuff.<eos> Any other store around here that does?<eos> I'm pretty much the only game in town, you know?<eos> I'd like to keep it that way.<eos> Nice piece ofjewelry.<eos> If you're interested in selling that I'd give you $50 for it.<eos> - That your daughter?<eos> I was gonna say it kind of looks like this girl who goes to our church.
Let me explain something to you.<eos> That drive has information regarding a deal I have with the city to bring in a tremendous amount of revenue.<eos> It's gonna do wonders for this community.<eos> I'm bringing in big change over here, my man.<eos> You'd be doing a public service to return it.<eos> If you call raising crime to chase people out, so you can build oil wells in their backyards, a public service, count me out.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's get down to the brass tacks.<eos> Where... is the motherfucking drive?<eos> It's in... your asshole.
Remember? My quest.<eos> Oh, wow, it took this long to get to a 100?<eos> What am I talking about? Of course it did.<eos> I know, right?<eos> But I did it. I made myself a promise and I kept it.<eos> My heart and cock swell with pride.<eos> Hey, I'm really happy you were here to see me cross the finish line.<eos> - Me too.<eos> - How was your day, buddy?<eos> It started off all right, then it got a little weird and then it just all went sideways and shitty.
Oh, God.<eos> Okay. The court says that I'm not supposed to say anything, ... but I would be, like, totally negligent if I didn't tell you ... that you really have to watch yourself ... when you're alone with Daddy, okay?<eos> Margo was there.<eos> Margo?<eos> You mean, ... you mean our Margo?<eos> That Margo? You have a nice room at Daddy's?<eos> Uh-huh, I have a canopy bed.<eos> Oh, that's nice.<eos> Does Margo have a nice room?<eos> It's tiny, and when you look out the window, there's a wall.
Come here. I want to go home.<eos> Please, I want to go home.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> Just a couple of things, okay, sweetie?<eos> Okay. What about my turtle?<eos> We'll get the turtle.<eos> And you know what?<eos> What? My cousin told me where the key is.<eos> Guess where it is? Where?
You know "The Driver"?<eos> Not really.<eos> You're joking!<eos> You don't know "The Driver"?<eos> - You're from Tel Aviv, right?<eos> - I think I heard of it,<eos> I don't get out much.<eos> Is that your place?<eos> One of them.<eos> That picture you sent me, when's it from?
High-five mine!<eos> High-five mine!<eos> Peanut butter! Peanut butter!<eos> Honey, how cool is this?<eos> It's like winning an Oscar.<eos> You promised me you would go to Janie's party.<eos> But she's one year old.<eos> She ain't gonna know I'm there.<eos> It's not about the party, it's about you keeping your promises.<eos> If there's one thing that little kid'll like, it'd be knowing I won that muscle car.
Love you.<eos> - Uncool, man.<eos> Come on, it looks like you could use the help.<eos> Ms. Miller.<eos> Come on, Brooke.<eos> Can I use the bathroom?<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> Yeah, honey, you can go for it.<eos> Can you please tell Matthew to give me back my lunchbox?<eos> No, Ashton, honey, it's right over here.
How come we do it?<eos> Don't under...<eos> Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming...<eos> Please leave our house.<eos> Good idea.<eos> Jeez, what're you doing in here?<eos> Pink?<eos> What're you doing?<eos> My bowling ball!<eos> It looks prettier that way.
There it is.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> See you later, Ellie.<eos> Bye, Larry.<eos> See you.<eos> What's up, Gabe?<eos> Hey, dude.<eos> How's that tooth treating you?<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Now remember, when it falls out, you need to put that under your pillow.
No recycling?<eos> That's not nice.<eos> It has your lab's seal on it.<eos> Our products go to these places.<eos> Any cabinet will be full of them.<eos> - What's TH-16?<eos> - A toxin.<eos> What kind?<eos> I don't know, we work with hundreds of them.<eos> - What's it for?

- Shall we go in your car?<eos> - No.<eos> Trust me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Beautiful day, isn't it?<eos> From now on I want us to enjoy every beautiful day like this.<eos> Mayka...<eos> It's the one you liked.<eos> Black and chrome.<eos> - It's beautiful.
Tell me how it will be.<eos> You won't want to eat much from now on.<eos> You'll be thirsty.<eos> And sometimes feverish.<eos> You'll want to sleep a lot.<eos> You'll have little or no energy.<eos> Will it hurt?<eos> No.<eos> The morphine will make sure you're not in any pain.<eos> It will give you some beautiful dreams.
Excuse me, miss cricket. Uh, the photo?<eos> Oh, what's this one for?<eos> Longhorn ball souvenir poster.<eos> Ah, no, no, no. White washes you out.<eos> Blue brings out those cornflower eyes I fell for.<eos> Someone gave Amanda a car.<eos> No!<eos> Who?<eos> Don't know.<eos> It came from Zack's dealership.
So it seems you were right.<eos> I do have feelings for Dan.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't have to be.<eos> But I won't see him.<eos> Not because I'm in denial, but because I care too much about your friendship.<eos> You come first.<eos> You're my family.<eos> Look, this isn't gonna be easy for me, but at least you're being honest.<eos> And if our friendship is real, which I know it is, then we can get through this.
See you guys later.<eos> That was weird, wasn't it?<eos> I mean, he mentioned that woman and then he just took off.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh, there's this site called "Gossip Girl."<eos> I'm just gonna see if there's anything about her on there.<eos> Wow.<eos> So after that, we have a Cindy Sherman exhibit we can check out at the M.O.M.A. And then tonight, there's a new restaurant that opened--<eos> I-I'm sorry, Dan.<eos> Cindy Sherman and her unflattering self-portraits aside, it sounds like you planned a perfect day. But it's going to have to wait.
You'll want it.<eos> The vault!<eos> Hacked into the Tower of bloody London's security?<eos> ! How? !<eos> Tell them we're on our way!<eos> There's been another one, another break-in.<eos> Bank of England!<eos> Sir!<eos> Security's down, sir.<eos> It's failing.
- It was there when I got back.<eos> A little trace of breadcrumbs.<eos> Hardback copy of Fairy Tales.<eos> Two children led into the forest by a wicked father, follow a little trail of breadcrumbs.<eos> That's Hansel and Gretel.<eos> What sort of kidnapper leaves clues?<eos> The sort that likes to boast, that thinks it's a game.<eos> He sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me...<eos> "All fairy tales need a good old-fashioned villain."<eos> The fifth substance, it's part of the tale.
Thinking about what's going to happen.<eos> There's an excitement about ideas unfolding that I try to put into it.<eos> It's a stream of communication between designer and player.<eos> And the design of a level like this, is sort of a dialogue or at least a monologue ...<eos> Where it's like:<eos> 'Hey!<eos> Check this out...'<eos> 'Did you realize you we're going to have a problem with that ladder? '<eos> 'Isn't it weird, but cool, that you could have such a problem...' '...just because this ladder was a bit to the left'<eos> 'If it was over here or here, you wouldn't have that problem.'
You can see the different sides of the texture strip.<eos> I can then take the cube and carve in details.<eos> You can barely see it in the game.<eos> You only really feel it in the rotation.<eos> I use the 'Tetris' pattern a lot.<eos> It's kind of a pain. Because I have to go in there and paint it.<eos> And reorient the tiles by hand.<eos> So, here:<eos> I don't like this big straight line.<eos> It's kind of awkward.
Just hang on.<eos> I don't care how it started...<eos> I don't!<eos> I care about right now.<eos> You should get that.<eos> Let it burn.<eos> Please, don't!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, how do you know when you have failed at a career?<eos> Is it when you're asked to host a showcase of no-name comedians, hoping to go to a foreign country, and you're being paid in drinks?<eos> Well, I'm no House, M.D., but I'm beginning to figure out that maybe my life is not going the way I would have preferred that it go.
- Keep a clean playground?<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> It's a simple question, brosephine.<eos> Yeah, yeah. Of course, everyone does.<eos> - Homo.<eos> - Say what?<eos> What? You really think you're having better sex than your parents?<eos> You think that your father loved your mother's beautiful pussy any less because she had more hair down there?<eos> Don't be talking about my mom's pussy.<eos> What? I said it was beautiful, man.
Are you gonna do it?<eos> Hells to the no.<eos> She's a psycho. Awfully wonderful in the boudoir, though.<eos> That's why I kept it going long after the expiration date.<eos> What was so wonderful about it?<eos> Just the enthusiasm, really.<eos> You know, it was as if the act itself was rejuvenating to her.<eos> It was as if she were dying of thirst and my cock was the fountain of everlasting youth.<eos> Mm, must be nice.<eos> I don't think a woman has ever looked at my dick like it offered health benefits of any kind.
That's our country.<eos> It's in our blood.<eos> Anything is possible.<eos> So we run tests they don't need.<eos> We take drugs that don't work.<eos> We send 25 specialists in to puzzle over a terminal patient.<eos> We're bankrupting the system, and no one cares.<eos> As long as it gives us two more weeks with Grandpa, it's worth it.<eos> This pill cost $300!<eos> And it won't work!
Guess who just got engaged.<eos> Ah...<eos> Hey, congratulations.<eos> - Thanks, man.<eos> - Isn't this kind of sudden?<eos> That's funny, 'cause Tammy said 'what took you so long? '<eos> That's what I mean, why now, after all these years?<eos> I don't know, everything we've been through, especially you and Abby.<eos> - Life's short.<eos> - Yeah, it is.
It's what I did.<eos> Years ago, some dangerous men came after my family.<eos> And we decided to go into the program.<eos> It was the hardest decision I've ever made, but I knew I had to make it.<eos> - Ray McDeere.<eos> - I need the ring back.<eos> - You're funny.<eos> - I'm not joking.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Turns out it didn't exactly belong to me.
You're exposing your client to prison time and you're letting a drug syndicate avoid prosecution.<eos> Are you questioning my legal judgment?<eos> I'm questioning whether you're even making one.<eos> This isn't about our family.<eos> This is about getting a young girl a good deal, a good offer.<eos> We took the same deal and look where we are.<eos> I think she can win, and I'm going for it.<eos> While I cannot condone the actions of a drug courier, neither can I condone an action against her based on a breach of confidentiality.<eos> Justifying that breach as a leak of physical evidence, not information, seems like unfair word play.<eos> If the legislature intended to exclude physical evidence from the rule, it should have said so clearly.
His name is Patrick Walker.<eos> I want you to represent him.<eos> He's been framed for a crime he didn't commit and I want him out.<eos> Here's my offer:<eos> You are gonna handle the case.<eos> If you do, the McDeere and Morolto families will be square.<eos> The victim's body was found in the trunk of your car.<eos> I've never met Charlotte Miller.<eos> My client didn't even know the victim.<eos> That suitcase, it weighs 117 pounds.
I'm sorry.<eos> Wendy lied.<eos> I just talked to her.<eos> You saw Wendy?<eos> In the bathroom.<eos> She's upset.<eos> About what?<eos> What she said on the stand.<eos> She admitted to going too far.<eos> She made the attack sound worse than it really was.
Answer the question, Miss. Vail.<eos> I told the truth.<eos> Nothing further, your Honour.<eos> - This time we move for...<eos> - Not so fast, Mr. Harper.<eos> Mr. McDeere, your witness.<eos> You spoke to my wife in the restroom, didn't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You were upset because you said some things that weren't true.<eos> You made the attack seem worse that it actually was.
Good, then I assign you.<eos> So, what? You're my babysitter now?<eos> That's howl roll, baby.<eos> Great.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Look at this.<eos> You're late.<eos> Doesn't your fancy car have a clock?<eos> Yeah, it has GPS navigation too.
Do you remember the story of the eagle and the arrow?<eos> No.<eos> The eagle once ruled our skies.<eos> And then, one day, he was struck down by the arrow.<eos> As he lay dying, the eagle could not understand why.<eos> The shaft of the arrow had been feathered by one of his own plumes.<eos> We often give our enemies the means to our own defeat.<eos> Look inside.<eos> Ask your heart.<eos> The truth may sleep, but it never dies.
Don't worry, the offset head will fit on this.<eos> The ball lives in the offset head, but the spirit lives in the stick.<eos> I may be old, but I'm not out of touch I watch ESPNU on my iPad.<eos> What's this?<eos> That's the Crooked Arrow, my Sunaquot name.<eos> I have made sticks and arrows for generations.<eos> Each one is different, and none are perfect.<eos> No arrow flies straight.<eos> There's nothing wrong with a crooked arrow.<eos> As long as it follows its own path, it will find its way.
- You do, we beat Bernard twice.<eos> That means we're in the playoffs.<eos> We're in the playoffs!<eos> What's up?<eos> Check this out.<eos> Coach, what's going on?<eos> How is this possible?<eos> Geyer needed a start date.<eos> The season ended today, so I gave him one.<eos> But it didn't end today.
♪ Willie said, mama, don't put me down ♪<eos> ♪ they're doing that hand jive all over town ♪<eos> ♪ hand jive ♪<eos> ♪ Mama, mama, look at Uncle Joe ♪<eos> My car!<eos> Stevie!<eos> What about my car?<eos> It's-- it's fine.<eos> What?<eos> It's just holding its breath.
Me, I just say throw the damn ring in and see what comes up.<eos> I bet you've seen a lot.<eos> No, I'm not coming down there to fill out a report!<eos> Don't you people keep records?<eos> Detective Holder said he would send someone.<eos> You like grilled cheese with tomatoes or ham?<eos> This is the second time you've put me on hold.<eos> Uh... No, wait a minute!<eos> Well, I have this very special fancy pan, if I can find it.<eos> It makes the best grilled-cheese sandwiches ever.
You shut up.<eos> Dad's gonna be home soon, and I'm gonna tell him that you said he can't protect us.<eos> The killer was right outside our house.<eos> He can't.<eos> Shut up.<eos> It's true, and you know it.<eos> No!<eos> It's mine!<eos> Just give me the sword.<eos> No! It's mine!
I was fourteen years old.<eos> We see events differently.<eos> Your badge.<eos> Rosie was just on the website once, that's it.<eos> Get out of my house!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - It's a key card.<eos> There was someone else in here that night.<eos> Damn it, Linden, turn off your flashlight.<eos> It's off.
You got any?<eos> I looked into this Beau Soleil.<eos> All Russian girls.<eos> No record of Rosie.<eos> The cops were wrong.<eos> What are you doing here, Janek?<eos> My contact at the morgue gave me Rosie's file.<eos> The police--<eos> They don't tell you the truth about how she died.<eos> Rosie was alive in that car when it went into the water.
Yeah, anybody ever tell you you're white?<eos> You never had sex with her?<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> Didn't hook up at all?<eos> No.<eos> All she'd ever do was cry when I'd want to.<eos> Bitch was like meat kryptonite.<eos> Look, she hated her life. All right?<eos> Said it was all a fake.
I'm fine.<eos> 'Cause you know...<eos> You can talk to me.<eos> About whatever.<eos> If you want.<eos> Look, I'm- - I'm here.<eos> I know you are.<eos> So, can we find the key now?<eos> Yeah, whatever you say, boss.<eos> It's not in there.
- Spidey-sense tingling?<eos> - No.<eos> But sometimes that feels just as weird.<eos> It can't have been that easy, right?<eos> And how does uncontained energy exist on its own?<eos> And wouldn't it need some sort of conduction, not to mention a power supply?<eos> Where did it go?<eos> Energy doesn't just disappear.<eos> They said that in science class.<eos> Whatever that thing is, if it came here to feed, then this city is an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Just run a magnitoencephalographic neural scan and find out.<eos> See?<eos> ...<eos> I mean, that is definitely not Jack.<eos> But neural transplantation is impossible.<eos> What about neural teleportation?<eos> Neural what?<eos> Dr. Fowler's matter-relocation unit blew up in our faces this morning.<eos> Maybe it affected our synaptic functioning.<eos> He said it was having issues.
No, no, no, n...<eos> Jack?<eos> Crap.<eos> Breathe easy, Jack.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm probing my own brain, Allie.<eos> It's so not okay.<eos> Allison, do you want me to disengage the gloves?<eos> No, leaving the probe there could cause permanent damage.<eos> We're gonna have to maneuver it out the way it came in.

We can't end our fake relationship the night it started, anyway.<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you for stopping by the Empire with me.<eos> I'm glad you asked.<eos> It seems we've finally stopped keeping secrets just in time for our wedding.<eos> You're not getting cold feet, are you?<eos> No.<eos> I've never been more sure of any decision my entire life.<eos> I know my I.D. is in here somewhere.<eos> Here it is.
Told Serena I wanted to hand-pick the macarons for tonight.<eos> Besides, I wouldn't mind an orange blossom to tide me over before dinner.<eos> Of course.<eos> I love Laduree.<eos> Although...<eos> I can go there anytime I like in Paris.<eos> You can never have too many macarons.<eos> You joke, but you might want to lick creme fraiche off a stripper or take a pole dancing class while you still can.<eos> What's the point in deviating from the royal path, even for one night?<eos> My life is what it is.
We could get married and then get some lunch.<eos> If you want.<eos> I thought you wanted a big wedding.<eos> Fancy dress.<eos> Banana cream pies.<eos> I just wanna be your wife... before we adopt our son.<eos> And just one more signature right here.<eos> Congratulations, Mr. And Mrs. Evans, it's a boy.<eos> Mm, I always loved that house.<eos> It deserved better.

This is how time remembers them.<eos> It's not how I remember them.<eos> I knew them as friends, as did Antwon.<eos> And I knew them as sports fans.<eos> Both believed that at their best, sports and athletes can be transcendent.<eos> They can remind us that an underdog can still find glory... and that there might still be magic left in David's sling.<eos> So today, I'm proud to announce... the Edwards-Scott Memorial Scholarship Program.<eos> A scholarship program for college-bound students... who plan to pursue any sports-related majors.<eos> Coaches, trainers, coordinators and, yes, broadcasters.<eos> It's not my intention that one day this scholarship fund will erase the past... but it is my intention that one day it might eclipse it... and remind a new generation of sports fans that what you do matters... and how you do it matters.
Hold on.<eos> Almost there.<eos> Okay, open.<eos> - My old house?<eos> - No, our new home.<eos> - What?<eos> - Come on.<eos> What?<eos> You said this house deserved better.<eos> That it deserved a family.
Good.<eos> Here he comes.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, honey.<eos> What's up, Jerry?<eos> Have a good show.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, who's that guy who told Alex her song's no good?<eos> Crappy.<eos> He said it was crappy.
Ah. Don't tell her I said that.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm gonna go get a drink.<eos> This ginger needs her jiggle juice.<eos> See you later.<eos> Make good choices.<eos> I thought of a new name for this hairstyle.<eos> It's called the Orthodox Jew ponytail.<eos> Yeah?<eos> 'Cause it's very reserved at the front...
Part of Sinbad, part of her.<eos> Sinbad is part of you as you are part of me.<eos> Breathe what he breathes.<eos> Feed off his emotion.<eos> Follow the magic of his curse.<eos> Go to him now.<eos> Bring him to me.<eos> Gunnar.<eos> What was that creature?<eos> Um, well, technically it would be called a familiar, a creature created with a certain bond to someone, though how it can actually move and exist is quite extraordinary and, well, wrong.
Go!<eos> No!<eos> Listen to me, if you get in their way, they will kill you.<eos> What I have done, what I did.<eos> He's right, Sinbad.<eos> I was a Valsgarde.<eos> A bloody, barbaric killer.<eos> I have run long enough.<eos> It ends here.<eos> That thing, it came back!
Listen to me, if you get in their way, they will kill you.<eos> What I have done, what I did.<eos> He's right, Sinbad.<eos> I was a Valsgarde.<eos> A bloody, barbaric killer.<eos> I have run long enough.<eos> It ends here.<eos> That thing, it came back!<eos> That thing came back!<eos> It's gonna kill us all.
Clearly it was meant for him.<eos> It will kill him!<eos> Why does a Valsgarde care so much for a man like that?<eos> Obsidian, I give you my word, if you let me go after him, I will return.<eos> I will not run.<eos> You are men of honour.<eos> You protect the weak.<eos> And, Sinbad, he is...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Stopping that creature before it kills Sinbad.
It's feeding off you.<eos> You have to let go!<eos> Your emotions, your fury, your anger!<eos> You have to let it go.<eos> No, Sinbad!<eos> Now, listen to me.<eos> You saw what I was like before.<eos> You can't give into that anger, that rush.<eos> You can't.<eos> It will kill me.
Sooner or later, one of us will weaken and it's better if it's not me.<eos> Tell him to kill you.<eos> I don't want to kill you.<eos> Take his life and you'll be free.<eos> And what if we stay like this?<eos> What if neither of us dies?<eos> You will grow tired...<eos> Eventually.<eos> I will never kill him.<eos> The emulate, it frightens him.
Actually, it makes me even hungrier.<eos> I can give you something for that.<eos> Did you just find us a way out?<eos> Not yet, but I did turn the outer shell into a wireless relay.<eos> Which means I can respond to the five hundred texts my roommate has sent me.<eos> Or, who do you have on speed dial?<eos> Dyson, I'm trapped in a magic lamp, but it's not a lamp. What?<eos> It looks like a music box.<eos> Just go with it, it's a metaphor.<eos> Last time I saw it, it was in the private room at the Swarga Lounge.
It's completely and utterly and totally wrong! Why?<eos> You need a solid polygonal base and a triangular face to meet at a common point!<eos> What is wrong with you people?<eos> ! You're never going to culminate into a single apex that way!<eos> Miss?<eos> Anything I could do for extra credit?<eos> Lobster dinner.<eos> Lauren, I'm kidding.<eos> Whatcha got there?<eos> Whatever this Fae drug is that's infecting these kids, it contains traces of embryonic tissue.
- This is because we are too demanding too full, too real.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> And you?<eos> - Me, nothing, no one, I am alone.<eos> But recently, I am troubled by someone.<eos> - Really, since when?<eos> - This morning.<eos> - How so?<eos> - A church!<eos> It is superb.
- Oh no!<eos> - Here we go again.<eos> - It's crazy, that!<eos> We thought you'd like it.<eos> - If so, it makes me feel good.<eos> No, but ... is wine, champagne ...<eos> And you are so nice finally.<eos> It me ...<eos> Even if this story is false ...<eos> - It is true.

Shh! Shh!<eos> Shh! Shh!<eos> Shh!<eos> Chris!<eos> - Won't be seeing him again.<eos> - What are we gonna do?<eos> - I just wanna get out of here.<eos> - We can't because the shutters are down.<eos> My unit's the best bet.<eos> It locks from the inside. In case...
Ferka.<eos> Follow me.<eos> This beast was not made a werewolf, not infected by a bite,<eos> but was born one.<eos> Born one?<eos> Do you mean a woman can...<eos> Taken by a beast. Yeah.<eos> This beast is stronger and smarter.<eos> The disease is part of its original blood.<eos> And it gets stronger, too, with each passing moon, until one day,

And it gets stronger, too, with each passing moon, until one day,<eos> it will be able to transform at will.<eos> Transform at will?<eos> It must be stopped now, before it is too late.<eos> Too late for what?<eos> Winter Solstice.<eos> It's upon us in two days, two nights.<eos> The longest night of the year.<eos> It's when the moon is closest to the Earth.<eos> It will be calling the creature, even by day.
CAMERAS CLICK<eos> It is with great sadness that I have to inform you that wreckage retrieved from the north Atlantic early this morning has now been identified as coming from the plane carrying our nation's Prime Minister.<eos> 'The government is therefore regretfully adopting an official position - 'the Prime Minister is dead.<eos> 'A memorial service will be held within the next week 'and the party will choose a new leader to take us into the election.<eos> 'I hope I speak for all of us when I say that as a man and a leader,' he will be greatly missed.<eos> Coming as this does... HELICOPTER WHIRRS<eos> Tragically, this comes in the wake of the disaster in Scarrow.<eos> And on the back of...a good few years now of real hardship for a lot of people in this country.<eos> And you might feel, as I do... ..that our nation is being sorely tested.<eos> It is.

And you were where else?<eos> Ulster. Germany.<eos> That's you and...?<eos> Look, have we got time to talk?<eos> I've got a very important meeting with the Indian Minister for Coal.<eos> It's a shame.<eos> Please, go ahead.<eos> I have wet wipes here.<eos> Let's get our hands dirty.<eos> This coal provided the underground boiler room that made this nation what it is today.
But before you welcome them with open arms, I want you to remember that it was the British people... ..who ploughed tens of billions into these banks in 2008.<eos> In return for this bailout, they promised that they would lend to small businesses.<eos> Well, did they lend to small businesses like they promised?<eos> Excuse my French, but did they fuck!<eos> LAUGHTER<eos> 'So... 'there's something in these photos that you didn't see, 'clever as you are.<eos> 'I've decided you're on my side.<eos> 'Everyone else might have given up on me, but I've still got, well... 'you.'<eos> What you missed was the bottle.<eos> First, it was in the baggage truck.

They're burn marks...in all probability a bomb.<eos> Sammy Shourar - he was on the plane with Charles Flyte.<eos> He may have been working for the Iranians.<eos> What you missed was the bottle.<eos> First it was in the baggage truck and then it wasn't and then it was.
Order!<eos> Tom, please, enough.<eos> No, John, it's not enough.<eos> It's not nearly enough.<eos> I'll tell you what enough should be.<eos> Enough would be learning from our past and not bulldozing our way into another unwarranted, illegal war.<eos> (MPS) Hear, hear!<eos> Enough?<eos> Order.<eos> I say enough would be returning democracy to this house and to the country it represents.
Can't even blame the poor Polack.<eos> No-one explained it properly.<eos> Suddenly they realise there's one pile of cash between two deliveries, and the numbers don't add up.<eos> They're a case light.<eos> It's a mess.<eos> They can't go back to the client, cos they can't prove who screwed up.<eos> So they do the only thing they can do.<eos> Absorb the loss, and keep it as quiet as possible.<eos> And the missing case?<eos> Wherever we want it to be.
All of Rome knows you're the mother to my children.<eos> The pope must be seen to be chaste.<eos> God has chosen us to sweep the Vatican clean of corruption.<eos> What Rome needs now is-<eos> You.<eos> Don't you want them to hear that you have a new whore?<eos> Whom can one trust, in this Rome of ours?<eos> I believe trust needs to be earned, my lord.<eos> Somebody!<eos> Perhaps it has been.
Something to do with killing.<eos> Ah.<eos> Killing.<eos> We will have none of that.<eos> Not today.<eos> You are brothers, after all, are you not?<eos> Your Eminence.<eos> You have found your prize.<eos> Sh sh sh...<eos> But it may have led you to a greater one.
At least the pope is not tempted with the sin of sodomy.<eos> His Holiness claimed to know nothing.<eos> Is he a fox, or a holy fool, that pope?<eos> He is definitely no fool, my liege.<eos> But if he thinks he's fooled me, Ambassador, he'll find he's wrong.<eos> This room was King Ferrante's joke, a parody of the last supper.<eos> Do you find it amusing?<eos> I find it repellent, my liege.<eos> But the Judas seat is empty.<eos> It awaits its occupant.
Barely.<eos> Let's pray.<eos> How long to batter the walls apart?<eos> The walls are 10 foot thick, my liege.<eos> Twelve hours of fire should achieve it.<eos> Twelve hours of cannon fire.<eos> Could I perhaps sleep through it?<eos> If Your Highness puts wax his ears.<eos> The fever returns?<eos> It never leaves us, Catherina Sforza.
You are a cleric, not a soldier.<eos> Then, yes.<eos> I have a secret.<eos> The whole of Rome is whispering.<eos> Of our dark son.<eos> So let us instruct you in the art of vengeance.<eos> Do I need lessons?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Vengeance should never be seen as that.<eos> It should always be unexpected.
Do I need lessons?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Vengeance should never be seen as that.<eos> It should always be unexpected.<eos> And it should rarely be public.<eos> You learnt this from the Lord?<eos> We know little of war, but much of vengeance.<eos> And the one salient point is this:<eos> Vengeance is patient.<eos> It can wait a lifetime if necessary.

The French munitions were destroyed.<eos> But not by thunder.<eos> By some brave Roman souls.<eos> You mean?<eos> I mean...<eos> I am now in the eternal debt of Rome.<eos> And I pledge all booty from this field of battle to our Holy Mother Church.<eos> Your salts of mercury, Highness?<eos> And the rain?<eos> It has finally stopped, Highness.
Like your studies.<eos> But I have no books.<eos> You will have a wife.<eos> I'm a wheelwright, Micheletto.<eos> I live in Forli.<eos> I will marry in Forli, and I will die in Forli.<eos> Then come to Rome.<eos> I know what your life is in Rome.<eos> My life, what is my life, Augustino?<eos> It does not involve healing.
What is the news from Florence?<eos> Ah,officially,I am here to open the shutters of the Villa Medici for my master,Piero de Medici.<eos> Stones have been thrown at his house in Florence.<eos> Large stones.<eos> He believes he will be safer here in Rome.<eos> Not without our protection.<eos> The Medici have made many enemies; that cannot be contested.<eos> What of the Medici bank?<eos> Is it a sinking ship?<eos> Oh,I am not a banker,but it may have already sunk.
"Someone will remember us, even in another time."<eos> "Even in another time."<eos> And you, are you an artist?<eos> No, I'm a bored nobleman from a family of considerable wealth with too much time on my hands.<eos> I paint and draw, pretend to be an artist.<eos> Well then, I will pretend with you.<eos> What happened to your hand?<eos> Oh, I was bitten. By a panther.<eos> Yes, I remember the beast.<eos> It dared to bite such a beautiful hand?
I married one of your choosing to be free to love you.<eos> But you were not the pope's daughter!<eos> Rodrigo, she will love whom she chooses.<eos> She is a Borgia.<eos> I hear the Pallavicini boys have gone.<eos> Yes, because you would marry a pauper with a paint brush.<eos> I would have married Calvino Pallavicini as you bid, dear father.<eos> But if I had followed my heart, I doubt I would have married either of them.<eos> Oh, so, the future of this family is in thrall to your heart?<eos> If it is, it needs mending.
You're willing to do all of this for him...<eos> And he's not even your family.<eos> He is my family, Bonnie.<eos> I know that might be hard for you to hear, but he is.<eos> But that doesn't mean that I don't care about you.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> You can't.<eos> You have no magic and I don't trust you.<eos> When I put mikael down, my magic didn't just leave me.<eos> It drifted away.
We have to work fast.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> Good news, bad news?<eos> Bonnie thinks that she can help you with a spell.<eos> Well, it's worth a try.<eos> But she needs something that you wore before you put on the ring.<eos> Something personal.<eos> Well, there's, uh...<eos> My wedding ring.<eos> It's at the loft.
But she needs something that you wore before you put on the ring.<eos> Something personal.<eos> Well, there's, uh...<eos> My wedding ring.<eos> It's at the loft.<eos> OK, yeah.<eos> Um, that's a good idea.<eos> I think it's better if you stay here with me.<eos> Oh, you and your tranquilizers.<eos> It's in the dresser by the kitchen.
It's, uh, not normally on the menu.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I'm as surprised as you are that I'm here.<eos> So we're hunting the same thing, just in different centuries?<eos> Two bodies.<eos> A few days apart just a little over a month ago.<eos> One witness said that she saw an assailant light up red after sucking the life out of a man.<eos> Awesome.<eos> How does that fill you with awe?<eos> Look, Dean, this thing, it kills --
One witness said that she saw an assailant light up red after sucking the life out of a man.<eos> Awesome.<eos> How does that fill you with awe?<eos> Look, Dean, this thing, it kills --<eos> - In threes.<eos> - In threes.<eos> But you already know that.<eos> He's two down.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> We've got to get this thing before it grabs the last one.
I know what I'm doing, Rufus.<eos> You're thinking you can help those boys.<eos> But how many spirits you meet in their right mind?<eos> What's it gonna be -- stay or go?<eos> I'm concerned that Bobby might be haunting you.<eos> I've already tried contacting Bobby.<eos> Without me?<eos> If he was there, I'd have told you.<eos> We burned him, Dean.<eos> The blade was across the room, and then it was in my hand.
What did you say to her?<eos> Yeah, I'm your slave.<eos> I love being your slave.<eos> Yeah, put me in your cage!<eos> I wanna go in the cage!<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait, it's dark in here!<eos> I don't wanna be in here anymore!<eos> I don't wanna be in here anymore!<eos> Yeah, your dick looks so big and it's looking at me!
- Yeah, that sounds too harsh.<eos> Stop fucking whining and take your medicine, Moody.<eos> Hey, you don't look too bad.<eos> I thought you'd walk back in here all bruised up and shit.<eos> The only violence was emotional.<eos> What did they do?<eos> They took me out back, put me down on my knees.<eos> The big guy took down his pants.<eos> He took out his dick.<eos> It was very big, Tyler.

Becky, Becky, we appreciate your enthusiasm, but will you just keep it down with the shouting?<eos> Keep your big honking nose out of it, Berry!<eos> So, I wouldn't mind watching a little TV.<eos> Dude, it's a hotel.<eos> It's gotta be Skinemax.<eos> We could put on a fashion show!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Let's go all Sound of Music and make some old-timey couture out of the drapes and bedsheets, huh? Too gay! I second that.<eos> Well, I'd love to show you guys my prom dress.<eos> I wouldn't want it to go completely to waste.

We use a lot more profanity.<eos> Son of a bitch...!<eos> Leela, take my hand!<eos> I'm slipping!<eos> The one time your hands aren't sticky, they're greasy!<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Normally I would've wiped them on my pants, but...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I... ow!<eos> My leg, it's broken.
Um, uh, tap.<eos> I mean bottled.<eos> Ooh, I love your boots, Leela.<eos> Nobody would ever guess they're knockoffs.<eos> How could you tell?<eos> I guessed.<eos> They're at it again.<eos> Please, Fry.<eos> Girlfriends always talk trash to each other.<eos> Like how I might say I like Amy's dress 'cause it covers all her tramp stamps.
(All screaming) I'm gonna peel off your skin and eat it like pencil shavings.<eos> (Gasps) Ow!<eos> Thank God Zoidberg didn't reattach my nerves.<eos> Mmm, that's tasty.<eos> Too tasty.<eos> (Whimpers) It burns.<eos> It... it burns!<eos> (Screaming) What's happening?<eos> The spicy curried goat.<eos> Hermes' skin is so saturated with it that it's dissolving the bad robot.
Tell that to the kids.<eos> Darling, we're going to make this work.<eos> Just try not to worry too much, and take care of yourself.<eos> You know me better than anyone, Clair.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> You're a workaholic and you're sensitive.<eos> I don't wanna see you go over the edge like what's-his-name.<eos> Clair's concerns about me proved justified.<eos> Three weeks on and Long Ear's head was playing on my mind.<eos> Life was hellish, but it was just about to get a hell of a lot worse.
But it's for Save the Children.<eos> Kids who ain't got no food, Nintendo or nothing, bruv.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Wait there. - I'm coming down.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You gonna open up this door, then, or what, bruv?<eos> Um, I tell you what I'm gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna put some loose change into this sock and then I'm gonna feed it through the letter box.<eos> - Did you get that?<eos> - Is it clean?

I've tried to get on top of it.<eos> I went to a washhouse when I was at college, but I was just so terrified, I accidentally trapped my load in an OOO.<eos> An OOO?<eos> Yes.<eos> An out of order machine.<eos> I was in there with about six months' of unimaginably sensitive material.<eos> The room gathered round, engineers were called.<eos> - It was a nightmare.<eos> - No. I sympathize with you.<eos> As unpleasant as the experience may have been it cannot have been traumatic enough to create such a phobia.
I'm afraid this is one very sick community support police officer.<eos> Very good.<eos> You know, you can't beat these old machines for sheer craftsmanship.<eos> Front loading, motor power, elegant design.<eos> Admittedly, they don't spin as fast as modern machines do, but so what?<eos> As Mahatma Gandhi said, "There's more to life "than simply increasing its speed."<eos> Looking at this washing machine, you'd have to agree with him.<eos> I mean, it's a bloody work of art.<eos> I said, it's a work of art. Don't you agree?<eos> Yes, it's very nice.
It's about 4:42.<eos> That's four hours.<eos> Caught him touching my guns.<eos> Were we are headed.<eos> There might be 20 people in the world.<eos> Who can say I've seen worst and not be lying to get laid.<eos> People... like Mrs. Cole... they don't know how lucky they are they hired me.<eos> Stop the boat.<eos> We found the beacon.<eos> It's here.
People... like Mrs. Cole... they don't know how lucky they are they hired me.<eos> Stop the boat.<eos> We found the beacon.<eos> It's here.<eos> Get in there, get in there, get in there, get in there.<eos> Here we go, here we go.<eos> - OK, where is it? - 15 meters. Right up here.<eos> OK stop it! Stop!<eos> Where is it?<eos> It's here.
Thank you!<eos> A marvellous device invented by a thoroughly modern woman called Marie Stopes.<eos> Family planning. Oh!<eos> I could do with a maid.<eos> No, not for all the tea in China.<eos> Even without Mr Andrews, there's still the electric iron to worry about.<eos> And the vacuum cleaner, and the new washing machine.<eos> Don't they save you labour?<eos> Yes, but at what cost, Miss? My priest says it's unnatural putting electricity through wires.<eos> Sooner or later, it'll come in contact with the molten centre of the earth and will blow up the whole world.
Allie?<eos> Allie, what's happening?<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> It's on the move.<eos> I'm coming to get you.<eos> No, no, no, I'm fine.<eos> Just...<eos> I'll call Andy, he'll give me a ride to the smart house.<eos> You just need to stop this thing before it gets out of hand.
Hey, you two, get back in here!<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna give you your present later.<eos> Okay. Okay. Ohh.<eos> What Neal found was a surveillance tape from the symphony.<eos> Now, obviously, the security is pretty outdated.<eos> This only shows the hallway outside where they kept the Strad.<eos> This is from Wednesday, when it went missing.<eos> No activity at all?<eos> Yeah, I thought it was strange, too, so we examined the tape -- It's pretty worn.
I don't know, but he's in room 207, and she clearly hands him the violin.<eos> All right, I'll call you back.<eos> Annie may not be his target.<eos> Damn it!<eos> There's a second exit.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Where's room 207?<eos> Mr. Sumner.<eos> Room 207.<eos> Where is it?
Down, like, a bazillion stairs?<eos> Do...<eos> No!<eos> I won't!<eos> I'm out!<eos> Sheriff.<eos> Sheriff, sheriff, sheriff.<eos> Shut up, Larry.<eos> The light is fading.<eos> It's fading.
No go.<eos> We've got rescue divers combing the water.<eos> They're doing high and low-resolution sonar sweeps of the lake.<eos> Sweeps complete.<eos> No hits.<eos> How's that possible?<eos> Okay, they're down there somewhere... we missed them.<eos> - Impossible, unless...<eos> - The Archimedes trench.<eos> It's more than a mile deep, and that lab will not survive the pressure for very long.
In the meantime, Travis will be in prison.<eos> We've got an opportunity here.<eos> The girl needs money. You have a lot of money.<eos> You only have one son.<eos> Settle.<eos> Do whatever you have to do.<eos> That's eight million in three installments.<eos> In a way which makes it clear, the attorney representing Mr. Harding was totally unaware.<eos> The gag order and confidentiality clause are standard.<eos> As Charles here has hopefully explained, it means you stop cooperating as a witness.
I am just glad that my obsession with detail and photographic memory could help you in your investigation.<eos> Actually, it was my identification of the honeycrisp apple that Debby was eating which enabled the authorities to track her to the only organic market in Unincorporated Juarez.<eos> Well, I... have... so much more money than you.<eos> She may not for long. I've got good news.<eos> Honey, I sold the company.<eos> Zack.<eos> You sold Losin' It With Jesus?<eos> How could you do that?<eos> It's my company.<eos> Exactly, and it still is.
Only my beloved husband has ever gotten to home plate, but there are boys that made it to other bases.<eos> Some even ran around in the outfield a bit.<eos> Oh, I really, really can't believe it.<eos> I guess when I heard the pastor's speech, my past came flooding back.<eos> I would give anything to keep young ladies like your Laura from making my mistakes.<eos> See, I wish she could hear that story.<eos> I think that would mean a whole lot more to her than a heck house full of fake scares.<eos> Then why don't you tell her what you've gone through?<eos> You know kids.<eos> They can't hear the truth if it comes from their own parents.
Yes, I am sure.<eos> A glass of bourbon and a low-cut top works better than truth serum on that man.<eos> He says that your daddy always used the wood from a pecan tree on pepper creek.<eos> It seems that the riverbed gives the smoke a very unique flavor.<eos> Absolutely impossible to replicate.<eos> And here it is.<eos> Sharon?<eos> Amanda, I know you need help on your barbecue team, and I'm willing to join on one condition... if we win, I get the car.<eos> No questions asked.<eos> But isn't it from Zack's dealership?
A coward!<eos> Maybelle wouldn't have wanted that.<eos> Why did you do it? Why?<eos> I knew.<eos> In fact, I've always known.<eos> That it was too wonderful to be true.<eos> That it couldn't last.<eos> That life isn't like that, life isn't generous.<eos> You mustn't love someone, you mustn't become attached to someone, life begrudges you that.<eos> It takes everything away from you and laughs in your face.

That's ridiculous!<eos> - That's a musical or something?<eos> You guys want snacks?<eos> Hey. Hey. I know what you're up to.<eos> Hey, I'm just trying to watch "Steely Mags."<eos> No, no, I know what you have planned, and you need to just slow it down, because now is not a good time for this.<eos> Wait.<eos> Not a good time for who?<eos> Not a good time for you?<eos> 'cause the surprise isn't for you--it's for Lennon.
You could be right.<eos> Her pulse, blood pressure and respiration are off the charts.<eos> If she keeps going at that pace, she's gonna drop dead.<eos> That's not the worst outcome I can imagine right now.<eos> I'm gonna talk her down.<eos> Pull your men back.<eos> All officers, stand down and retreat to barriers.<eos> Repeat, stand down.<eos> You must be the real one.<eos> Whatever that weapon is, Cheetah, it won't work.
When my files are decrypted, they call home.<eos> Louisiana.<eos> Swampland.<eos> So that thing's really going to kill half the population of Earth.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> The solar flare will do most of the damage.<eos> Solar flare?<eos> Think of this as a pilot light.<eos> When our ideal launch window opens in just over an hour this magnificent creation will fly into the sun trailing magnetic resonance.<eos> - And when it hits?
Well, what good is a witness who can't remember someone she met an hour ago, much less the man who attacked her and kidnapped her in 1986?<eos> Actually, we have every reason to believe that because of her condition..<eos> She does remember him.<eos> How do you figure that?<eos> According to the journal, the killer is someone that Lacey interacted with several times in the days leading up to her abduction.<eos> Everything that happened to her that week is as fresh in her mind a..<eos> As this morning is for us.<eos> If the physical injury caused the amnesia, then why wouldn't she remember everything up to the moment she got clobbered?<eos> Because her memory wasn't cut like a ribbon.<eos> It was.. It was smashed, like glass.
Every monster has their own version of an addiction.<eos> It's written into our nature.<eos> We need the blood, the strength, the power.<eos> But the curse of those of us with darker urges is that when we let the cravings inside us take over, someone else pays the price.<eos> Did you miss it?<eos> Did you miss me?<eos> We don't have to fit 80 years into a week.<eos> We've had enough.<eos> There's work to be done.<eos> Your tolerance isn't what it used to be.
Hung up three cabinets, tiled the shower upstairs and I stained all the floors up there too.<eos> Really?<eos> You?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Stop gushing.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> By the way, the floors up there?<eos> They look beautiful.<eos> You're gonna love it.<eos> There's like this glue all over the floor and it won't let go of your shoes.
Hell, yeah, son!<eos> This is what I spent our money on!<eos> Look. Real silk curtains.<eos> This is a fuckin' real leather couch.<eos> Both of these.<eos> They spent all morning putting up these fucking mirrors.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Stainless steel pole. Huh? This isn't going anywhere.<eos> This stage is 400 pounds.<eos> It's fabricated Italian marble.
Look at this indent on the steering wheel.<eos> It's a perfect match.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You're Peter Griffin!<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> And you live at 31 Spooner Street.<eos> Finally, a real clue.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Wow, I own a house!<eos> I just hope it doesn't have one of those mailboxes that looks like a cow.
You can't leave him alone.<eos> Come on, it's good to have some alone time.<eos> You know, I spent a year alone on a desert island with nothing but a monkey to keep me company.<eos> You're saved, sir.<eos> We're going to get you back to civilization.<eos> And how about we bring along your monkey pal?<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, we can teach him sign language, and he can tell us stories about what you two did on the island together.<eos> No, no, no, no, let's... Let's not... Let's not bring the monkey.<eos> Um, I have a peanut MM up my nose, and it's now further up than my finger can reach.
That act is all me.<eos> I feel so betrayed.<eos> This is worse than what Judas did to Jesus.<eos> Man, I hope Tammy's here. Hey, can I see that wine real quick?<eos> H-Hey!<eos> Hope you like red. Oh, thank you.<eos> You are so thoughtful, Judas.<eos> Strike two, Judas!<eos> So, what do you think of my mustache?<eos> It's black and it stinks, just like the rest of you. Thank you.
Winston, what's happening? - Huh?<eos> Yeah, good night.<eos> What is wrong with you, man?<eos> You got no game.<eos> That was so stupid.<eos> Hey!<eos> Anyone!<eos> My towel!<eos> Can someone please get my towel?<eos> It's in my room next to my Irish walking cape.
Paul, how many times have I got to warn you about the no cell phone rule?<eos> I'm sorry, Professor, but I just had to feed the machine.<eos> How can you even drink that stuff?<eos> With results like these... pop...<eos> How could you not?<eos> I saw you ladies checking me out.<eos> Don't act like you haven't noticed.<eos> Oh, yeah, we noticed, all right.<eos> Your dick getting smaller.<eos> It's not small.
Long time, asshole.<eos> You look good.<eos> How are you?<eos> - You must be Cova.<eos> - And you're Felix?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - Do you like it?<eos> - What?<eos> The room, do you like it?<eos> Yes, it's beautiful.
We can get in round the back.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hugh!<eos> Wanker!<eos> He's changed this one as well.<eos> Is he made of money?<eos> OK, well, look, why don't we just put the presents in the kennel and then we can get out of here?<eos> What kennel?<eos> That kennel.<eos> It's bespoke.
I've loved him, now, for six years!<eos> I look at the door and wait, hoping that he'll come in at any moment, but...<eos> He... He never looks at me.<eos> Doesn't see me.<eos> Well, why did you stand me up?<eos> Not here.<eos> Right, just what exactly are you fucking playing at?<eos> What?<eos> When you stole this watch, yeah?<eos> Did you know that it belonged to an important client of Jo's?
And what's he gonna say?<eos> Okay, well, it was nice meeting you.<eos> Oh, nuts.<eos> Listen, my stuff is good.<eos> You can see advertising ain't my day job.<eos> Look, you're a fair woman.<eos> I insulted you because I'm honest.<eos> And I apologized because I'm brave.<eos> I didn't pick this profession.<eos> It picked me.
Some things are possibly true.<eos> Some are necessarily true.<eos> Some used to be true.<eos> Some will be true.<eos> Some are true on this planet, but not necessarily others.<eos> So there's no good and bad because the truth is relative?<eos> Even if the truth is what you would call relative, good and bad are not relative.<eos> Your mistake is that you're assuming That because something is true that it's good.<eos> Professor's got you there.<eos> I think the truth is good because it's always real on any planet.
I just know for a fact that you did not fall in love.<eos> So what was wrong again?<eos> You don't like me.<eos> I did.<eos> I really did.<eos> - Is it morning?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm sorry I always say it, but you are so beautiful.<eos> Last night was beautiful.<eos> It was, wasn't it?
Now, what did you do for Frederick Dafoe that got you the endowed chair?<eos> I'm an agricultural geneticist.<eos> I created a new strain of corn for his company.<eos> Why would someone try to kill you for that?<eos> Look, while I was working on the gene.. I realized there was a possibility.. Of a troubling collateral effect.<eos> What "collateral effect"?<eos> My strain of corn was genetically dominant.<eos> If the seed blew into the neighboring farm.<eos> It would wipe out the native corn and take over the other farmer's field.<eos> I was trying to re-engineer the seed so it could achieve harmony with the other strains.
There's a parable about a group of enemies who plant bad seeds amongst the good ones to ruin the crops.<eos> The farmer notices weeds growing amongst the fruit.<eos> The servants ask the farmer if they should round up the weeds before the harvest, and what does the farmer say?<eos> "No.<eos> Let them grow together. "<eos> One day, God will burn the weeds and save the fruit, Billy, but for now, let 'em grow.<eos> You need to get back to the White House before the press corps comes in.<eos> I've imagined your place a thousand times.<eos> I like it.<eos> It's very you.
I am not leaving this close to finding your father.<eos> No wonder we can't move.<eos> Look at this-- these vines.<eos> They're growing all over the ship.<eos> We're not going anywhere like this.<eos> This stuff is so thick.<eos> No wonder we couldn't move.<eos> Look at this growth.<eos> It's insane.<eos> Oh, it's jammed between the prop and the rudder.
You've seen his journal.<eos> It's all coded.<eos> I mean, all he told us is that we were on a path.<eos> Now I don't know what that is, and I'm not sure how much I can help you.<eos> You must know something.<eos> I'm just the cameraman.<eos> Hey, everyone!<eos> Take a look at this!<eos> Storm's coming.<eos> It's coming fast.

It's not her decision.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I'll play along with captain Tess when I can, but this is not the time to indulge fantasy, all right?<eos> Jonas is our best hope for finding Emmet, Russ, and the crew.<eos> Yes! Yeah, I-I can help. I can help you.<eos> Okay, Jonas, you tell me what Emmet was doing here.<eos> He was looking for magic.<eos> You told me that already, Jonas.<eos> No, listen.<eos> He was obsessed with the idea that it comes from one place.
We're just worried about you.<eos> A clever boy like you must do something with his life.<eos> Why must people always do something?<eos> Some houses have been washed away by the tide.<eos> There are families sheltering in the church.<eos> Is that not what science should be used for?<eos> - No?<eos> - What?<eos> Helping them.<eos> Science would be more useful if it could blow up the universe.
The worse the infection, the later the date.<eos> It could give us some sort of direction.<eos> One of the strays swam up.<eos> He's refusing to leave the boat.<eos> The camera.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Put the next one in.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> Okay, look at the bite there.<eos> It's fresh.
Everyone, in general.<eos> Let's give our opinions, and move on a little.<eos> I'd like to know if anyone thinks that this campaign will help us win the plebiscite.<eos> Well, I think that the main objective...<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I think that the main objective is to open up the eyes of those who don't want to vote.<eos> That is the objective.<eos> The main one, that is.<eos> The thing is that the dictatorship destroyed this country.<eos> And it will continue to destroy it with its economic success based on 40% of the population living below the poverty line.
Not for your possessions, nor for your future, nor for your security.<eos> When you vote, think about everything you could lose.<eos> Think about what you cherish the most, about your loved ones.<eos> ♪ A winning country<eos> ♪ Yes! ♪<eos> Our campaign is garbage, Minister.<eos> It's frankly outrageous.<eos> We're throwing our money away.<eos> I don't think it's that bad.<eos> It's more serious than the others'.
Mark.<eos> Action!<eos> ♪ Chile<eos> ♪ Happiness is coming!<eos> This land has never been a propitious place for warlords and strikes.<eos> The new democracy...<eos> Does it fit?<eos> It doesn't?<eos> It doesn't.<eos> No, it doesn't fit.
Holiday!<eos> All right, we're gonna piss on Rider in his sleep!<eos> Why?<eos> His Dad's Villa's not finished.<eos> Hang on, he said it was a luxury pad.<eos> Rider's gotta turn the water on, man.<eos> Yeah, the pool's a bit more of a barbecue pit.<eos> Shit! We paid!<eos> Chill out, man.<eos> He promised - it's gonna be full by the time we get back.
Yes, heavenly.<eos> If I die tomorrow, then I'd go happy.<eos> What about me.<eos> I wouldn't be happy.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Well, I'd just come back and do knob jokes to cheer you up.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Your knob's always been a bit of a joke.<eos> It has.<eos> But, usually, it's ready for a bit of stand-up.
No, you dildo. Get off!<eos> Rich, fuck off!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You two look so fucking lame,<eos> I'm giving it a sheen of responsibility.<eos> Well, don't, all right?<eos> Rich, get off!<eos> You think being in this stupid band is going to help?<eos> Music doesn't solve anything!<eos> Yes, it does.
* Together forge a will That can never be torn<eos> * You can cleft us in twain<eos> * But we'll reanimate and our core remains the same<eos> * Because we are, we are, we are<eos> * Because we are We are, we are one... *<eos> This house... this fucking house...<eos> belongs to someone who doesn't care as long as you're in your place.<eos> This house is a fucking prison!<eos> It needs...<eos> It needs to be...
I...<eos> I want my money back.<eos> It's off.<eos> The money is already accounted for.<eos> Accounted for?<eos> Fuck's that mean?<eos> It means you should sit down.<eos> Listen, mate, back off, yeah?<eos> Ah, fuck!<eos> The situation is what it is, Nico.
Fabulous!<eos> Wow!<eos> Did you see that jump?<eos> Shall we?<eos> Wait, there's a guy about to do a trick!<eos> You're wasting time, "Blue Hands"!<eos> Did you come along to do anything? Come on.<eos> Will we ski this afternoon?<eos> Put on your ski mask.<eos> I can't, it itches.
- What you got?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Where did you know the owner from?<eos> What do you care?<eos> I'm done.<eos> Can you ask the boy to come here?<eos> Simon?<eos> Can you come over here, for five minutes?<eos> There was a watch in the bathroom.<eos> It's no longer there.
I know it.<eos> Where are you, camera?<eos> Over here somewhere.<eos> There you go!<eos> Oh, come on, man!<eos> Oh, you've got to be kidding me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Look at my camera.<eos> No, don't ignore me.<eos> It's broken and it's my last ND-six filter.
We're just trying to make a TV show, okay?<eos> - Clark!<eos> - What?<eos> - My eyes are burning.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - I can't see!<eos> - Mom!<eos> Okay, are you serious?<eos> The blindness.<eos> It's spreading.
- What?<eos> - What is that?<eos> Oh, my God! It's them!<eos> Run!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> They're right behind us!<eos> Holy Christ!<eos> Come on, AJ. Come!<eos> Mom, you okay?<eos> They're behind the door, but I think it's gonna hold.
Look, I, uh...<eos> I know we're here to find Dad.<eos> We're going to.<eos> But when we do, and when we go home, I just want you to know.<eos> Things don't have to go back to the way they were.<eos> You know, it's okay for you to move on.<eos> If that's what you want.<eos> I want my family back.<eos> That's all I want.<eos> And I should never have let it come apart in the first place.
He felt he had to get to know her.<eos> He was at his rehearsal dinner.<eos> He was getting married the next day.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Exactly what?<eos> True love saves him from making the biggest mistake of his life.<eos> Do you think that's realistic?<eos> I think it's romantic.<eos> Life isn't always romantic.<eos> Sometimes it's realistic.
Please, don't.<eos> We got an arm out on the farmer's truck.<eos> An abandoned vehicle found several miles from here with a dead battery.<eos> Thought the driver may have walked off into the woods, to cut across to the state route, so we checked it out.<eos> We found this.<eos> Well, he's definitely got help.<eos> Somebody left this for him.<eos> Find any info on the vehicle?<eos> Yeah, rented to a Susie G. Brown.<eos> Ran the address; It's fake.
Just heard from Becky's boyfriend.<eos> He said that she would always mix up her route and that she downloaded the data from each run onto her computer, but he doesn't have her password.<eos> Not... that she would have downloaded her last one.<eos> How do you download a run?<eos> If you have a runner's watch.<eos> Julianne, can you blow up the image of Becky?<eos> I need to see what kind of watch she was wearing.<eos> That's as far as I can go before the resolution bottoms out.<eos> That's a runner's watch.<eos> It has a GPS function that tracks your route and time.
I'm coming.<eos> Rose, you are...<eos> Ridiculous?<eos> I know...<eos> No...<eos> Well... you're...<eos> You're not the same person...<eos> I'm still the same.<eos> The dress is different.<eos> It doesn't seem too practical for typing.
So you can destroy everything you always dreamed of?<eos> Susan Hunter... maintains her world record of 512 strokes a minute!<eos> Rose Pamphyle, with 506 strokes a minute!<eos> It's incredible!<eos> Pamphyle left the stage!<eos> We'll never let you near her, you two bit insurer.<eos> You can't give up.<eos> Not now.<eos> What do you intend to do, with this old machine?<eos> It'll slow you down even more.
Good. - Yeah?<eos> How about you?<eos> - Yeah, good.<eos> - Yeah? Yeah.<eos> Just... another day.<eos> Um, I'm going to go and get changed.<eos> - OK, don't be long.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How was the meeting?<eos> Oh, it didn't happen in the end.
I don't think I can.<eos> I kept meaning to bring you to Margate, didn't I?<eos> Yeah. You used to come, didn't you, when you was younger?<eos> My granny lived here when I was a kid, yeah.<eos> Skegness for me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I remember, that was a glorious fortnight.<eos> Yeah. My grandma's caravan.<eos> Your grandma's stinking caravan!<eos> - It was not stinking.
But do you know what...<eos> what they could afford?<eos> Do you know what they did want to buy?<eos> They want to buy that weed.<eos> My business goes down the drain, and-and... and Carl is over there making money hand over fist.<eos> So you firebombed his house?<eos> I didn't want anyone to get hurt.<eos> I was just sitting in my kitchen... drinking, feeling sorry for myself.<eos> And then I finished the bottle, and I put the gas in it, and I stuck a dish towel in, and I lit it, and before I knew, I was walking across... and I threw it over Carl's fence.<eos> I didn't even know where it was going to land.
Maybe you can start now.<eos> Well, that was definitely not what I expected to happen tonight.<eos> Not that it... it was bad. It wasn't.<eos> Oh, don't sound so surprised.<eos> We were always good together.<eos> Yeah, we were, weren't we?<eos> Here.<eos> That's weird.<eos> Your camera's on.<eos> Uh, no, no, it's not.
Well, that was definitely not what I expected to happen tonight.<eos> Not that it... it was bad. It wasn't.<eos> Oh, don't sound so surprised.<eos> We were always good together.<eos> Yeah, we were, weren't we?<eos> Here.<eos> That's weird.<eos> Your camera's on.<eos> Uh, no, no, it's not.<eos> Whoa, I think it was recording us, actually.
So do the Inuit people like Simon Qamanirq.<eos> Polar bears surprise us in camp.<eos> Especially in the lean summer months.<eos> My father could read the clouds.<eos> He knew when the storm was coming.<eos> But now the ancient weather patterns have changed.<eos> Our grandfathers fed their families well.<eos> My family has always depended on snow and ice.<eos> Nowadays when the ice melts, we can adjust but the polar bears are not so lucky.<eos> The ice is forming later in the year so it's thinner.
And it's gonna be our honeymoon as well.<eos> Honeymoon?<eos> These newlyweds will follow the caribou all the way to their birthing grounds.<eos> These caribou mothers are on a tight schedule.<eos> Yeah, that's gotta be caribou paths. Look at that drainage coming in.<eos> Yeah, just over there...<eos> With the warm spring, the snowpack's melted early.<eos> And so the rivers are flooding and this is gonna be a problem for the caribou to get across.<eos> This is climate change slowing down the herd.<eos> This water is so cold it can stop your heart.
According to the isotope profile from her tooth enamel, the victim grew up in Denmark.<eos> That would explain why we haven't been able to ID her.<eos> Have Angela forward the facial reconstruction to the Danish Embassy.<eos> Meanwhile, we have to determine cause of death.<eos> I found a particulate embedded in the anterior aspect of the T4.<eos> There are also hairline fractures on the neural arches.<eos> That could be consistent with a high velocity injury. Maybe a gunshot;<eos> it could be a bullet fragment.<eos> A bullet wouldn't explain the pitting on the vertebral body.<eos> Unless it shattered a rib into smaller projectiles.
I don't know what chance I have.<eos> She's Mayor and I'm, well, me.<eos> Ms. Swan, two people with a common goal can accomplish many things.<eos> Two people with a common enemy can accomplish even more.<eos> How would you like a benefactor?<eos> A benefactor?<eos> Do you mind?<eos> You know, it really is quite shocking how few people study the town charter.<eos> The town charter?<eos> Well, it's quite comprehensive.
Keep that fire good and stoked, Bae.<eos> The sheep's fat needs to be liquid.<eos> And get that wool good and soaked.<eos> Why are we doing this, Papa?<eos> This is good wool we can spin and sell.<eos> These are our keys to the castle, Son.<eos> And once I'm inside, there's something I have to take.<eos> What do you need to take?<eos> That old beggar, he told me a fine tale about the Duke and his magical dagger.<eos> What does it do?
Then he just smiled.<eos> "You know, when your eyes look at someone else's...<eos> To hell with the chicken Alfredo."<eos> He said that.<eos> Then he asked if I would go to dinner with him, right there in the freezer aisle.<eos> Did you ever go to his house?<eos> We always went to my place.<eos> His house was having work done.<eos> He have a car?<eos> But it was in the shop.
Do we need to go through this every time?<eos> I'm putting my snipers on the roof.<eos> No, commander, you're not.<eos> Great, another fan to tell us how to run things.<eos> Chief, with all due respect, believe me when I tell you I have a great deal more experience in this matter than you do.<eos> All right, so how do I get in that bank?<eos> You agreed without a plan?<eos> After the Big Quake in 1906, a lot of buildings went up super fast, almost on top of each other.<eos> My comic book shop's in an old bank building like this one.<eos> And it shares a central air-conditioning unit with the buildings on either side.
Went back to my room and I put in earplugs.<eos> And they didn't work, I'm guessing.<eos> [ Chuckles nervously ] I feel for you, Annie.<eos> I do.<eos> There you are, working on the biggest test of your life, the one that's gonna determine your future.<eos> And there's Christina, just screwing any chance you have of success.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Sounds to me like she was the bitch.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - You were working so hard, the music's blaring, it's driving you nuts.
I'm going away.<eos> Time to travel, see the world.<eos> First stop is Africa, to climb Kilimanjaro.<eos> I'm sorry you didn't get to go, but..<eos> You know, sometimes plan "B" turns out pretty good, too.<eos> Our ambitions and our dreams..<eos> Give us a glimpse of a beautiful someday.<eos> And they can help us get through a sometimes less-than-beautiful today.<eos> It's a tricky thing, though, ambition.<eos> It can blind us to the price of success.

She's in trouble.<eos> I'm going after her.<eos> I don't suppose you know the code.<eos> Actually.. .. I'm pretty sure I do.<eos> Pleiades.<eos> Of course.<eos> Thanks to your unwavering support,<eos> I now stand before you as a United States Senator.<eos> This victory belongs to everyone here at this historic conference.<eos> And it brings us one step closer to achieving our ultimate objective..
Matt, we're bringing you on now.<eos> Don't do that onstage.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Unless it's your closer.<eos> I was thinking about Cookie Monster, you know?<eos> And do you think this guy's got an eating disorder, you know?<eos> Nice shirt, loser.<eos> Sorry.<eos> No, I like it.<eos> It's nice.
What is that?<eos> It's a pizza pillow.<eos> It's very good.<eos> Yeah, you like it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I like the sauce.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you want more...<eos> The sauce is very good, yeah.<eos> Yeah, it is good sauce.
Yeah, it is good sauce.<eos> Do you want more sauce?<eos> Yeah, more sauce.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll go get you more sauce.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Hey, I love the sauce.<eos> It is very good sauce.
Yeah, more sauce.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll go get you more sauce.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Hey, I love the sauce.<eos> It is very good sauce.<eos> Do you like the sauce?<eos> It's too hot!
I'll go get you more sauce.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Hey, I love the sauce.<eos> It is very good sauce.<eos> Do you like the sauce?<eos> It's too hot!<eos> The sauce is too hot!<eos> It's too hot!
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Hey, I love the sauce.<eos> It is very good sauce.<eos> Do you like the sauce?<eos> It's too hot!<eos> The sauce is too hot!<eos> It's too hot!<eos> I like the sauce, but it's too hot!
I'm not gonna tell you about this.<eos> Okay, Mom.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Right.<eos> Right, I mean-but I could tell you, but I shouldn't.<eos> No, I know.<eos> On the other hand, I just don't think it would be so bad if I just described...<eos> I mean, a little description won't really ruin the effect.<eos> Okay, well, let me tell you about the dress.<eos> It's off-white and very bosomy, which I know that you like.
Again, room 109 at seven P.M.Thank you.<eos> Wait.<eos> Why did Tamborelli call you down?<eos> She has a birthmark!<eos> Okay.<eos> Em, do you still have it-- that photo from the locker room?<eos> Yeah, I think so. Why?<eos> Han, what-- what's going on?<eos> There wasn't a birthmark in that photo!<eos> Where is it?
General Nitu is ordering, "Do not overtakehim".<eos> But who can, in fact, overtake Michael Jackson?<eos> Around 13:15 Michael jackson was receive by president lon lliescu.<eos> Living... living...<eos> Good Afternoon. Director, the boys is ready.<eos> Whenever. OK, OK.<eos> OF SNAILS AND MEN<eos> You'll be careful, OK?<eos> This vehicle has been our livelihood for years.<eos> It was a great achievement of our times.
- Yes!<eos> Come with me.<eos> Is everything alright?<eos> Excuse me, do you have a magazine or something?<eos> What are you going to do when they closedown the factory?<eos> No. You can't.<eos> - You can't.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because there will be no factory.<eos> It will close for good.
Something that might cause hallucinations.<eos> An anesthetic like ketamine, for instance, could have that effect.<eos> The last thing I remember before I woke up this morning, I got shot up with something... maybe ketamine.<eos> I don't understand how...<eos> There's this guy, a mental patient, he's taken some people hostage in a hospital, and I was sent in to diffuse the situation.<eos> He attacked me and injected me with something, and-and...<eos> You mean in your dreams. I don't know what's going on now.<eos> Are you experiencing hallucinations?<eos> No.<eos> This ring that you're missing, you said that it wasn't important to the case, and yet you feel compelled to find it.
I didn't.<eos> I saw it on the picture, and his name was<eos> Gabriel Wyath III, so I figured I'd give it a shot.<eos> I don't understand. Trip.<eos> As in triple.<eos> Nickname for third.<eos> So you had the opportunity to help this patient see the truth, but you chose instead to perpetuate his denial.<eos> Why?<eos> How would he be better off, thinking of his sister in the ground somewhere than-than thinking of her free, liberated, waiting for him?<eos> Explain to me what exactly is so great about seeing reality for what it is?
This is what sheriffs do.<eos> Yes, you're taking them.<eos> No. I promised them they wouldn't be separated.<eos> Well, then perhaps you should stop making promises you can't keep.<eos> These children need a home.<eos> I'm just trying to find the best one.<eos> What is that?<eos> My father's compass.<eos> He gave it to me so I could find him.<eos> But now it's broken.
I spent a lot of time with a lot of kids in your situation, and all of them,<eos> all of us, we held on to stuff.<eos> I want to find your father, but I need your help.<eos> Is there anything of his you've held on to?<eos> I might have something.<eos> But if I give it to you, you'll make sure we stay together, right?<eos> Right.<eos> A compass?<eos> Our mom kept it.<eos> She said it was our dad's.
All that matters is getting it to the Queen so she can find Father.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I smell dinner.<eos> Emma.<eos> How lovely to see you.<eos> I'm flattered you'd take time off your busy schedule for me.<eos> What can I do for you, Sheriff?<eos> I'm looking for information on this old compass.<eos> Any idea where it could have come from?
Hello?<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> I need you to come outside right away.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Don't say anything in front of the kids, but no, it's not.<eos> He doesn't want the kids.<eos> And you don't want to tell them.<eos> I can't.<eos> Because all I'll be telling them is that the false hope I gave them was exactly that.<eos> The truth can be painful, Emma, but it can also be cathartic.
- On the deck.<eos> Go then.<eos> We haven't got much time.<eos> We need to check the fore-hatch, see if there's flooding there too.<eos> (Maniacal screaming) (Screaming)<eos> You're not one of them.<eos> They wouldn't scream like a little girl.<eos> Help! Help! Help please here!<eos> My leg, I can't move it!<eos> It's trapped.
At least then we'll have the sun on our side.<eos> Whatever we decide, we need to do it quickly.<eos> (LOUD BANGING) Fine.<eos> Then we're going to need fire.<eos> Every living thing is afeared of fire.<eos> Afraid.<eos> That's what I said. Afeared.<eos> More nuts!<eos> Gunnar, try and hold on.<eos> My dying breath will be to curse that creature, as it dies.
I've seen the world, and still I find you again.<eos> You can't leave me now.<eos> Ah... the wind has blown my Tiger to me.<eos> My friend, Sinbad, is in great need.<eos> Great danger.<eos> There is a map, one of the charts of fable to Land of the Dead.<eos> Sinbad must go there to heal the wound that will not heal.<eos> We can see it only for a moment.<eos> No map, no chart could hold that land.<eos> It exists.
What if the future sees one of us injured or worse?<eos> Wouldn't you want to know about it so we could avoid it?<eos> If it was the future, we couldn't avoid it.<eos> You could try.<eos> Come on.<eos> Nice.<eos> Father?<eos> I've been thinking about the vision that you've had.<eos> As have I.<eos> For so long, we have looked to the stone, have trusted what it shows us.
- I don't think we're asking you.<eos> - And also, we're just talking.<eos> Hypothetically.<eos> We're not looking for trouble.<eos> Oh, neither am I, but still.<eos> The fact remains, stealing the stone...<eos> For a start, it isn't in a vault.<eos> It's hidden deep underground surrounded by deadly traps and pitfalls.<eos> They do say it's the most beautiful stone.<eos> It's heart-shaped and deepest red.

Changed the face of surgery as we know it.<eos> You have read Abur Hashim's own medical treatise?<eos> - No.<eos> You have?<eos> - In Seville.<eos> In the original Latin.<eos> Now, tell me...<eos> What's a bright young man like you doing in a rundown ship like this?<eos> What?<eos> If a rock could drink, it would fly.
Are they saying he's a suspect? I'm not sure, why?<eos> Because they can lock him in a holding cell for 24 hours.<eos> Like, overnight?<eos> During the full moon. How good are these holding cells at holding people?<eos> People, good.<eos> Werewolves, probably not that good.<eos> Stiles, remember when I said I don't have the urge to maim and kill?<eos> He does.<eos> Why would Derek choose Isaac?<eos> Peter told me that if the bite doesn't turn you it could kill you.
What's with the lost boys?<eos> Last night, had this evil nightmare.<eos> Wait, stop.<eos> What are you talking about, nightmare?<eos> I slept.<eos> Stevie taught me how to sleep.<eos> I did it.<eos> It was a friggin' mistake, because I dreamt my door came back.<eos> I opened it and then this-- this thing rushed out.<eos> And I think it actually flew out.
Oh!<eos> Sorry!<eos> Do you work here?<eos> I'm trying.<eos> I'm applying for my residency.<eos> Last call.<eos> How is it you get stuck minding - the errant princess again?<eos> - I will work for you, but I could never be like you.<eos> This force comes rushing out.<eos> I think it actually flew out.
How can you see me?<eos> Second sight, 6th sense.<eos> It's a gift.<eos> It's a curse.<eos> Crazy stuff.<eos> Now get in line with the others.<eos> Uh, I'm not...<eos> Line. Now!<eos> Hey, Terry. Could I use your key card?<eos> It won't work either. They've tightened security.
Leave this baby alone.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You were gonna jump into a baby weren't you?<eos> You were right.<eos> You'll never see me again.<eos> Wait.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> Wouldn't have been fair.<eos> It just would've followed me.<eos> This thing that's after you, what's it look like?
I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.<eos> You have my dragons?<eos> When I learned you were coming to our city,<eos> I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth.<eos> ( Laughter )<eos> He procured them for me.<eos> - But there is no King of Qarth.<eos> - Xaro: There is now.<eos> That was the other half of the arrangement.<eos> You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change.
By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town.<eos> Given the circumstances, My Lord,<eos> I believe extreme measures are warranted.<eos> "The Great Sieges of Westeros."<eos> Thrilling subject.<eos> Shame Archmaester Ch'vyalthan wasn't a better writer.<eos> Stannis knows King's Landing.<eos> He knows where the walls are strongest and he knows which gates are weakest.<eos> The mud gate.<eos> A good ram will batter it down in minutes and it's only 50 yards from the water.
Verraterkuss was on Tannhäuser's payroll.<eos> All I did was inform him that Racken would pay double for the information.<eos> Verraterkuss chose to take the offer, so Tannhäuser killed him.<eos> (Hagerman): All this corruption.<eos> Makes me wanna shower for all eternity.<eos> Get out.<eos> Leave me to my little Freudian disaster.<eos> I have a little truth for you.<eos> Your old face still exists... preserved in cryogenic freeze.<eos> Tell me where it is, bitch.

Those were not my drugs.<eos> You should get a t-shirt with that printed on the back.<eos> Must be hard trying to patch up a marriage with a guy like TJ barking at your heels.<eos> Even harder when a couple of detectives catch you snorting coke in between hands of an undergr...<eos> - I swear, I was not there...<eos> - Thought to yourself,<eos> "Man, I could lose everything"... marriage, job, your season tickets.<eos> I get it.<eos> I understand how that could affect your judgment.<eos> And the gun, well, it was in your hand.
My wife just found emails saying I cheated on her.<eos> I'm a totally faithful husband.<eos> All of a sudden, colonel Bradshaw has a history of mental illness and substance abuse?<eos> How do I know you're not really a womanizing drunken crazy man?<eos> I guess you're just gonna have to make your own determination on that count.<eos> Was it you that put the footage on the Internet after Wren died?<eos> You know who did?<eos> No idea.<eos> It'd be nice to have the original footage.<eos> It disappeared with Jeremy's death.
A cusk eel.<eos> About a foot long, very ugly.<eos> I'm going to find a cusk eel, attach this camera to its ugly little head, send him down to the ocean floor.<eos> Walter, it's not gonna work.<eos> Usually I'm very supportive of your efforts, Walter.<eos> But I'm with Isabel on this one.<eos> - She did it!<eos> Who did what?<eos> The gypsy girl. She found first generation footage.<eos> I hate to be a Debbie downer, but it looks like all the others.
Excuse me.<eos> I got to tell you, I was really intrigued by your speech.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Look, can I ask you a few questions?<eos> - Sure, sure.<eos> - Yeah, thanks.<eos> Hey, do you mind if you just give me a moment? Thanks.<eos> I'll be there soon.<eos> Look, that Johnny guy, that story about that Johnny is very intriguing.<eos> The nightclub you were talking about, now, is it around here somewhere?

I don't want to hear it.<eos> Yeah, well, you're gonna hear it.<eos> It was stupid.<eos> I know. No, stupid was that story you came up with.<eos> Come on.<eos> Tell me how that car really got in the lake, Ethan.<eos> Yeah, that's what I thought.<eos> You don't know, do you?<eos> You made up that story to protect Sutton.<eos> She was the one who took the car, and somehow it ended up in the lake.
You threaten to punch him in the wallet, they always open up.<eos> So what did he say?<eos> He doesn't remember Pablo, but he does remember this character called El Diablo.<eos> Troublemaker.<eos> So we hit a bunch of sites, just see if he made an impression anywhere else.<eos> You have any idea how many construction sites there are in L.A.?<eos> Look, I've seen cases break with less than this.<eos> Sometimes all you have is a faint trail.<eos> You have to follow it until you find what you're looking for.<eos> Or it disappears altogether.
Then why would my subconscious keep pointing me to it?<eos> Because you need an excuse.<eos> An excuse for what?<eos> To stay right where you are.<eos> To keep everything just like it is.<eos> You can't admit that moving represents a threat to your arrangement, so you simply create a distraction, some unfinished business, a reason you have to stay put.<eos> But it's a mirage.<eos> You've manufactured a mystery that does not exist and can never be solved so that you never have to face the thing that you're afraid of, which is letting yourself move to Portland.<eos> You're an intelligent man, detective.<eos> I believe that if you step back, you'll begin to see the situation for what it is... a frightened mind grasping at straws.
I don't know why I said that. Bye.<eos> Jeff.<eos> Jeff!<eos> I looked it up. I was right. Oh, that thing about Danny Thomas?<eos> I looked it up too.<eos> Weird.<eos> No, those meds you're taking.<eos> Without anxiety to keep your vanity in check, you are vulnerable to a syndrome called hyper-narcissosis.<eos> Okay, look. This apple is your ego.<eos> Imagine it expanding to the point of critical mass, taking over your whole personality, making you an uncontrollable monster.

What?<eos> No.<eos> My X-box, too?<eos> Everything.<eos> Grammy bought us that stuff.<eos> Well, we have no money since Monica stole the Squirrel Fund, and we need to eat!<eos> Is Lip coming home for Thanksgiving tomorrow?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Now, go.<eos> And when you get back, take the pool down before it freezes and cracks.
The bank is gonna come and foreclose on your farm,<eos> "Fuck you, bank."<eos> "Fuck you" money is the ultimate liberator, and underneath your town, there's "fuck you" money.<eos> So think long and hard about all those brutal days working.<eos> And the goddamn checks you get from whatever frozen peas company is buying.<eos> Think about how much you made on your best day and then think real hard about how much you made on your worst, 'cause, let's be honest with each other, they're all looking like that more and more nowadays, right?<eos> These people?<eos> This town?<eos> This life?<eos> It's dying or damn near dead.
That's the lighthouse and the ocean.<eos> I was looking at this picture...<eos> Looking at it for a while last night.<eos> For a long while.<eos> And found myself staring at this barn.<eos> The Wood's chipping away and the paint's flaking off there.<eos> Probably from all the salt water in the air.<eos> But it reminded me of my grandfather's barn.<eos> That barn was the bane of my existence.<eos> It was immaculate.
His heartbeat's doing well and his body temperature stabilized.<eos> There he is.<eos> Is that Portuguese?<eos> Honey, I don't understand.<eos> What's he saying? (SIGHS)<eos> I don't know.<eos> I tried to learn when we got married, but I just... (BREATHING HEAVILY)<eos> His body temperature is rising.<eos> It's above normal.<eos> Wait, I thought you said it was stable.

Hooray for us.<eos> We disproved his asexuality.<eos> We also probably ruined his life.<eos> He'll thank us.<eos> Then he'll doze off. And then, in a couple of hours, he'll thank us again.<eos> It could destroy his identity.<eos> It's like a gay person being told they're really straight.<eos> So don't tell him.<eos> Yeah, why bother telling a guy he has a tumor growing in his head?<eos> He'll notice it eventually when it starts leaking out his ears.
Can you see if you could find me a plumber?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I really appreciate it.<eos> Thanks for your support.<eos> You look amazing.<eos> You don't look too shabby yourself.<eos> Where's your ring?<eos> I took it to get resized.<eos> It fell off again today.
The gardener found him in the backyard.<eos> Tom made sure it wasn't me who found him.<eos> The coroner's office hasn't released the body yet.<eos> I need to bury him.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll check it out immediately.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm so sorry for what happened.<eos> It was the guilt.<eos> It ate him up like a cancer.
I-I-I don't buy that.<eos> Maier killed himself yesterday.<eos> We're going to the house now to search it.<eos> Good luck.<eos> I have a confession to make.<eos> When Tom killed himself, part of me was angry at him for being weak.<eos> But now I know how strong he was.<eos> Now I know.<eos> The FBI found this letter in Molly's room.<eos> It's from Tom.
Twisted, but talented.<eos> Why would anyone draw something like that?<eos> Well, she's a teenager.<eos> Isn't that what they do?<eos> Play depressing music, and think about how everything sucks, and then try and make everyone else as miserable as they are.<eos> It's a stage.<eos> Stage or not, that's creepy.<eos> Hey, look out!<eos> Get those people back!<eos> In my timeline, I can interact with the machine, but since I'm not supposed to exist here, it wouldn't respond to me.
I was heading down to Dallas.<eos> Selling my company to my scumbag partner who for six years has made my life a living hell.<eos> Today was gonna be the day that I started over.<eos> A new beginning.<eos> I had a water bottle in my carry-on and by the time the damn TSA was done with me, I missed my flight.<eos> Besides his description, is there anything else that you can tell us?<eos> Anything that you remember?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He had this weird rod.<eos> It was blue.
It was my decision, Elizabeth.<eos> I knew the risk.<eos> I took a- an immense gamble.<eos> And now that man Jones is gone.<eos> I don't think that's all you're upset about.<eos> You've gone over the blueprints, haven't you?<eos> Like Peter asked you to.<eos> Yes.<eos> I've tried to see what he's saying...<eos> That the machine is... capable of more than one function, that it can return him to his timeline.
Look, you have every right to defend yourself.<eos> She's the one poisoning the water around here.<eos> And I'm so sorry about the ring.<eos> I should have just told you the second I couldn't find it.<eos> I just have no idea who would have taken it.<eos> Well, I thought it was Juliet, but I was wrong.<eos> Regardless, it won't happen again.<eos> I'm putting a new security system in tomorrow.<eos> But at least I got the ring back.<eos> It fits.
I wouldn't have expected anything less.<eos> I thought that you and Siobhan were teetotaling?<eos> -Well, today's an exception. Hmm.<eos> -Would you make an exception for me?<eos> You were right, I did have ulterior motives, but this time they were pure.<eos> Catherine, you are many things, but pure?<eos> Well, by my standards.<eos> Juliet just loves that house so much,<eos> I thought I could spare her from having to give it up.<eos> -I am with you that the house is a pit, but the way that she spoke about it today, you know, I guess we never realized that it means so much to her.
So they were still in contact.<eos> I'm gonna head up to the Hamptons later and see what else I can dig up.<eos> In the meantime, I want you to take this.<eos> No, I don't like guns.<eos> You have to protect yourself.<eos> I don't like the idea of you and Kemper running around in the same city.<eos> Kemper's long gone by now.<eos> Really, it's not...<eos> Necessary?<eos> If memory serves, the last time you turned down a gun, it ended up saving your life.
- And since then, nothing?<eos> It hurt you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Since when?<eos> - I do not know.<eos> - Breathe. It runs.<eos> Yet.<eos> Breathing.<eos> She was diagnosed with breast.<eos> It will not last long. You can get dressed.
- Everybody out.<eos> Bell<eos> - What are you doing still there, do you?<eos> Come on.<eos> - Look who's here.<eos> - You put meat at every meal.<eos> - I warn you:<eos> it costs more.<eos> - We take our box.<eos> - It is empty.
Take a load off, Lassie.<eos> What's--what's going on?<eos> Just strange sounds and... jiggling and hissing, and...<eos> I also, um, saw some things.<eos> What kind of things?<eos> Just general spooky-type things, things that are hard to explain, like, um... people that are there when they shouldn't be and should be when they aren't.<eos> And, um, there were some chairs that moved on their own.<eos> Sure.<eos> Your place is haunted!<eos> No, no, no, it's not.
All right, so we get O'Brien, who brings us McCaulay and Cunliffe.<eos> Is McCaulay the one with the nose hair problem like he's got two raccoons in his nostrils?<eos> That's seven to Doyle's five.<eos> I mean, this is a filibuster slam dunk.<eos> - Chung is on TV live.<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> - Get it on. Get it on.<eos> - Where's the remote?<eos> It's in the bowl.
- Chung is on TV live.<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> - Get it on. Get it on.<eos> - Where's the remote?<eos> It's in the bowl.<eos> The remote's in the bowl.<eos> Sue, where's the clicker?<eos> - Where's the clicker?<eos> - Guys, it's in the credenza.
How are we going to-How are we gonna get enough money in time?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All I know is I'm not gonna sit here another day.<eos> I'm not gonna sit in the same fucking classroom.<eos> We 're not gonna be miserable.<eos> We 're getting out of here.<eos> - What's up, homes?<eos> Can we use your car?<eos> No. - Why?<eos> - It's in the shop.
As do I.<eos> Ava?<eos> While we appreciate you making this fine meal, I think we would appreciate it even more if you told us what Boyd had to say.<eos> Yeah, why you stalling?<eos> Well, you got me, Devil.<eos> I am stalling. I just wanted to get some good food in you before I relayed Boyd's orders.<eos> Boyd instructed that you burn the weed.<eos> The hell?<eos> That weed's worth 100 grand easy.<eos> It's also worth 20 years any law enforcement happens by.
Screw that!<eos> She's Hitler with a beautician's diploma.<eos> Gentlemen,<eos> I think it's backed up unless they're freeing Mandela.<eos> She's scum.<eos> Screw her mean and nasty.<eos> Bone her dry.<eos> Here, babe!<eos> You're snug as a bug in my little rug.<eos> It's warm and cozy.

And uh...<eos> I would really like to hear your voice, okay?<eos> Dammit!<eos> The couple moving in's been more than patient.<eos> I told you, I can pay.<eos> You were supposed to be out a week ago--<eos> Look, the new job, it's as good as mine-- No way.<eos> Two weeks-- first paycheck, it's all yours. Come on-- I've heard it before.<eos> Okay, look, take my watch.<eos> It's worth $300 bucks, all right?
Don't worry. Okay. Tonight's about homework.<eos> You need to remember why you're here, okay?<eos> Whatever.<eos> I got nothing on this guy.<eos> He's stonewalling and he's good.<eos> We got it.<eos> What?<eos> Something you're not going to believe.<eos> Make me a believer.<eos> We got a hit on the wife's print taken from the house. It's a match to the finger that we found on the floor of Showalter's condo.
What do you know?<eos> Well, there are whispers.<eos> Whispers of a man who can achieve even the most unholy of requests.<eos> A man who can do what you ask.<eos> Who is this man?<eos> How much for this?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Your boat.<eos> Exquisite craftsmanship.<eos> It's not for sale.
You've been here before?<eos> I know all this for one very simple reason.<eos> I read the plaque.<eos> You actually believe that?<eos> I'm a writer.<eos> I have to have an open mind.<eos> Yeah, but magic?<eos> Water is a very powerful thing.<eos> Cultures as old as time have worshipped it.<eos> It ﬂows throughout all lands, connecting the entire world.
I'm getting for everyone.<eos> No, I'm not hungry.<eos> David's in the woods.<eos> There's something wrong with him.<eos> He looked right through me. It's like...<eos> It's like he was a different person.<eos> Here's another one.<eos> Right. And then here's...<eos> What?<eos> This print, it looks like it's half wolf and half boot.
Proud of you.<eos> What was that?<eos> You heard me.<eos> David, it's going to be okay.<eos> Really?<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because I honestly can't say anything about my actions any more.<eos> There has to be an explanation.<eos> You're right.<eos> But the problem is, I don't think it's a good one.
The problem is that I'm living here, in a house full of dwarfs instead of in my palace, with my father as a princess.<eos> But I can't do that any more, can I? Because he was murdered.<eos> Murdered by the same woman who sent a huntsman to kill me.<eos> Snow, your anger towards the Queen is understandable.<eos> It's just not fair to take it out on your friends.<eos> You're right.<eos> I should be taking it out on her.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> No, revenge is not the answer.<eos> No, it's gonna change you.
Snow, don't!<eos> Now, what is this?<eos> This is how you kill the Queen!<eos> How will that help me get into the castle?<eos> No, no, no, that's impossible.<eos> You have to kill her when she's on the move.<eos> When she's on her way to the Summer Palace.<eos> Fire the arrow from this spot, here, and you'll be hidden from sight.<eos> An arrow fired from this bow will get you exactly what you need.<eos> It always finds its target!
I need you to be certain.<eos> You can never speak of this.<eos> And above all, you mustn't tell my mother.<eos> Will you do that for me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I promise.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Grasping at straws.<eos> Still trying to find a way to prove your friend has been framed?<eos> Every time I go down a path I think leads somewhere, it ends up being a dead end.
Now, don't you be a stranger.<eos> I've got lots more to say to you.<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> - Okay, ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> "A new turn of events will soon come about.<eos> - "A happy reunion with..." - Hey, there, pardner!<eos> - Yep, I'm talkin' to you!<eos> - "A happy reunion..." Pappy here's got some wisdom for you!<eos> "A happy reunion with a loved one "will make life all that you ever wanted it "or dreamed it to be.
I found it.<eos> Nice.<eos> What?<eos> It's nice, it's just...<eos> I don't know if I'm feeling it, you know?<eos> What about this idea?<eos> I know a guy who cuts glass...<eos> No. I took measurements, I looked at colors, we came here.<eos> This is the plan.<eos> Yeah, it's just that this table, it feels kind of uptight.
Are you scared of them?<eos> I need you.<eos> I'm with you.<eos> My job was to guide cars in and make sure nobody blocked pedestrians.<eos> The Hummer was right across the pavement, people couldn't get past.<eos> There's a big sign.<eos> Did you do or say anything?<eos> The windows were all darkened glass.<eos> I couldn't see in.<eos> I tapped on the window - it was open a little.
I'll look up while you look at the lines?<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Is Fanny coming too?<eos> - Yes, she's coming too.<eos> She'll watch out for us.<eos> - What's your favourite dish?<eos> - Probably venison.<eos> Mine's fish fingers.<eos> Why do you work in our nursery?<eos> Well, I was a teacher at your brother's school, but then it closed.
I found it interesting that the police didn't find any bullets in the gun...<eos> Your gun.<eos> I thought you always kept that thing loaded.<eos> Not always.<eos> You never cease to amaze and... Terrify me, maestro.<eos> I'm so sorry, ash. Yeah, me, too.<eos> Wow, that was fun.<eos> Well, we sure know how to pick 'em, hmm?<eos> Duress impacts relationships in one of two ways.<eos> It either tears people apart... binding them tightly in a common objective.
There's one thing Russians do well...<eos> It's give good hugs.<eos> So, Irene Demova...<eos> I'm not really sure what it meant.<eos> Or maybe it's a fresh start, a new beginning.<eos> I need some time to think.<eos> To be alone.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Morgan had this idea.<eos> It's nutty, really.
All right, all right, Tanisha.<eos> This isn't Jerry Springer.<eos> Calm down.<eos> Put all that spunk out on the court.<eos> You, too.<eos> Go.<eos> You're a little shit starter.<eos> Frank?<eos> Frank, can you come take a look at the stove?<eos> It's not lighting.
Did she say anything?<eos> Before you put her in the coma, was she talking again?<eos> Yes, she was, and that's a good sign.<eos> What did she say?<eos> Did she mention the name Andy?<eos> No, she only said that I had very pretty eyelashes.<eos> She's right.<eos> Your eyelashes are quite lush.<eos> - What about the bullet?<eos> - Oh, it's in there.
Was anyone else in the room?<eos> My mother and my father, my sister, Fatima.<eos> And what was she doing?<eos> She was bent over the table, like she was exhausted or something.<eos> Later I learned she...<eos> No, no, forget about later.<eos> Just tell us what you saw.<eos> She was holding the bottle.<eos> It was broken.<eos> It fell out of her hand.
I should sue her for lying on me about the watch.<eos> Lying about what?<eos> I didn't steal it from her.<eos> She gave it to me.<eos> Everybody's been talking about how she's been stepping out on me with some other fool.<eos> And then I see that watch hanging off her wrist?<eos> It ain't hard to figure out where she got it from.<eos> Then she try to play it off like it was for me.<eos> I ain't stupid, but it's a $8,000 watch.<eos> I don't care where it come from, I'll take it.
-Careful with that! It's 1 00 years old. -Shipshooba.<eos> Toothbrush.<eos> That's good. You need that.<eos> And special fork.<eos> You know, we have forks here, Robbie.<eos> Careful.<eos> is this 1 00 years old, too?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That is a very expensive fork, too.<eos> What does it do that's so special?
Toothbrush.<eos> That's good. You need that.<eos> And special fork.<eos> You know, we have forks here, Robbie.<eos> Careful.<eos> is this 1 00 years old, too?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That is a very expensive fork, too.<eos> What does it do that's so special?<eos> It tells the future.
Yeah, I know.<eos> -Did you hear that?<eos> -What's up?<eos> The garage just opened.<eos> Are your parents home?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They shouldn't be.<eos> Garage door open.<eos> Can you see it?<eos> Yeah, no, it looks like it's, Iike, stuck.
- I felt it.<eos> You just blindly felt it?<eos> It wasn't a blind feel.<eos> I knew what I was doing.<eos> I traced it with my fingers.<eos> - It was the posterior segmental artery. I'm sure of it.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> You never got a visual.<eos> I-I followed the tracheal bifurcation.<eos> It came directly off the main pulmonary artery.
Okay, so look, here's the deal.<eos> I took your car to the hardware store and had a little accident.<eos> And I ran over Mrs. Roser's mailbox.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> How's my car?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, the car's fine.<eos> It's got a little dent in the rear fender, okay?<eos> It's hardly noticeable and the car's completely drivable.
Don't give up on Clark just yet.<eos> He's a good guy, all right?<eos> A blind date is a very stressful situation.<eos> I'll tell you what- - I'm going to do you a favor, all right?<eos> Let's do a double date.<eos> Sometimes being in a group takes a lot of the pressure off.<eos> Double date, really?<eos> What is this, "High School Musical"?<eos> My idea is flawed?<eos> It has a fault?
I'm sorry. It's for school.<eos> I have to design a container that'll protect an egg in a 1-story drop.<eos> Yeah, so, um, you thought you would go with an egg carton?<eos> What if the best idea was under my nose the whole time?<eos> You're gonna need to come down and clean this up now.<eos> Ugh!<eos> I wouldn't have to do any of this if Alex would just let me use hers - from when she took the class.<eos> - Never.<eos> That design is my intellectual property.<eos> I think it has applications for unmanned space flight.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system.<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I know because I built it.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
At a park in Bethesda, a Syrian businessman drops his phone.<eos> Kurzweil picks it up and via coded SMS, he arranges to sell 26 pounds of weapons-grade uranium to the Iranian government.<eos> I guess the number panned out.<eos> What I need you to explain to me is how did some damn computer program spot a traitor when federal agents couldn't?<eos> Honestly?<eos> Not a clue.<eos> The machine will deliver actionable intelligence in time to thwart any threat to national security, but its operating system is a black box.<eos> And if we want to direct this machine at a specific target?<eos> No need.<eos> It already watches every target.

This isn't the first item chronologically, but it's the one that triggered a harder look.<eos> A gas station receipt?<eos> Eighteen of them.<eos> From a Shell station just outside Towson, Maryland.<eos> Kurzweil stopped there every third Thursday of every even month, even if he'd filled up the day before.<eos> On three of his 18 visits, this SUV was present two hours before.<eos> - A dead-drop.<eos> - The SUV was registered to the wife of a Turkish oil executive that paid for plane tickets used by an Iranian suspect in the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994.<eos> The thinnest thread connects Kurzweil and his contact and the machine could see it.<eos> It knew. And it was right.
You think the government would abuse this machine?<eos> Denton Weeks has spent the last six months trying to tunnel into the machine by way of the NSA feed.<eos> He's failed.<eos> But he'll keep trying.<eos> And he won't be alone.<eos> I don't want to think about what a man like Weeks would do with that power.<eos> That's why we keep anyone from getting their hands on it.<eos> You're sure it was Weeks?<eos> The machine told me.<eos> It has an instinct for self-preservation.

But I can't.<eos> I need to find my brother and mother.<eos> And my sister.<eos> I need to find her, too.<eos> Then we must part.<eos> A man has duties as well.<eos> Here.<eos> What is it?<eos> A coin of great value.<eos> Could it buy a horse?
Tell me where to find it.<eos> I don't want milk of the poppy.<eos> Do it quickly.<eos> Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.<eos> They miss their mother.<eos> They want to be with you.<eos> Do you want to be with them?<eos> You will be.<eos> When your dragons were born, our magic was born again.<eos> It is strongest in their presence.
How long?<eos> How long have you loved him?<eos> My mother and I have always been hot and cold.<eos> Uh, after one particular blow up,<eos> Mother wanted to make peace.<eos> She gave me a black orchid.<eos> Oh!<eos> Very delicate flower, the orchid.<eos> Well, I was determined to let it die out of some form of foolish protest.<eos> So I refused to water it, denied it light, and yet, day after day, it thrived.
If there were ever a time... grab the gun, go to his house... and then what?<eos> Kill him, free myself and leave you where?<eos> Cursed.<eos> And I promised you I would find a way to fix this.<eos> I can't do this to you.<eos> You haven't.<eos> I've made my decision.<eos> But you don't know everything you need to know.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The curse, it's in the bloodline.
Papa was the one who wanted a prince of the church.<eos> I'd have settled for Travis.<eos> Is there really no way we can get Sybil over?<eos> It seems ridiculous.<eos> On the contrary, it's a relief.<eos> Branson is still an object of fascination for the county.<eos> We'll ask him here when we can prepare the servants and manage it gently.<eos> He's making a problem where none exists.<eos> No-one could care less whether Branson's at the wedding or not.<eos> You must think country life more exciting than it is if you imagine people don't care when an earl's daughter runs off with the chauffeur.
It is possible he doesn't know about the third one.<eos> Regardless, we're gonna be able to use these two guns to determine the location of Matthew's shooter.<eos> According to my tests, the maximum range of the PW-ten weapon is a mile.<eos> So, the shooter wasn't anywhere beyond that distance.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And the bullet also would've needed another quarter of a mile to curve and then flatten out and hit Matthew the way it did.<eos> And that would eliminate anything within a quarter of a mile.<eos> So, see these red lines?<eos> Those are the paths the bullet would have traveled.<eos> Well, it's unlikely that it would have turned at a 90-degree angle, so that eliminates the marina and the street.
Hey.<eos> Come here, you got to see this.<eos> Hey, man, look, if one more person tells me how this phone's gonna change my life...<eos> Will you just look? I found this hidden on Stone's phone.<eos> I bet you're wondering why it had to be like this.<eos> It was my last resort.<eos> The only way I could get people to believe me.<eos> No one knew what I had put in motion.<eos> But I knew the officers of the Miami-Dade Police Department could decipher my message.<eos> I needed people with no agenda, people who could right a wrong, who would follow an investigation no matter where it went.
The unsub brought his own music to an abduction? Yes, he did, and that is creepy.<eos> Fortunately, whatever is imported onto this computer is downloaded to the home network, so, ladies and gentlemen, the mystery song of Mr. gruesome is...<eos> That's specific.<eos> That's another reason to call him the piano man. Turn it off.<eos> Please.<eos> Does this song mean something to you or your wife? Vanessa hates it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> How come?<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> But every time it came on the radio, she'd burst into tears.
Let's go.<eos> What about Jake?<eos> He'll be ok.<eos> We just need to get you away from here.<eos> What the hell, Ben?<eos> The iron will keep your power in check.<eos> What happened to killing Blackwell?<eos> I don't have to.<eos> Cassie will.<eos> Lee. Since when do you leave a party before it's over?
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I'll get you out of there.<eos> We gotta cut the power on the fence.<eos> Bad idea.<eos> Unless you want to use the entire population of Lake Placid as bait.<eos> She's right.<eos> Without the voltage running through the fence, it's not gonna hold up long to something that big.
What is that on your face?<eos> Is that dirt?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> What do you think they're talking about?<eos> Who?<eos> Ms. Evans is probably telling Dalia about some cool, new band whose bass player she used to date, a band Dalia would never in a million years be into, but I would have loved.<eos> Well, I'm not a professional lip-reader, but I think Dalia just said something about brownies?<eos> Or bran eyes?<eos> Brown thighs.<eos> I hope Dalia enjoys the attention while it lasts, because that's gonna be me soon.
What's to talk about?<eos> I thought you wanted me to stop moping?<eos> George, I meant have a shower, not storm the Batcave.<eos> Besides, it's... erm...<eos> Splodge's first transformation.<eos> - Splodge?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Daft, isn't it?<eos> It's almost as if she hasn't been given a proper name.<eos> The curse repairs what it damages.
- What is she doing in here?<eos> - What is it?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This is a new pane of glass, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, Erica broke it bouncing a ball like she's not ever supposed to do in the house, but she does it anyway.<eos> Right?<eos> - When was this?<eos> - Can we see it?<eos> Do you have the ball?<eos> - I-I don't know where it is.
You see, life is a precious, precious gift.<eos> This coming from a guy who announced in the break room today that if we were out of non-dairy creamer he was going to kill himself?<eos> Okay.<eos> So there you were behind the counter and the victim was facing you.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Yes, and I'm telling him that I don't have the box in the cigarettes he wants, only soft pack.<eos> Then I see a blue car go by.<eos> Then I hear something.<eos> Then I hear the window is cracking.<eos> - Then it crashes in.
He wasn't there.<eos> Guess now I know why.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Prime Suspect Season 01 Episode 13 Stuck In The Middle With You Original Air Date January 22, 2012<eos> It ain't a coincidence.<eos> Ramirez was solid.<eos> Cordero knew it.

Go.<eos> Bienvenido to the DJ W-Squared show.<eos> I am DJ W-Squared, the only place you can listen to a rainbow of authentic rap and hip-hop that will move you.<eos> First up today, I've decided I'm gonna play a new J-Stryke track each day this week.<eos> Next one is up tonight, and then another one tomorrow.<eos> This is DJ W-Squared, calling it a night.<eos> Remember, they are after you.<eos> They do want to take your money.<eos> They are conspiring against you, but music is where freedom lives.<eos> It frees our minds and soothes our souls.
A little heartbreak is nothing compared to what you're serving up.<eos> End it... today!<eos> OK, ready, guys?<eos> One and two...<eos> Barry, I need to use the shed.<eos> What for?<eos> Me and Hope need a place to, er... You know.<eos> You want to use my shagging cabin?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's in use all afternoon.
For breath to utter what it's like thee.<eos> You tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase, you vile standing-tuck!<eos> RAUCOUS LAUGHTER<eos> Well, well, breathe awhile, and then to it again.<eos> Yet hear me speak but this.<eos> Mark, Jack.<eos> We two saw you three set on two.<eos> Mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down.<eos> Then did we two set on you three and, Falstaff, you carried your guts away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard bull-calf!<eos> What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword and say it was in fight.
Three times hath King Henry made head against my power.<eos> Thrice have I sent him bootless home and weather-beaten back.<eos> Home without boots, and in foul weather too.<eos> How 'scapes he agues in the devil's name(! )<eos> Come, here is the map.<eos> Shall we divide our right according to our threefold order ta'en?<eos> The archdeacon hath divided it into three limits very equally.<eos> Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here, in quantity equals not one of yours.<eos> See how this river comes me cranking in and cuts me from the best of all my land.<eos> It shall not wind with such a deep indent, to rob me of so rich a bottom here.

Three of four times.<eos> Lived well and in good compass.<eos> And now I'm out of all order, out of all compass.<eos> Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of all compass.<eos> Out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.<eos> Do thou amend thy face and I'll amend my life.<eos> Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.<eos> I never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire.<eos> A good sherry sack hath a two-fold operation in it.<eos> It ascends me into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy vapours which environ it, makes it apprehensive, quick, full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the voice - the tongue - becomes excellent wit.
How has he the leisure to be sick in such a rustling time?<eos> Who leads his power?<eos> His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.<eos> Sick now?<eos> Droop now?<eos> This sickness doth infect the very life-blood of our enterprise.<eos> Yet I would your father had been here.<eos> This absence of your father's draws a curtain that shows the ignorant a kind of fear before not dreamt of.<eos> You strain too far.<eos> I rather of his absence make this use - it lends a lustre and more great opinion,
Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition.<eos> Belike then my appetite was not princely got, for, by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature, "small beer".<eos> But, indeed, these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness.<eos> What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name.<eos> Or to know thy face tomorrow.<eos> How ill it follows after you have laboured so hard, you should talk so idly.<eos> Tell me, how many good young princes would do so, their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is?<eos> Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?<eos> Yes, faith, let it be an excellent good thing.<eos> It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.
Given what's happened, it's understandable that your opinion would color your testimony, but I just want to know what you said, what you did, and what you were thinking at the time.<eos> I don't think it was his fault.<eos> Just tell me your initial theory.<eos> I thought the patient had a liver problem.<eos> Hepatic encephalopathy explained why he passed out, why he couldn't move his limbs.<eos> But that's not the idea House went with.<eos> He thought Taub's idea was stupid.<eos> And what about your idea?<eos> He thought that was stupid too.<eos> No, I meant, what was it?
If Park is right, he goes all Cuckoo's Nest on us, we can cross "brain" off the list, diagnose him, and he can walk out of here cured.<eos> Are you trying to make this easy for me?<eos> By your own admission, if you give the patient steroids, two of the three outcomes are gonna make him worse.<eos> What was making the patient worse was not having a diagnosis.<eos> This was the fastest way to get it.<eos> It was a perfect diagnostic moment.<eos> In light of what happened, you still think it was the perfect diagnostic moment?<eos> Yes.<eos> My theory accounted for all the medical outcomes.<eos> It did not account for the disobedience of my own team.
I'm still on temporary vows.<eos> It may be the last time I hear Eminem for a while.<eos> You're using an iPod.<eos> But I've never seen you use rosary beads.<eos> What day did Jesus die?<eos> I know, one gospel says passover, another says the day before.<eos> How many times did the cock crow before Peter's third denial? Once or twice?<eos> You can't argue away my faith.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it's so strong even plain contradictions-- because it's not that strong.
But we don'! live on Sesame Street. We live in the real...<eos> I was wondering if maybe we overlooked a symptom, or something.<eos> Makes perfect sense if you're the patient, and pantywaist is the symptom.<eos> Adams and I both thought the patient could have celiac, but only she was willing to go out on a limb and run the test.<eos> I gave up.<eos> Now you're in here watching a motivational speech.<eos> Even your attempt to get your balls back lacks balls.<eos> World, the business world.<eos> If you're not a winner, you're a loser.<eos> His voice, it's lower than it is now.
When you see a weakness, that's a time for strength.<eos> A lot of people say, "I feel bad about it.<eos> " The other guy made a mistake...<eos> You bailed too early.<eos> Now I get all the credit.<eos> Chronic hoarseness is a symptom of a condition called silent thyroiditis.<eos> But I'm not hoarse.<eos> Exactly. But you were, three years ago.<eos> Silent thyroiditis comes and goes.<eos> And it, in turn, is a symptom of Polyglandular Autoimmune syndrome, type 3.
Lateral view looks good.<eos> If you have such a negative opinion of the army, why did you enlist?<eos> I needed to find out what really happened to my dad.<eos> There were two redacted pages in his service record.<eos> Going into intelligence was the quickest way to up my security clearance.<eos> Then why would you leak that video?<eos> Part of my job was to grab a cup of tea with the locals.<eos> The face time is supposed to make them more likely to trust us with sensitive information, but they became my friends.<eos> If there was another attack, civilian casualties, and I had done nothing...<eos> Your spleen, it's enlarged.
Clear him, clear him!<eos> Hey, what was that?<eos> Hatchet, hatchet, hatchet!<eos> Let's make some noise!<eos> Nice to meet the pride of Trois-Rivieres.<eos> I still got your Wings rookie card. So what's that worth?<eos> It's a collector's item.
CHASE: An amoebic infection would cause fever and meningitis.<eos> - But not liver failure.<eos> - It could if he had a clot.<eos> TAUB: How would amoebas get past his cribriform plate?<eos> He went swimming in a frozen lake in New Jersey?<eos> Adams said his ex-girlfriend was a yoga instructor.<eos> Maybe he sprained his chakras.<eos> Yoga nuts are way more likely to be into alternative medicine.<eos> He had this weird little teapot in his house.<eos> What was it like?

And because he's always played that role, you've never had to develop a conscience of your own.<eos> People don't change.<eos> Consciences don't spontaneously develop.<eos> You're wrong, Greg.<eos> Which is why you'll be better off without him.<eos> You've been looking to him to find what you've gotta find within yourself.<eos> Something you can find.<eos> Hold your child.<eos> This is a reason to die.<eos> This is what my life could have been, not what it can be.
Unless you've got something to hide?<eos> We were working on a cheese souffle recipe, all night.<eos> Sue and I were in my training kitchen, attempting a six-cheese souffle.<eos> Let me get this straight, Sue.<eos> You were making... a Sue-fley?<eos> And before you were head chef, you were a... - .. Sue-s chef.<eos> No, no, it's just that you were, your name is...<eos> Your name is Sue...<eos> You know what? Forget it, it's fine.<eos> We have a television show to make and it has to be transmitted later today.
Well, he's very intense.<eos> But she's very aggressive.<eos> What do your instincts say?<eos> Well, he kept his coat on the entire time.<eos> He must have been boiling.<eos> Well, that's a bit weird.<eos> It is weird.<eos> Let me, let me get rid of this jacket, sorry.<eos> Why does your coat smell of chicken?<eos> - It's not...chicken.
And now?<eos> 73 Steenweg, Lochristi.<eos> 73 Steenweg, Lochristi. Say it again.<eos> 73 Steenweg, Lochristi.<eos> Remember that.<eos> That's where I live.<eos> When I've had my baby, you can come and live with me.<eos> Everything will be fine.<eos> Can't you hear the music?<eos> It's really loud.

Sometimes, you'd dig through an old grave, unmarked like, right through a dead body, and it stunk.<eos> Child's play. Try digging plague pits with the bodies piled three deep around you.<eos> Um, I worked in a bar once.<eos> Yeah, and this guy came in to chat me up and later, he got drunk and crashed his car and died and he tried to drag me through death's door into purgatory.<eos> Dog food factory.<eos> Shifting huge lumps of frozen sheep's lung.<eos> Melted blood all sploshing about on the floor and the gaffer, well, he was...<eos> Annie! How was your day?<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Thank you for asking, because it was a bit weird.
♪ Are you!<eos> D.B., you may want to take a look at this.<eos> Jane Doe Number One. Entry wound looks like a small caliber.<eos> Bullet is copper-washed.<eos> Looks like a .22. Kill shot.<eos> She sustained at least five other GSWs.<eos> Four perforating, through-and-through, caliber unknown.

You really think Mark Gabriel is reading your mail?<eos> I wouldn't put anything past him.<eos> You and Laura close?<eos> Yeah.<eos> At one time, yeah.<eos> When we were kids, Laura's house was like my second home.<eos> Until Sam, her dad was like the closest thing I had to a father.<eos> We were like sisters.<eos> This card play music when you got it?<eos> Well, no, but I just assumed it wasn't working.
It's, like, under all this viscera we wear, there's--well, there's something strong and--and clean and--and beautiful that--that holds us together.<eos> You can't lose it.<eos> I think--I think that's cool.<eos> Did I pass?<eos> I've taken a psych test before.<eos> Ah.<eos> Mr. Jane.<eos> We were just discussing you.<eos> Dean Papadakis told me about your impressive memory.<eos> My own memory isn't as good as it used to be.
Au lit...<eos> Avec ma femme.<eos> I think that means he was in bed with his wife.<eos> You released Theissens' video, didn't you?<eos> Yeah?<eos> So?<eos> It was news.<eos> So you're responsible for derailing his career.<eos> No.<eos> The truth is what it is.
you're team captain.<eos> You lead us to victory.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You understand this game.<eos> I suck at everything.<eos> Not at this.<eos> What about that creamy filling you talked about?<eos> That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the Butters we know?<eos> That's in there.<eos> It's overflowing sometimes.

I know this is a painful subject, but you might wanna hold on to it for the future.<eos> All right, gimme.<eos> Gimme the dress.<eos> No, I'm just...<eos> I'm gonna put this in my closet.<eos> That way, you don't have to see it.<eos> But if you ever want it back, it'll be there.
His prediction is that you're planning an escape, which we both know is impossible.<eos> Impossible is a word found only in the dictionary of fools.<eos> You're a little tall to be quoting Napoleon.<eos> His exile did last nearly a year and, uh, you're right.<eos> Well, take a look around, Percy.<eos> There is no way out of here.<eos> No way that you can see, but you will, before this day is done.<eos> And my favorite part is, there's nothing you can do to stop it.<eos> Not long ago, I received reliable Intel on a major threat against Division, most likely an attack on this facility.<eos> I have reason to believe it will occur within the next 24 hours.
But this time was different.<eos> This time there were no reservations.<eos> Did you make the reservations for the chair rentals?<eos> No, I'm finalizing the head count.<eos> Michael's brother's a no, so that's 25.<eos> No, 26... both his parents are driving down.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Aren't they, like, archenemies or something?<eos> Well, they're not in a comic book, but yes, basically.<eos> They haven't been in the same room since Michael's high school graduation.
You're good to go.<eos> The babies, too?<eos> Yes. The babies, too.<eos> Petra... don't worry, we can do this.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Michael, I promise.<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> The last time my parents were together, it was a disaster.<eos> There was fighting, finger-pointing, tears... mostly mine, but still...<eos> Come on, they are not gonna do that in front of me.

It sure is.<eos> _<eos> Slight change of plans:<eos> I'm on my way to Fort Myers.<eos> What?<eos> Michael's parents left.<eos> They said that they weren't coming to the engagement party, so I'm going there.
Look what he did.<eos> He punished them.<eos> So maybe it's some kind of self-loathing thing.<eos> Or maybe we got it wrong.<eos> I mean, just because the guy's educated and multi-lingual doesn't mean he comes from money.<eos> Maybe it's exactly the opposite.<eos> Maybe he hates people with money.<eos> We should deliver the profile.<eos> The man we're looking for is a narcissistic copycat killer.<eos> Typically, copycats have identity issues and low confidence, which is why they emulate others.
Fine.<eos> As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday.<eos> Every year we'd have a party.<eos> No one I invited would ever come, because they didn't like me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, that part wasn't so bad.<eos> I didn't like them, either.<eos> But then I'd inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister's friends.<eos> Oh, you poor thing.<eos> When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party.
Happy birthday to you.<eos> Oh, you're singing.<eos> Well, I'm sorry.<eos> Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.<eos> Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second, we'll light the candles, and we can all sing together.<eos> I was crushing it, but all right.<eos> Okay, while they get the cake,<eos> Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn't think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.<eos> You know, I used to hate these hugs.<eos> Now they're just extremely irritating.
And blue if it's a Svetlenny.<eos> Well, it beats the way they did it in my town in Poland.<eos> You were either a boy or you had to know how to climb back up out of a well.<eos> Um, you know we're bakers, right?<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> I'm baked right now.<eos> Well, I'm dressed for my father's prison musical.<eos> Say that three times without crying.<eos> You look good.<eos> If those inmates weren't hardened criminals before, they will be once they see you in that.
Five years ago, we were sitting on Chestnut with our iced coffees.<eos> I remember it like it was five years ago.<eos> And we said that $250,000 the exact amount of money we're getting, was what we needed to get our cupcake business going.<eos> Chestnut was so excited, he made a little poo.<eos> Not so little.<eos> I remember it knocking that cat unconscious.<eos> Five years later, cupcakes alone aren't cutting it.<eos> Ouch.<eos> But true.<eos> Sure, they're sweet, delicious, and chic, but what if we add... alcohol?
So, what do we know?<eos> At 0750, a neighbor witnessed Megan Porter and a classmate,<eos> Dean Campbell, being forced into a black SUV by armed assailants.<eos> Any luck getting a GPS fix on either of their cells?<eos> We checked that.<eos> They're both turned off.<eos> I'll call Abby, see if she can turn them back on remotely.<eos> Has there been any communication with the kidnappers?<eos> It's too soon.<eos> They'll settle somewhere first.

Nothing like that.<eos> This classmate,<eos> Dean Campbell, what do you know about him?<eos> Everything.<eos> I had my personal security assistant check him out a few months ago.<eos> He's dating my daughter.<eos> I had to have him vetted.<eos> What do you know about his family?<eos> Dean's parents are curators at the Smithsonian.<eos> I hardly think they're cause for concern.
That's not good enough!<eos> - Makes me miss Diane.<eos> - Richard, we're done here.<eos> Gentlemen, I apologize.<eos> Please come in.<eos> Agents Gibbs and Fornell, this is Richard Porter, uh, my daughter's father, and his partner, Justine Wolfe.<eos> I'm tired of meeting agent after agent.<eos> None of 'em have any answers.<eos> Richard, calm down.<eos> They're on our side.
It's empty.<eos> Let it air out.<eos> She must have left in a hurry.<eos> She didn't get very far.<eos> Gibbs. Okay, I'm ready this time.<eos> So go ahead, ask me, ask me, ask me.<eos> Got anything?<eos> You know better than to ask me that, Gibbs.<eos> You know I found something.<eos> So when the kidnappers abandoned the van at the mall, they didn't have time to bleach-bomb it like they did the SUV, and I found this on the floor.
Decriminalizing quality-of-life crimes is a huge mistake.<eos> I would think the cops would be thrilled not to have to arrest everyone who drinks a beer on their own stoop.<eos> Look, Broken Windows is an essential part of the fabric that protects this city.<eos> You can't just cherry-pick and pull threads, or the whole thing unravels.<eos> It's an excuse for the NYPD to intrude on the private lives of its citizens.<eos> And you know it.<eos> No, I do not.<eos> Yes, you do. And now you're trying to tell me that harassing people for jaywalking keeps the city safe.<eos> Yeah. And I've got the numbers to prove it.<eos> I have the numbers that say, in minority neighborhoods, they're starting to get a little tired of constantly being hassled by the police.
Why... why does she want to protect me from you?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> Oh. We've been in here almost two weeks, and you've spoken very little about your life growing up.<eos> I was, uh... normal.<eos> My parents fought a bit.<eos> Uh, my dad had a drinking problem.<eos> But every family has their problems.<eos> It was nothing, uh, extraordinary.<eos> It was ordinary.<eos> You know, they both tried.
Each candidate will get one minute to answer questions and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals.<eos> I'll give candidates time to respond if they've been singled out and criticized by another candidate.
- So... when Glen and I first got married, his parents gave us, as a wedding gift, um, a little house that they had in Pennsylvania.
- So... when Glen and I first got married, his parents gave us, as a wedding gift, um, a little house that they had in Pennsylvania.<eos> They had it since they were married back in, I don't know, '69, and now they spend their summers in a bigger house that they moved into that's right near the little house and I think that they partly gave it to us so that they could see Glen's kids more,
I wouldn't worry.<eos> I'm sure she made it back safe.<eos> Then why are we still in the woods?<eos> We should go back into town and check.<eos> I can't.<eos> Snow White still thinks I'm a villain.<eos> These people are always looking for villains to blame.<eos> I'll tell them you've changed... that love changed you.<eos> It certainly did.<eos> But... in case they don't believe me, would... would you mind taking the baby?
Don't be.<eos> I've only had a few thousand years to dwell on it.<eos> And once I make this whole, we can show everyone they were wrong about us.<eos> We can live any life we want.<eos> That sounds lovely.<eos> We could even rule this place together.<eos> Rule Storybrooke?<eos> But I thought we were just planning to live here, you know?<eos> Nice little house, my daughter playing in the garden.<eos> I want that, too, but... these people, they're leaving us no choice.
I can see my daughter.<eos> But we need a distraction.<eos> My protection spell.<eos> Someone's trying to break in.<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> They're coming for us.<eos> It's Emma Swan.<eos> Mummy will be right back as soon as I make sure you're safe.<eos> I'll check who else is creeping in.<eos> One thing I know about these people, they never work alone.
We're gonna need another one wide open.<eos> O2 sats are 85 and dropping.<eos> What's happening to me?<eos> We're gonna find that out.<eos> We're gonna intubate.<eos> Give me a 7.5 ET tube, 20 of Etomidate, and 1 milligram per kilo of ROC.<eos> Septic shock?<eos> Maybe, but we need to find a source.<eos> Your respiratory muscles are weak.<eos> I'm gonna intubate you so that they can rest.
How about we talk later on, in private?<eos> You seen how they blew that little kid away.<eos> What you think they gonna do to me?<eos> I saw this white SUV drive around the playground.<eos> Slow.<eos> Kind of big.<eos> It had a roof rack on it.<eos> And then I glance over and see four guys get out.<eos> That's all I saw.<eos> Were they white?
My hope is, he might even point us in the direction of the killers.<eos> - He's at Stateville Penitentiary.<eos> - Yeah, I know. I put him there.<eos> We'll need to leave right now.<eos> Look, that's a wasted trip, Reverend.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - He's the leader of the G Park Lords.<eos> - Was.<eos> Reverend, the gangs now, they're splinter units.<eos> They don't kick it upstairs anymore.
Grateful we saved your life?<eos> He says you brought them to his door.<eos> It's you who got everybody in Shanzhai killed.<eos> I didn't start this.<eos> You and Peng did.<eos> Why was Lau Hu torturing you?<eos> Lottery tickets!<eos> How the hell does lottery even work now, when there's barely any currency?<eos> I've seen it in Hong Kong, mate.<eos> People put in whatever they have... A chicken, a bag of rice.

It's our job to hold the country together.<eos> You sat with the President and wrote those policies.<eos> You didn't fight for them.<eos> If President Michener couldn't make them work, then Howard Oliver certainly can't.<eos> So you're gonna let Oliver capitulate to the regional leaders.<eos> He just gave them authority over local militias without speaking to Captain Chandler.<eos> Chandler's the acting head of our military, and he never would have allowed it.<eos> Captain Chandler is 12,000 miles away.<eos> The regional leaders need to be able to call their own shots.<eos> If they can't control their own regions, who will?

ATF found the guns, but we're not giving up on the shooter.<eos> Kitt said they'd take it from here, but, uh, they'd keep us in the loop.<eos> Oh, I want to hear that in person.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> I show you the professional courtesy of dragging my ass down here late at night for an interrogation room?<eos> Tell me what's going on.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I told your agents.<eos> Didn't they tell you?
But it's the--<eos> -Ööö-ber.<eos> It's a service where people can request a ride and I will pick them up.<eos> -Like Uber.<eos> -Except it's Ööö-ber.<eos> It's the same thing.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> - Kirk. People use an app to call a car.<eos> -I have no app.<eos> -Then how do they get a car?

-Bye, Gypsy.<eos> Hi, Mrs. Gleason?<eos> Hey, Kirk? It's freezing back here.<eos> Oh, that's probably because I vented the floor.<eos> -Pardon?<eos> -The floor.<eos> I drilled a few holes in the floor.<eos> Was there an explanation with that or...<eos> Two customers passed out last week.<eos> They were old, so it could've just been old people passing out.
-And the one with the skateboard?<eos> He doesn't ride it. He just carries it around.<eos> I'm not listening to you.<eos> The girls all stand at the mirror, looking at themselves like they're God's gift, making it impossible for me to stand at the mirror and look at myself.<eos> -Enough.<eos> -And the boys stare at their phones with their mouths open.<eos> They never close them.<eos> They all have stupid ventriloquist dummy mouths!<eos> And what is the mother lode?<eos> They keep telling stories about the mother lode.
But Jack Black wants a mini-fridge. Cate Blanchett wants a mini-fridge.<eos> It's Dexter Schmid and Lydia Papadokolis who compromise their standards and stay in our tiny rooms without mini-fridges.<eos> Our rooms are beautiful.<eos> But no Nespresso machines.<eos> Daniel Radcliffe likes his ristretto in the morning and his half-decaffeinato in the evening, while he reads the papers he borrowed from Matthew McConaughey.<eos> How do you know all this?<eos> -We don't have a spa or a gym.<eos> -We don't have the space.<eos> These people care about their pecs and their glutes.<eos> They work them out. Then they want them oiled, rubbed and scraped.

How about scotch? Feels like a scotch night.<eos> Coming up.<eos> --Oh, now who's that?<eos> - I'm not gonna make it.<eos> - Luke, come on.<eos> Remember your last name. Danes. The Anglo-Saxon word for warrior.<eos> It means that you're a fighter. You're a conqueror!<eos> No, it doesn't. "Danes" means, like, valley, or something.<eos> It's a farmer's name. My ancestors raised sheep.<eos> Well, they defended those sheep with all they had.
-I'm sweating through everything now.<eos> -Not gonna happen. -I've got a shark.<eos> -Give me that.<eos> - Not gonna happen.<eos> Say, I believe I recognize you from my school days.<eos> And I you.<eos> Good to see you, old chum.<eos> Ah, Chilton.<eos> "I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten;<eos> even so, they have made me."
Go back to bed.<eos> Go on.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's your stove.<eos> How a grown woman goes through life without being able to heat something up is incredible.<eos> Yes, Sidney.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> I just need to heat up some soup, and then I'm out the door.<eos> See you soon.<eos> He plunges his barbed harpoon into the whale's back. Then with the killing irons, they stab the great beast repeatedly in the neck... to stop it diving and make it bleed to death all the faster.
Oh, I'm not back. I'm just here temporarily.<eos> -That's not what I heard. -It's true.<eos> At the bookstore, all anyone talks about is how you're back.<eos> -Well, I'm not back.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Spread the word.<eos> Hey, guys, did you hear?<eos> Somebody vandalized the floaty hut.<eos> -Oh, no.<eos> -Hinges are bent, lock's jammed, and the kids are having a fit 'cause they can't get their floaties.
Did you know I just celebrated a birthday?<eos> -Of course I did.<eos> -It was a big one.<eos> A milestone.<eos> - Fifty?<eos> - Forty.<eos> -I'm not 50. -You're not 40.<eos> -I'm not 50.<eos> -Michel, you weren't 17 when we met.<eos> This is the problem with knowing people a long time. They can backdate you.
With your approval, I would like to petition the national board to fund the purchase of a top-notch display for the diaries of Abigail Franklin.<eos> -After we authenticate them, right?<eos> We can't repeat what happened with the bogus Federalist Papers.<eos> Where the word "Federalist" was misspelled.<eos> We stopped that check just in time.<eos> Very well, then. Post-verification.<eos> All in favor?<eos> I'll get the process started.<eos> Emily, these puffs... Are they crab?<eos> Do they taste like crab?
I have no job. I have no credit. I have no underwear.<eos> -What?<eos> -I can't find that box!<eos> -Buy some new ones. -Are you listening, man?<eos> I'm broke.<eos> I'll lend you the money.<eos> This isn't about you lending me money.<eos> This is about my life!<eos> People come up and smell me.<eos> And what are they smelling?
Vod, can we have a talk about...?<eos> Yes, hello, Nightline?<eos> I need to talk to someone.<eos> About something I've done.<eos> Something terrible.<eos> I've had sex with JP before.<eos> Quite a few times.<eos> But this is the first time we've ever done it sober.<eos> I fucking hate myself.<eos> Yeah, well, I would talk to my friends about it, except they're all third years and they're too busy, so I'm in this on my own.
Oh, I can't compete with that.<eos> End-stage cirrhosis.<eos> You're just saying that to make me jealous.<eos> Aw, you guys are so cute together.<eos> - Hmm. - It's nauseating.<eos> Dr. Shane said to give this to you.<eos> It's a new patient he wants you to handle.<eos> All right, you.<eos> I asked for Mr. Perry's labs an hour ago.<eos> I want you to call your parents and tell them they wasted their money sending you to medical school.
Did he tell you he was dying?<eos> Was the intercourse...<eos> The most romantic, amazing night of my life?<eos> No. Vaginal.<eos> - Okay. You know what?<eos> Maybe you can actually fill this out.<eos> It's just fascinating.<eos> We had a pair of conjoined twins born in Cleveland Clinic.<eos> I was part of the team that worked on them for 20 hours.<eos> They nearly didn't survive.

My people are here.<eos> Your people?<eos> Well, two nurses.<eos> I got to go fill out paperwork to release the body when she dies.<eos> You'll get over it.<eos> I knew it was gonna be a challenge having him on my own, but I... you know,<eos> I thought I'd have a little time to ramp into it.<eos> When he smiles back at you, you'll know it's all worth it.<eos> Uh, did my test results come back?<eos> Yes. They're good.
Yeah, and you wouldn't tell me what they were.<eos> What does the unluckiest girl in the world do when she wakes from a long sleep to find that she's been granted both her wishes in the same day?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She thanks Grace.<eos> Hey. What are you doing here?<eos> Oh, I just got that patient into a deep-freeze pod at Randor.<eos> And now I have a shift.<eos> Long day.<eos> Man, those people are nuts.<eos> They really believe all that crap.
I'm waiting for you.<eos> Mommy, I want you to come home now.<eos> Now!<eos> I'm waiting.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Where are you?<eos> You're not my mommy.<eos> You're back.<eos> Black Claw found the safe house. Killed the guardians.<eos> They have Diana.
It's gonna knock you out.<eos> You should lie down.<eos> Hope this doesn't go back too far.<eos> There are a few things I did as a teenager that I'd rather not...<eos> Rather not...<eos> When is he supposed to wake up?<eos> We want him to stay asleep.<eos> He needs to be able to access his memories without any outside stimulation causing them to go away again.<eos> Bad memories are like, you know, little bunnies.<eos> They get scared, they run back down the hall, they hide.

I know.<eos> I know. It's a miracle.<eos> This baby must be thinking, "What is going on out there?"<eos> Paige, honey.<eos> I've never been scared like that before.<eos> I mean... I'm married to a minister.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I know.<eos> Please tell your parents I'm sorry.<eos> It's... It's okay.<eos> They understand.
Are you ready to move to get the codes?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> You think so?<eos> Yes. I am.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> Nothing.<eos> There's no problem.<eos> You know, it's possible for people like us who give everything to our country and the world to forget ourselves.<eos> You sound like Philip after an EST meeting.<eos> What are they like?
I guess I do.<eos> Hours are good, pay is decent.<eos> I only live a few miles away.<eos> It's a job.<eos> These are all the flagged posts from the Boston area relating to drugs, trolling and violence.<eos> And if I'm completely honest, I still don't understand what trolling is.<eos> Basically, trolls are jerks.<eos> Most are just annoying, but some can do real damage.<eos> Bullying kids into committing suicide, or blackmailing people they meet online.<eos> So in a way, they do evoke the trolls of Scandinavian folklore.

♪ Do you feel that?<eos> ♪<eos> ♪ Can you feel that?<eos> ♪<eos> Jared Atchley,<eos> Agent Ryan, FBI.<eos> I'm here investigating the two images that were posted yesterday.<eos> Do you know which pictures I'm talking about?<eos> The dead bodies?<eos> You're not asking me if they're real.
I don't know.<eos> To talk, maybe?<eos> I'm a pretty good listener.<eos> Well, you used to think so, anyway.<eos> He said you told him about me.<eos> He was not very friendly at first.<eos> But then we started talking... getting to know each other.<eos> We were actually having a really nice time.<eos> And then, out of nowhere, he just collapsed and I had to give him CPR until the paramedics came.<eos> They said he might not have made it had I not done that.
Right, and we know the next sin is Trolling.<eos> But with no photo, that could mean there's no victim yet.<eos> Could be staging her next murder as we speak.<eos> Actually, that could be how we find her.<eos> Raven, uh, log onto Sasha's PicThread account.<eos> Then click onto "followers"<eos> and go to the "people you may know" section.<eos> Social media sites like FriendAgenda and PicThread-- they use this, uh, proximity-based - algorithm, right? - Right.<eos> To determine who shows up in this section.<eos> They actually suggest people that you have physically been around.
There's a chance they would've looked into their value before committing to the robbery, right?<eos> Narrowing down to anyone searching for Ball watches...<eos> One result.<eos> Boom, right there.<eos> All right, Krumitz, match that IP address to a physical address.<eos> Elijah, you're with SWAT.<eos> Deputy Director, I've just been informed that one of your black hats is bringing a lawsuit against the FBI.<eos> What?<eos> I'm looking at the legal documents right now.<eos> They just hit my desk.
All of these girls have their own unique talents they bring to the squad.<eos> Know what?<eos> You're right. The beta was the coder.<eos> She rerouted from the car.<eos> Alpha just seems like she's getting rich off the other two girls' hacking skills.<eos> She takes charge, she intimidates.<eos> You know what?<eos> The omega.<eos> The omegas shows fear, right?<eos> They could become a liability.
To be famous.<eos> GNE.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And that is how we're gonna catch them.<eos> Listen up, bitches.<eos> We're the Flash Squad.<eos> This is how we do.<eos> That's right, these rainbowed-visor vixens want your stuff.<eos> But let's be real.<eos> With legs like that, all they had to do was ask.
I got it!<eos> GARDNER:<eos> Do they know where their son is?<eos> RYAN:<eos> No idea.<eos> Jake's cell phone's off.<eos> They gave me the number of some of his friends.<eos> I'll make some calls.<eos> But Jake's parents are scared and worried.<eos> They don't know any more than we do.
That's crazy.<eos> You got a...<eos> Have you seen this trick before?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay. (chuckles)<eos> I used to be better at it.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're worried about your parents, aren't you?<eos> Don't be.<eos> They're gonna be fine.
You got a...<eos> Have you seen this trick before?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay. (chuckles)<eos> I used to be better at it.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're worried about your parents, aren't you?<eos> Don't be.<eos> They're gonna be fine.<eos> They're just helping us out.
We need authorized access to that site.<eos> RYAN:<eos> Don't worry about that right now!<eos> Hack it if you need to.<eos> Do it, pull it up right now.<eos> Raven, focus on Adams Morgan.<eos> RUSSELL:<eos> Find the last sensor recordings.<eos> Use time and distance between the sensors.<eos> Where they intersect will be our location.
Mm. Lights off.<eos> Lights on.<eos> Who would've moved the body?<eos> What?<eos> I mean, that's a big deal, right?<eos> Are you testing me?<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> Okay. Yes, it is a big deal that they moved the body.<eos> That means the witnesses lied to us.<eos> So maybe they were hiding something.
Well, it's totally friendly.<eos> They look great together.<eos> They could have their own show.<eos> I should be there.<eos> Well, why aren't you?<eos> We both decided Blake could handle it and... because he wanted to and they said it would be friendly.<eos> What about China?<eos> I understand you've developed...<eos> What now?<eos> Oliver developed this App that busy people can share which lets them know when they have a simultaneous window of spare time in their schedules.
Good luck tomorrow.<eos> So we barely avoided an all-out war with Russia in the fall,<eos> Hizb Al-Shahid is still out there plotting more attacks, and now India is gloating that a-a Pakistani nuke crash-landed within their border, and we're supposed to convince a bunch of hippie-dippie physicists that the world isn't getting any more dangerous?<eos> Apparently, the Doomsday Clock people also take global warming into account, but yes, that's pretty much our marching orders.<eos> Marching into a firing squad.<eos> And now it's time to execute.<eos> So to speak.<eos> Matt, would you please work with the people on the first floor on bullet pointing all the positive diplomatic outcomes from the last year?<eos> Those guys haven't had anything positive to say since the Wall came down.<eos> And even then, they were griping about the clean up.
Short of getting their bomb back, I'd say it's only a matter of days before Pakistan's government collapses.<eos> Or a matter of hours.<eos> What is the situation with the bomb, Ephraim?<eos> The JTOC team is literally acting at this point, going through a series of final safety checks that aren't really necessary.<eos> It's getting tense.<eos> Pakistan's amassing troops along the border.<eos> India, of course is responding in kind.<eos> How quickly can we get our people out there?<eos> As long as it takes them to run to their choppers... a couple HH-60G's.<eos> Assuming they don't get caught in the crossfire.
- Ah.<eos> I guess one is better than two.<eos> I had a feeling this whole thing was a nonstarter.<eos> You can't dissuade people with that much integrity.<eos> They're in the pocket of "Big Truth."<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Okay, this is getting a little weird.<eos> You knew I'd be here because of the calendar App.<eos> Well, yeah, but I'm here because I was invited.<eos> I'm psyched to meet these people, and, to be honest, they are excited to meet me.
It's time to take a break.<eos> Let's all reconvene in one hour.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Genuine Thought is a database with millions of essays.<eos> It helps schools identify possible plagiarism.<eos> Mr. Ecklund, have you read Grace's essay?<eos> I have.<eos> So then you know that this is intensely personal.<eos> Do you seriously think that other essays in that database contain the same family history?<eos> Mrs. Florrick, many students write about the challenges they've overcome.
Dear God, I'm falling apart.<eos> All right, Genuine Thought... it's big business in the fight against student plagiarism.<eos> The software designers have acknowledged they're having problems with false positives, which is why the company has settled a few lawsuits last year.<eos> Wait, false positives how?<eos> It might tag a section as plagiarism when, in fact, it's just a phrase in common usage.<eos> For example, in one paper they flagged, "there's not enough money to go around," or "according to conventional wisdom"<eos> as plagiarized, when in fact they're just sort of clichés.<eos> Unoriginal, but not plagiarized.<eos> - So, what do I do?<eos> - Well, you need to find out what they're saying is plagiarized.

Given that I cannot find<eos> - enough evidence to definitively rule - _ that Mr. Dargis's business suffered from gun violence specifically...<eos> Your Honor, before you rule...<eos> Ms. Lockhart, I feel like I've been more than fair here.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Uh, but please, if you could just grant us a brief recess,<eos> I believe we can offer you the definitive proof that you're looking for.<eos> Hotel owners, restaurateurs, valet companies, gift shops.<eos> They all say their business is down in the same period, by roughly the same amount<eos> - They can all show verified losses from gun crimes?
That was not my question.<eos> I want to know if traffic through O'Hare figures into your tourism statistics for Chicago.<eos> That's not something I can confirm or deny.<eos> Sure. I mean, you're only the Chief Economist for Chicago's Chamber of Commerce.<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Withdrawn.<eos> Don't most large cities measure tourism or growth of tourism based on hotel occupancy rates and rates per day?<eos> - I don't know what most cities do.<eos> - And yet, uh,<eos> Chicago inflates its numbers by including people just passing through the airport, even if they're just catching
She's going to have to.<eos> That's it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wow. I think your office has more square footage than mine.<eos> I feel like I've arrived.<eos> You look it.<eos> Put your feet up.<eos> Are the associates still hating you?<eos> Let's see.<eos> No, they've come around.
Now that you did, she may have information that could help.<eos> Whatever it is, she's worried that it might get her in trouble, that's why she brought you.<eos> Is whatever she did less bad than what she thinks happened to Dr. Bader?<eos> By about a thousand miles.<eos> All right, I can't make any promises, but if that's true, I'm sure Ms. Monahan's cooperation will be taken into account, and I'd throw whatever support I could that way.<eos> A few weeks ago, Vince came to me with a problem.<eos> He had been selling narcotics out of his practice to drug dealers.<eos> Oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine.<eos> He tell you the dealers' names?<eos> He told me it started out small-- he just needed to make some extra money on the side-- but then they kept wanting more and they threatened to hurt him if he stopped.
His wife said he had his gym bag with him the morning he disappeared.<eos> It hasn't turned up.<eos> I just verified for myself that he never made it here.<eos> It's possible he met with foul play between his office and here.<eos> It's also possible that he never intended to go to the gym.<eos> The bag might have contained extra clothes.<eos> He might not fit the profile of a cheating husband, but he might be a runaway husband.<eos> Especially if he recently broke off business with drug traffickers.<eos> So you got my message.<eos> If they intended him harm, he might be on the lam.
Have a seat.<eos> Some information's come to light about Dr. Bader's murder.<eos> It could have an impact on your practice, so... we thought you ought to know.<eos> His wife told me that he was killed in a... doomsday bunker.<eos> That another prepper killed him.<eos> We believe that that's what the killer intended us to think.<eos> Your partner had gotten himself involved with a group of pill traffickers called the Silver Rail.<eos> We have reason to think he tried to break things off with them but couldn't.<eos> You think Vince was killed by drug dealers?<eos> We would have thought that, except they didn't know he was dead.
Is that the spirit of that statute?<eos> Hep!<eos> Who here has a law degree?<eos> He is being denied simply because his brain is different than most people.<eos> Same reason why I couldn't get a license to operate a crane.<eos> What now?<eos> Anyway... let's forget the contract claims.<eos> If the Megan Dodd Pediatric Wing is going to be a reality<eos> I'm gonna have to lean on these fat cats to give in or face the consequences.<eos> They'll have to watch your commercial on a loop?
We're done here.<eos> Man, he is messed up.<eos> (whirring)<eos> Welcome to Camp Hasley.<eos> We appreciate your help with our project.<eos> Our pleasure, Major Janeway.<eos> Uh, question.<eos> Are there any monkeys on the base?<eos> Okay, don't embarrass us in front of the Marines.<eos> They make me very uncomfortable.
Luckily, both our prongs,<eos> Cabe and the bowl, are in the same compound.<eos> On the counterfeit bowl prong:<eos> whether we copy it or not depends on the kind of organic material we're talking about.<eos> This.<eos> The type of clay-laden soil used to make the bowl.<eos> It's only found here in this area of Africa.<eos> Okay, so, we need to reconfigure the software in the printer, Sylvester?<eos> On it.<eos> I'll adjust the output jets so that they're compatible with the clay.
(screeches)<eos> (shouts)<eos> Uh, not good.<eos> I don't think anybody heard.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> The guards won't kill you because I'm gonna kill you first.<eos> Okay, Paige, uh, you got to stretch those 30 seconds.<eos> Sly just broke the bowl.<eos> We've got to do some surgery.<eos> They broke the bowl?
But I don't have to tell you that, do I?<eos> Good luck, Erin.<eos> I guess I wasn't all that hungry anyway.<eos> But maybe you are.<eos> You weren't 100% honest with us last night, were you?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I think you had more than breakfast, lunch and dinner on the menu.<eos> Alex K is a known drug dealer.<eos> He came to your place with a beef.<eos> Now, you're trying to tell me that if we bring the dogs in, they're not gonna find anything?
Look...<eos> Right now, we're in battle mode.<eos> You need to assume anything suspicious is part of the greater threat.<eos> Why would someone come at me like this?<eos> [Sighing] ELENA: I don't have many memories of my parents.<eos> Just flashes.<eos> My mom's smile.<eos> The smell of my dad's shirts.<eos> Mostly just... this feeling of being safe.<eos> Those memories, that's all that I have and they mean everything to me.

[Clatter] Think anyone else was involved?<eos> No, the Spanish Pack wants Eduardo's head on a pike as much as I do.<eos> He's loyal to his family but those numbers are dwindling.<eos> Hang on...<eos> Receipt from that storage place where we cornered Pablo.<eos> Unit 56.<eos> Pablo wasn't just trapped there.<eos> They were using it.<eos> Maybe they still are. Not for long.<eos> NICK: You know, reality TV makes these places seem a lot more interesting than they really are.
Cracking Russian records is next to impossible.<eos> We have to find out what's going on in Mother Russia.<eos> You know who to phone.<eos> Are they here?<eos> I have brought six men with me.<eos> Not enough.<eos> Send for more.<eos> That is difficult.<eos> The districts are grumbling about money again.<eos> They will need... convincing.
You swear no strings?<eos> Yeah, I mean, I already have a girlfriend. So...<eos> Oh, sorry. I forgot.<eos> Front's full.<eos> Would you mind, uh...<eos> What the hell?<eos> ♪ Criminal Minds 11x20 ♪ Inner Beauty Original Air Date on April 13, 2016<eos> "I imagine one of the reasons<eos> "people cling to their hates so stubbornly<eos> "is because they sense once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain."
Take a look at this label.<eos> Looks pretty good.<eos> Except for one thing,<eos> Pertuzumab is spelled with an S, instead of with a Z.<eos> - Counterfeit.<eos> - Indeed.<eos> All of these pills contain the drugs they're supposed to be, but they also contain sugar.<eos> So the bad guys cut it to stretch out the inventory. That's the scam.<eos> Precisely.<eos> And FYI, there have been at least nine local deaths in the last year all associated with counterfeit meds, and nobody could determine where they were coming from.
Oh. Hello, Tom. Hey, buddy.<eos> - Is he a service dog?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Good to know.<eos> So, what are we doing here?<eos> Lawyering by loitering?<eos> Yes.<eos> Really?<eos> Yes, since you won't tell us why you're targeting the governor, we're going to question the witnesses as they leave.<eos> They won't talk to you.
We got to fix that...<eos> Might have acquired a quick infusion of cash.<eos> He did.<eos> And did Lloyd Garber provide that money?<eos> He bundled it for us, yes.<eos> And you had struggles with Eli Gold, too, didn't you?<eos> Eli Gold had some issues with me because I replaced him as campaign manager.<eos> Well, let's talk about Eli Gold for a second.<eos> Candidates don't come into your life like newborn babies.<eos> They're not clean and pure.
Then how do you plan on using it?<eos> That depends on where Veronica's money is.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Is it always like this here?<eos> Pretty much.<eos> Diane thinks the firm needs to be defined.<eos> It needs an identity.<eos> She's not wrong.<eos> All-service firms tend to do too much.<eos> No one knows what they're about.
Asian fetish?<eos> No, that's you.<eos> What can I say?<eos> I likes what I likes.<eos> Damn!<eos> Ken, I feel that you and I are friends.<eos> Really?<eos> We're gonna have that argument again?<eos> I just found out that once a year, all managers at Welltopia get an evaluation based on the collective feedback of their subordinates.<eos> Oh, man, they're gonna crush you.

"Employees find him barely tolerable.<eos> Communication skills need significant improvement.<eos> Overall behavior leaves much to be desired."<eos> Well, maybe next year you'll try harder.<eos> This is so much better then I expected.<eos> Really?<eos> Hell yeah.<eos> Look at this.<eos> "As a leader, he is wildly out of touch with his employees."<eos> They love me!
Well, you're good at it.<eos> Oh, it's just easy.<eos> Just push. Uh, would you pass the green beans, Sheriff?<eos> Yeah. How about you, uh, you call me Alex, Norman?<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you, Alex.<eos> Now, I'd love it if you told me all about the... the motel, Norman.<eos> You know, what you do and how it works so I could help out if you need it.<eos> Oh, it's really very simple.<eos> People check in and then they check out.
Can we not?<eos> I need to win this court case so I can clear away the mess of my life and start fresh.<eos> Well, my cab is waiting, so if you wouldn't mind signing my form.<eos> - Are you married?<eos> - I was married for 26 years.<eos> Now I'm divorced.<eos> Potential Juror number 11, before your divorce, did you and your husband ever seek any kind of counseling or therapy?<eos> Yes, we did.<eos> Have you ever heard of the defendants?<eos> Only that they wrote a smutty book.
You've done too much already.<eos> Excuse me, um...<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Mom, Dad, you know Betty.<eos> Betty lives down the hall.<eos> I water the plants when she's away.<eos> But you're not away.<eos> I got mixed up. I thought that... you were going to visit your parents.<eos> Oh, no. Yeah, no, I... Uh, they came to visit me, so...<eos> But they're, uh, going on a gambling cruise this morning.
We treated a man a couple of weeks ago with a predilection for his wife's high heels.<eos> - Wearing them?<eos> - Copulating with them.<eos> He'll make a compelling case study for the new book.<eos> What?<eos> Too bad you're wearing that.<eos> I'd take you to the party, but it's black tie.<eos> Isn't Saks just around the corner?<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Well, I think they're all down for the count.
Okay, well, adultery is against the law, so they plan on portraying you as a criminal.<eos> For committing a crime that hasn't been prosecuted in 100 years?<eos> If they want to bring this in, it's going to get in.<eos> Look, it'll be worse for her than it is for you.<eos> Adultery sticks to a woman more than a man.<eos> You're a doctor who works long hours with a gorgeous woman.<eos> You study sex together.<eos> Of course you dabbled.<eos> No one will blame you.<eos> You know, it'll forever be what people think of when they hear Masters and Johnson.
She's strong-willed.<eos> Mm. He's just like his mother.<eos> I had a dream my folks were here again.<eos> Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.<eos> No, it wasn't a sad dream this time.<eos> Well, who cried?<eos> 'Cause someone always ends up crying.<eos> No one.<eos> Not even me.<eos> I mean, they still rejected me, rejected us, but when they left, I waved good-bye and they blew me a kiss.
I find it nauseating.<eos> And sometimes arousing.<eos> But mostly, I find it shameful and abhorrent.<eos> We would recommend, Bob, before beginning any kind of sexual therapy...<eos> That you speak with a psychiatrist.<eos> We find in cases where there's latent homosexuality...<eos> I am not a homosexual.<eos> I read your books.<eos> Men have impotence for all sorts of reasons.<eos> Their parents are too strict, or they go to church too many times.

- Yeah, give or take a 7.<eos> - So what about your dad?<eos> - How many revenants did he...?<eos> - Not enough.<eos> Ah. Well now, they're gonna have to deal with you.<eos> Right after you deal with the shit ton of paperwork you generated after last night's disastrous takedown.<eos> OK. Like, one blonde broke a heel, and I was trying to smoke the revenant.<eos> Aaah! Our number 1 priority is to keep the public<eos> - from learning they exist.<eos> - People here deserve to know what they're up against, even if most of these people
I got a good feeling about you.<eos> And I'm an excellent judge of character.<eos> Sweetheart... you really aren't.<eos> Only Peacemaker puts 'em down for good.<eos> Long as I hit 'em between the eyes.<eos> Oh! And revenants can't physically hold it.<eos> Not without vibrating faster than a... You know.<eos> I have my toys; you have yours.<eos> Anyway.<eos> Regular guns can slow the revheads down, but they will always come back for more until they meet Peacemaker, which only I can handle...
Remember when Mama made these windchimes?<eos> Do you remember?<eos> This was a home then.<eos> Never saw anything scarier than an albino gopher.<eos> Until the attack where half of us died.<eos> Oh, hey, Marshal Dolls!<eos> How old were you when the revenants invaded the homestead?<eos> - 12.<eos> - 6.<eos> - And they'd never done it before?

They can't.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> - I hope so.<eos> - OK, a mute's voice,<eos> - an innocent killer; what's next?<eos> - Now, these things usually come in threes, mundus triformis.<eos> - It's a kind of paradox, like cold fire, the living dead.<eos> I'll keep my eyes open for a zombie wearing an icy-hot patch.<eos> Come on, Earp, this ain't no joke.<eos> If the revenants escape, they can scatter to the four corners of the world, ignite a shit storm of rape, murder, pillaging.
You behind the desk, follow 'em.<eos> Get him off the floor!<eos> Now!<eos> We're close, boys!<eos> Marty, move your ass, find the vault.<eos> Gary, you help him.<eos> Alone?<eos> Why are we not going in there and shooting these bastards?<eos> Do the odds.<eos> You think we can subdue all three before they kill anyone?
I got to get to Doc Sugarman to either fix this or give me a fistful of Percodan.<eos> You stay and gripe.<eos> You're gonna run someone off the road.<eos> I will drive you.<eos> Easy, easy.<eos> I'm gonna take this.<eos> For evidence.<eos> Do you think this will still pick up our conversation if it's not right at the top of the bag?<eos> Keller says we have to get these people on tape if we want to pursue a patent infringement.<eos> What if we tell them we're both hard of hearing, and they have to speak up?
It's obvious how they got it.<eos> You left it on the bureau last night. a pair of charlatans, two therapists posing as patients to steal our material.<eos> Which means we need stricter screening procedures for all potential new patients, and our lawyer advised us to get signed copies of this from all staff members by the beginning of next week.<eos> That includes Guy and Lester.<eos> A non-disclosure agreement?<eos> Is that really necessary? Well, the last thing we want is somebody coming to work at the clinic, and then leaving with our work and starting a rival business.<eos> No. No, of course that makes sense.<eos> I'm surprised the phone didn't wake you this morning.<eos> My parents called at 6:00 to give their customary eight-hours notice.<eos> They're coming to St. Louis, staying through the weekend, and for some reason, my father is insisting that they stay in a hotel, so at least it won't be a problem for us to stay in the house together.
They have chartered a helicopter to pick us up in a hippy-free field 1/2 mile down the road.<eos> I'm gonna stay, actually.<eos> What? In a traffic jam?<eos> No.<eos> Allison and her friends are walking to the festival.<eos> It's 35 miles away.<eos> You know, in the last few days, I have begun registering for night classes, and in six years I will be a lawyer.<eos> In the meantime, I can keep my job with Herb, and I can keep my slot in the carpool.<eos> When did my dreams get so small?<eos> They're not small. They're... they're... reasonable.

It's practically a health drink.<eos> Is Daddy upstairs in the room?<eos> No, he's off somewhere, planning his new life as an old bachelor.<eos> Mom, I'm-I'm so sorry.<eos> - I can't imagine...<eos> - What a relief it is?<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> No one understands their parents.<eos> Doesn't matter what age they are.<eos> They always look at them from the point of view of a child.
That's all.<eos> The redhead?<eos> That sucks.<eos> When I started playing, I had all these musician friends.<eos> And, you know, we'd hang, and we'd jam together.<eos> We grew up together, you know.<eos> And then I started booking gigs, selling out those gigs, and, you know, I had the fans and the girls, and it was fantastic.<eos> It was everything we had hoped for.<eos> It was... It was everything we had talked about, you know?<eos> And then when I went to share it with them... they weren't there.

Okay, so I'm checking on the dessert bar assignments I gave everyone.<eos> Earl, did you call your cousin at that liquor distributor about getting us a discount?<eos> Now, why would I call him?<eos> I owe him $10,000 and a kidney.<eos> So that's a "not yet."<eos> I haven't done my thing, either.<eos> Caroline, with all your money from Hollywood, you could pay other people to do this stuff... and also replace the transmission on a 2012 Yaris.<eos> We have to save all our movie money for the dessert bar.<eos> Believe it or not, my boobs can't get us zoning permits.<eos> But they did get us kicked out of an architect's office.
And...<eos> Look at that.<eos> Amen.<eos> Thank you for waiting.<eos> Mm-hmm. You want to know what I was praying for?<eos> No, that's all right.<eos> Throw pillows.<eos> Thousands of them just raining from the sky.<eos> - I do not understand their purpose.<eos> - They have so many purposes.

And to see people whose appreciation of that is undiminished is kind of thrilling.<eos> [Michael] One of the things people around the world use their weekends for is to go to church and to worship.<eos> The Martu people are no different in that sense.<eos> Though they generally spend much of their week living in modern houses and eating food from modern kitchens, on weekends they go out to the country to reconnect to their land and their traditions, which revolve around the primacy of fire.<eos> They burn the land to revive it and make hunting easier.<eos> They cook their catch in the most elemental way possible, and they even celebrate the spirit of the flame with a baptism by fire.<eos> [Kumpaya in Martu Wangka] Now, you'll be smoked.<eos> You all right. Good one, good one.<eos> [women speaking Martu Wangka] [baby wailing]<eos> [Nola speaking English] We always smoke the little baby when they're born... to be, um, healthy and to stop them from crying.
After we burn, we go out hunting for kangaroos and bush turkey.<eos> A lot of animals scavenge around that area after the burn.<eos> In the old days, hunting took a lot of work, with spears and boomerangs and fire.<eos> But now we got a... an air rifle, .22, it's easier.<eos> [Michael] I think anyone who eats meat needs to go hunting once, to see how they feel about it.<eos> If you hunt, you're gonna... you're gonna treat that meat with respect.<eos> [Curtis] Yeah, good shot, good shot, good shot.<eos> [Michael] It's thrilling to bring in the big game, and it's high prestige, and it's high risk, but the relation of risk and reward is very different for men, I think, than for women.<eos> Among the Martu, the men go out with guns and they hunt bush turkey and kangaroos, you know, the high prestige foods that are hard to get.<eos> And often, they come home empty-handed.
[Michael] You know, behind every electric outlet, even behind every microwave oven, there is somewhere a fire burning, probably of fossil fuel, but it's hidden from us.<eos> Here we see it. It's just right in front of us.<eos> Because the Martu are a people who, until recently, owed their very survival to open fire.<eos> [Kumpaya in Martu Wangka] We didn't know about non-Martu people's fire.<eos> We had our fire.<eos> Everywhere we burn.<eos> [Michael] In 1963, the Australians were about to rain fire down on the Martu in the form of missile tests.<eos> But thankfully, somebody checked out the target area and found that there was a group of native Australians living on it, who'd been living entirely off the land for tens of thousands of years.<eos> After this first contact with the Martu, the white Australians herded them into missions and boarding schools.<eos> And it's only been in the last dozen years or so that they've gotten the right to return to their lands.
If it comes to you turned into a chicken nugget, you can completely lose sight of the fact that there was a chicken at the beginning of that process.<eos> And to my mind, the dark side of Southern barbecue now is that it's all based on commodity pork.<eos> These are hogs raised in confinement in really brutal conditions.<eos> They never go outdoors, the sows live in narrow crates, and they're just impregnated litter after litter after litter.<eos> They still have a desire to suck, and they will do that on each other's tails and they'll get infected. So the farmers cut the tails off.<eos> I've been in these buildings, and they're a vision of hell.<eos> They really are.<eos> We've hidden meat and our transaction with animals behind the high walls of these abattoirs and feedlots. We don't have to deal with the karmic costs.<eos> Most of the meat eating we do, I have a lot of trouble justifying.<eos> But I have visited enough farms where I have seen animals living the kinds of lives they should live and that they have what farmers like to say, "One bad day."
[Michael] Barbecue crosses race in the South in very interesting ways, even in the days before integration.<eos> Barbecue was very closely tied to the tobacco harvest.<eos> When you were bringing in the tobacco, it was a very intense time on the farm and everybody worked, white and black, because it had to be done quickly when the leaves were perfect.<eos> And then you needed to dry them as quickly as you could, so you built a big fire.<eos> So, it only made sense that where you had all those coals, and you had so many people around, and it was a 24-hour process, that, um, you would do a pig.<eos> And Ed said it was the only time, um, at that point, in the life of the South, where blacks and whites sat down together and ate.<eos> [Ed] Only two things I've seen to bring people together in such a way was, uh, barbecuing, and, of course, my experience in going to Vietnam.<eos> We all would be, uh... crouched together, you know, for fear of a rocket, mortar or something coming in, and... didn't make any difference, man.<eos> You watch my back and I watch yours, you know.<eos> People are at their best when, um... I guess, when they realize that they are... they really are connected.

Um...<eos> [Seth clears throat]<eos> "Law number four, There can be bumps and detours."<eos> "But every twist is actually leading towards true love."<eos> "Law number five."<eos> "Upon true love being achieved, the drama will be reset."<eos> "Character's memories will be wiped clean in preparation for their next drama so that they can fall in love for the first time again and again, and again."

Loading ink cartridges and listening to idiots?<eos> Sure.<eos> You must miss teaching.<eos> I miss a lot of things.<eos> I'm a teacher, too.<eos> Ethics, morality, religious studies.<eos> But only to college students, never high school.<eos> Well, then you're missing something.<eos> Lighting them up for the first time.<eos> That age where they're so passionate.
And neither is Mom.<eos> You've both completely lost your ability to have fun.<eos> Great.<eos> Great.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Come on, guys, delete the photos.<eos> Or what?<eos> Your mom and her fascist goons will hunt me down?<eos> Fascism is the direct opposite of a representative democracy, which you happen to be lucky enough to live in thanks to people like our mother who defend it every single day.<eos> And by the way, you attacking and trying to silence people because they don't agree with what you think kind of makes you the fascist.
It's just, uh-- it's just the stress.<eos> It's been really tough these last few months.<eos> - Is there anyone you'd like to call?<eos> Maybe Grace's father, or--<eos> - I wouldn't know who to call.<eos> - You don't know who the father is?<eos> - It's not so much a matter of who.<eos> It's more which.<eos> There were a couple guys.<eos> because they all bailed when I told them I was pregnant, so--and then my parents, they thought I should terminate.
Let's get another head CT and page pediatric neurology. - This is what you were talking about, huh?<eos> - Yes, seizures can be a part of her condition.<eos> - How long will she have 'em?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Her whole life?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> [baby crying]<eos> - That woman has a long road ahead of her.<eos> They both do.<eos> - You know, there are maybe 17 different agencies ready to jump in when they suspect abuse.
Diaz.<eos> Hey, how's your sister doing by the way?<eos> She still a part of that Chinese gang that kills people?<eos> Yeah. She's still part of the Quantou.<eos> Look, I wish you would cut my cousin some slack.<eos> I wish you would take your job more seriously.<eos> I wish you two would quit bickering about petty little differences all the time and try working together.<eos> So sorry, Didi.<eos> I mean, this home invasion crew is pulling jobs at a steady rate, you guys.<eos> Okay, and I'm guessing that we don't have a lot of time before they kill somebody else.
Oh, yeah, trust me, I know what you mean.<eos> Sometimes I'll be in a club and I meet a girl and I'll be like, damn!<eos> Then after the club when the lights come on I'll be like damn!<eos> Damn! Give me my badge.<eos> Stupid.<eos> He stole a stolen watch and we let him go.<eos> Our killer celebrates a score by going to an illegal club wearing a watch from a murder victim?<eos> I mean, it's just a dumb move.<eos> You know, pros usually keep a low profile.<eos> I mean, these guys are good but maybe they're not a professional crew, maybe...
I mean, these guys are good but maybe they're not a professional crew, maybe...<eos> Carter, we are at a dead end.<eos> It's late...<eos> Carter.<eos> Robbery-homicide.<eos> Two victims.<eos> No witnesses, no prints.<eos> Five home security cameras caught nothing.<eos> The killers must have known their locations and area of coverage.<eos> It's the same crew, they're all over the city.
It's called Venetian plaster, Sgraffito.<eos> Right-right. Uh, Parisian pasta porcino.<eos> It's a technique.<eos> An artistry, if you're good.<eos> High-power polish, small arcs with a trowel...<eos> Uh, that movement would create a reverse pattern of what we see on the photo.<eos> This guy's a lefty.<eos> Didi, I got something for you.<eos> So I talked to the contractors from all five houses.<eos> And all used the same Parisian pasta porcino guy, didn't they?
Come on!<eos> Could've told me you commandeered all our friends.<eos> There was no commandeering here.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> 'Cause we split everything else in half.<eos> - They reached out to me.<eos> - Mm.<eos> I bet you loved that.<eos> Am I not likeable?<eos> They like you.
- Sorry.<eos> - it's all true.<eos> Guys!<eos> You're alive.<eos> Respect that.<eos> Not everybody is.<eos> This room is full of dead people.<eos> I know it's easy to forget, but come on.<eos> Something happened to them... a mistake, a disease, a stupid twist of fate.<eos> They left their bodies here for us to learn from, to become better.
I mean, I haven't seen her in six years.<eos> to become who we always wanted to be.<eos> We can leave our past behind.<eos> You sure you're ready for this?<eos> Or we can learn from it.<eos> and honor it.<eos> Hi, David.<eos> we can decide it's never too late to change.<eos> These people don't have that chance.<eos> They left it to you.

Should weigh just about the same.<eos> Who knew that chocolate tastes best in egg form?<eos> Sid!<eos> Yeah!<eos> We got 'em all!<eos> Aw, Clint!<eos> Finally got off your cottontail just to bite me in the back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Those traps are on a hare-trigger.<eos> One goes off, they all go off!
I am not your miracle.<eos> Could you just put me down?<eos> We can't panic like this.<eos> We've gotta panic like this!<eos> We're never gonna see our eggs again!<eos> We gotta build him that ship.<eos> I know you're worried about your families.<eos> I've been there. But my guys always come through.<eos> Look! It's them!<eos> They're back!
An eye for an eye.<eos> And, Diego, bring me that baby alive.<eos> Go! Go!<eos> That's his herd right up the hill.<eos> We should return him.<eos> Manny!<eos> Name's Diego, friend.<eos> Manfred, and I'm not your friend.<eos> If you're looking for the humans, you're wasting your time.<eos> They left this morning.

- I made a mistake!<eos> Then fix it.<eos> How?<eos> Seize the moment by the balls.<eos> Stop him.<eos> Excuse me. Excuse me.<eos> Do you have a... Oh.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> The boys?<eos> They're fine.
Step right in, ma'am.<eos> Good news, you can drive this beauty off the lot, no money down, no payments for a year.<eos> How do we do it?<eos> We're crazy, is how!<eos> So, what's up?<eos> Well, last night Roscoe mentioned that there's a lot of tension in your house.<eos> Ah, damn.<eos> He's feeling it, Baxter, and I'm a little worried about him.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I bought him noise-canceling headphones, but they don't cancel Candace.
You're saying that every vampire you ever killed with that sword is now wandering the Earth?<eos> What the hell happened to you?<eos> I'm... not sure.<eos> I woke up in the middle of the road and I saw the bus on fire.<eos> Yeah, you're a real hero, Marty.<eos> Saving half the kids from the accident you caused?<eos> Why do you keep calling me "Marty"?<eos> I burned all their original bodies, which means the Stone's prisoners are in random corpses.<eos> Vampire, human, it doesn't matter.<eos> The spirits fled scattershot into the first dead piece of flesh they could find.
Give Bonnie Bennett my regards.<eos> VALERIE:<eos> Everyone you know has made the choice that serves them best.<eos> Why not make a choice that serves you?<eos> (grunts)<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> (screaming)<eos> When you destroyed the Phoenix Stone, all the souls inside escaped.<eos> The spirits fled into the first dead piece of flesh they could find.
Have a look at this for me, will you?<eos> In the war, we used mathematicians to decode the indecipherable.<eos> I need an expert to cut through the jargon.<eos> Are they keeping something from me?<eos> Well, I wouldn't be unduly concerned about the man's pneumatics.<eos> And, given his age, and he's a smoker. Catarrhal inflammation, it's not that unusual.<eos> But I would be concerned about the bronchoscopy.<eos> They wouldn't have done that unless they were looking for something far more serious.<eos> And they conspicuously fail to mention the results. Instead they go on about the lung resection.<eos> Which they performed because of "structural alterations".
I have two questions.<eos> Who knows the full picture?<eos> Apart from the surgeons?<eos> Perhaps the Prime Minister, sir.<eos> Of course.<eos> But not the queen?<eos> - Nor anyone else in my family?<eos> And the second question?<eos> It's impossible to say, sir.<eos> My understanding is the surgeons did everything they could.
What do we do?<eos> Wait till she dies in the woods?<eos> - Calm down.<eos> - No.<eos> While this bastard's in the warm, my goddaughter's dying in a hole!<eos> I love her like she's my daughter.<eos> She's so precious.<eos> When I came here I was nothing.<eos> Her parents took me in, helped me.<eos> When she was born, they made me her godfather.
He's wrong.<eos> Then save him.<eos> Save him from himself.<eos> I beg you.<eos> - OK, everyone's here.<eos> - OK.<eos> Right.<eos> The cops have been wrong all along.<eos> Protecting the scum that took Justine.<eos> Now they've let him go.
I don't lose clients.<eos> I don't lose, period.<eos> So the Sizz stays where he is.<eos> Well, maybe we can call Sizz now, see what he thinks.<eos> He doesn't know what he thinks.<eos> He's a football player.<eos> You sound very worried, Andre.<eos> Maybe you don't understand your clients as well as you think you do.<eos> Maybe they need somebody who does.<eos> No, what they need is someone to protect and grow their money.

It's me.<eos> Listen, something's wrong.<eos> I found...<eos> The smell in the kitchen nearly knocked me out.<eos> What do you got cooking in those pots?<eos> Oh, this and that-- black licorice, an old belt, splash of feline urine.<eos> Okay, so we're gonna have to get new pots, and I have to get my coffee someplace else today.<eos> The National Council of Sommeliers is embroiled in scandal.<eos> Over the last year, three American sommeliers have authenticated cases of auction wine, which were later proven to be forgeries.<eos> They didn't realize they were drinking cat pee?
That's not less troubling.<eos> Like I said, I'm in real estate.<eos> Sometimes, to make a little extra money, I host no-limit poker games in my empty listings.<eos> Big cash games.<eos> About a week ago, I put together a table at this amazing penthouse.<eos> Seven high rollers.<eos> Some shady types, but all guys I thought I could trust.<eos> The game was going long, so I stepped out to get some more drinks.<eos> While I was gone, two guys in hockey masks stormed in and roughed up my dealer.<eos> They took off with the keys to one of the player's cars, a Bentley, and all the cash.
Sofia.<eos> How did you know?<eos> Uh, your, uh, fingernails, clipped and unpainted, are at odds with your carefully applied mascara and lip tint, but necessitated by your profession.<eos> And also your periorbital hematoma is yellowing, so... it's about a week old.<eos> Lin told you what happened at the game?<eos> She was outside when the robbery occurred, and you were inside.<eos> Very much like to discuss what you saw.<eos> It was about 2:00 a.m.<eos> A few players were almost down to the felt, but they're all hanging in, when these two guys-- they were both in hockey masks-- they kicked the door in.<eos> They had these shiny little guns, and they fired warning shots into the ceiling.
What?<eos> Something on my tie?<eos> No, I was just thinking you look... different.<eos> Oh, lost a few pounds.<eos> I mean, you look different than you did when you were standing over here.<eos> There's something weird about the light.<eos> Aside from the fact it casts a cooler hue, you'd never know there's a tiny little spy camera in there.<eos> Yes, I would.<eos> I'm pretty sure that the signal range was enough to reach local Wi-Fi.<eos> So the thieves could see the room they were about to storm into.
They were really sick of that van.<eos> Could've spared us all the cloak and dagger by just explaining why you were confiscating the footage.<eos> Anything I said would've been a lie, so it seemed better not to say anything.<eos> "Omission is the most powerful form of lie."<eos> Yeah, we get a lot of George Orwell quotes around here.<eos> Uh, I'm a fan of "Four legs good, two legs bad."<eos> I'm guessing you're not here to wax poetic about 20th century authors.<eos> I find nothing poetic about a government agency watching passively as two Turkish agents rob, maim and murder American citizens.<eos> You mean the Celik brothers.<eos> You expect me to believe that the NSA is surveilling them because they are not spies?
After you visited the smoke shop,<eos> Szofi and her pals requested extraction.<eos> They're on a flight to Istanbul in seven hours.<eos> Congratulations, Holmes.<eos> You just helped three spies get away with murder.<eos> I think I know why the NSA gave us the footage of the robbery back; there's nothing in here that we don't already know.<eos> Still, good to be reminded of the dangers of bashing your friends with Hungarian weapons.<eos> Is it just me or are Szofi and the Celik brothers awfully careless for spies?<eos> I wish I was in a position to judge them more harshly.<eos> But absent the discovery of fresh evidence, it appears that they are three and a half hours from besting us, and I shall be back to the olfactory grind of sniffing out wine fraud.

I will be unable to sully my sinuses with fluoride and flavorants until that case is complete.<eos> I do not intend to fail in my duties twice in a row.<eos> Well, maybe they will beat us, but it'll be an ugly win.
And as the star, I say what it should be.<eos> Come on, Leila.<eos> This is crazy, right?<eos> She's only got followers because she came out as intersex.<eos> People want to know what that's like.<eos> Not what she puts on her lips.<eos> Well, you know, kids these days do seem to like their Kardashian shows.<eos> It's like she's afraid to open up and let people in.<eos> Well, you know, sometimes people are too stubborn to let others know what they're going through.<eos> Well, maybe they need to talk if they ever hope to deal with it.
Midnight, New Year's Eve.<eos> What possible excuse do you have for majorly ruining this?<eos> Oh, get off your high horse.<eos> I know you just shoved me aside to impress some boy.<eos> Oh, please, like you've never done anything to impress a boy before.<eos> Shane!<eos> This was the only thing making me feel better, and now I feel so much worse.<eos> Friends don't do this.<eos> Real friends look out for you.<eos> They go out of their way for you.
We found these outside NCIS, the morgue, the bar, and other places you frequent.<eos> Including Laurel's apartment.<eos> Someone is after you.<eos> All of us.<eos> Patton did a sweep of the office, Sebastian swept the morgue-- no cameras or listening devices.<eos> All right? Suspects didn't have access inside.<eos> Well, whoever's been watching us has been doing it for a while.<eos> Laurel's safe now, King.<eos> Yeah, well, she should never have been vulnerable.<eos> They went after her to get to me.
Where are we going?<eos> A safe house.<eos> Your bags are in the car.<eos> We're gonna take you out through the back exit.<eos> You coming, too?<eos> I'm staying.<eos> I got to make this right.<eos> I saw all those people who hate you.<eos> You need protection, too.<eos> But they didn't come after me.

Yeah, I prefer the word "thoughtful""<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Thoughtful.<eos> But like you say, we do things different.<eos> And if I hadn't followed Spooner, we would have missed all of this.<eos> But, friend to friend, down the road, your methods are gonna bite you in the ass.<eos> Yeah, well, I'll worry about "down the road" down the road.<eos> Hey, King. NOPD found these.<eos> Militia's been watching these men like they've been watching you.<eos> Yeah, well, whoever they are, they're targets.
You also have a history of defending members of the Militia.<eos> You're counsel of record on a dozen of their outstanding cases.<eos> Including Troy Spooner and the three men he's on the run with.<eos> Everyone is entitled to defense.<eos> What am I looking at?<eos> Targets.<eos> Innocent men.<eos> Likely being hunted by your clients right now.<eos> So arrest my clients.<eos> Don't know where they are.
Hands up!<eos> Cross your ankles!<eos> Just heard from our pal at JSOC.<eos> Got the SEALs transferred safely.<eos> Good work, Hardy.<eos> Not too methodical for you?<eos> It'll do for today.<eos> Wanted to look you in the eye to tell you that six Navy SEALs were awarded commendations for bravery today.<eos> And your men were arrested.<eos> They'll be relocating to this prison soon.

- Adderall.<eos> It'll focus you in.<eos> Welcome to tonight's presidential primary debate between candidates Senator Darren Stringer and Governor Hank Wesley.<eos> The first question goes to Senator Stringer.<eos> Senator, you've been very critical of the Governor's military service.<eos> Hey, uh, I can't really, um... I can't really talk right now, but, um, I'm about to run out of those vitamins that you gave me.<eos> So, did you guys get to meet the candidates?<eos> Stringer seems like a real tool.<eos> You say you stood in the line of fire.<eos> No. They just breezed right by us.
Pupils are dilated.<eos> I bet you if I checked your heart rate, you'd be over 100.<eos> Why don't you save your diagnosing for the hospital?<eos> Fine.<eos> Plain English, you're acting like a dick.<eos> Hmm. And you have B.O.<eos> What are you popping...<eos> Moda, Rids, Adderall?<eos> That's the thing about drug addicts...<eos> They see kindred spirits where they don't exist.
Let's line him up, start fluids running, please.<eos> Sats down to 60 and reduced breath sounds on the left.<eos> - He's gonna need a...<eos> - Chest tube.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Move.<eos> Dr. Rorish, I need Senator Stringer moved to a secure area.<eos> - It's not gonna happen.<eos> - I'm not asking.<eos> None of these patients are moving anywhere until they've been stabilized.

Your people are so tired of foreigners, of fighting.<eos> Fighting and unrest incited by England for centuries.<eos> And now I'm the potential tyrant?<eos> I'm the one to fear?<eos> Gideon, I need time.<eos> It will take years for your people to trust you.<eos> Days.<eos> Something has happened and I need to fix it to show my Protestant nobles that I am Scotland's queen and not a Catholic despot.<eos> You are moving north towards my most powerful lords.<eos> The Lords of the Congregation, if they turn to Elizabeth...
Mercenary.<eos> You cannot blame me for something I didn't do.<eos> God knows the truth, and if you trade my life for your gain, it will forever mark your soul.<eos> Take him back to the dungeon.<eos> I can't win.<eos> Protestants hate me because I am Catholic, and everyone else mistrusts me because I am French.<eos> What a fearful, angry man.<eos> But there is no proof that he is to blame.<eos> Mary, you rushed back to court, ahead of the English contingent, to win over your Protestant lords.<eos> If you don't give them justice for their dead, they will turn to Elizabeth.
- Where are you going?<eos> - To tell the council my decision.<eos> You have a responsibility to this nation and to your family.<eos> No, I don't. I can't do it.<eos> I feel nothing, I am nothing!<eos> You never say such things.<eos> You foolish boy, you need to grow up.<eos> I didn't work this hard for nothing.<eos> Charles, look at me.<eos> You show your enemies such weakness, and they will keep coming.
Not to be spared.<eos> Per the king.<eos> Everyone clear?<eos> Then let's move.<eos> I have a message from King Charles.<eos> He wanted it delivered in private.<eos> Yes, what is it?<eos> What's all this?<eos> King's men.<eos> They must have come for the Knights.

If you care about your sister, you won't give her reason to misstep.<eos> And if I care about my sister, what do I do about you?<eos> Play all sides as you have always done, but be sure to stay on mine, because Mary's rule will not last.<eos> Scotland could be the first true democracy since the Greeks, and you could be its first leader.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> I had to deliver some terrible news.<eos> Melaniee.<eos> Who are you really?<eos> For a moment, I was Melaniee, wasn't I?<eos> People see what they want to see.
A girl during the plague.<eos> Others, too, in the shadows.<eos> Well, that was just exhaustion and...<eos> And what?<eos> It wasn't grief.<eos> I've seen souls I barely knew.<eos> Have you seen others?<eos> Francis?<eos> No.<eos> But these people, they can teach me.

What's your answer?<eos> I like a practical gift.<eos> How about I send you back with this one's head in a bag?<eos> What'd you think of that for an answer?<eos> I think such an answer would be beneath the dignity of an emir like yourself.<eos> You're a clever one, aren't you?<eos> Where you from, anyway?<eos> New York... but my parents are from Abuja, like yours.<eos> (laughs)<eos> That's why they sent you, 'cause we're both Hausa.
Let's look underground.<eos> Okay, now pull out.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> Look at that.<eos> It's a tunnel.<eos> Nice work, Jane.<eos> Okay, great, guys, we got it.<eos> That tunnel took some serious engineering.<eos> Between this and the SIGINT, signs point to Disah stashing Hijriyyah in there.<eos> FELLOWS: Now, this part's just a theory, but those trucks were there six days ago, and maybe they do a regular resupply.

The first human trial, so they're down to Hail Marys.<eos> Call his wife.<eos> Ask if I can pay him a visit.<eos> On behalf of the nation, I want to thank him for his service.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Take me to Bethesda.<eos> HENRY: Our hypothesis was that the convoy would return to resupply the house.<eos> Looks like we were right.<eos> According to Jose's sources on the ground, several men got out of the trucks, some of them carrying supplies.<eos> They went into the gas station, but they haven't come out.

We want the girls back... all of them.<eos> (crowd cheering and applauding)<eos> (camera shutters clicking)<eos> ...where these young girls have been held prisoner...<eos> NADINE: Very nice work, ma'am.<eos> Thanks, Nadine.<eos> Sure wasn't all me.<eos> The reports so far:<eos> the cease-fire is holding in Northern Cameroon, and the doctors have been going about their work in peace.<eos> They're making good progress containing the outbreak.
It's not like you could get them on your own.<eos> Let's not kid ourselves.<eos> Oh, I'm... I'm getting those votes.<eos> What?<eos> You're just gonna roll up here and make people like you?<eos> - That's right.<eos> I'm doing my speech.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> And they are gonna vote me through the roof when they hear it.
Come on. Let's have a little fun here.<eos> You know, fuck the planet!<eos> Fuck the planet!<eos> Anyway... I...<eos> looked up to Naomi pretty much my entire life, which meant she was looking down on me.<eos> Always with a smile though.<eos> In high school, she was my shoulder to cry on.<eos> She seemed to enjoy that.<eos> Guys and me never worked out.<eos> They'd see Naomi and just... Whoo!
- Excuse me?<eos> - You heard me.<eos> I answered every one of those questions honestly.<eos> I didn't say you didn't.<eos> Well, in that case, I guess you didn't get the memo.<eos> We're in a prison filled with con men.<eos> Everyone here is full of shit.<eos> And the difference between you and them is they know they are.<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> It means that they know they don't have the patience to earn what they want, and that's why they go out and steal it from other people.
Hello, pumpkin.<eos> What exactly is going on here?<eos> Sit down.<eos> Why has the trial been postponed?<eos> According to your commanding officer, you were on board the "Raza" for approximately 3 1/2 months.<eos> That's correct.<eos> But two months in, you lost contact.<eos> I was compromised.<eos> Two members of the crew discovered I was Galactic Authority and planned to kill me.<eos> Evidently they failed.

But there's no reason for you to go down with them.<eos> If you're not gonna help me, you can't blame me for trying to help myself.<eos> What?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> A little late, don't you think?<eos> I made a mistake. I thought I was part of a system that stood for something, but it was all a lie.<eos> You want to prove you're sorry?<eos> Then help us.<eos> So assuming we pull this thing off, and despite my normally super-positive outlook, I am not convinced that we will, we're leaving crew members behind.<eos> We don't even know where they are or what happened to them.
Besides, you've got no choice.<eos> It's been arranged.<eos> The Ishida cruiser is sending a shuttle to pick me up.<eos> When it gets here, we make our move.<eos> - Where's Two?<eos> - In solitary.<eos> - What did she do?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I reached out to my connections.<eos> They'll find out what's going on.
Why do you wish to reactivate her early?<eos> My whole crew is down.<eos> They just collapsed, and I have no idea what happened, and I'm stuck on this ship with three complete strangers, so what the hell am I supposed to do?<eos> I have insufficient data to present a reasonable response.<eos> Hey, have either of you guys seen the others?<eos> Not for a while, why?<eos> I think something's wrong.<eos> Any change?<eos> They're exactly the way I left them.<eos> I mean, they're still breathing, but I can't wake them up, and it's been over an hour.
She's not ready.<eos> She's at a very delicate point in her repair cycle.<eos> Well, then, I guess I'll have to go with my backup plan.<eos> Plan to do what?<eos> The computer recognized a neural imprint that Two uploaded over a year ago.<eos> It used that imprint to establish a link.<eos> Interesting.<eos> It's more than interesting.<eos> It means the memories aren't gone, not completely.<eos> They're just inaccessible.
Please, please sever the link and end this now.<eos> It's over.<eos> Her scan is also normal.<eos> No residual damage from the link, probably thanks to her nanites.<eos> That's one hell of a story, Kid.<eos> I wish I could remember some of it.<eos> Well, I wish I could forget all of it.<eos> What I don't understand is, if our memories were wiped, then how did the link bring them back?<eos> That's the thing.<eos> They were never really wiped.

And most importantly, a safe space for our children to learn and grow.<eos> That sounds very supportive.<eos> We're one big happy family.<eos> What are the... the next steps?<eos> The paperwork you sent looks good.<eos> If we can just ask Laura a few questions, I think we'll be set.<eos> Ask away.<eos> Is there anything you're looking forward to in particular this semester?<eos> Where to start?<eos> Uh, I mean, designing my own curriculum and, uh, just getting to be around people who care about what they're doing.
It's not about the money.<eos> - Yes, it is! - Paul...<eos> You have 80 pairs of unworn socks in your closet<eos> I like wearing new socks.<eos> So what?<eos> That's a luxury you might not be able to afford when we go bankrupt.<eos> Fine, then I'll wash them.<eos> Or wear sandals.<eos> We have 19 employees, Alex.<eos> They have families, mortgages.
I'm an adult, so I'm not allowed.<eos> Well, if it makes you feel any better, I can't do it either.<eos> No, that doesn't make me feel better at all.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Maybe you'll meet somebody tonight.<eos> With a bunch of homeschoolers and their weird parents?<eos> Should we bail?<eos> Think that would set a pretty bad precedent.<eos> True.<eos> But what if they're really weird?
- and she's been sober for two years.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> In your voice just now, did I detect a little compassion for your other mother?<eos> Okay, no.<eos> She has a good reason right now to cut back on risky behavior.<eos> Which reminds me...<eos> I have to get up early<eos> - to drive her to the doctor's office.<eos> - ‭She okay?<eos> Yeah, yeah, but since Gary's parents are adopting the baby, they want her to have more regular care, and so they're paying for a sonogram.
- Sean: All of my clients throw me<eos> - overboard when their ship comes in.<eos> - There were ‭some nasty phone calls.<eos> And when the contract for "Gold Storm" was announced,<eos> Sean sent a bouquet of dead roses over to the house.<eos> Well, that sounds angry.<eos> But that's no motive.<eos> He won't be able to get Chris' commissions now.<eos> You see, that's the irony of running a boutique agency.<eos> I help people climb the ladder they use to abandon me.
What's going on here?<eos> - [Music stop, feedback] - Hello, uh, we're listening to that.<eos> Yeah, well, you don't mind if the L.A.P.D.<eos> has a look around, do you?<eos> Uh, Lieutenant, over here.<eos> I don't think these are green MM's.<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> I have prescriptions for all of those.<eos> And your guests?<eos> Do they all have prescriptions, too, ma'am?
Hey, so, um, did Buzz ever follow up with you on using the partial to identify a witness in his father's murder?<eos> Not yet. ‭<eos> Because I feel like he has a really compelling rationale to go beyond the L.A.P.D. point system.<eos> I'm looking forward to hearing it.<eos> So, what did you find out this morning at your mother's doctor's appointment?<eos> Oh. Well... it's a girl.<eos> You're gonna have a little sister in your life.<eos> Well, you would if she wasn't going to be living with Gary's parents.<eos> Actually, uh, Gary's parents invited my mother to move in with them.<eos> Said that they could all look after the baby together.
You feeling good, Grey?<eos> We practiced it once.<eos> We're about to pull an all-nighter.<eos> Sure. Feeling great.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine, you guys.<eos> We just have to be squirrels about this. Jackson:<eos> Couldn't have heard you correctly there.<eos> Oh, you know, squirrels... they store nuts for the winter, right?<eos> But they don't do it all at once.<eos> They do it one nut at a time.
Don't... Get back in there.<eos> It's fine, it's fine. I'm...<eos> I'm... I'm thinking.<eos> Okay, I just need to think. - You want space. - Yes!<eos> I get it.<eos> I keep asking for space.<eos> People keep not giving it to me, bugging me about hot doctors asking for my number.<eos> And I keep shutting them down because...<eos> Why are we talking about this? Because it's not always the worst thing when people push you.<eos> When people push you, they're trying to help you.
- well, let's do it.<eos> - Just like new?<eos> This is Major Thorpe.<eos> It's great what you did in there.<eos> I'm just glad I saw it.<eos> Well, we said we'll follow up, and we will.<eos> I'd like that... to follow up with you.<eos> That guy definitely just asked for your number.<eos> And that's what flirting looks like.<eos> When babies are born, they usually come out crying like there's no tomorrow.
No, no, no. Don't you talk to me.<eos> Dr. Robbins talks to me.<eos> Dr. Robbins is the "in" guy.<eos> She's the one. These babies are staying in.<eos> Dr. Robbins is "in."<eos> You're keeping them in, right?<eos> It's Charles, right?<eos> Courtney, Charles already made up his mind.<eos> He's partially out, and once he's completely out,<eos> - they all come out.

Okay, fine. Fine, great.<eos> Then I don't deliver Charles' placenta.<eos> After I cut the cord, I sterilize it.<eos> I put it back inside, and we put Mom on antibiotics.<eos> Do you know how dangerous that is?<eos> If that placenta stays in, it could cause an infection, even sepsis.<eos> It puts Mom at risk, all three babies at...<eos> Alex, I am a fetal surgeon!<eos> I know more about this than you do.<eos> I know exactly how they can die.
Look at that.<eos> It is.<eos> How do you like the group?<eos> I expected more freaks.<eos> - It's a weak crop. - Yeah.<eos> I actually kind of miss that about my old school.<eos> There's something weirdly comforting about a bunch of strangers all in one place, pretending to be okay.<eos> You should meet my parents.<eos> Yours too?<eos> They should just cheat and blow it up.
Yeah.<eos> I've, uh, I've been there.<eos> And Harry's a great guy.<eos> I like him, but it's like, these people... the more I feel them judging, the more I clamp up.<eos> I don't want to wear a hat of shame.<eos> I... totally know how you feel.<eos> - Yeah? - Yeah.<eos> Yes.<eos> I mean, it's really intimidating.<eos> They're very close.

You don't need their approval.<eos> I know.<eos> You're right.<eos> - Hi. - Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sure.<eos> These guys have ambition and drive.<eos> They're gonna make it.
Gage Dean, are you in here?<eos> There. We did something.<eos> - Wire cutter.<eos> I just need a description of your husband, ma'am.<eos> Ex-husband.<eos> I know the guy.<eos> I'm just gonna start looking...<eos> The only way to get through the doors right now is with one of these badges.<eos> My men will fan out from peds.<eos> They'll take it room by room.
My dad's journal said he had an appointment here.<eos> Whatever he was looking for to destroy magic must be in this room.<eos> Start with these.<eos> Read every page and then re-read it.<eos> Because whatever my dad was looking for, he never found it.<eos> And you really think we can?<eos> We have to.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Henry, w-what did you find?<eos> These books, they all look exactly like my Story Book.

Same kind of plastic bag and tape.<eos> Sorry.<eos> The same as in 2005 or on the other victim? Both.<eos> No signs of forced entry.<eos> All points to the same offender.<eos> Did you get hold of Clive Bonn. Yep.<eos> He claims to have never met or even heard of Carol Fincher or Liz Harper.<eos> And what about the other suspects from the 2005 investigation?<eos> Well, we've got hold of pretty much all of them.<eos> They've been questioned and written off.
You just wanna hear me say that I... murdered her.<eos> So why don't you have the guts to ask me to my face, Detective?<eos> Did you kill your wife?<eos> No.<eos> - Looks like he's telling the truth.<eos> - And it's on the record.<eos> I mean, I know he that he passed the lie detector test, but it's just... something... something's not right.<eos> Well, I can't tell you whether Robert's guilty or not, but the one thing I'm certain of are your instincts.<eos> Now people can beat lie detectors, especially if they're pathological liars.<eos> They do it so often there's no physiological response to lying.
Which would work if I hadn't torched his phone.<eos> What the hell?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> It's Granny.<eos> Something's happened in Storybrooke.<eos> My parents, Hook, and your sister were pulled through some kind of portal.<eos> Again?<eos> To where?<eos> Granny is an expert on lasagna, not magic.<eos> All she says is that they vanished with the Sorcerer's wand and never came back.

Yes, but we both know that's not you, dearie.<eos> My best student was a queen.<eos> You have her buried under layers of tasteful cotton and good intentions.<eos> Such a pity.<eos> What if I told you I was ready to let her back out?<eos> What if I told you I am sick of losing everyone I care about?<eos> Well, I'd say, "What's changed?"<eos> Zelena.<eos> She's in trouble.<eos> All because the heroes convinced her to use the Sorcerer's Wand, and now they're trapped in another realm.
No, this is my house.<eos> Oh, they're definitely gonna want to talk to you, then.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I've never seen these guys before.<eos> I have.<eos> Sorry, I'm in a hurry.<eos> What?<eos> These guys are Black Claw.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> They were following me.
What?<eos> And they all knew I was a Grimm.<eos> And they're holding Hank there?<eos> They said he's not there.<eos> I don't know where he is.<eos> Even if he is, I can't get to him, at least not alone.<eos> Check to see if they booked him, and if they did he'll be in the system.<eos> Nope, nothing.<eos> They haven't filed any paperwork, so whatever they're up to, it's not by the book.<eos> These guys are Black Claw, the charge is bogus and they know it.

Told me to get Burkhardt into an interrogation room, he's on his way here.<eos> Back off, Sergeant!<eos> Get off me! These are Captain's orders!<eos> Wu, it's me!<eos> What happened?<eos> - They got Nick.<eos> - Who?<eos> These guys are North Precinct. Same as the guys that arrested me.<eos> Nick told me that precinct was Black Claw.<eos> Well, if they control it, that's probably where they took him.
Johnny, do an analysis.<eos> Analysis of what?<eos> I don't know! That's just something we say and then you make it all better.<eos> Tell me what we're dealing with.<eos> Here, mossy-mossy.<eos> Well... to start with, it looks like an angry vagina.<eos> And these things aren't moss, they're centipedes.<eos> Moss-covered centipedes?<eos> Mossipedes?<eos> Well, they must use moss as camouflage.

I mean, that must be the way that they hunt.<eos> Yeah, but she was running from Paolo.<eos> Wasn't she?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> How many skeletons were down there with her?<eos> Two.<eos> So Paolo and Deena were already dead.<eos> She was what... hallucinating?<eos> And that's why there was no blood after she shot Paolo.<eos> I mean, these things, I think, I think they have some sort of psychotropic venom.
So why hasn't Alvis mentioned anything?<eos> Alvis!<eos> Alvis, what's going on?<eos> We lost visual.<eos> So, D'av, what's your theory?<eos> That Khlyen sends people down here to milk the mossipedes?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're the science guy.<eos> Now how 'bout you tell me the best way to get these things away from us so we can get the hells out of here.<eos> Well, they don't move very fast.
God damn it, no.<eos> What? What?<eos> I fucking agree with Reggie.<eos> What?<eos> Just a matter of time.<eos> All right, I got to take the minivan today.<eos> I'm gonna pick up a big plant for Kiki's room after work.<eos> Help boost the oxygen levels.<eos> Hmm, ever wonder why keys are so popular with babies?<eos> They got nowhere to be.
It's not real.<eos> [knocking]<eos> - Hi, Mr. Jenkins, I'm Dr. Rhodes.<eos> Dr. Manning's asked me to consult.<eos> - Would you mind stepping out for a minute? - Sure.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Eric, can you show me what you just made?<eos> What is that?<eos> - These are Eric's x-rays, and these two dots are the magnets.<eos> They're attracted to one another, and if they meet, they could pin separate parts of his digestive tract together and erode through the thin intestinal walls.
"Go in peace."<eos> - [sighs]<eos> - Can you just watch her for a minute?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you for not giving up on Jen.<eos> [crying]<eos> - We're here today to celebrate the newest member<eos> And as we do at weddings and funerals, to offer our love and support.<eos> It is the people in our lives who bring us joy.<eos> They are the color of our lives.
Oh, shit.<eos> Hey, Bell.<eos> - Long time no see, Rick. - Mm.<eos> What's up? You boys are out on the prowl tonight?<eos> You see all these bit... nope, nope.<eos> - Hell, yeah.<eos> Just helping my man get his mind off some shit.<eos> Yeah, I have a penchant for fashion.<eos> Particularly skinny jeans.<eos> They give me the nut support that I receive on field off field and make my butt look tight.
Yeah, I do.<eos> ♪♪<eos> I just talked to Detective Holloway and she said that you're not returning her calls.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> She's not talking to the cops.<eos> You ever seen "Making a Murderer"?<eos> David, I want to know what happened to Courtney.<eos> I know you do.<eos> But you can't talk to them.<eos> You know what they'll say?

You know, if we do this now, you can make your Spring Formal.<eos> Didn't you say what's his name ask you?<eos> Sam?<eos> Or Steve?<eos> Or...<eos> Well, I guess Parker can find someone else.<eos> I don't want to go if I can only sit and watch and be pitied.<eos> What, are you kidding me?<eos> With these lungs?<eos> They're gonna have to drag you off that dance floor.
Francine got you on the air and I abused my CIA powers to make that superstorm.<eos> You made this storm?<eos> Lives were destroyed.<eos> But Greg's life was fixed.<eos> Now, you've got a new work partner and a new life partner.<eos> Now kiss, you two lovebirds.<eos> And put some mustard on it.<eos> Aren't you straight?<eos> Yes, but I'm terrified of these people.<eos> They can control the weather!
FBI asked Callen and Sam to the scene.<eos> Do we know why the FBI asked for our help?<eos> Not yet.<eos> So is it terrorist attack, or is it a gas leak?<eos> No one's confirmed anything.<eos> We're looking at security cams.<eos> There's no clear angle of the explosion.<eos> What about outliers on other cameras?<eos> It's morning downtown, so the outliers are these two boys.<eos> Looks like they're being chased by these men.

You don't have time to wait, Agent Callen.<eos> Proceed as if we're right on this, for your own sake.<eos> Nadir, I need you to listen to me.<eos> You were not abandoned.<eos> Your parents did not give you up.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> Well, actually, I do.<eos> I have my people looking into your background.<eos> I know who your parents are.<eos> They didn't care about me and my brother, so I don't care about them.

Be a good start.<eos> You want the beach and the sunset with the ring.<eos> Maybe then you'd have a chance.<eos> Hey. That's still a yes.<eos> Huh? Baby?<eos> Uh-huh, that's a yes.<eos> Your new clothes a little stiff?<eos> Well, you wash 'em a couple times, they'll feel better.<eos> You okay?<eos> What if when I finally meet them, they don't want me?

When you sent us out, were you aware of the threat from North Korea?<eos> Sometimes I just think it's being in the right place at the right time.<eos> GRANGER:<eos> Here's lunch.<eos> Korean takeout.<eos> (laughs)<eos> Ah.<eos> Ooh.<eos> Ah-ha.<eos> And by the way, those five North Korean agents we took down, they were on the dog's chip.
Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?<eos> Okay, we'll take 'em.<eos> Okay. But, I swear, if it's Will Smith in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original.<eos> I mean, it's crazy, isn't it?<eos> I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress, and now I'm sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system.<eos> It is crazy.<eos> It's also crazy that I've made 14 of these and you've made three.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where are the guys?<eos> Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things.
All right but off the books means off the ledger, as in tax-free.<eos> All right.<eos> $1 million cash.<eos> Compliments of your president and a grateful nation.<eos> Do you mind if I smell that?<eos> You know what, i-it is very tempting, but there are too many variables... and we're not lab rats.<eos> Put us in a cage and see if the trap springs?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Yeah, Walter's right.<eos> These guys, they don't do Mission: Impossible.

Should be sticky enough to hold the gun powder.<eos> How many bullets did Tim give you?<eos> Six, more than enough.<eos> Do you see Tim and Cabe?<eos> No, they're well hidden.<eos> This is dumb.<eos> The idea of breaking back into Knox is crazy enough but waiting here in the hopes we can take out those guards on our tail is wishful thinking.<eos> If we run into the woods now and get caught, it's over.<eos> It's worth the wait.<eos> Anyway, shut up, they're here.
Whatcha doing out here all by yourself?<eos> I guess I just felt like getting away from my family for a while.<eos> Well, yeah, well, I guess I get that.<eos> So, school's good?<eos> Actually, it's great.<eos> I really feel like I'm changing, you know.<eos> Like really evolving.<eos> Evolving's good.<eos> But my... my parents don't seem to get that.<eos> They still want me to be this thing I decided to be when I was 6, whether I still want that or not.
What were we talking about?<eos> How kids lie.<eos> How old is Shelly?<eos> 11?<eos> Can you really trust them at that age?<eos> And what was she doing in a bar?<eos> That's a little bit weird.<eos> I'm not blaming you.<eos> It's just what kids do to get attention.<eos> They...

Your lawyer will argue for you.<eos> And, uh, why is the drone such<eos> - a problem for you?<eos> - Well, it's my business.<eos> I'm a therapist.<eos> I practice out of my house.<eos> And do your patients complain?<eos> Yes.<eos> Some have even quit.<eos> They depend on me for privacy and they get this...
- Look at her.<eos> - Do patients<eos> - park in your garage, Dr. Nachmann?<eos> - My garage?<eos> No.<eos> I turned that into my office.<eos> I see.<eos> Then do patients enter your garage office through a covered walkway?<eos> No.<eos> So they park on the street, then walk up to your house, where anyone who happens to be around could see them?
- Very much so.<eos> - 720 ILCS 5/7-2 allows the use of force in defense of one's dwelling.<eos> - Castle doctrine? - You're applying Castle doctrine?<eos> Your Honor, this is still about Mr. Dipple's libertarian fantasies...<eos> Again, the plaintiff is attempting to provoke bias.<eos> Castle doctrine allows the use of force to the extent necessary to terminate or prevent<eos> - unlawful entry.<eos> - Are you saying Dr. Nachmann thought the drone was going to enter his home?<eos> Drones are capable of doing more than record video, Your Honor.<eos> They can steal, interfere with, and destroy things inside the house without ever entering.
Lights and buzzers.<eos> Of my choosing.<eos> Fine.<eos> Good.<eos> Now, about those podiums.<eos> What you're suggesting, Mr. Doyle... that's not an immigration policy, it's institutionalized racism.<eos> - Now, hold on a minute.<eos> - If we close our borders...<eos> Do you have any idea how much of our economy depends on the ideas and contributions of non-citizens?<eos> The best young minds in the world, they come here, they enroll in our universities, and once they graduate, they stay.

24 is the number of EPA sanctions leveled against Doyle Energy last year.<eos> Let's start again.<eos> Did you break Susan?<eos> Because your girlfriend is in a death spiral.<eos> Just fix it, okay?<eos> "Pencils down."<eos> We all remember those dreaded words from school.<eos> When you heard them, it meant you were out of time.<eos> That's a feeling our Republican presidential hopefuls can relate to.<eos> With only two days left before their first debate, they're cramming like crazy in preparation for the most important test of their lives... a test, my dear Lovers of Liberty, that you will be grading.

Oh, God. I envy that.<eos> It's so romantic to just know after only a few months.<eos> Oh! I can tell you, he definitely knows all my secrets.<eos> That's the one drawback to marrying the head of the NSA.<eos> Those guys dig pretty deep, huh?<eos> Oh, yeah. I had to submit all my tax records, bank statements...<eos> what else?<eos> Laptops and stuff?<eos> Sure.<eos> They did a full background check.
Who cares who?<eos> I...<eos> I didn't mean to...<eos> It's just a shock, is all.<eos> David Rosen is such an ass.<eos> Oh.<eos> Sometimes you can seem really mean, but you care, don't you?<eos> Oh!<eos> Each candidate will get one minute to answer questions and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals.<eos> I'll give candidates time to respond if they've been singled out and criticized by another candidate.
Took someone seven hours to find a dead body dressed like this?<eos> Well, either his cape fell over him when he fell, or the person who shot him tucked him in.<eos> To anyone who walked by, he just looked like a homeless guy trying to stay warm.<eos> Believe it or not, he wasn't coming home from a costume party.<eos> These were his work clothes-- sort of.<eos> He walked a beat in Greenpoint almost every night.<eos> Real-life superhero.<eos> One of a subculture of ordinary men and women who don costumes to perform acts of public service.<eos> I'm familiar with the phenomenon, though I've never delved too deeply into the affairs of the heroes who operate in New York.<eos> They mostly just scold litterbugs and help little old ladies across the street.
Would you do me the favor of telling me your name?<eos> I want to talk in person.<eos> Time and a place?<eos> Now.<eos> I'm on your roof.<eos> I'm the Standard-Bearer.<eos> I'm here to help.<eos> You're staring.<eos> Observation must be one of your superhuman abilities.<eos> I've had masked visitors before, but they came either to kill me or have sex with me.
They don't know they're already dead.<eos> And the deception at its core makes it all the more sinister.<eos> Whole nations are at risk of complete extinction, and they don't know it.<eos> This is genocide.<eos> Sir, the missile we found contained enough of the anti-cure to affect a 20-mile radius or more, depending on the winds.<eos> Strategically deployed at ports where the actual cure would be delivered,<eos> President Peng could kill off a country the size of Japan with only six of these weapons.<eos> And how many more of these missiles are out there, Captain?<eos> It's hard to say, sir.<eos> But we're pretty sure we know where they're coming from.
Report damages to CCS.<eos> Incoming.<eos> Destroy.<eos> Corpsman! We need a corpsman on the bridge!<eos> Sound and Security... report damage and flooding status.<eos> Sound and Security. We have water integrity.<eos> CIC, bridge.<eos> Did those missiles come from the Chinese ship?<eos> Negative.<eos> They launched from mainland.

He's not responsible for this.<eos> He's with us now, against Peng.<eos> I'm not sure I understand, sir.<eos> Captain Slattery will show you to your quarters, brief you on the particulars.<eos> I know we lost a lot today, but we prevented a genocide in Korea.<eos> We'll take care of our wounded, then we'll finish Peng off for good.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Kara. I want to know why you tried to stop our ships.<eos> Sir?<eos> You knew they were gonna be attacked.

Wasn't me.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - What if I talk to him?<eos> Why, because his love for you runs so deep?<eos> You have a better suggestion?<eos> Yeah, you could drop out of the race, spare yourself the embarrassment when this all comes out.<eos> You do realize Susan goes down, too.<eos> Susan had nothing to do with this.<eos> Technically, no, but she's associated with you now, and you, which means when your names turn to dirt, which they will, so will hers.
Oh. Okay.<eos> How do you make it stop?<eos> Thanks. This is perfect.<eos> Do people always stare at you?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - They're staring at you.<eos> - Stop.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> You're a giant.<eos> They think you might eat them.
I-I shouldn't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - It isn't...<eos> - It's not?<eos> Did you bring it?<eos> You know, sometimes I wish we'd said no... to the mission, to all of this.<eos> There was no mission, Alex.<eos> We were chasing ghosts.<eos> They weren't ghosts, Ryan.<eos> They were just smarter than us.
And now, with both of you here, that just doubles our odds.<eos> Look, the FBI and the CIA used to be able to do whatever they wanted in the name of national security, but over the years, laws have been passed rightfully -- to keep us from crossing the line.<eos> We believe that some people in the Agency decided they're done with these laws.<eos> They want the old ways restored -- no accountability, no rules, no oversight.<eos> Now, whoever this rogue group is, they've been growing within the CIA for years with their own nefarious agenda, and we need to stop them.<eos> The recruitment is happening on The Farm, and we believe Owen Hall, who is the head instructor, is finding the right candidates and indoctrinating them while training them right alongside the other students.<eos> So we need you to get close to your fellow recruits, figure out who may be chosen, and, if you can, get chosen yourself.<eos> The only way for us to know who's in charge is if you get inside.<eos> Well, won't sending in two former FBI agents who are in a romantic relationship raise some red flags as to the reasons we're there?<eos> Well, they don't know you've been romantic.
Captain, I'll stay on your six.<eos> Fine by me.<eos> Just watch your front sight.<eos> Captain.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Just got a sit rep.<eos> The prisoners have the control room.<eos> Copy that.<eos> It's gonna get hairy in there.<eos> They're not gonna give it up without a fight.
Wait. Hold on.<eos> This is your card.<eos> No. No.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> That's not your card?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Is that your card?<eos> Ohh! How did you do that?<eos> I had a hard time putting both boys down last night.<eos> They couldn't sleep?
Wait. Wait, don't move.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What? What?<eos> Oh, my God, you have something in your hair!<eos> Ha ha ha ha! Holy guacamole!<eos> ♪ I hope the night keeps ♪ I'll be right back.<eos> ♪ as you come and keep me ♪ What is it now?<eos> 3 more prison breaks in 3 different states, all organized by Rawdon's partners from his last bombing attempt.<eos> The local field office got a head start because of what we did.<eos> They stopped the bomb threat, but--
Um, no, thank you.<eos> Well, you are good people, Tawney, staying with him like this.<eos> Oh, that's kind of you to say, but I'm doing this for me.<eos> He's the good people.<eos> Well, I'll be back in a little while.<eos> I've been thinking about you having no children, Mr. Zeke.<eos> How sad that must have been for you and your wife.<eos> Do you see her yet?<eos> I... I didn't really know my parents.<eos> I don't know details about them, but... but I don't think they were together,
Forget it.<eos> That was beautiful.<eos> The planning, the execution.<eos> Did you think it up yourself?<eos> - Bits of it I did, yeah.<eos> - Is that him?<eos> - It's Antoine.<eos> - Antoine.<eos> - People know you.<eos> Yeah, they never forget a face round here.
A joyride?<eos> To Olcott.<eos> She wanted to trade a baby to save her life.<eos> But then she had a change of mind.<eos> I'm just as glad.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> You love babies.<eos> What do I care for babies?<eos> Katia is on my list.<eos> I don't like taking people off my list until they are dead.
I'll be three seconds behind you.<eos> Good luck.<eos> - Nick, come on!<eos> - Go!<eos> Hey, fellas.<eos> Smoke break over?<eos> We could work on him for days.<eos> His fingers.<eos> His eyes.<eos> I don't think he'll tell us where they are.
There was a second vehicle involved.<eos> Hey, boss, got something you got to see here.<eos> White paint.<eos> Looks like our victim got tapped by another vehicle.<eos> Maybe forced off the road.<eos> How's that investigation going now, Hicks?<eos> Guess it could have been a hit-and-run.<eos> Guess we'll have to take a closer look.<eos> Investigators don't guess, Deputy.<eos> They study.

The rest is embedded in his quadriceps.<eos> What, the phone was inside his leg?<eos> It was in his pants pocket.<eos> It shattered when the car crashed, and the pieces, I say, embedded in his thigh.<eos> Well, so much for getting those contacts.<eos> I think it's safe to say that his last contact was with the pole.<eos> I made a joke.<eos> You cut the car in half.<eos> No. The firefighters did.<eos> They were already slicing it up to try to extricate Phony Tony, so I just asked them to go ahead and bisect it.
From what?<eos> This looks like an eHarmony ad.<eos> EHarmony's the benchmark.<eos> They fully monetized desperation.<eos> Okay, fine, but we're selling something different, right?<eos> The anti-partnership.<eos> The... the fun of the chase.<eos> Our customers don't need to know that.<eos> Oh, they don't?<eos> So long as they're satisfied with the experience, what does it matter, right?
You can't let her kill your dreams!<eos> Wait.<eos> What are your dreams?<eos> To be the world's greatest entertainment reporter.<eos> Yeah, that!<eos> You can't let her kill that.<eos> Don't you understand, Tucker?<eos> Dreams are all we have.<eos> Dreams are what we're made of.<eos> They course through every vein in our body.
Mostly they don't.<eos> People come and go in this town.<eos> I've only been here two years, myself.<eos> There are some old-timers with their theories.<eos> Such as?<eos> Town's built on an Indian burial ground.<eos> Forest folk are pissed because we stole their coal.<eos> And what's your take?<eos> We're a small town.<eos> People get bored, they get fed up, they leave.
Or keeps coming back for seconds.<eos> All right, I'll go check the reports on the other missing.<eos> I guess that leaves me Ganja Girl.<eos> You're gonna say I was hallucinating.<eos> The weed was laced with PCP or something.<eos> It's okay, Cori, just -- just... tell me what you remember.<eos> And nothing is too strange or weird to mention.<eos> The thing that took Libby was naked and pale.<eos> Except for the eyes.<eos> I swear to God, they flashed green for a second.
Etta Fraser.<eos> Let's go talk to Etta.<eos> Your husband was one of the people who disappeared in 1989.<eos> Oh, my second husband.<eos> Barely that.<eos> Pete only stuck around a couple months.<eos> So he left voluntarily?<eos> Pete was volunteering himself all over the place.<eos> Right before he disappeared, people saw Pete diddling two different women in public, separate occasions.<eos> You mean they actually saw him in the act?
Is that... is that white sage? Mm.<eos> Yeah, you know your herbs.<eos> You, uh, planning on taking a trip?<eos> Uh, yeah. I'm going to stay with my sister a few weeks.<eos> For any reason?<eos> You're gonna think it's real out there.<eos> Well, you'd be surprised at the kind of crazy we hear.<eos> Well... when Pete went missing, and we found out about the women, my grandma said that he "got the chitters."<eos> According to her, once a generation around the spring equinox, people in town start going nuts, having orgies, copulating in the woods.<eos> And then they disappear, never to be heard from again.
Come on.<eos> I hate it when I lose my blade. Yeah.<eos> You could've jumped in anytime.<eos> What is this place?<eos> It's a maternity ward/ subway station.<eos> That hole -- I think that's a tunnel.<eos> That's gotta go topside eventually.<eos> Mothers are already dead.<eos> Males weren't protecting them.<eos> They were protecting the eggs.

The world was turned upside-down, and all the rules were thrown out.<eos> But...<eos> The Navy taught me many things.<eos> Most importantly, it taught me to adapt.<eos> I had to make some difficult decisions.<eos> God knows I made some mistakes.<eos> But never once did I waver from what I knew to be right...<eos> The core values that run through all of our veins.<eos> Honor... courage... commitment.<eos> And I served my sailors as they served me.
- Well, yeah, but --<eos> - Do you know her name?<eos> - No. But you have seen her, haven't you?<eos> Identifying this woman is top priority.<eos> What do we know about her?<eos> Mark? She may have been in trouble before.<eos> Got the guy from the pawnshop looking through mugshots.<eos> - We're trying to get fingerprints off the bracelet, the watch and the earrings.<eos> - Good. Serial killers don't take trophies to sell them.<eos> - They've got a different value.
Bam.<eos> About seven minutes sober today.<eos> OK.<eos> You're upbeat about this.<eos> That's good.<eos> Too right.<eos> Toked up the last of my stash.<eos> What was I going to do?<eos> Leave it lying around in temptation's way?<eos> Chemical stimulants think they can control me, they can think again.
Doesn't matter where I got it.<eos> From Truss.<eos> Truss?<eos> ! Imagine a world where this is a really bad idea.<eos> We're in it.<eos> That's the world we live in.<eos> You are not going to get that job.<eos> Well, not if I don't apply for it, that's for sure.<eos> You're an alien.<eos> People are less nice than you think they are.

You all right, Holly, everything OK?<eos> OK?<eos> With the whole being off fur?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What's she doing?<eos> Oh, she's fine, she's just making a packed lunch, eh?<eos> I thought of something else we used to do together.<eos> Sainsbury's big shop.<eos> Hello, there, we're just in the area today, talking to people about how they can save money on their gas and electricity bills.
Hey, hope I don't get this test pregnant.<eos> Okay, give me that.<eos> Well, that can't be right.<eos> But that would mean...<eos> You know, I bet my sperm count was too high for the test.<eos> Yes, oh, definitely.<eos> Probably broke the barrier.<eos> What do we even know about these things, anyway, huh?<eos> Oh, "made in China."<eos> They're probably calibrated for Chinese sperm.
And I... will be by your side.<eos> Nice digs.<eos> The Crypt Keeper out of town?<eos> I'm lucky to be alive.<eos> Lucifer had me trussed up like a dog in my own palace.<eos> "Palace"?<eos> Oh, you mean the abandoned nuthouse.<eos> He kept me in a kennel!<eos> And he turned all his demons -- my demons -- against me.<eos> They scour the earth, day and night, looking to kill me.
I'm someone you can talk with. Confide in.<eos> Have you -- Have you ever had that?<eos> I've always been alone.<eos> Oh, you don't have to be, darlin'!<eos> Well... whatever you're doing, it seems to be working.<eos> Maybe I should try a little test.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, I like your spunk. There's always room for a go-getter in my organization.<eos> Hey, I know I can count on you.<eos> But what about your people? They on board, or we need to do a little wing-twisting?
Your friends weren't making any plans.<eos> I wanted it to be special.<eos> I know.<eos> I thought you like being pampered.<eos> Men these days. They don't take enough time for themselves.<eos> It's not about the spa.<eos> Having you here, it changes the dynamic with my friends.<eos> But we're friends! #Brogelios4Life.<eos> We are, but we're also about to be family, and you know, that changes things.<eos> They can't tell funny stories and have them be inappropriate while my wife's dad is around, you know?
I wouldn't really call these people my friends.<eos> Most of them don't even know whose house they're at.<eos> Except for Ken over there.<eos> Ken knows exactly where he is.<eos> You know what? I'm thirsty.<eos> Why don't we open this up?<eos> So whereabouts do you live now? Or are you still in Burlingame?<eos> Oh, no, I got out of there a while ago.<eos> I'm in Los Altos now with a bunch of college buddies.<eos> They're really jealous that I'm working for you.
Okay, that makes absolutely zero sense.<eos> Well, we thought it made a lot of sense.<eos> Well, you guys are the heads of the company. Of course you should be the ones to bring the offer over to SwapMeet.<eos> Gordon, it's a formality.<eos> Bos can do it.<eos> It's not a formality. It's about perception.<eos> And the people that you're buying, especially since they're coming to work here, need to view you and Donna as the ones in charge.<eos> Gordon, we've already met with them a gazillion times, okay?<eos> We've had lunch. We've had drinks.<eos> They know we're in charge.
and I don't want anything to do with it.<eos> I'm sorry that you had to hear that.<eos> Hazard of the job.<eos> Are you ok?<eos> Just seeing Thea in the suit, it just made me feel like everything was going to get back to normal.<eos> Well, I'm running out of different ways to tell you that it's not.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> Being a vigilante is not just putting on a mask and thinking up a codename.<eos> These people are amateurs, Felicity.<eos> You really think that they're going to replace

It says here his name is Rene Ramirez.<eos> Yeah, but Wild Dog is much scarier.<eos> So by looking into him, does that mean--<eos> I'm thinking of recruiting him.<eos> Good.<eos> You better.<eos> Because if you don't, I have no idea what I went through this for.<eos> Oh, my God. What happened?<eos> I was looking for Mr. Dog, and then I was jumped by two insanely aggressive guys with knives.<eos> Do you remember what they looked like?
- Once you're there, we're gonna need you to publicly announce that Miss Mileva Maric has been your silent partner for over 30 years.<eos> You see, acknowledgment of Mileva's contributions is the only way to keep her safe.<eos> Besides, it's the right thing to do.<eos> Don't be a jerk.<eos> Today I want to tell you about a very special woman, my longtime collaborator, Mileva Maric.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Krauts won't be able to get to her?<eos> Yes, and then people won't say,<eos> "Hey, you're a regular Einstein."<eos> They'll say, "You're like one of the Einsteins."
How are you even here?<eos> The plasma acts as a conduit between connected minds, among other things.<eos> Dutch, I'm reading massive trauma to D'Avin's lower left abdomen.<eos> You're hurt.<eos> No, Jaqobis is hurt.<eos> I need to send a message to my partner to switch us back before certain... people catch up to him... me.<eos> It's confusing.<eos> D'Avin can take care of himself.<eos> Not against the Black Root.<eos> If they catch up to him first, we'll both be dead.
It's Jess's.<eos> Every time she gets a job at a new school, she brings back kid germs that infect your filthy body.<eos> Don't get me sick.<eos> Don't get me sick either, man.<eos> I got a date coming up, and I might get to mouth-base.<eos> I'm not gonna get sick.<eos> No germ can live in a body that is 65% beer.<eos> Nick, are you eating raisins from my purse?<eos> I confiscated those from a kid.<eos> That explains why they're so sticky.
Okay, fine.<eos> Honesty, all right,<eos> I... had a really hard time opening up to someone and then I met Jess and... and I thought we were...<eos> We were great together.<eos> And then Nick kissed her, and I-I went down kind of a weird path.<eos> I gained 85 pounds.<eos> And then I lost, like, 100.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Poured almost all my money into silkworms.<eos> They froze to death.
I like to avoid dangerous situations.<eos> Plus, you know, you've been doing this as long as I have, you learn that rarely is a secret tunnel just a tunnel.<eos> Okay, watch your step.<eos> Case in point.<eos> What is this?<eos> Looks like a geek gold mine.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> It took me four hours to get control of the scene from the local idiots.<eos> Now they're letting press past the tape?
It's guitar string.<eos> It's just a lot of empty land.<eos> Farms.<eos> The gas odometer only had three miles on it.<eos> That's strange.<eos> Maybe that means something?<eos> There was a news story about this area a couple months ago.<eos> Some locals cried miracle when a nearby creek ran red with blood.<eos> Turns out there's a slaughterhouse with a drainage issue nearby.<eos> They closed it down.
"In the meantime, our good ship, with that friendly breeze to drive her, fast approached the Sirens' isle."<eos> Oh. I think I remember this.<eos> The Sirens lured the sailors into shore with their song before they ate them.<eos> More importantly, this book is one of the greatest love stories of all time.<eos> You're an incurable romantic, aren't you?<eos> When it comes to you, love, I would never stop fighting.<eos> I would brave the oceans and sail past the Sirens to find my way back to you.<eos> "Meanwhile, I took a large round of wax, cut it up small with my sharp sword, I took all my men in turn and plugged their ears with it."<eos> _<eos> "Then they bound me hand and foot, standing me up by the step of the ship's mast and then lashing me to the mast itself."
You can track the SUV, can't you?<eos> We can, but they probably swapped cars at least once by now, and with a two-hour head start, we're looking at a 100-mile search radius, and we still have no idea what we're looking for.<eos> There must be something that you can do.<eos> This... This is Richard's life.<eos> YOLO.<eos> That's cold, Beckett.<eos> No, uh, Castle's new credit card.<eos> The kidnappers left his cellphone by the car, but he might still have his wallet with him.<eos> And the new YOLO card has an upgraded RFID chip in it.<eos> And if they passed within range of a tollbooth or a gas station...
Don't.<eos> I hated myself for leaving you.<eos> Water under the bridge, darling.<eos> And whatever happens in the next 10 seconds, no regrets.<eos> For me, it's freedom or death.<eos> Wesley, please.<eos> Goodbye, Hayley.<eos> You had no choice.<eos> Nice job smoothing things over with the feds for Hayley.<eos> Yeah, well, it didn't hurt that they were able to take credit for closing down a terrorism case, so...
And those vampires could be anywhere.<eos> You'd better get started.<eos> Look.<eos> The girls are growing up so fast.<eos> They look like footballs in pumpkin costumes.<eos> What have you got there?<eos> Blueprints of the Armory's underground levels.<eos> You ever been down there?<eos> No, actually.<eos> Uh, Alex said they were all sealed off.
Why do you care?<eos> Hmm?<eos> They abandoned you.<eos> Left you at a workhouse.<eos> You have two parents, right?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Um, had.<eos> I know your dad died.<eos> I had none.<eos> Curiosity about what they stand for is what keeps me from hating them for leaving me.
Considering I'm giving you my life, I figured it qualified me for an upgrade from the storm cellar.<eos> Personally, I would've negotiated for the penthouse suite in Paris and dinner at the best restaurant in town where I would've ordered one of everything and had the most expensive bottle of wine and champagne.<eos> And when all the names are in the fire, you'll have a whole lifetime to do all of it.<eos> Guess I don't understand what you're getting out of this.<eos> I mean, not to sound ungrateful, but you're willing to die?<eos> For me?<eos> Just doesn't make any sense.<eos> That's because you haven't lived seven lifetimes beyond your own.<eos> That's what I never understood about vampires.<eos> They seek out immortality like it's some kind of gift.
Yeah, I know.<eos> Tell me that everything's gonna be fine.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine?<eos> Yeah, you want to try it again?<eos> Maybe this time where you actually believe it?<eos> Do you know what this place is?<eos> Half of these things should've been lost to history.<eos> Disappeared.<eos> The other half shouldn't even exist.<eos> Now, if these guys can make all of this disappear, they're gonna have no problem making us disappear, so when I say, "Yeah, we're gonna be fine,"

Now for our favorite subject.<eos> Anyone?<eos> Anyone?<eos> Vampires.<eos> Real or myth?<eos> Bonnie?<eos> Myth.<eos> Wrong.<eos> Vampires are as common today as mosquitoes.<eos> They can walk in the daylight, kill from the shadows.
After a week, Alaric managed to crack the security code.<eos> We were prepared for almost anything... except what we saw.<eos> It was empty.<eos> Enzo? Completely cleaned out.<eos> I don't know how they got out, but they did.<eos> I'm worried about Bonnie.<eos> She lost the two people closest to her, and she can't even do a locator spell to find them.<eos> Her magic never came back.<eos> She feels helpless.<eos> I reached out to all my contacts, knowing they'd show up sooner or later.
Heywood Ja-help-em?<eos> Ja-help...<eos> That's a unique middle name.<eos> Actually, it's pronounced, uh, Ja-help-me, as in, "Hey, Would Ya Help Me?"<eos> (chuckles)<eos> I had it legally changed for business purposes.<eos> Back of your card looks like a $20 bill.<eos> It's cool, right?<eos> Yeah, that's so if people throw 'em away, you know, other folks will come by and be like,<eos> "Oh, cool, $20." They'll pick 'em up and then they'll be like, "Oh, it's a lawyer."

their mothers, their fathers, everyone. Their mothers and fathers?<eos> No.<eos> When people talk about protecting someone, they generally talk about children, not their parents.<eos> We shouldn't be looking at what happened to him.<eos> We should be looking at what happened to his mom and dad.<eos> Ooh, hold on, because I had found something on his parents before.<eos> Right here.<eos> When he was 15 years old, the factory his father worked at was sold to a consortium.<eos> All of the jobs went overseas.<eos> They lost their main source of income, and the bank foreclosed upon their home.
- He is not leaving this precinct!<eos> Hey! Get off me!<eos> These are Captain's orders!<eos> - [growls] - Wu, it's me!<eos> - What happened?<eos> - They got Nick.<eos> - Who?<eos> - These guys are North Precinct, same as the guys that arrested me.<eos> - Nick told me that precinct was Black Claw.<eos> - Well, if they control it, that's probably where they took him.
Or he was soulless.<eos> It ain't much, but given what we've got, I'll take it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There you go.<eos> Dude, quit ironing my shirts with beer!<eos> So, what you been up to?<eos> Oh, I've been super busy.<eos> Yeah, I traveled. Mm-hmm. I started a blog.<eos> Mostly just pictures of cats.<eos> Oh. They're so cute.
So you're saying I'm likable.<eos> I am saying the chapter "Chuckle""<eos> is devouring pounds of pages at the expense of... juicier stuff.<eos> Stuff that people might actually want to read.<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, like, uh...<eos> Like the archangels.<eos> I mean, you have got maybe two paragraphs on them in here.<eos> And that's it!<eos> Don't you think they deserve a few extra words?
And you were, I don't know, writing books, going to fan conventions.<eos> Were you even aware, o-or did you just tune it out?<eos> I was aware, Dean.<eos> But you did nothing.<eos> And, again, I-I'm not trying to piss you off.<eos> You know, I don't want to turn into a pillar of salt.<eos> I actually -- I didn't do that.<eos> People -- People pray to you.<eos> People build churches for you.<eos> They fight wars in your name, and you did nothing.
That came right to me.<eos> Who speaks this language?<eos> - Angels.<eos> I need to see you, Dean.<eos> Events are moving swiftly and everything will change.<eos> I need to meet with you, but not like this.<eos> Somewhere alone.<eos> I can't be a prophet. I'm an atheist and a chemist!<eos> I-I believe in molecules, not God.<eos> All right, well, we're pretty sure that prophets don't even know they're in the game until they've actually been touched by God, so...
Get your Casper asses out here!<eos> You know what?<eos> Why don't you finish up? I'll go piss them off.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, I think it worked!<eos> - Say the magic word! - Aah!<eos> Dean, hurry!<eos> Go magic word.<eos> The angels are -- Heaven won't help.<eos> They know that this is the end, right? Of everything.

Of everything.<eos> Yes. And they don't care?<eos> No, it's not that. It's...<eos> They know -- They know God is dying and they don't think we can win this.

And they don't care?<eos> No, it's not that.

Uh, w-what does that mean, "okay"?<eos> Means way things are going, I'm about an hour away from reaping God himself.<eos> So you're here to help us.<eos> Little tip -- you want souls, call a reaper.<eos> Oh, I like your dress.<eos> It's pretty fancy for the park, but at least you made an effort.<eos> Do you want to feed them?<eos> I shouldn't.<eos> I've been feeding these birds going on 20 years now.<eos> They're practically family.
Okay, well, thanks for keeping him warm.<eos> We got it from here.<eos> Detective, Sean Young was shot in Brooklyn, which makes it my case.<eos> Yeah, but the M.O. fits the pattern of a crew that's struck twice in Manhattan, so it makes it our case.<eos> Same crew?<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> DANNY:<eos> Three athletes hit the same way in the same month?<eos> Yeah, I'd say there's a connection.<eos> They both weren't shot.
Mosley.<eos> Mosley.<eos> How you holding up, champ?<eos> I might've been better off going another 12 rounds instead.<eos> Yeah, you got that right.<eos> I don't got much.<eos> Well, just be straight with us.<eos> We'll be the judge of what you got.<eos> We heard from some witnesses that there was a beef at the club between you and some guys.<eos> Do you think they might have been involved in the shooting?
It's not funny.<eos> Dude, slow down.<eos> It's not funny."<eos> But it was funny.<eos> I was sliding off the back 'cause I was trying to keep my dick from touching your butt.<eos> Hey, boys.<eos> What's up, Hank?<eos> These are Maggie's sons.<eos> They drink for free.<eos> They'll have three beers.
He drops back.<eos> He's got a receiver open over the middle.<eos> He throws!<eos> Touchdown!<eos> What's that?<eos> There's a flag on the play!<eos> Well, but it's declined 'cause it's just for excessive handsomeness.<eos> What you doing here?<eos> Well, I heard your mom needed new drapes, so Kenny got these from his hotel.<eos> Can't use them 'cause they don't match the carpet.
Good night, Dad.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Dad took quite a shine to you.<eos> Well, yeah, he's so easy to get along with.<eos> Oh, you're serious.<eos> Oh, no, he's not.<eos> I can't believe he hugged you.<eos> 'Course he only hugged me twice in my life... and one time, I think he just tripped and grabbed me to keep from falling.<eos> Guys do that to me all the time.<eos> Except they always land like this.
Look, I've been thinking, and just hear me out...<eos> I could put the bar up as collateral for you.<eos> And I appreciate that... but that's the same as offering me money.<eos> You need help.<eos> It may as well come from me.<eos> This ranch isn't your concern anymore, Maggie.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> My sons still live here.<eos> And whether we end up divorced or not, that makes it my concern.<eos> Plus, if you lose this place, they're gonna want to live with me in my Airstream and there's no fucking way that's gonna happen.
Well... Maggie and I are havin' a hard time.<eos> I don't even know what the right thing to do is anymore.<eos> Yep.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Sure sounds tough.<eos> Damn it, Dale.<eos> You know... back in the ranch, I had two old horses.<eos> Both over 20 years old.<eos> One of 'em was a mare, one of 'em was a gelding.<eos> And they were almost inseparable.
Mm-mm. Hey, April.<eos> Are the cops here yet?<eos> I haven't seen them.<eos> Yeah, how's our victim doing?<eos> He didn't make it.<eos> He knows where I live.<eos> I know.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> The cops'll be here soon.<eos> They'll know what to do.
I messed up.<eos> Brett, what's going on?<eos> Chief, I know I should have said something to you sooner.<eos> Sooner?<eos> You should have called me from the scene.<eos> I would have met you at Med.<eos> Not left your side until I was sure that you were safe.<eos> Damn it, Brett.<eos> My job is to take care of my people.<eos> How can I do that if they're not being up front with me?
45 aldermen voted for Gallo's last contract.<eos> Isn't that all of them?<eos> All but five.<eos> And he's... he's pretty tied up with a lot of them.<eos> Donations, fundraisers, stuff like that.<eos> He's got the whole city council in his pocket.<eos> Yeah, it sounds like it.<eos> Winning this vote, it's a long shot, Matt.<eos> Yeah, but guys like Gallo?<eos> They'll just keep getting away with things like this until someone stands up to them.
Regress?<eos> No, you remember that time?<eos> You remember the last time we played Spin the Bottle?<eos> Hello?<eos> The cops can't watch you forever, Sylvie Brett.<eos> Come all out and be like, "Hey, I'm ready."<eos> Hey. Hey, who is it?<eos> Will you let me know if the situation changes?<eos> Yeah. Thank you.<eos> They tracked the call to an unregistered cell phone, but then it went dark.

Okay, I got this.<eos> - 4420 South Western Boulevard.<eos> - There you go.<eos> Well played.<eos> Gunshot wound to the abdomen.<eos> Give me some pads.<eos> How'd it go down?<eos> Suspect matched an investigative alert so the officers pulled him over.<eos> He drew a weapon, started shooting.<eos> They returned fire and...
- Excuse me, excuse me...<eos> Just give me a blink if I'm close.<eos> The situation is firmly in hand.<eos> Liar!<eos> My name is Oswald Cobblepot.<eos> We know who you are, Penguin.<eos> What do you want?<eos> What do I want?<eos> I want you to tell the truth to the people of Gotham.<eos> They would have us believe that there is no danger.
- Guess I'm finding a new bar.<eos> - I heard you ran into<eos> Fish Mooney yesterday.<eos> - So?<eos> - So... are you still interested in finding her?<eos> Every cop in the city's looking for her now.<eos> But I know where she's gonna be next.<eos> - Why are you telling me?<eos> - You see, I need something from the cops.<eos> They're not gonna tell me, but Bullock still trusts you.
A couple days ago.<eos> I tried to find you before I left.<eos> No worries.<eos> You remember what I discovered that night at Indian Hill?<eos> That there was a secret group that infiltrated my company.<eos> I wasn't paying attention.<eos> I needed time to research them.<eos> I couldn't do it here.<eos> Okay. I have a plan, but these people are powerful.<eos> We need to assume they know you and I are friends.
Uh, still out.<eos> Did you eat?<eos> Uh, no. You?<eos> I snacked with Young-Hee.<eos> How's that going?<eos> It's going.<eos> I'll make you something.<eos> How about eggs?<eos> Let's see what else we have.<eos> Turns out they were on her.
Speaking of which, I have news.<eos> Your son finished his tour.<eos> He's back home, safe.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Maybe what you've been getting from Breland helped him survive.<eos> Does he have anybody?<eos> Irina's father in Moscow.<eos> Any news on Martha?<eos> No. I want someone to contact her parents soon.<eos> I'll have the Centre call them when they think it's safe.

So...<eos> I see why you like it.<eos> You do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Things that are hard to talk about... that hurt too much...<eos> Maybe it's good that someone makes you look at those things.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I mean, it is weird talking in front of strangers, but...<eos> But they don't let you just stand there and say anything you want.<eos> You know, they question it.
Obviously FBI jurisdiction.<eos> This is my case.<eos> Great.<eos> You couldn't have just e-mailed?<eos> I wore a hat.<eos> Now I got to do my hair again.<eos> It's always good to see you, Gibbs.<eos> If you don't mind, I have to find your missing killer.<eos> Two prisoners escaped from Prickwillow Prison outside London.<eos> During a routine prison transfer, they took a guard hostage and stole the transport van, found dumped near River Blackwater.

You think Tony keeps his real estate statements here?<eos> Wait, are you talking about breaking into his personal files?<eos> It's not like he hasn't snooped on us.<eos> That's true. Mm.<eos> Or maybe there's another way.<eos> Maybe... we call in reinforcements.<eos> I agree.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Our prisoners, walking out after the murders.<eos> Looks like they're splitting up.
See, I think he only wants us to believe that.<eos> Blackmail?<eos> Did he actually get that lucky?<eos> Neither.<eos> Neither.<eos> Do both of you guys know the story here?<eos> On the case.<eos> Got it.<eos> A British prison break has left two convicted felons loose in the greater DC area.<eos> They split up.
Come on.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - For real.<eos> Do not tell me that you cheated on my boy.<eos> No, actually, it was his decision.<eos> Apparently he's been thinking about it all summer.<eos> You don't think there's something else going on?<eos> Wait, you think my boy cheated on you?<eos> Have any of you seen these articles?<eos> They're all about the fliers.
You, of all people, should be able to relate.<eos> So, you don't want to know what I found out?<eos> Say it.<eos> Dani was working a desk job on the day she claims she was attacked in Afghanistan.<eos> It's not a lie.<eos> You made that story up.<eos> I didn't make it up.<eos> I stole it.<eos> Most of the time I was over there,<eos> I had to file all the injury and casualty reports -- how soldiers were maimed, how they died, how many pieces they went home in.
This is fine.<eos> Um, is there anything else I can help you with today?<eos> Not unless you can get the last 12 hours of my life back.<eos> I'm kidding, Carol.<eos> I know it's not your fault.<eos> Knock, knock!<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi, Brick.<eos> Your folks called.<eos> They had a bit to drink in a bar.
I love whales and borders.<eos> Aw, honey.<eos> And then I don't even know why I bother caring at all.<eos> I'm just gonna end up like you anyway.<eos> No offense.<eos> Sue, you will always care just the right amount because that's you.<eos> - Really? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Yep, as a parent, sometimes you have 2-star days, sometimes you have 10-star days.<eos> Drive safe.<eos> But when the last one leaves the nest, you hope your customers are vaguely satisfied and that they'll come again and bring grandchildren.
So, I...<eos> No.<eos> S...<eos> I had a real epiphany tonight at the pizza place.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Seriously.<eos> There I was, picking up our one-millionth pizza, and I ran into this whole group of families from Brick's class... the Murphys, the Gelfands, the Trouts.<eos> And they were all playing pinball and singing songs and really having a good time.<eos> I literally don't know who any of those people are.<eos> Exactly, and the worst part was they didn't even feel awkward about it 'cause it didn't even occur to them to invite us.
Anyway, I guess they're all in this big clique together, and now we're on the outside looking in.<eos> Well, you tried.<eos> [Sighs]<eos> [TV turns on]<eos> [TV turns off]<eos> What about Cindy's parents?<eos> - Uh...<eos> - Uh...<eos> Why not?<eos> They're very nice people.
Bogie and Bacall over there.<eos> Okay, Brick.<eos> Wrap it up.<eos> Goodbye, Brick.<eos> Goodbye, Cindy.<eos> [Car door closes]<eos> I'll call you when I get there.<eos> [Engine starts]<eos> ♪<eos> Turns out, when Cindy's parents said they were moving away, they actually meant two houses away.
Everyone's good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Nothing, everything's fine.<eos> Why'd he lie?<eos> He never lies.<eos> He said he's going after my family.<eos> He always does what he says.<eos> Maybe he was just trying to scare you.<eos> Guys like Wilder, they don't usually break their MO.
That's mine.<eos> Is that where you've been this whole time?<eos> Working with Roberta Price?<eos> Well, I wouldn't say "working" with Price.<eos> Me and the guys went to help for a spell.<eos> She had some trouble in her region.<eos> Riots.<eos> Right.<eos> Said the Army's hands were tied, could I train some fellas to defend their homes?<eos> Only the number of fellas kept getting bigger and bigger and they weren't for security, they were enforcers.
It's the only way to see the second ship.<eos> Negative.<eos> If they're behind island cover, we'd be giving away our position for nothing.<eos> But if we do, we could target and kill.<eos> Commander, it's the only viable option.<eos> We just fired on Vulture Team.<eos> Vulture Team, missiles incoming.<eos> I say again, missiles incoming.<eos> Three missiles fired from Henan.<eos> They'll be on Vulture Team inside one minute.
Just go!<eos> [reporters all talking at once]<eos> Mr. Taro, what do you think about Ms. Avery's resignation?<eos> -What about the fake invoices?<eos> -And what about her resignation?<eos> Did Ms. Avery resign of her own accord or was she forced to resign?<eos> Please answer our questions.<eos> Mr. Taro, please!<eos> -[Fred] There are tweets about Julia.<eos> -What do they say?
You'll pay for this, Julia.<eos> You'll pay dearly for this.<eos> -What have you got to say for yourself?<eos> -Nothing.<eos> Are you letting the Internet speak for you?<eos> -Is it true?<eos> -What, that I slept with a dealer?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -I don't know, Dad.<eos> I don't ask the guys I sleep with whether they sell drugs.

I've always thought that about you.<eos> - Ms. d'Abrantès.<eos> - A question, please.<eos> Who will you vote for on Sunday?<eos> I preside over the Council, not the election.<eos> My vote is private.<eos> What is your view of the campaign?<eos> That it stinks.<eos> The two favorites to win are in the same Party.<eos> They're ripping one another to shreds.
- Shit.<eos> He's gained a point.<eos> I'll win it back.<eos> We'll take him down.<eos> You okay?<eos> I appreciate your commitment, Barbara.<eos> You're very beautiful.<eos> Sometimes I feel so alone.<eos> The ballot papers are no good.<eos> They're 2mm too small.
You will get your chance.<eos> But I never said anything like...<eos> - Mr. Deepak!<eos> Minal, the honorable Judge is saying that you'll get a chance to defend yourself.<eos> Just sit down and be quiet!<eos> Would you like to cross-examine him?<eos> - No, cross your honor.<eos> Minal Arora, please take the stand.<eos> The charges against you are quiet serious Do you have anything to say?<eos> Sir...they are all lying.
And then he started touching me.<eos> Then he pushed me onto the bed...and he started touching my...<eos> He touched my...<eos> That's all, your honor.<eos> Mr. Prashant, it seems quite clear why Andrea went into the room and why she stayed for so long etc. etc.<eos> But I do get your point.<eos> And your point leads me to the making of 'A girl's safety manual'.<eos> A girl should never go anywhere with a boy alone.<eos> Not to a resort... and definitely not to use the bathroom.<eos> Because by her doing that, people presume that since she has willingly come there... they have been issued a license to touch her inappropriately.
Her 'smile' will be considered a 'yes', and what is 'natural human behavior' can make her seem 'characterless' to him.<eos> That's her<eos> - Right? The Surajkund girl!<eos> - Yeah, that's her.<eos> I am being honest, sir.<eos> I've seen it with my own eyes, and so have Residents' Association members.<eos> Boys do come to their apartment often.<eos> That will be all, your honor.<eos> Mr. Gupta, about the boys...<eos> Could they be their friends?
I was talking about the logic of taking on this matter.<eos> PAIGE:<eos> Walt, people lost family.<eos> Have you forgotten how you felt when Megan passed?<eos> I felt awful.<eos> Because I missed who she was, not what she was.<eos> Her organic material meant nothing to me.<eos> I kept her ashes in a coffee can in my glove box.<eos> And that's messed up, Walt.<eos> Son, regular people need to get a sense of closure when they say good-bye to a loved one.

Um, Walter can a little brusque.<eos> We want hospital administrators giving us their equipment, not calling the cops.<eos> Don't look so down, buddy.<eos> Have you ever got a failing grade?<eos> (stammers) Don't be ridiculous.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, no, hey, hey, Ralph.<eos> What you coded was incredibly advanced.<eos> Your professor just couldn't follow it.<eos> People often reject what they can't understand.
I got it!<eos> Let's go!<eos> (low pulsing chirp)<eos> (thunder crashing)<eos> WALTER:<eos> They're almost at the edge of the third grid.<eos> Well, for someone who just met and forgave the man who killed his father, he seems to be doing okay.<eos> (thunder crashes)<eos> I don't know how he's keeping it together.<eos> In the military, you learn to hold your emotions in check-- you need to be on point-- but when the time is right, you need to acknowledge and process those feelings, or they will eat you alive.
Am I?<eos> Would you say that I'm a trusting person?<eos> I would. I'd say you're a very trusting person, sometimes to a fault.<eos> I guess I try to see the good in people.<eos> It's a wonderful quality.<eos> I wish I saw it in more of my patients.<eos> But it's naive, isn't it?<eos> Because not everyone's good.<eos> Some people just take.<eos> They take until there's nothing left.
He gets around.<eos> This guy's got warrants out against him across half the galaxy.<eos> Do either of you know anyone who works out of the Adara sector?<eos> - Not me.<eos> - I know a few guys.<eos> They run an import-export business.<eos> So, smugglers?<eos> - If you want to get technical.<eos> - Well, that's perfect.<eos> Maybe they can help us.
To kill him?<eos> If you've got a problem with that, it's a little late.<eos> It was your idea that got us here in the first place.<eos> It's one thing to kill a man in self-defense.<eos> It's a whole other thing to hunt him down and kill him for revenge.<eos> We're the ones who are being hunted.<eos> From the minute we stepped out of those stasis pods, we've been on the run.<eos> Cops, criminals, ‭corporations...<eos> it doesn't matter.<eos> They're all after us.

What?<eos> Easy there.<eos> I'd say, "Don't move,"<eos> but it's pretty obvious you're not going anywhere.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Chief Inspector Kierken, Galactic Authority.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> Don't struggle.<eos> It'll just make things worse.<eos> When my men get here, they'll dig you out.

That's enough.<eos> Shut up and get back to work.<eos> He was weak and a coward.<eos> You don't know anything about him.<eos> I know he didn't belong on your ship.<eos> For better or worse, he was a member of my crew, and you killed him.<eos> For that, you're gonna have to pay.<eos> You still need me.<eos> These tunnels are part of the old mine.<eos> They go on for miles.
- Four?<eos> - Yes?<eos> We've been contacted by Commander Truffault.<eos> She wants to know how it went.<eos> Complications?<eos> The ship jumped.<eos> They're gone.<eos> So your friends were unsuccessful?<eos> That remains to be seen.<eos> They're still on board.
No way.<eos> I'm gonna give him something else.<eos> A taste of his own medicine.<eos> No. - You two are even now.<eos> - What?<eos> You made him feel awful for missing your grandma's death.<eos> This is just a classic tit-for-tat situation.<eos> Your head's the tat, and your grandma was the tit.<eos> God, Carol, you're just like my parents.<eos> No matter what Mike did, they always took his side.
What the hell is this?<eos> Who cares about money now?<eos> What a dummy.<eos> He friggin' Smurfed me.<eos> It's not coming off.<eos> It's not coming off.<eos> What do I do?<eos> So there I am, standing between Denzel Washington's legs, and I'm saying, "Push, Denzel, push."<eos> And Denzel pops out the most beautiful little Siamese twins.<eos> They are perfect.
It's not over.<eos> He just wants me to think it is so I'll let my guard down.<eos> This is only the beginning.<eos> Carol, stop popping my alarm system.<eos> Okay, okay, this has got to stop.<eos> This is like McDreamy versus McSteamy redux.<eos> I'll stop when he stops, and he will never stop, Carol.<eos> Hey, I want you to see something.<eos> Look at these two little boys.<eos> They love each other so much.
You know what?<eos> Don't talk to me anymore.<eos> Fine.<eos> Oh, look what I found.<eos> You know... maybe I should've brought Rooster along.<eos> He's right, it has become a tradition.<eos> You know, Colt was really excited to be with you.<eos> Both your boys wanted to spend time with you, and I know you don't want to hear this but... it says something really nice about you.<eos> Why can't boys be more like cows?<eos> You could brand 'em, stick 'em out in a field, and they just stand there until they're ready to die.
You're not getting soft in your old age, are ya?<eos> Don't get too excited.<eos> You only get one glass.<eos> I'm saving the rest in case we get a surprise visit from John Elway.<eos> This turned out to be a pretty great opening day.<eos> Maybe this ought to be the new tradition.<eos> Send the boys hunting, and we have the house all to ourselves.<eos> You're a fucking idiot!<eos> Hell, I did my best.<eos> Left them both out in the middle of nowhere with guns and they still came back.
Lieutenant's got us busting tweakers up and down the coast.<eos> Well, you look the part.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, a couple of meth heads knocked over a watch store in Long Beach.<eos> You heard about that?<eos> - No. These guys were so high, they drove the car straight through the window.<eos> Must have been living in this car, too, because it smelled like piss and vomit.<eos> Those idiots killed a cop.<eos> So now they got half of California on this thing.<eos> - They killed a cop?
Well, I would have gone over and helped her take care of the baby if she called.<eos> Come on, Smurf. You took her kid.<eos> She has every right to be pissed.<eos> Tell her I hope she feels better.<eos> You're still so shy.<eos> I changed your diapers every day, baby.<eos> Go on. I won't look.<eos> Hey, sweetie, do you need anything?<eos> Don't tell your uncles.<eos> They've been on me for cash for weeks.

Seriously. Put it...<eos> Shit, that hurt!<eos> Yeah, there's more where that came from, asshole.<eos> So I guess it does have to be like that!<eos> Get the hell up!<eos> Get up! Get up!<eos> Shit!<eos> It was hilarious.<eos> All the way home, my parents were going on about what a strong single mother Smurf is.<eos> Which is amazing, given the fact that they just found out I've been sleeping with you at her house behind their backs.
I'm not cheating on you, Cath. Okay?<eos> Used to be a pain in the ass, trying to let them down gently without losing tips.<eos> Now I look forward to it, someone wanting to talk to me.<eos> I was at my dad's.<eos> He lives in a trailer over in Vista.<eos> I thought he was in for life.<eos> I guess the state thought 26 years was enough.<eos> You're talking to him?<eos> After everything he did to you...<eos> You telling me you wouldn't talk to your parents if they were still alive?
That's not true.<eos> You think I'm stupid?<eos> You don't even try to hide it.<eos> I don't think you're stupid.<eos> I think you've got real gifts.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What?<eos> You're fearless.<eos> You've got what it takes to do things your brothers won't.<eos> They can't.
Lena!<eos> Got you a present.<eos> Baz did not tell me that you guys were having a keg party.<eos> 'Cause I didn't invite him.<eos> Wanna get in some trouble?<eos> - All right, but be careful.<eos> Do you ever see any sharks?<eos> Yeah, sometimes. Wow.<eos> How big?<eos> Well, they're usually baby great whites, so they can be, like, 6 feet, 5 feet.
I'll sleep when the job is done.<eos> That's what's on your mind, the job?<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I just didn't... didn't sleep well.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah, I'm just...<eos> I'm thinking about my parents.<eos> What about 'em?<eos> Just, how on Sunday nights, if they weren't broke, we'd get burgers from Ruby's and go to the pier and watch people fish.

A place to sleep?<eos> Were they there for you, ever?<eos> If Smurf had to choose, do you honestly think she would hesitate to throw you to the wolves if it meant protecting one of your uncles?<eos> You're expendable, Josh.<eos> And you know it.<eos> You're like the colt who can't keep up with the herd when the wolves arrive.<eos> And the wolves are circling, Josh.<eos> Are you baking today? Of course I am.<eos> It's tradition.<eos> The boys expect it when they get back.
Guns?<eos> Any idea how much cash? - No.<eos> - Drugs?<eos> - They don't sell drugs.<eos> - But they use drugs.<eos> I mean, that must have been hard after your mother's overdose.<eos> So your uncles all participated in the bank robbery your Uncle Pope went to prison for.<eos> Josh?<eos> Look, I heard them talking.<eos> They were all there.
I have a secret hiding place for cookies.<eos> And if you can find it, I'll let you have as many as you want, okay?<eos> You gonna break the screen.<eos> Please stop.<eos> I'm trying to get warm.<eos> I caught a chill sleeping in this shit-box last night.<eos> Well, maybe Baz is wrong about all this, and the money never moves.<eos> I mean, what if the military just...<eos> You know, what if they don't recycle the fry grease?<eos> Maybe they just dump it in the ocean or something.
Who the hell do you think you're talking to? !<eos> We took it. It's in my room.<eos> What are you doing, man?<eos> I felt like we deserved a little bonus.<eos> Oh, really, now?<eos> Way to have some balls, bro.<eos> Go get it.<eos> Now!<eos> - Oh, yeah, like you weren't gonna?<eos> Couple of idiots, still think that they could...
Still in surgery.<eos> Doc says he's gonna be fine.<eos> KENSI:<eos> Do you remember the attackers mentioning anything?<eos> A time?<eos> Maybe a location?<eos> Only thing I heard was my brain frying.<eos> Uh, did you recognize anybody?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, whoever they were knew our disposal routine.
CALLEN:<eos> And another tracker.<eos> I'll take care of those.<eos> That's all of them.<eos> Good.<eos> It's been fun.<eos> Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You don't just put a bullet in a guy like this.<eos> His friends will find him and then they'll find us.
Her kiss is the last thing you'll see.<eos> So who's the target?<eos> It's not a target, it's a sale.<eos> Who's the buyer?<eos> Foreigners, from what I could put together.<eos> Whoever they are, I'm sure they're not nice.<eos> (clears throat)<eos> Leaders of the Triads, Armenian Mafia, the Molina cartel-- those guys have been untouchable for years.<eos> Yeah, that's all we need is these guys getting their hands on the JD-X.<eos> Yeah, they can sell it to the highest bidder.

It's over.<eos> You still don't get it!<eos> In!<eos> Close the door!<eos> I have a shot!<eos> Do not take the shot.<eos> GRANGER:<eos> Do not shoot that van.<eos> The explosives will blow us all to hell.<eos> They're on the move.
"Keep an eye on Garvey."<eos> Total scumbag.<eos> Say it. - In my defence, Fab...<eos> - Say it.<eos> Another one from the human side went over to Antoine.<eos> Third one this week. Why is this happening?<eos> Someone explain to me why this keeps happening.<eos> You have lost your monopoly.<eos> Used to be the dealers had to take whatever you gave them but now, Antoine's offering them more.<eos> And they feel safe going over to him because he got a big operation up and running fast.
Nah.<eos> I'm still here.<eos> I was all set, but I couldn't do it in the end.<eos> Thank Christ.<eos> What changed your mind?<eos> Wasn't able to say goodbye.<eos> People need me.<eos> Listen, Lewis, keep out of Troy for the moment.<eos> I'm trying to make things right with Fabien.<eos> The bosses decide they're going to go up against each other, and we run away and hide like we always do, while they ruin Troy.
My name is<eos> Commander Steve McGarrett, I'm with the Five-O task force.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Goodman, you mind if we come in and ask you a few questions?<eos> Aloha. I'm Keiko Mahoe, newly elected governor of Hawaii.<eos> And I am here to personally welcome you to a Oahu, the third largest of the Hawaiian Islands.<eos> You're not just a tourist, you're 'ohana.<eos> With over 250 properties...<eos> Chin, what do we got?<eos> We got two dead bodies here.<eos> They've each had their eyes gouged out.
With over 250 properties...<eos> Chin, what do we got?<eos> We got two dead bodies here.<eos> They've each had their eyes gouged out.<eos> We got exactly the same thing here.<eos> Anthony Hein was a serial killer.<eos> You know, maybe whoever murdered him knew that before we did.<eos> When you come to Hawaii, you're not just a tourist, you're 'ohana.<eos> Are we sure these murders are connected?<eos> Yes, ma'am, they're the same M.O.
We believe it's the work of this man.<eos> Who is he?<eos> I'm sure you heard about the body we found at the Palace this morning.<eos> That was this guy?<eos> Yes, ma'am. Lab found traces of all four victims' blood on his clothing.<eos> It doesn't appear that either of the couples knew each other.<eos> There were no valuables missing at either of the crime scenes.<eos> So far, everything's pointing towards this being serial.<eos> Why the eyes?<eos> We believe it has something to do with the fact that they were tourists.
Why the eyes?<eos> We believe it has something to do with the fact that they were tourists.<eos> Here to admire our beautiful island.<eos> So this guy murders four people within days of each other at the same hotel, then turns up dead?<eos> What's going on here, Commander?<eos> We're not sure.<eos> Could be a vigilante, maybe this guy had a partner who turned on him, we just...<eos> we don't know yet.<eos> We need to keep what happened here from the press.<eos> If people think they can't be safe in their hotel rooms, we jeopardize the one thing this island relies on the most.
What do you got?<eos> After much digging,<eos> I've come to the conclusion that those carvings are modeled after 11th century chess pieces.<eos> Pawns, to be exact.<eos> Chess?<eos> Maybe whoever knocked off Hein and Larsen thinks this thing is a game.<eos> Or, he was somehow using both men to commit murder.<eos> Maybe he considered them as instruments.<eos> His pawns.<eos> Right, and after they served their purpose, he got rid of 'em.
Save your breath, 'cause he's determined to have my noble sacrifice be in vain.<eos> Don't give me that look.<eos> That's good.<eos> You know what?<eos> If you need anybody else's organs, talk to Chin, 'cause I'm done.<eos> Detective Dunn, good to see you.<eos> Thought you guys could use a hand.<eos> All right, guys, I have eyes on every floor.<eos> My guys have been checking the elevators.<eos> They say a service car is not responding to the call button.
You sure?<eos> Oh, my God, you don't love me!<eos> I can't believe you brought me to an AA meeting to meet men.<eos> Oh, sweetie, this isn't just any AA meeting.<eos> Oh, my God, they're all so pretty.<eos> Don't be intimidated.<eos> They're just like you, but better.<eos> No kidding.<eos> Look at all these hot guys.<eos> Yeah. Some of them are gay, but they're all fun to look at.
I take it you're an expert on snipers.<eos> Trained sharpshooter myself-- one of only a few female agents.<eos> My divisional specialty is actually counterterrorism and behavioral profiling, but obviously sniper activity is a sub-specialty.<eos> Obviously.<eos> You said his signature is a single kill shot, but our sniper injures others, too.<eos> His first shot is to cover his motive, make us think it's random.<eos> Then, after the kill shot, he's gone.<eos> And public hysteria only helps his cover.<eos> Media, too, which is why he never uses a silencer.<eos> The more people panic, the less they witness.
I am already into it.<eos> What is that nonsense?<eos> Uh, this is Super Fun Guy Cuckoo Clay.<eos> I'm stressed and it helps.<eos> Two-two hands.<eos> Okay, look, does anybody have a read on where these plane are right now?<eos> There's your answer.<eos> I'm gonna look for vulnerable ports on the military wireless server networks.<eos> And I just got the navy's radar feed up on our monitors.<eos> They're circling L.A.
You're responsible for nothing.<eos> I need to take this.<eos> Woodrow, fill in Agent Gallo.<eos> Give him a full debriefing.<eos> First, my airspeed increased independently.<eos> Then altitude.<eos> I lost all flight controls and communications.<eos> One system failure after another.<eos> That's why the hackers turned on her comms.<eos> They wanted us to hear, blow by blow, how an F-130 was systematically usurped.

- and any plans...<eos> - we might devise?<eos> You know, I'm not too worried about these hackers!<eos> Took 'em an hour of joystickin' around to bring down a plane.<eos> If they had real skills, they'd have June doing scissors and rolls right now.<eos> Someone shut that guy up!<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Okay, see?<eos> The punks that are behind this don't speak English.<eos> If they did, they'd have sent June into a tailspin, 'cause I just called 'em out, and they are egomaniacal, highly intelligent, and antisocial.

Why?<eos> Symbolic. "We got you boxed in."<eos> They are trying to prove themselves to potential clients who want to bring the U.S. to its knees.

You find the European hackers, I'll get you Fruity Moons.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Lieutenant Commander, can you stay with us while we sort this out?<eos> Don't have much of a choice.<eos> Happy and I will jump on the Dark Web, see if anyone's bragging about what they did to Uncle Sam!<eos> No need.<eos> I just traced the hack to a section of Sofia, Bulgaria.<eos> Eastern Europe.<eos> Wow, who could've predicted that?<eos> Looks like they jumped onto a signal from a Pentagon white shoe out of Long Beach.
We follow his lead.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Truth is, as much as I hate flying, I am excited to get out of this garage.<eos> Between Tim and Walter and Happy and Toby, it's too tense.<eos> I'm getting out of my jimjams.<eos> Admiral.<eos> All aircraft are grounded.<eos> How are you gonna find a plane that can go at least Mach 4 and get you to Bulgaria in two hours?<eos> Don't worry, I got an idea.<eos> Um, speaking of planes, if the hackers pick up that we're messing with their signal, they will drive June's plane into the ground.
Toby's having a bad 24 hours.<eos> Paige, are you okay?<eos> It's been radio silence!<eos> Yes, Tim, we're both fine, thank you for a...<eos> You promised.<eos> But the Pentagon is going to need a new relay server.<eos> And a new building to put it in.<eos> Guys, the destroyers are still under hacker control.<eos> Their signal wasn't even interrupted for a second.<eos> They spoofed a signal to the white shoe office to sniff out anyone who could be posing a threat.

I got 500 American for some information.<eos> Are all these units 236 Cherkovna?<eos> 236 A, B, C, D.<eos> All right, which one of them has a bunch of teenage boys with computer skills?<eos> I tell you for a thousand.<eos> You know, the only thing I hate more than street drug dealers is one that makes my job harder.<eos> Listen.<eos> You get them out here, you get your grand.<eos> Okay? You're a very angry man.<eos> I think they knew we were coming.
Oh... that's our answer!<eos> When I was a kid, I got a metal detector for my birthday, and I tested it out by putting it up against our old tube TV.<eos> It created a magnetic field that ruined the set.<eos> Dad was not happy.<eos> So you want to create a magnetic field in the water to disrupt the hackers' link to the sub's computer system.<eos> We can use the McEwan pipeline.<eos> It's metal.<eos> If we put enough strong magnets inside, it'll create a palpable magnetic field.<eos> And when the sub passes through the field and the hacker" signal is disrupted, we reboot back control, and the Clayton quickly gets to the surface and powers down the sub.<eos> Once we power down, they won't be able to retake control of the vessel.

Where did you get that?<eos> Let's just say the officer's club doesn't have air-conditioning anymore.<eos> You're a real live wire, you know that?<eos> Guys, time's a factor.<eos> Right!<eos> Shutting off oil flow now.<eos> Happy, Paige, let's get in that hatch and get that pallet inside.<eos> Where are your friends?<eos> Listen, I'm not Walter, so I can't make heads or tails of what's on this thing.<eos> My best guess is that after the hackers realized that people were onto them in the U.S., they ran off, set up shop in some other locale.
He works in a movie theater?<eos> Apparently.<eos> Why?<eos> Most theaters show movies digitally now, so that's 900 gigabits per second, so its movies are beamed by satellite, which means that theater is one of the only places in Bulgaria that has the bandwidth necessary to implement a military-grade hack.<eos> This jerk sent his pals to the movies.<eos> Interpol will be by to get you before it gets too cold.<eos> My glasses. My glasses.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> No.<eos> My friends and I are in a lot of trouble, and I know it sounds crazy, but millions could die, and they don't even know it.
We missed it by seconds.<eos> Confirmed.<eos> But I still don't have control over my ship.<eos> Uh, Walt, remember when you tried to screw with the signal from the Pentagon office and they destroyed a high-rise?<eos> What do you think they'll do now?<eos> Sounds like retaliate.<eos> What you hear is a nuclear missile going into launch prep sequence.<eos> The hackers are launching a warhead?<eos> It's more peacocking.<eos> They're showing buyers the full extent of what they'll do if anyone tries to screw with 'em like we just did.
Preliminary data guarantees a strike on the continental United States.<eos> Cabe, we've got countdown on a missile that travels 14,000 miles per hour, and the only way to stop it is you getting to those hackers and snuffing the signal that's controlling all of this.<eos> I'm driving a two-cylinder lawn mower, and I've got it floored, and we're still a few minutes from the theater.<eos> That's gonna be a problem 'cause this missile launches in less than three minutes.<eos> And I just ran the coordinates.<eos> It's headed for Cody, Wyoming.<eos> Population 10,000.<eos> Hackers made a very strategic choice:<eos> demonstrate their destructive ability without completely crippling the country.<eos> Because crippling the country is what they're going to be selling for billions.
From launch to impact in Cody is about 3.8 minutes.<eos> And once I start messing around with the missile's GPS, the hackers will see what I'm doing and then try and stop us, so whoever hacks the fastest wins.<eos> It's our only option.<eos> Speaking of hackers, we're here.<eos> The servers need to be kept cool so the top floors are easy to ventilate.<eos> Countdown to launch.<eos> In five... four... three... two...<eos> Launch.<eos> I'm into the missile's GPS.<eos> If the hackers are watching, they'll see pretty quickly.

Is that Tokugawa Iemitsu, by any chance?<eos> Historians view him as a particularly brutal warlord and...<eos> Did I say something?<eos> Tomorrow I'm to be married to Tokugawa Iemitsu.<eos> Then my life is over.<eos> How can you bring a thug on a rescue mission?<eos> I've known men like you.<eos> Men who take and prey on the weak.<eos> Listen, girly, I'm risking my neck for two morons who fell out of a ship. Why?<eos> 'Cause they'd do the same for me.
It's like "Ninja III:<eos> The Domination."<eos> Never took you for a cinephile.<eos> All I know is ninjas like to hide in trees.<eos> - I don't see anything.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> You don't find them, they find you.<eos> Just because you saw ninjas in a movie, that doesn't make them real.<eos> I have to side with Mick on this one.<eos> They're real.
Had to go to the bathroom.<eos> You okay?<eos> We were attacked by zombies.<eos> And someone put sprouts on my sandwich.<eos> The Time Pirate's distress call referenced something called a TX-90.<eos> It's a futurist bioweapon.<eos> The infected's condition represents strongly those things... that... I can't say.<eos> And if that infected Time Pirate is out there spreading this virus, then our work is not done here.<eos> No kidding.<eos> Having zombies, or whatever they are, running around the Civil War is not a good thing.
I'm with the additional staff for tonight's festivities.<eos> Oh, so you're ignorant about the house rules?<eos> See, my staff know better than to talk back to me.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> Won't happen again, sir.<eos> Don't you turn your back on me, boy.<eos> There a problem, Mr. Collins?<eos> Just a house boy who don't know his place.<eos> And needs to be taught some manners.<eos> These zombies, they're...

I'm here for General Grant.<eos> The Union general?<eos> He sent me to steal details of Confederate troop movements.<eos> Even if you could get your hands on them, there ain't no way off this plantation, Mr. Jackson.<eos> - There's always a way.<eos> - No.<eos> Master Collins got guard dogs.<eos> Cuban bloodhounds.<eos> Yeah, we had some friends.<eos> They got caught less than a mile out.

W-we're not doing anything.<eos> But you, on the other hand...<eos> Look, Marty, I know that you're scared.<eos> I've been nothing but scared since my suit was destroyed.<eos> I've been terrified that I have nothing to offer the team.<eos> But you have to get over your fears if we're gonna survive this.<eos> We've only seen these things downwind from here.<eos> We can pick them off in this valley until they're all gone.<eos> I got my best men on the ridge to the West.<eos> But reports are, they are running out of ammunition.
No.<eos> You've just witnessed the very worst of humanity.<eos> We share a psychic connection, but I still can't even begin to fathom what you must be feeling.<eos> It must be... like your heart is broken.<eos> Yeah. It is.<eos> But I saw something in those people's eyes I...<eos> I didn't expect to see.<eos> I saw hope.<eos> I saw dignity.<eos> Those men and women, they were treated worse than animals.

- of the Cold War.<eos> - How do you know all that?<eos> Because I was in the capital for that very summit.<eos> The Reagan Administration would call upon the top nuclear physicists to act as technical advisors.<eos> You think someone might have traveled back in time to stop the treaty from being signed?<eos> That, or worse.<eos> Think about it,<eos> Reagan and Gorbachev under the same roof at one of the most volatile moments in history?<eos> The JSA has a training academy in D.C.<eos> I could reach out to the current membership, see if they have any intel or resources we could use.
But I...<eos> I haven't the slightest notion why.<eos> Trying to work out your frustration?<eos> Something like that.<eos> What happened out there today?<eos> You lost control.<eos> Says you.<eos> That man back in town, the drinker, the gambler, the animal that wants to watch the whole world burn... that's the real me.<eos> I happen to know a thing or two about animals.<eos> They're not vicious by nature.
Okay? He just needed to save his family, and in doing that, he ended up destroying mine.<eos> You know, all this time traveling, fighting aliens, this is the stuff I used to dream about as a kid.<eos> Heh. Yeah, me too.<eos> But it doesn't feel like a dream.<eos> It just feels weird.<eos> Well, exactly, and it's only gonna get weirder.<eos> So that's why we have to be able to rely on our friends.<eos> I really wish I could right now, Felicity.<eos> But he's not my friend.<eos> - They're taking off.
Projected casualty count is around 2 million non-meta-humans.<eos> Okay, so what if we negotiated with them?<eos> Yeah, I don't know if you noticed, but our last chat with him didn't go so well.<eos> Well, what've we got to lose?<eos> Look, maybe we should contact them.<eos> Then make it fast.<eos> We've got incoming.<eos> Dominator ships are coming in worldwide.<eos> Including Central City.<eos> Yeah, but they're not moving or anything.

I got a better idea.<eos> How 'bout I show you how business is done in my town?<eos> You or me?<eos> Oh, I've got... this.<eos> By now you've probably surmised that my friend and I aren't from around here.<eos> - What do you freaks want?<eos> - To help.<eos> I thought I made...<eos> did I not make that perfectly clear?<eos> New enemies are coming to Chicago, and they will endanger your enterprises.
My name is Ray Palmer.<eos> I have reason to believe that your life may be in danger.<eos> It'd be best if you came with me.<eos> Mr. Ness, I'm Sergeant Jones with Chicago PD.<eos> We're your security detail on the way to the bureau.<eos> Thank you for your concern, Mr. Palmer, but it looks like I'm in good hands.<eos> Okay.<eos> What just happened? Well, it's the strangest thing.<eos> Uh, two cops just escorted Eliot Ness to the bureau.<eos> They're not escorting him to the bureau.

Welcome to Chicago, Mr. Ness.<eos> All this for some booze?<eos> I like it. Nice getups.<eos> Seems our new friends have got some friends of their own.<eos> I'm going after Capone.<eos> Let 'em go, we got Ness.<eos> - Is he dead?<eos> - Unconscious. He took on a lot of water.<eos> Merlyn was right.<eos> They took the bait.
A full-grown human progeny who I never even knew I had.<eos> - This beautiful, brilliant...<eos> - And not real. At first, no, but then I remembered.<eos> I remembered the... The countless nights I spent pacing the neighborhood with her stroller, trying to get her to sleep. The... the...<eos> The way my heart melted the first time she smiled at me.<eos> The... the distress she caused her kindergarten teacher when she insisted on singing the periodic table instead of the alphabet.<eos> I-I... I remembered all of it.<eos> But none of that happened to you.<eos> But the memories are real.<eos> They are a part of me now.
I gave you an out.<eos> Not just a chance to survive, but to live a better life.<eos> I already found a better life.<eos> One without you in it.<eos> But what about your friend, Martin Stein?<eos> Where is he?<eos> My dear, that information comes at a cost.<eos> Don't look so glum, professor.<eos> You'll be in good company at the bottom of this here river.<eos> Thieves, snitches, do-gooder cops, they've all run afoul in my organization, but you...
Wait, I...<eos> Dad.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why'd you want to see me?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Look...<eos> I know it's been really hard for you, seeing Jesse with speed.<eos> I just keep thinking of what Harry said.<eos> How sometimes it takes a while for powers to manifest.<eos> Yeah, Harry also said that they may never manifest.
Me?<eos> Yeah. You.<eos> Don't blame me for this.<eos> I tried to help.<eos> Help her or help me?<eos> Listen, Harry.<eos> Maybe the reason she's shutting you out is because you're not trying to understand<eos> - what she's going through.<eos> - I don't need to...<eos> Maybe if you helped her navigate her powers rather than just assuming they'll destroy her, she'd turn to you rather than push you away.
It's just so strange being responsible for all of this and not remembering any of it.<eos> What do you remember about how you got your powers?<eos> How this all began?<eos> I started having dreams, at night, of Magenta.<eos> - Dreams?<eos> - They were more than dreams.<eos> It was like I was living another life or something.<eos> And then I started getting them all the time.<eos> During the day.<eos> And the more it happened, the more painful they became.
My f... My fear... my guilt... has kept both of us back for far too long.<eos> You know you've always been my hero.<eos> But now... it's time for me to let you be one for everyone else.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hey! - Hey, you just made it.<eos> Yeah, I had to make sure Frankie was okay.<eos> So, are you ready to try this again?<eos> Um...actually, I had a thought about why our last date was so boring.<eos> Here you go.<eos> So, I know that you think that I shouldn't use my powers, and it's not that. I'm nothing without them, but they are a part of me now, you know?

It's a bit like you with rule breaking... a momentary fix, and now you're lazy, sloppy.<eos> Cool.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think The Flash is actually a source of inspiration for the city.<eos> I think he kind of provides hope.<eos> Yes, well, that's one of many things that we'll have to disagree on, Allen.<eos> What?<eos> You see something?<eos> A pattern.<eos> The creature's movements, they seemed random at first, but they were contained to a prescribed area.
No one will ever know about this.<eos> I promise.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Just go.<eos> Every time there's been a sighting of the monster, multiple transformers have blown.<eos> Hmm, so it's definitely feeding off electricity.<eos> Mm-hmm, and see, I mapped out all the streets that it's been spotted around.<eos> Never leaves a ten-block radius.<eos> You know, this is exactly what I was talking about.<eos> Some meta's been gifted this incredible power, and this is the very best thing they can do with it... terrorize a city.
- Well, what do you want?<eos> To help people achieve their true potential.<eos> I know you want this more than anything, but you have to face the fact that it might not happen.<eos> There's a whole multiverse of Harrison Wells out there.<eos> - Call me HR.<eos> - You're a fake.<eos> Let me prove my worth.<eos> If I fail, I will right back to my Earth.<eos> If I succeed, I will have done some good with my life.<eos> Caitlin, these powers you have, the more you use them, the more difficult they're going to be to reverse.
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,<eos> I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.<eos> After defeating Zoom and saving the multiverse, I ran back in time and created the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.<eos> I restored the timeline to how it was, only to find things weren't as I left them.<eos> I brought new threats to our world, and I'm the only one fast enough to stop them.<eos> I am The Flash.<eos> Previously on "The Flash"...<eos> Caitlin, I'm sorry, honey.<eos> These powers you have...<eos> the more you use them, the more difficult they're going to be to reverse.
You're pathetic.<eos> Alchemy can't help you.<eos> But we can.<eos> I promise.<eos> Oh, like you promised Eddie?<eos> And like you promised Ronnie?<eos> You know, for a hero, Flash, you sure let a lot of people around you die.<eos> This isn't you talking.<eos> It's the powers.<eos> They're messing with your mind.
Do you know what they want?<eos> They've ignored all attempts to communicate, but we do know, just like before, that the dropships contain reconnaissance teams sent here to gather more intel about us.<eos> Looking for our weaknesses.<eos> - We need to do something.<eos> - We are.<eos> Nearly every member state in the UN is in talks to coordinate a response.<eos> Action is being taken.<eos> So, wait, you want us to just sit this one out?<eos> These things are like "World War Z" zombies.<eos> If they decide to attack, no military can stop them.
Where are you going?<eos> If they can't shut it down, maybe she can.<eos> Hey, Supergirl!<eos> Let's finally see who's faster.<eos> Too slow.<eos> - What is he doing?<eos> - He's making her angry.<eos> But he knows Supergirl is invincible.<eos> Think maybe that's the point.<eos> Guys, they're back.
Don't worry.<eos> His bark's way worse than his bite.<eos> And you're going to get it worse than anyone.<eos> Uh, thanks?<eos> The people that we are looking at have at least some experience on the street.<eos> You have the farthest way to go before I'm convinced that you can do this.<eos> I can do it, sir.<eos> Don't call me "sir."<eos> - Ok, Oliver. - Don't call me Oliver, especially in front of the recruits.<eos> We don't know these people, and they can't know us.
Sergeant Diggle here will be running the Op.<eos> Wheels up at 0400.<eos> All right, gentlemen, get some rest.<eos> You're going to need it.<eos> Dismissed!<eos> You good, soldier?<eos> I got through basic training no sweat, but this is my first day in the soup, and I don't want to be scared, but I am a little.<eos> Fear is part of war, the part that keeps us alive.<eos> See these stripes?<eos> They give me strength, clarity.

He's not here.<eos> Give me a minute while I scan the feeds.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What?<eos> They moved him into gen pop.<eos> You go in there, neither of you are getting out.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> When's he coming back to his cell?<eos> Outside our window.<eos> If those MPs wake up, the first thing they're gonna do is move John and all the other prisoners to a more secure location, and we lose our shot.
Do not touch circuit board.<eos> Is ok, Oliver.<eos> First time I try, I nearly lose finger.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> Declaration of war against Bratva.<eos> By who?<eos> Your friend...<eos> Kovar.<eos> I'm proud of our new zoning ordinance along with the work that's being done by the ACU.<eos> Our citizens need to feel safe, but they also need homes and jobs.
He's over there!<eos> Right behind you!<eos> Watch out!<eos> He's over there!<eos> I see him!<eos> Look out!<eos> He's behind you!<eos> I got him!<eos> Who the hell are those guys?<eos> They're just shooting into the dark.
Right behind you!<eos> Watch out!<eos> He's over there!<eos> I see him!<eos> Look out!<eos> He's behind you!<eos> I got him!<eos> Who the hell are those guys?<eos> They're just shooting into the dark.<eos> It's because they're scared.
Such as looking for anagrams in case Prometheus was sending a message in the names of the victims he's been choosing.<eos> - Is he?<eos> - Kind of.<eos> Ahh. First 4 victims--<eos> Tobias Church, Sam Conahan, Peter Meld, and Gay Eked.<eos> Victims 3 and 4 were not random.<eos> We think Prometheus is using those names as anagrams to spell out other names.<eos> Adam Hunt, Ted Gaynor, Palmer Cokes, Sachi Beech.<eos> Those names supposed to mean anything to us?<eos> They do to him.
What's gotten into you today?<eos> For the past 3 weeks, either been living here or at HIVE.<eos> Call it cabin fever.<eos> Well, how about you don't take it out on me?<eos> I don't even know why you're teaching us how to use these things.<eos> What good is wooden stick if the other guy's got a gun?<eos> You ever heard of Slade Wilson?<eos> He could take you down in about two seconds with a wooden stick.<eos> Actually, they're more than just wooden sticks.<eos> They're from the Philippines, and their technical name is--
I--I can not only see the past.<eos> I can see the future, but most importantly, I can see where people are.<eos> So you're one of them...<eos> Metahuman?<eos> Yeah. Don't sound too excited about it.<eos> Ok. So this is it.<eos> Just--just please don't break it any more than it is already broken.<eos> Ok. Cool.<eos> I saw them.<eos> They're in some kind of stasis, like a ship.
- What hell?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Been remembering things. It's like they're dreams but they're not, John.<eos> I don't think that any of this is real.<eos> We're real, but whatever's playing these head games with us, I don't think it's fully working.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Because the Queen's Gambit-- they've put me into a world where I never got on my father's boat.<eos> Oliver, I don't know if these are memories or feelings, but I think you're a hero, and I don't think it's because of any boat.<eos> These head games aren't over.<eos> They are gonna push back against whatever we do.
- Speedy.<eos> - She knows, Ollie.<eos> She knows, and she doesn't want to go.<eos> The better question is why would you want to?<eos> Because none of this is real.<eos> It's real enough, ok?<eos> It's--it's better than our real lives.<eos> In--in this life, Laurel is alive, my parents are alive.<eos> But those are not your parents.<eos> They remember the only lullaby that would actually work to put me to sleep.

I can't lose my family.<eos> Ok.<eos> Ok. All right.<eos> I want you to be well, I want you to be happy. I love you, Thea.<eos> Where's Thea?<eos> Thea's staying.<eos> Have you explained to Ray what we have to do? Yeah.<eos> Apparently, we have to get to an office tower that my non-fiancée doesn't own, which is a little strange.<eos> All that coming from a guy who's been having memories that he's able to shrink.<eos> Well, whatever we're doing, we have to do it fast because whatever the Dominators have done to us, they would have built in safeguards.

You wanted proof of a divine plan to the universe, right?<eos> Guys, I'm getting references to 5 Terran captives here, ok?<eos> The signal's coming from--that's not possible.<eos> -3.127 latitude,<eos> -23.7987 longitude.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Geographical coordinates don't have any negative numbers.<eos> I mean, they do.<eos> Only when--<eos> Oh, my God. I think I know where they are.
Right?<eos> Besides, how can you be so surprised?<eos> I'm Moira Queen's daughter, and that means throwing a killer Christmas party is in my blood.<eos> Mom and dad would be very proud of you, Speedy.<eos> Me?<eos> Come on.<eos> You're the mayor.<eos> They'd be so happy, they wouldn't know what to do with themselves.<eos> Are you all right? Because what the Dominators showed us, it was a little like losing them all over again.<eos> They didn't take anything away from me.

Come look at this.<eos> TB outbreak in Lamb Valley?<eos> Since when?<eos> Since this guy got greedy.<eos> That's one smug-looking son of a bitch.<eos> Justin Claybourne owns Claybourne Pharmaceuticals that recently acquired the rights to this drug Dycloseral, which fights this particular strain of TB.<eos> As soon as the outbreak started, he jacked up the prices.<eos> Price went from $10 a pill to $1,000 overnight.<eos> The people in Lamb Valley, they're working class, low income.<eos> They can't afford this.
He created the epidemic.<eos> He's connected to something called the AK Desmond Group.<eos> They are black marketeers who specialize in creating bioweapons.<eos> What do you think they've been working on?<eos> Weaponized tuberculosis.<eos> He created the marketplace, Diggle, and he didn't care who died in the process.<eos> And now you're gonna kill him.<eos> How can you read what's in that folder and have a problem with that?<eos> Have you thought about the ramifications of your actions, of actually crossing names off a list, of being judge, jury, and executioner?<eos> Men like Claybourne buy judges, they buy juries.
Whether or not Billy's alive-- and believe me, I hope that he is-- the ACU and the SCPD, they need instructions.<eos> Well, we've had a BOLO out for weeks.<eos> I'm not talking about a be on the lookout order.<eos> I'm talking about a shoot to kill.<eos> I don't know how that will sit with the public.<eos> I do.<eos> They'll love it.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because they are sick and tired as I am of watching this psycho murder Star City's finest and get away with it.<eos> Our cops need to know that they can fight back.

Come on.<eos> The money, the Porsche.<eos> Lars wished for them, and his wishes were granted...<eos> And here we go.<eos> ...by a genie!<eos> Lars found Aladdin's lamp!<eos> Perfect!<eos> Thank you, Diane.<eos> - Yeah? Look at this.<eos> These books from Lars' apartment on "1001 Arabian Nights," they all have handwritten notes in them.
is a romantic metaphor, nothing more.<eos> Of course, but what if...<eos> and I... and I'm only saying what if the legend of genies were based in fact?<eos> Well, I certainly hope it isn't.<eos> Genies are frightful creatures.<eos> You're saying they're not cheery '60s housewives or singing blue cartoons?<eos> I'll put it to you like this.<eos> In Arabic, they use the same word for "demon"<eos> as they do for "genie."<eos> They're dangerous, capricious tricksters who appear and disappear in gentle breezes or a whirlwind of dust.
Okay, great. Ooh, can you just... can you make sure that he gets dibs on the first rub, please?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Good. Thanks.<eos> Can't believe I said that.<eos> NYPD!<eos> NYPD!<eos> Are you in here?<eos> Clear. Looks like Yuruk skipped town.<eos> Why are you playing with the carpets?<eos> I'm checking if they're magic.
If one wished to keep priceless history safe from looters and terrorists, there is no better place for them to wait out the conflict than in the basement of the Smithsonian.<eos> It was a pleasure meeting you both.<eos> Come along, Genie.<eos> That...<eos> She was... That... So, I just got off the phone with Ryan.<eos> There's been some complications with Jenny's labor.<eos> Hey. Everything was normal, uh... until Jenny started hyperventilating.<eos> She lost consciousness.<eos> Doctors think it might be a, uh, amniotic fluid embolism.<eos> But they're... they're trying to stabilize her now... so that, uh... they can deliver the baby.
Second shelf.<eos> So what happened at work today?<eos> They sent me home.<eos> I'm fine, you know, but 'cause I have a history of mental illness, they send me home when I make one mistake.<eos> Okay. I get it.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> What, I don't get how shitty Gallagher genes are?<eos> I have to set a timer every time I want to have a beer.<eos> Frank's genes might not be quite as bad as Monica's, but...<eos> But they suck.
I don't think you have to worry about any of that stuff.<eos> Speaking of stuff, what about his stuff?<eos> What if his stuff doesn't work?<eos> That doesn't mean you can't have fun.<eos> Yeah. His tongue's not in a wheelchair.<eos> Thanks.<eos> This is perfect.<eos> Do people always stare at you?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They're staring at you.
Yeah. His tongue's not in a wheelchair.<eos> Thanks.<eos> This is perfect.<eos> Do people always stare at you?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They're staring at you.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> You're a giant.<eos> They think you might eat them.
What do you want?<eos> Can we talk?<eos> I'm working.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm a customer.<eos> I want to get something pierced.<eos> What would you recommend?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Some people get their nose or tongue.<eos> Both solid ideas, but I have a job where people see me while they're eating.
Come down slowly!<eos> Hands where we can see 'em!<eos> Got him? Yeah.<eos> Hands behind your back.<eos> It's empty.<eos> Go and check the cargo hold.<eos> You bet.<eos> Where is everybody?<eos> Where are all your passengers?<eos> They paid me to fly here empty.
Sweetheart, listen to me.<eos> You think I'd do this if I had another option?<eos> I don't have another option.<eos> I'm gonna end this thing.<eos> I'm gonna end this thing now, you understand?<eos> Yeah, this is good.<eos> Okay, listen, I'm gonna need you to stay here with your mother, understand?<eos> Wait, wait, where are you going?<eos> I gotta go head these guys off.<eos> I gotta find these guys before they find you...
Whoever did this must have got the jump on him.<eos> Or maybe he knew his attacker.<eos> What else do we know?<eos> Well, Makana's retinal scan was used to access the facility at 11:32 p.m.<eos> We're thinking our perp used him to get inside, then executed him.<eos> We got any idea what these guys were after?<eos> No, CEO is on his way down to talk to us now.<eos> So far, everyone we've talked to hasn't really given us much.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> They don't want us to know what they're working on here.
I've been going through the footage.<eos> Turns out, the elephant escape was actually a botched kidnapping.<eos> Somebody was trying to rescue the animal from the circus.<eos> I did get a pretty good screen-grab of one of the people involved.<eos> That's great.<eos> But why are we whispering?<eos> Because.<eos> Look at this.<eos> It's the only image we have of the perpetrator.<eos> They're very aware of the cameras, very prepared.
Make any demands yet?<eos> Radio silence.<eos> You got anybody in lockup?<eos> Not since last night.<eos> Then what the hell does he want?<eos> Duke, who's he got with him?<eos> That's David Atowa.<eos> He's our property clerk, works in the evidence room.<eos> Tell your men to stand down.<eos> There's no way they're gonna stop this guy.
I just need more time.<eos> Mr. Shioma has given you over a month to make good on your debt.<eos> Time's up.<eos> I'd like to report two murders.<eos> You can find the bodies in the Makua Kea'au Forest Reserve.<eos> How do you know this?<eos> 'Cause I put them there.<eos> Prosecutor's last and final offer was 18 months.<eos> We accepted.<eos> Before you think of saying anything, know this-- I have people outside your house, right now, and if they don't hear from me in exactly ten minutes, she's dead.
Is that clear?<eos> Good.<eos> SWAT is currently tied up helping Corrections with the prison evac.<eos> Aviation is up, but the K-9s are still 15 to 20 out.<eos> We're not waiting for the dogs, all right?<eos> We got to move.<eos> These guys have got a big head start on us already.<eos> If we want to catch them before the sun goes down, we got to move right now, got it? Kono.<eos> All right, so the escapees were last seen headed north.<eos> So far, they've avoided H-3 to the west, which is already crawling with HPD checkpoints.

Get your ass up now, or we're gonna break your neck and carry you.<eos> If you let him stop the bleeding, he walks faster.<eos> We all want that, right?<eos> He's right.<eos> Make it quick.<eos> You guys keep moving.<eos> We'll catch up.<eos> Okay, so the stabbing of Hamasaki happened in the prison laundry room, away from cameras and guards.<eos> There were four witnesses.<eos> Conveniently, they all came down with a case of amnesia.
I mean, you know, she's like the sister I never had.<eos> But maybe you didn't know that the man you had set up to be killed this morning is her husband.<eos> That makes him 'ohana.<eos> And that makes this very, very personal.<eos> So if you ever want to see your children again without a piece of glass and a telephone between you and them, you're gonna tell me who paid you to put Adam Noshimuri on that bus.<eos> Where are Garavito and Aquino?<eos> They should've caught up to us by now.<eos> - Maybe the cops grabbed them.<eos> - Who cares?<eos> All they did was slow us down anyway.
Housekeeper arrived this morning and found them tied up on the floor.<eos> Their infant daughter, however, was left untouched in her crib.<eos> I thought this was a kidnapping.<eos> If the parents are accounted for and so is the kid, who's the victim?<eos> Addison Wells. 22 years old, originally from Minnesota.<eos> She's currently a senior at Oahu State.<eos> She started babysitting for the Hillers six months ago.<eos> Parents are getting on a flight to Hawaii.<eos> Minneapolis PD is up on the phones, but so far no ransom call.<eos> Well, I think if they wanted a ransom, they would've taken the kid.
He authored Cherry Bomb.<eos> Well, look at this.<eos> Captain Bird Turd is slumming it with the code jockeys again.<eos> What, did you blow through your millions already?<eos> Nope.<eos> I was hoping you could help my boy here.<eos> See, someone's been using Cherry Bomb to creep on his sister.<eos> Sorry to hear, but I just give people the tools to hack, it's up to them to do so responsibly.<eos> Besides, my customers pay top dollar to stay anon.<eos> Except they're not so anonymous to you.
The same one that put you in the emergency room.<eos> My dear, save your money.<eos> I can do the sketch.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We'll leave it to the pros.<eos> I guarantee you I'll do a better job.<eos> Hirsch, a composite sketch is not like one of your caricatures.<eos> It's an important forensic tool.<eos> We need to have the most accurate description possible.<eos> And the sketch artist has ways of helping people remember exactly who they saw.
She had strong ties to the community, and she was active in her little girl's school.<eos> What's her occupation?<eos> Well, she told her neighbors she was into finance.<eos> Said her expertise was in emerging Latin American markets or some such thing.<eos> She hadn't managed to find a job on the Island anywhere yet, but she said she was interviewing.<eos> I also spoke with the Mexican government-- I figured maybe there was something she was into over there that followed her over here, but they said they didn't know anything about that.<eos> But... here's what they do have on her.<eos> Vanessa was born in La Tuna, which is a small town in Sinaloa.<eos> Both her parents were farmers.<eos> They're deceased now.
After she got free, she ran for the bedroom.<eos> And when I realized where she was going, I... I locked myself inside the safe room.<eos> She hit the panic button, grabbed a gun out of the dresser.<eos> She wasn't fast enough.<eos> Guy came in and shot her before she could pull the trigger.<eos> After that, he picked up the gun and took off.<eos> I waited till he was gone, then I came out.<eos> I tried to help her, but it was too late.<eos> Then I heard the cops coming.<eos> I was afraid if they found me, they'd think I did it.
She's not gonna talk, but if we keep her out there, we can monitor her and maybe get a lead.<eos> And what if we don't, then?<eos> How are we gonna find Sara?<eos> Her bracelet.<eos> What about it?<eos> Chin just said something about Sara having a bracelet.<eos> So?<eos> I worked a kidnapping case years ago-- a young daughter of a wealthy family.<eos> The only way we could find her was thanks to a GPS chip in her necklace.<eos> Parents thought she might be a target, so they made her wear it all the time.
You know I have, uh, experience driving one of these, right? Yeah, yeah.<eos> On a highway in the middle of nowhere.<eos> City driving is a different animal.<eos> Different.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Hey, Jerry, I need a 20 on those SUVs.<eos> Three blocks and closing.<eos> Two blocks.<eos> Yeah, I got 'em I see them.<eos> You think they know we're on the bus?
She told you what this is all about.<eos> She told you the truth.<eos> - Johnny... - So she played you.<eos> It happens.<eos> And now you're gonna suck it up, and you're gonna let her go.<eos> Johnny... you don't whip up an angry mob and then just tell them to go home.<eos> One way or another, someone was always gonna hang.<eos> Nobody hangs today.<eos> Crowd wants blood, son.<eos> Hers, yours, with a rope or bullet... they don't care.
Old habits die hard in Old Town.<eos> Give me the other one.<eos> How could you?<eos> Your own people...<eos> You're not my people.<eos> What did she offer you?<eos> Only what we all want, Herin:<eos> to live forever.<eos> What will you tell the rest of Old Town?<eos> What they need to hear, of course.
You cannot sideline me.<eos> Sir.<eos> No bodyguard, Leo?<eos> That's pretty careless of you.<eos> David will be along any second now.<eos> Happy to see you, Miguel.<eos> Or whatever the hell your name is.<eos> One day you're at my home, the next day you're missing.<eos> We were all concerned.<eos> Oh, yeah, those guys you sent over to kill me-- they-they seemed really worried.

- Goodbye. - Goodbye.<eos> Rita!<eos> Lady Debora, she was right here, don't worry.<eos> There she is!<eos> I told you she was here.<eos> Get off the bike. Get off.<eos> Some guys came last night and took everything.<eos> We couldn't do a thing.<eos> Fuck, there's nothing left, not even here!<eos> They took all the weapons, those bastards!
The Niflheim attack was an attempt on the lives of the visiting Lucian royalty.<eos> Noctis!<eos> Please.<eos> Help us!<eos> King Regis!<eos> Lunafreya...<eos> Luna!<eos> From that day until this day Tenebrae has been gripped in the iron fist of Niflheim sworn enemy of Lucis.<eos> King Regis assembles a force of mighty warriors to combat the imperial menace.<eos> Dubbed the Kingsglaive, they fight relentlessly against Niflheim empowered by the magic of their sovereign.
For hearth!<eos> - And home.<eos> - And home.<eos> So, Nyx the Gatekeeper.<eos> How's the new post treating you?<eos> Oh, it's amazing.<eos> You guys would love it.<eos> The gate watch are real sweethearts.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> We all know they hate us outsiders more than anything.

But I don't wanna be the reason why you don't shove crank into your veins.<eos> Okay? I don't want that responsibility.<eos> Hey... all that stuff I said to Westfall... it was bullshit, you know, you gotta give the shrink something to get 'em off your back, right?<eos> Sure.<eos> ... then my dad kicked me out again, when he found out that I worked as a prostitute and lived as he didn't wanna face the fact that I was homeless and... sleeping in doorways and down alleys and on the street.<eos> Hey, you're an Allie cat.<eos> ♪ Yeah, 'cause we're wearin' green! ♪ Um-hm.<eos> Do... right. Deal, you dickhead.<eos> Well, they're everywhere.<eos> I told her that snails need to be outside but she said that they needed friends and they needed a home.
Doreen's been looking after me.<eos> Really?<eos> Where is she?<eos> Ran off somewhere.<eos> I understand.<eos> She wouldn't want to be seen too close.<eos> Mr. Stewart's okay.<eos> Stewart?<eos> God, guards, they're worse than cops.<eos> You try to seek their protection they will just use your information and throw you to the wolves anyway.
W-We've actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.<eos> But we won't bore you with the details.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I love science.<eos> Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Mike deGrasse Tyson.<eos> Mike deGrasse Tyson?<eos> Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a mustache and became a scientist.<eos> So what's your invention?<eos> Well, we're using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.<eos> What's neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.
And that brings us to "Z" gauge, at a "you could easily swallow it, don't ask how I know," 1/220.<eos> I'm sorry, I have to ask.<eos> When I was five, I ingested a "Z" gauge locomotive.<eos> I spent the next three days saying, "I think I can pass it,<eos> I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it."<eos> What is it about trains that you like so much?<eos> What an interesting question.<eos> When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order.<eos> I could line them up, categorize them, control them.<eos> I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn't.
Oh, thanks! You're a peach!<eos> Beverly, we'll catch up soon.<eos> Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always,<eos> Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.<eos> How long have I had spinach in my teeth?<eos> Since the airport, dear.<eos> You look like you come with a kickstand.<eos> You can't make me feel bad.<eos> Hmm, maybe not.<eos> So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?
The woman fled on foot.<eos> They left this one behind.<eos> Establish if she's Resistance.<eos> We're trying to identify her now, sir.<eos> Why did they not flee the scene together?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Panic, perhaps?<eos> Not one of ours.<eos> The men were not just shooting at the officer up there.<eos> They were also shooting at the woman they arrived with.
Baby, give it here.<eos> -Your hair looks pretty like that.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> Yeah, Farid.<eos> Meet me at the club.<eos> Now.<eos> They're your labor force.<eos> The supporters, too.<eos> I'll brief them.<eos> They'll put up posters, provide security.
Hope he dies before you get bored with him too.<eos> All you had to do was nothing.<eos> Sit back and collect a paycheck.<eos> You had the American dream and you forced yourself awake.<eos> I don't want your blood money.<eos> You want to run this company?<eos> You do it with me in tow.<eos> Fine.<eos> You can hang around, watch me fire your employees. Watch me blackball them in the industry.<eos> You know they'll blame you, the founder.

Watch me blackball them in the industry.<eos> You know they'll blame you, the founder.<eos> The guy who started it all.<eos> Or you can sign.<eos> They all get to keep their jobs and Snooger becomes a line item on a spreadsheet I glance at every other quarter.
No reason... just excited to face a new day.<eos> Oh, because ever since we've been down here, you've been a little depressed.<eos> Have I?<eos> No, no, no, don't eat the burrito.<eos> Oh, I'm disgusting.<eos> Okay, fine, I may have had a teensy bit of trouble adjusting when we first got here for, like, six teensy, little months, but I took your advice, and I got a job.<eos> - Doing what?<eos> - I sell ATVs now, eh?<eos> Well, the truth is, these little babies sell themselves.<eos> They're super fun, and they're a lot safer than you might think... if you're standing next to one.
June 9, 1969, the day my parents got married.<eos> - No, it isn't.<eos> - My mom's birthday.<eos> - No.<eos> - The moon landing.<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Fine, you're right.<eos> It's a completely random number.<eos> Look, the feds are useless.<eos> They're never gonna catch Figgis, so I'm working the case.
And you... this can still happen anytime.<eos> You know where I live.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - A little sore, but...<eos> - Good.<eos> Then I can excoriate you freely.<eos> You half-assed living in Florida, and you half-assed getting the phone back.<eos> You've probably blown our cover, which means the marshals will have to move us.<eos> And when they do, I'm gonna demand they send us to different cities, because I don't want you anywhere near me.
Elena, I can't let this happen.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Last chance.<eos> Please don't let go, okay?<eos> We'll get through this together, you and me.<eos> Elena, I can't!<eos> I'm waiting to hold your hand.<eos> Where are the men?<eos> Get them in here!<eos> They are not coming.
- I can't.<eos> - Last chance.<eos> Please don't let go, okay?<eos> We'll get through this together, you and me.<eos> Elena, I can't!<eos> I'm waiting to hold your hand.<eos> Where are the men?<eos> Get them in here!<eos> They are not coming.<eos> They are loyal to me now.
It was a refugee center.<eos> We are all working for the greater good here.<eos> So I urge you... obey our men and women in uniform.<eos> - Turn that off.<eos> - They are our peace keepers.<eos> I can't listen to that.<eos> Every road block we dodged had military personnel still in uniform.<eos> I don't know why they're going along with this.<eos> Castillo and the rest, they sold the people a line of crap that breaking up the country was the only way to save it.<eos> The rank and file soldiers and sailors probably don't know the truth, and they're just doing what they do because they were trained to, to serve the people.
CIC reports no contacts on surface or subsurface.<eos> Very well.<eos> Let's bring her in.<eos> Starboard beam 0-6-0.<eos> Vampire! Vampire! Vampire!<eos> Bearing 115.<eos> Two missiles incoming!<eos> - No! - My God.<eos> Those missiles came out of no where.<eos> They were circling.
And say what?<eos> We got Castillo's man to stand down, but what if the other generals aren't so easily convinced?<eos> We could start a civil war.<eos> The rank and file will fall in line.<eos> They've just forgotten who they are.<eos> Who's gonna remind them?<eos> You put a suicidal mission in office, and I took advantage of it.<eos> We are public enemies number one and two.<eos> The people don't trust us.<eos> That's because they've been poisoned.
And because he didn't learn the lessons of the plague.<eos> Which are?<eos> There are winners and there are losers.<eos> If you want to win, you have to fight.<eos> I suppose that's one way of looking at it.<eos> It's the only way to look at it, Captain.<eos> I come from a small town.<eos> Everybody knew everyone.<eos> People left their doors unlocked.<eos> Until the virus came, and they tore each other apart to stay alive.
- Tex.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> You're an American, Colonel.<eos> Stand down.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Take me away.<eos> It won't matter.<eos> Somebody else will take my place, somebody who sees the world for what it is and seizes the opportunity.<eos> The people are too wounded and scared to think for themselves.<eos> Today they follow you, but tomorrow, they will find another golden calf to worship.
Somebody else will take my place, somebody who sees the world for what it is and seizes the opportunity.<eos> The people are too wounded and scared to think for themselves.<eos> Today they follow you, but tomorrow, they will find another golden calf to worship.<eos> That much I've learned.<eos> Are you so naive?<eos> Captain, ‭you didn't save the world.<eos> You unleashed the worst in human nature.<eos> You really want to save the people, you need to terrorize them.<eos> You need to take them by the neck and shake them.<eos> You need to be more terrible so that they don't have to be, and deep down inside, you know it's true.
Why don't you have a seat?<eos> Can I get you a water?<eos> Or a soda, or...?<eos> No, thank you. Swanson:<eos> Just want to get this over with, huh? Yes, sir.<eos> These...<eos> Are my two victims. Do you recognize either of them?<eos> I-i don't know.<eos> I'm...<eos> Now, Henry, before you look at these crime scene photos, you should know that sometimes people look a little different when they're dead, and... You don't have to look at them if you don't want to.
A gun that killed someone.<eos> I didn't ask for this.<eos> You didn't turn it down, either.<eos> Would you rather I go to jail?<eos> You think Trixie would prefer that?<eos> No, it's just... it's a lot to take in.<eos> I've been demoted.<eos> I've been reassigned to assist on cases, so... for now, how can I help?<eos> Uh, interview crew members.<eos> See if they know anything, any enemies she had.
The key is figuring out what that is.<eos> Well, why don't we narrow it down?<eos> What are you really good at?<eos> Um, let's see.<eos> I'm smart, I'm personable, I'm... really good at tricking people into liking me.<eos> That's because you're a fantastic liar.<eos> Never made a promise I didn't break.<eos> So true.<eos> I'm still waiting for those roller skates for my sixth birthday.<eos> They're on the way.

It's still there, ma'am.<eos> Excellent, and the other countries?<eos> All present and accounted for.<eos> Great. Where are we on getting my face on a stamp?<eos> Do you really want people licking the back of your head, ma'am?<eos> Good point.<eos> Let's put me on money.<eos> Ah, what denomination did you have in mind?<eos> I've been sober awhile, do people still snort coke with hundred dollar bills?<eos> Yes, I believe they do.
No, God, please, uh, don't-don't do that.<eos> People feeling sorry for me...<eos> That's exactly why I'm not going.<eos> But... Adam, it's your call, but I got to tell you, if I avoided places where people felt sorry for me, I'd never leave the house.<eos> Yeah, good, can we just drop it?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> But you know...<eos> And she picked it back up.<eos> Your friends just want to see you, they don't care that you can't jump out a window with your hair on fire.
Parents living?<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And you are married.<eos> Yes. Raymond.<eos> Three years.<eos> But we're separated right now.<eos> I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude. I went over all this at Stanford already.<eos> Why did they send me here?<eos> The doctors at Stanford were unable to locate an organic basis for your symptoms, so they asked me to review their findings and if I agree, which I do, by the way.

I have no idea, Boo-boo.<eos> Got to my desk and they were already in there.<eos> I got to admit that toying with Spencer and Joe has been one of life's great joys, but I think it's time to settle this like businessmen.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you have in mind?<eos> I want to make an offer on ASM.<eos> I have absolutely no desire to sell.<eos> This division's still in diapers<eos> - and my boys are killing it.<eos> - They're killing themselves.
Same here.<eos> Give a big hug and a kiss to Katya for me.<eos> I will do that.<eos> And by the way, just because I shook your hand doesn't mean I agreed to the seven zeros.<eos> How about making it eight?<eos> One last thing.<eos> Suh, he's with me now.<eos> Come again?<eos> You got to keep a closer eye on your boys, Bret.<eos> The NFLPA, they certainly are.
Kid's a little nervous.<eos> He's never done this.<eos> - Why? It's with me.<eos> - Yeah, exactly.<eos> I'm a little surprised you called me about him.<eos> - Why, you're his guy.<eos> - I'm not his guy.<eos> Whoa, whoa, why you jumping all over me?<eos> You know how it is when these players come out of college.<eos> They're going through a lot of stress.
- Jeez, louder, Spence.<eos> I don't think the sound guy from inside could quite pick that up, man.<eos> Why wouldn't you just tell me before we agreed to do this, huh?<eos> We didn't agree to do this, you did.<eos> Listen, it's not that bad.<eos> Everything just takes extra time.<eos> It takes repetition, muscle memory, a routine.<eos> Put a whiteboard in front of me and everything starts looking like quantum fucking physics.<eos> And this is why you skipped the combine.<eos> You know, I just started worrying about all the shit people were gonna say when they find out I botched the Wonderlic.
Now, he never said anything to anybody.<eos> He never mentioned it.<eos> This was something he did because he knew I couldn't bear to be alone.<eos> You know, he was there for me, like, when my father died,<eos> John McGarrett was there for me.<eos> Two times in my life, I really needed a friend... and both times that friend was named McGarrett.<eos> They're gonna be okay.<eos> Thank you, Doc.<eos> Hey, boss.<eos> Why is it that people never say what they want to say until something like this happens?
_<eos> Let her go!<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Come on.<eos> You had no choice but to approve the general's plan, Trade Minister, but perhaps you will find another way to change his mind.<eos> The general's not interested in changing his mind, Kotomichi.<eos> He made that clear.<eos> If innocent civilians die, it will not be your doing.<eos> When they die... it will be because I failed to prevent it.
When did he move in here?<eos> About two years.<eos> When he came, he seemed to just get out of the jail.<eos> What's your relationship to him?<eos> Nothing will happen to him, right?<eos> What can happen to a big guy like him?<eos> I've seen these stuff a lot.<eos> People ran away over little rent.<eos> This place will be demolished.<eos> They have to move anyway.
Nine...<eos> How many'?<eos> Nine.<eos> Don't bullshit us.<eos> Get his legs.<eos> I was quietly doing my thing...<eos> Three men came in that day.<eos> Asked me if I needed food...<eos> I was hungry... So I came along with them.<eos> They beat me up so hard!

Has everyone gone deaf and mute?<eos> Get me out of here!<eos> Is anyone there at all?<eos> Over here.<eos> I am here.<eos> They've held me locked me in...<eos> I was quietly doing my thing.<eos> Three men came in...<eos> Asked me if I needed food.<eos> They got me here.

Pocket!<eos> Since you're a little one...<eos> If anyone wonders why I killed you... I'll just say 'He was easy pickings.'<eos> Our Police is completely brainless...<eos> You know what I did?<eos> I killed someone... then waited... for the Police to find the body.<eos> When the murder hit the newspaper... I went and sat outside the cops station...<eos> When cops came and asked me, "Did you do it?" I said 'Yes'<eos> They asked me to go with them, I went...<eos> Then they took me to be an idiot and didn't arrest me...
I'll manage.<eos> Don't worry, madam.<eos> I work here... at your service.<eos> - I'll manage.<eos> - I said do not worry.<eos> Do you know...<eos> It's both Dussehra (HINDU) and Muharram (MUSLIM) today.<eos> While the Muslims mourn, Hindus celebrate.<eos> This year, the festival of Ganesha and Bakr-Eid coincided too!<eos> People sin so much that they need religion to hide behind.
I guess I'm not going backstage at Barbie Winehouse.<eos> You tried to make them come to this bar and they said, "No, no, no."<eos> My gay guys at 12:00.<eos> I spoke too soon.<eos> And you spat a little.<eos> Tad!<eos> Jameson!<eos> Welcome to the M and C Dessert Bar.<eos> No, you're not dreaming!<eos> If they were, we'd be shirtless dudes.
Why?<eos> - Why what?<eos> - Why didn't you kill me?<eos> I have gone over that night 1,000 times, and it doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why didn't you kill me?<eos> I would've killed you in an instant.<eos> - Answer me!<eos> - Because you're mine.<eos> You were my umbrella boy, remember?<eos> You rubbed my feet when they were tired.
And we did.<eos> And he has.<eos> He can't use the Falcone name, but he's brought true honor to the family.<eos> My wife is looking down on us now, and she's so proud and happy.<eos> She would love you, Lee.<eos> You're exactly the kind of woman she would have wished for her son.<eos> There's only one thing that would've worried her.<eos> My wife would say you're a little too beautiful.<eos> All the great tragedies start with a face like yours.<eos> Makes men fall in love when they shouldn't.
Hmm. The guy I'm having dinner with is the hematologist in charge of analyzing Alice Tetch's blood.<eos> I'm free after 10:00 if you want to call.<eos> Thanks for the coffee.<eos> We found the truck.<eos> They ditched it in the Narrows.<eos> We got forensics going over it and teams doing a ten-block sweep.<eos> We already found this.<eos> The Red Hood Gang.<eos> I thought those idiots were dead.<eos> My guess is they're copying the look.

Unfortunately, life doesn't usually work that way.<eos> We're hours away from Mayor Cobblepot's victory celebration.<eos> But people are asking, will the Red Hood Gang put a damper on the festivities?<eos> Sounds like Penguin's having a bad day.<eos> I'm supposed to go to his party tonight.<eos> Part of my re-engagement with being a Wayne.<eos> Mm. Well, give the mayor my best.<eos> Witnesses say the Red Hoods blamed Cobblepot for their ac...<eos> Someone is testing me, Ed.<eos> They're thinking, "Oh, he's mayor now.
I can honestly say that if I'd have hesitated, I'd have been a goner.<eos> All right, people, listen up!<eos> It's happy hour...<eos> Finish up those reports and let's call it a day!<eos> Ed. Even before you went crazy, I never liked you.<eos> Your zipper's down.<eos> Listen, Butch did us all a favor.<eos> Red Hoods go bye-bye, case closed.<eos> Look at the way the bodies fell.<eos> It's as if they were just standing there, waiting to be killed.
Let's get out of here.<eos> - Hey, open the damn door.<eos> - Sorry, we mustn't be late.<eos> Please just... don't hurt us.<eos> That's not my decision to make.<eos> Your fate depends entirely on James Gordon.<eos> Hey. Hey! Don't forget to buckle up.<eos> What a beautiful morning.<eos> Sun is shining, birds are singing.<eos> They say that fortune favors the brave.

Don't forget to buckle up.<eos> What a beautiful morning.<eos> Sun is shining, birds are singing.<eos> They say that fortune favors the brave.<eos> They have that saying in your country, Olga?
Ivy, you are very beautiful.<eos> But we've only just met.<eos> We haven't had time to get to know each other.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where do you come from?<eos> What do you do?<eos> Well, I'm from Gotham.<eos> And I meet men.<eos> Like you.<eos> They give me things.
I don't know.<eos> Someone paid 'em off.<eos> The question is, who?<eos> Who has that kind of money and influence?<eos> You don't know.<eos> But I do.<eos> End of the line.<eos> No more running.<eos> Just in time.<eos> In a few moments, your brothers in arms are gonna come up those stairs and find your dead body, and they'll believe me when I tell them that Jim Gordon is a killer.
I'm not. Good.<eos> Doesn't mean I'm gonna stand by after something like this.<eos> The captain of police was just indicted for murder and sent to Arkham.<eos> The last thing I need is you and your men tearing up Gotham looking for revenge.<eos> I didn't start this.<eos> I'll get to the bottom of it.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I'll give you one day.<eos> As members of the Five Families, you are well aware that with the tragic downfall of Captain Barnes, people are frightened.<eos> They will be looking to us for stability.
You think we're stupid enough to bring it with us?<eos> You really want it back?<eos> I'd listen to him.<eos> Put the tools down, lads, aye?<eos> I need reassurances my friends are no longer in any danger.<eos> I need to speak to the woman in the mask.<eos> Any assurances that woman gives you are lies.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because the people you are talking about have no honor.<eos> And they will betray you as they betrayed us.

- Previously on Gotham...<eos> - My name is Volk.<eos> My brother Jacob.<eos> We are called the Whisper Gang.<eos> Those men were willing to kill for this key,<eos> - but what does it open?<eos> - A safe.<eos> Inside, there is a device that we believe can destroy them.<eos> They call themselves the Court of Owls.
Sure, Jim.<eos> Happy to oblige.<eos> No rest for the wicked.<eos> Relax.<eos> I'm not here to get revenge for you lopping off Tabby's paw.<eos> Though I am surprised to find you back at work and not tracking down who really did kill your lady love.<eos> That's because you don't see the full picture.<eos> The mayor has many enemies.<eos> These enemies understand that I am a fundamental part of this operation.<eos> They weaken me, they weaken him.
I knew he was in danger, but I didn't know why.<eos> I never suspected this.<eos> You're saying the attacks on Mario... the car bomb...<eos> It's because of the virus?<eos> How is that possible?<eos> Who knew he had it?<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> I'll send my men to bring Mario in.<eos> You think I'd trust Lee's life with these two goons?<eos> Tell me where they are.
All you have to do is kill the Devil.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Which part?<eos> We covered a lot of ground.<eos> Hell.<eos> The Devil.<eos> None of it exists.<eos> Did you believe in vampires before you fell in love with one and became one yourself?<eos> That's the trouble with facts, Stefan.<eos> They're true whether you believe in them or not.
Hell.<eos> The Devil.<eos> None of it exists.<eos> Did you believe in vampires before you fell in love with one and became one yourself?<eos> That's the trouble with facts, Stefan.<eos> They're true whether you believe in them or not.<eos> I promise you, just as my sister promised me.<eos> There was a man named Cade.<eos> The people he loved damned him.<eos> And only at the very end did he finally give up on them, only when the smell of his burning flesh was searing his nostrils, did he see them for what they really were.
So, if it's my fault, damn me.<eos> Not him.<eos> Damon's fate is already sealed.<eos> I reached into his mind and gave him a look at what awaits him, and even that little spoonful was enough to make him flip his little humanity switch.<eos> He chose to serve Cade for all eternity, rather than experience another second in that kind of torment.<eos> Damon believes in hell.<eos> And soon you will, too.<eos> Because you're just as doomed as he is.<eos> So Mystic Falls is overrun with supernatural creatures, and... vampires are real.<eos> They feed on human blood and can even control people if they want to.
Bonnie, wake up.<eos> Are we gonna bury the fish?<eos> Yes, but in our own way.<eos> You see, we are made up of two parts.<eos> Our body and our soul.<eos> See, some people are very special.<eos> And when they die, a man named Cade comes to take their soul away.<eos> - Does he take the body, too?<eos> - No. But that doesn't mean the bodies aren't special, too.<eos> They need to be treated with dignity to find peace in death.
Hey, bud.<eos> Can I tag in next?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> With the lady.<eos> How much?<eos> This one you could kill. Come on.<eos> I'm joking!<eos> I'm joking, mother.<eos> You're gonna have to lose those clothes.<eos> They're a serious problem.
Why?<eos> Are you going to punish me?<eos> I'm sorry, Detective.<eos> I looked into the two videos in question, and unfortunately, there was no overlap.<eos> Doesn't make any sense.<eos> I'll need a list of everyone who saw the videos.<eos> Sadly, we don't track people, just I.P. addresses.<eos> Maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way.<eos> Can you take me through how your video process works?<eos> Well, our users can upload anything they want.
I mean, these videos are enthralling.<eos> No, I-I can't.<eos> I can't watch these.<eos> Oh, I've seen worse.<eos> But never so many collected in one single room.<eos> You know, if I ever go back to Hell,<eos> I am getting me one of these.<eos> Selfish bastards get to see everything.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They do.
I'm his big brother, Maze.<eos> I really should start looking out for him more often.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Dan's working with Wobble to trace what moderator may have pulled both videos.<eos> Hopefully, we'll have an answer soon.<eos> Then why are you so sure the killer's one of these misanthropes?<eos> Well, serial killers usually start with someone they know.
Hopefully, we'll have an answer soon.<eos> Then why are you so sure the killer's one of these misanthropes?<eos> Well, serial killers usually start with someone they know.<eos> If the killer worked here, they knew Nick, saw how much the prank hurt Tommy.<eos> So you think seeing someone they recognized in one of these twisted videos finally made them snap?<eos> Maybe it awakened something in them.<eos> Something that was always there, just fighting to get out.<eos> But... they were just trying to do a job.<eos> Job no one else wanted.<eos> Well, maybe they chose that for a reason.
Whenever he asks a question, I just have sex with him.<eos> Seems to render him mute.<eos> Hmm. Took me a while to figure that one out.<eos> As for the rest of it, for lack of a better word, it is absolute... hell.<eos> Well, if it's so bad, why don't you just go back?<eos> Why?<eos> So that you could go back to torturing me for another millennia?<eos> - Sounds like fun to me.<eos> - Yes, these humans are awful.<eos> They breathe through their mouths, and they won't... shut up about something called gluten.
I thought it was an organic kind of roofie.<eos> I didn't know that it would kill them.<eos> I was just trying to loosen them up.<eos> You were trying to make an extra buck by bringing in a couple newbies.<eos> I won the Dame Judith acting award in college.<eos> I was the president of our sorority.<eos> I should have made it by now!<eos> L.A. was supposed to be easy!<eos> Oh, phones...<eos> They can be so distracting.
- Family drama? - Mm.<eos> My brother died.<eos> Amenadiel?<eos> Mm! No, no.<eos> No, I... another brother.<eos> I have many.<eos> Lucifer, I'm so sorry.<eos> Oh, it's fine, what's done is done, eh?<eos> - Whiskey?<eos> - No, no, you... Lucifer, patients often avoid sessions precisely when they need it the most.
No.<eos> Dead end.<eos> All right.<eos> Maybe I can dig a little deeper.<eos> So, tell me.<eos> Why would I help you two?<eos> Because we're just two regular fellows who need your help, Boris.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> - Mr. Sokolov...<eos> - People call me human lie detector because I look in my clients' eyes, and I can know if they're telling the truth.
Do you think it's crazy that I wanted to talk about it?<eos> Mourn with him, maybe? !<eos> - I... - So I reached out, and guess what I got back.<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Like always.<eos> So I figured that if his toys started stabbing each other with a celestial blade, that maybe he might take a moment.<eos> Humans are dying because of you.<eos> Well, humans die.<eos> They all do eventually.

- Because I do actually have things that I'd like to talk about, Doctor.<eos> Oh. Oh, yes.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Yes.<eos> Please.<eos> Right.<eos> So, my mum asked me why I care so much about these people dying and I'm not sure I know.<eos> I mean, it's not like I know them personally, and Maze is right...<eos> Even without Azrael's blade, humans are capricious.<eos> Hell, they're willing to trade their souls to lose unsightly tummy fat, but... So... why should I feel bad?
And neither was Hell.<eos> No. No, that was somewhere I was sent as a punishment.<eos> Like the DMV, but less screaming.<eos> So would you say that this is your first home?<eos> Yes, I suppose it is.<eos> And why do you think that's the case?<eos> Well, I don't know, Doctor.<eos> You tell me.<eos> I find that people make Los Angeles their home for one of two reasons.<eos> Either they're running from something, or looking for something.
I love that girl.<eos> That's an amazing woman.<eos> Did she ever tell you how she got the name "Cookie"?<eos> Yo, I had a crazy weekend, man.<eos> Friday and Saturday was insane.<eos> First, my mom started trippin', but<eos> I met this nice honey, though.<eos> ♪ I woke up early Friday afternoon ♪<eos> ♪ Turn my radio up before I step out the room ♪<eos> ♪ Lay my clothes on the bed, make sure they press ♪
I don't know.<eos> Well... if she does show up, let her know I'd like to speak with her about pressing charges.<eos> She won't be pressing charges.<eos> But we have their faces.<eos> Yeah, she wants to move past this.<eos> Did she tell you that, David?<eos> Yeah, she did.<eos> Well, did she tell you that she kicked the shit out of those boys?<eos> You knew she was capable of this?<eos> Well, I-I think that, when people are in fight-or-flight mode, that they're capable of...
Not you, you mean?<eos> I don't know, probably not a lot of pre-pubescent children walking around an FBI office.<eos> Maybe it's time-sensitive.<eos> Why are you taking it so personally?<eos> I'm not taking it personally.<eos> Okay, what do we know about the abductors?<eos> There are two of them.<eos> Man and a woman.<eos> I know from historical records, the victim's body was found in the basement.<eos> They're dangerous.
Okay. I got him.<eos> I got him, I got him.<eos> Aleksander, are you hurt at all?<eos> Are there any other kids here?<eos> Just me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm going to get you home to your mom, but I need you to do something very important for me.<eos> Okay?<eos> Police officers will be here soon.<eos> They're gonna ask you what happened.
Just me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm going to get you home to your mom, but I need you to do something very important for me.<eos> Okay?<eos> Police officers will be here soon.<eos> They're gonna ask you what happened.<eos> It's really important you tell them I was the only person here.<eos> Okay?<eos> You asked me for help.<eos> They got afraid and started shooting.
I would think that would crush your spirit,<eos> - but you're this...<eos> - I'm this what?<eos> I was going to say firebrand, but that sounded... bad.<eos> It sounds nice.<eos> So why are you?<eos> I was probably about 7 or 8 when, um, a few dozen inmates staged a hunger strike.<eos> I stood in the corner, scared as hell, watching the guards come.<eos> Do you really want to hear this?<eos> They got beaten down.
Where?<eos> At Harrah's.<eos> I'm gonna be a blackjack dealer.<eos> Wait a minute, you're moving to Lake Tahoe?<eos> Yeah, my friend Lindsay's dad is a pit-boss and he hooked us up.<eos> We're gonna share an apartment and go to dealer school.<eos> It'll be a blast.<eos> But what about finishing college, making something of your life?<eos> money.<eos> When people win at blackjack, they give you a tip.

"I threw myself into slave trading young<eos> "for the prosperity of our family.<eos> "Captain Lavergne has agreed<eos> "to take you on as a boy seaman, Joseph.<eos> "It's your turn to learn the trade<eos> "and, like all Monerois, climb the ranks one by one."<eos> Land.<eos> On 16 April 1825, having reached the coast of Africa 98 days after setting sail from Nantes, the Bienfaisant dropped anchor at the mouth of a river.<eos> Supplying human merchandise remained the work of local traffickers, capitalising on wars, famine and raids to stock up.<eos> At times, they let white slavers deal with the slaves themselves.

"and the need to have them shackled<eos> "compounds a fatal fermentation that can be prevented<eos> "by taking the captives on deck for air and<eos> "washing them with sea water".<eos> She's definitely dead.<eos> "Be sure to write reports on the captives<eos> "that die and see that they are thrown into the sea<eos> "at night to prevent the sad spectacle from feeding a<eos> "revolt among the Negroes.<eos> "You must clean and rinse the place they have left
While out of the 32 crew members, we lost 4 sailors and the boy seaman.<eos> - Captain.<eos> - Welcome aboard.<eos> Be careful.<eos> No more on board sales allowed.<eos> Get them ashore fast.<eos> With one exception.<eos> Your ship owner requests a young female in France to use as a servant.<eos> Very well.<eos> In the last 3 months, the governor seized 2 ships before they discharged their Negroes.
We lost an ox today.<eos> With last week's, that makes 3 oxen and 2 mules.<eos> Some of you poisoned them.<eos> that is punished by death.<eos> Anyone who knows the culprits must inform me or will be punished for collusion.<eos> I hold you all responsible.<eos> You will pay by working on Saturday and Sunday.<eos> If you are unhappy, denounce the culprits and I'll lift the penalties.<eos> In the meantime, return to your huts immediately.<eos> If we are to end the poisoning, Governor, you must give the colonists free rein to do it as they see fit.
And if these swift and ruthless rulings fall on the innocent, the price paid will be small compared to the gains.<eos> Doctor Ruffier.<eos> You're the young judge everyone's talking about?<eos> Yes, Adolphe Juston.<eos> Have you time to talk?<eos> I must go and see a patient, but let's have a chat.<eos> I am sceptical about this poisoning business.<eos> the doctors are notoriously incompetent.<eos> the signs Dr Lapierre attributes to poisoning to my mind point to a form of cholera that affects as many men as animals.<eos> the colonists are so prejudiced that all they can imagine is a plot to destroy them.
destroying the Whites.<eos> Pierre.<eos> I seek a match for my daughter, in order to increase the race of honest people while purging the rogues.<eos> that's also my mission, Mr Dessart.<eos> Only by the most severe means, the vilest examples and new tortures to slay the villains, will we keep the peace for years to come.<eos> But you have never prospered more.<eos> the colonies will never be what they once were.<eos> If the government wants to keep and protect them more than before, we'll regain our wealth.<eos> It's not easy buying 10-20 Negroes a year to replace the dead.<eos> they kill themselves with disconcerting ease.
"weaponry, the crew's wages,<eos> "trading goods, insurance, ship repairs,<eos> "The profit from this slave trading excursion is 4 times higher<eos> "than the returns of any other investment."<eos> At my master's nephew's they found bodies of other animals.<eos> Toriki's master, Bonnefond, accused them of poisoning along with 2 other slaves,<eos> Eusebe and Solitude, who were expecting a child.<eos> My god-mother knew he wanted to punish Toriki harshly for daring to speak to the judge who has just left the island.<eos> the judges sentenced all 3 to death.<eos> But they waited until Solitude had had her baby before taking her away.
Then listen now...<eos> Vortigern got hold of Bretagne's throne by getting rid of his heirs.<eos> He even killed a son of his.<eos> But he had more powerful enemies, like Uther Pendragon.<eos> To protect himself from the latter, he built an immense tower.<eos> The problem was that the tower crumbled every night.<eos> When does Merlin appear?<eos> Can I continue?<eos> Vortigern was perplexed until the day a 7-year-old boy,<eos> Merlin, told him that two dragons lived underneath the tower: one white, the other red, and they fought every night.
They're not peaceful vigils like you've got going on here.<eos> We-We've got people on the brink of... of rioting, Mr. President.<eos> I understand.<eos> So what can I do to help?<eos> Cancel the ration cards.<eos> Restore the land-claim rights.<eos> Open the markets.<eos> Rescind all of my domestic policies.<eos> They're not working and people aren't happy.<eos> There's not much more they can take...
First time on a darkened ship?<eos> I thought you said she was Navy, Tom.<eos> Naval intelligence doesn't spend much time on small-boys.<eos> Captain Slattery?<eos> Gator, where are they?<eos> All four contacts are north of our position, sir.<eos> Still nothing from Alpha or Bravo.<eos> The four Chinese ships are spreading out, looking for us.<eos> So far, we've done a good job dodging in and out of their radar sweeps using the island chain to mask ourselves.<eos> - They haven't IDed us yet.
Well, then maybe it was a mutation after all.<eos> Okay, I know Dr. Scott said that the virus cannot mutate.<eos> You've been very clear about that.<eos> But with no other explanation, isn't it possible that in this one instance Dr. Scott was wrong?<eos> General quarters, general quarters.<eos> All hands, man your battle stations.<eos> What do you got?<eos> We're surrounded, sir.<eos> Two ships on either side painting us with navigational radar.<eos> Damn it. They used our time in the islands to set a perimeter.

They've gotta have us triangulated by now.
This is my minefield.<eos> I designed it.<eos> I know how those mines operate.<eos> I can steer us to safety.<eos> There is no other option.<eos> Surrender the helm.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> Oh, that was close.<eos> Sir, Chinese vessels are converging.<eos> They can have us targeted in 30 seconds, sir.
I wish you luck.<eos> I think you're gonna need it.<eos> Mm-hmm. Thanks.<eos> And you're welcome.<eos> Hey, where you been?<eos> Well, I considered getting a massage, but I can't find my neck.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> You find Kort?<eos> I'm still waiting on my guys from across the pond.<eos> They don't work quite as fast as we do.
You're now a journeyman agent.<eos> I will carry this with tremendous pride.<eos> You all right, boss?<eos> We need answers.<eos> You know, there's something I've been thinking about a lot lately.<eos> Something you said to me when you first hired me.<eos> Something I never forgot.<eos> You asked,<eos> "What happens when the best agents in the world want to accomplish something?"<eos> "They get it done."

My friend's coming here!<eos> What did you say?<eos> My friend from another car is coming over.<eos> Who's coming?<eos> - My friend!<eos> He was in car 9, and he rescued some people.<eos> Rescued?<eos> From there to here, passing through those monsters?<eos> Without any injuries?<eos> You sure they're not infected?
It gave them enhanced levels of what they call C.P.A.<eos> Cognitive Predictive Ability.<eos> Everyone has it to some degree.<eos> Most people call it "Intuition."<eos> "A gut feeling."<eos> Like when you feel someone behind you before you turn around.<eos> It's a long way from a gut feeling to accurately predicting where a ship is going to appear in the galaxy.<eos> Well, that's where the machine comes in.<eos> That room you saw, with all those people.<eos> They're linked together to form a collective consciousness.
Not only are we getting clean 56K, we can do this at the same time.<eos> - Sounds pretty good, huh?<eos> - Yeah, is that coming off the CD-ROM?<eos> We should really focus.<eos> Okay, so through NSFNET, we can connect to CERN?<eos> Yes, but we're gonna crawl once we jump to Europe.<eos> Why?<eos> The TAT-8 is fiber optic.<eos> Yeah, but it's also buried along the continental shelf and constantly being attacked by sharks.<eos> Apparently, they can sense the electrical radiation.
It will never be like it was.<eos> It can't be.<eos> But last night, we... we talked.<eos> It was good.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You know why I wanted us to meet here?<eos> I just didn't want to forget what had happened, how painful that was.<eos> Why?<eos> And then I almost did forget last night when we talked, when it felt good, when I was with my friend again.<eos> And then you reminded me how easily you toss people aside when you feel like they're in your way.
We can't serve Leslie Garner pizza.<eos> She's been on "Oprah."<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why are you guys looking at us like that?<eos> I'm doing an extra credit assignment.<eos> You're getting extra credit for meeting Leslie Garner?<eos> For what class, business strategy?<eos> I want extra credit.<eos> We took mushrooms.<eos> Don't worry, we timed it out so they won't kick in until after...
Back... off.<eos> You know what's not cool?<eos> Licking a grown man's face.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Your face looked like a lollipop, but the drugs wore off.<eos> - Are you writing a legal brief?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm writing an essay to get onto the law journal about the race bias within the local police force.<eos> Are you using these cases to support your thesis?<eos> 'Cause they don't work.
Previously on "Sweet/Vicious"...<eos> Who are you?<eos> I guess I'm like a vigilante.<eos> So what do we do next?<eos> There is no we. I work alone.<eos> How did you know I was there?<eos> I put tracking software in your phone.<eos> Used part of my charm.<eos> Is that what your parents tell you?<eos> Yeah, they tell me I'm a mistake.
- Okay, well, um... This.<eos> - I should...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Just let me.<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> - Who are these people?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm not them.<eos> They send me messages, and I do what they say.
- Listen to me.<eos> - I'm not...<eos> - Shut up and listen!<eos> Hat and sunglasses.<eos> No one's going to ID you.<eos> You could be Kevin fucking Bacon. That's point one.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Point two, in a robbery, staff are trained.<eos> I am not...<eos> They are trained to hand over the cash.
Moving out!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.<eos> You can speak now.<eos> - It must have been roaches.<eos> - Roaches, you see them?<eos> You see?<eos> I didn't see them. I heard them.<eos> All the mess. It must have been them.<eos> Want a cookie?<eos> - Here you go. - They've been in the food.

Check the upstairs rooms.<eos> Relax.<eos> I'm not your enemy.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Where are who?<eos> You know, we got a whole bunch of frightened, angry people in that village.<eos> Roaches have been breaking into the food stores, stealing supplies.<eos> You know anything about that?<eos> No.<eos> See, it's not just what they stole.
All that food left is gonna be destroyed.<eos> - No one's gonna eat it.<eos> - Stripe.<eos> Makes life harder for everyone.<eos> Cross on the wall there.<eos> You got principles.<eos> Think all life is sacred. And I get it.<eos> I agree. All life is sacred so... you even got to protect the roaches.<eos> Right?<eos> It's not their fault they're like that.

That doesn't care about the sanctity of life or the pain about who else is gonna suffer.
Sit down.<eos> So you recently logged your first kills?<eos> - Two roaches?<eos> First time out. It's impressive.<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> So what happened?<eos> - What, with the kills?<eos> I'm in this, uh... farmhouse.<eos> There's this, like, hidden room or something.<eos> We go in and there they are.
But I've seen roaches.<eos> I've seen them, they're fucking... They're like, uh...<eos> - Animals?<eos> - No, they're monsters.<eos> I've seen them.<eos> The implant made you see this.<eos> Fuck.<eos> The villagers...<eos> The locals, they... they ain't army.<eos> They got no Mass in their heads.

The light here transmits a code.<eos> It's like a virus.<eos> It burrows into your Mass, trying to shut it down from within.<eos> I tell you, those roaches are getting more ingenious than we give them credit for.<eos> The whole thing is a lie.<eos> I understand why you'd say that, yeah.<eos> Roaches.<eos> They look just like us.<eos> Of course they do.<eos> That's why they're so dangerous.
Of course they do.<eos> That's why they're so dangerous.<eos> Humans. You know, we give ourselves a bad rap, but we're genuinely empathetic as a species.<eos> I mean, we don't actually really want to kill each other.<eos> Which is a good thing.<eos> Until your future depends on wiping out the enemy.<eos> Come on, sit down.<eos> I don't know how much history you studied in school.<eos> Many years ago, I'm talking early 20th century, most soldiers didn't even fire their weapons.<eos> Or if they did, they would just aim over the heads of the enemies.

Computer murk.<eos> What happened, you get bored of it?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> You've seen what people tuck away on these.<eos> Schemes and kill lists, kiddy porn.<eos> It's not boring.<eos> I'm old enough to remember when they walked around with that stuff just tucked away in their heads.<eos> Right. But now they can't help but entrusting it to their little companions.<eos> These things absorb who we are.<eos> They know everything about us.
- Um... But at number one... is 880 people using it on someone called Clara Meades.<eos> - Who's she?<eos> - Clara Meades.<eos> Okay, um... it looks like she was at a demo, and she took a selfie in front of a war memorial.<eos> - Pretending to piss on it.<eos> - Nice work, Clara.<eos> Yeah, it's getting near the end of the vote, and her mentions are blowing up.<eos> - Tusk isn't public knowledge yet?<eos> - Um, no. So people can't know the hashtag works.<eos> They're using it to scare her.

Now look, the visual feed is secure between each ADI and the hive.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Although... one of the government's conditions for backing the project...<eos> Okay. Enough.<eos> We had to consent to permitting government security services access to the visual feed at times of quote, "increased national security."<eos> Which is, as I understand it, pretty much all the time.<eos> - I wasn't happy about it.<eos> - Your lot went along with it.<eos> That implies a greater range of options than your lot presented.<eos> - So they are spying on us.
I was in France.<eos> I stayed at this, like, vineyard, and they had this wine, like, grape-stomping festival.<eos> Now that, that wine was good.<eos> I know that.<eos> You're being discursive.<eos> - What is discursive? Discursive?<eos> - Talkative.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Rambling.<eos> Is that a problem?<eos> People sometimes talk more when they're afraid.
Don't!<eos> Don't! Stop! Stop!<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> That was one second.<eos> Either he's super susceptible to this or the software is way too powerful still.<eos> It's jumped from zero to 18K in five milliseconds...<eos> I'm sorry. The experience was more powerful than intended, Mr. Cooper.<eos> I hope you can forgive us.<eos> ...all luggage under the seat in front of you.<eos> All electronic devices should now be turned off and stowed as they may interfere with the aircraft's navigational and communication....
There's Travis.<eos> There you are.<eos> Where's the other guy?<eos> - What's that right there?<eos> - What?<eos> - There.<eos> - Where?<eos> Come on.<eos> Step by step, as the mill prospered the farmers got more money.<eos> Until they, like the miller and his helpers, could buy automobiles and radios and electric and the other conveniences to make farm life easier and happier.
Come on.<eos> You got him. You got him.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Our tires are slashed.<eos> - Where are Ronnie and T.J.?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What do you mean you don't know?<eos> - I mean I don't fucking know!<eos> They're not in their beds.<eos> You think that they slashed the tires?
What is it, Gennaro?<eos> Can't sleep?<eos> I'm worried.<eos> About what?<eos> Mico.<eos> I knew he was your contact here, so I asked around.<eos> Who did you ask?<eos> Selling drugs, I've made lots of friends, especially among Calabrians.<eos> And what did these friends say?<eos> They had a meeting in Polsi and "The Mother" is really pissed.
Oh, baby, are you pausing yet?<eos> Okay, so this is the weird thing.<eos> I assumed, you know.<eos> I thought I was at the end of the rope here, and I was kind of hoping that she was going to say that.<eos> But apparently I have the reproductive system of a 16-year-old.<eos> Like, my tubes are really good, and my eggs are still coming, and I'm fully functional and productive and just the reproductive system of a 16-year-old.<eos> Did I fart?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> But your eggs are... fried.<eos> Right? I mean, they're... rotten.
Yeah, in New York when I was in high school.<eos> That's great that you're doing that.<eos> Even if you don't dance, which, you know, I gave it up when I was 19, but you'll never regret it.<eos> I mean, it's still a part of me.<eos> Thanks.<eos> No, you're lucky, because when I was your age and I was aching to be an artist,<eos> I had to explain that to my parents.<eos> My father was a janitor.<eos> My mom's still a nurse.<eos> But they didn't know from art.
Dr. Charles wants me to be a psych resident.<eos> You?<eos> Is that such a shock?<eos> I just didn't realize that you had an interest in that.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I don't. I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> What do you see?<eos> I wish people wouldn't diagnose themselves.<eos> - They always screw it up. - Hmm.
Pablo Escobar said, "Sometimes I'm God.<eos> If I say a man dies, he dies the same day."<eos> In his career, this asshole killed thousands of police officers at a rate of over 400 a year.<eos> With numbers like that staring you in the face, you have to ask... what possesses a man to put on a uniform that all but guarantees his days are numbered?<eos> Most of them were just kids, raised to reach a fork in the road and choose the right path.<eos> Fight for the good guys.<eos> They were young, they were full of hope... and they thought they were invincible.
This is Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela.<eos> And if you've never heard of him, it's because that's exactly the way he wants it.<eos> Ask him what he does for a living and he'll tell you that he's a banker, and that would be true.<eos> In fact, he and his brother Miguel controlled their own bank.<eos> Or he might tell you that he and his brother owned and operated one of Colombia's largest chains of drug stores.<eos> The brothers could also tell you they ran their own soccer team.<eos> Which they did.<eos> América de Cali, one of the best teams on the continent and a fierce rival of Pablo's Atlético Nacional.<eos> But what they'd never tell you is that these businesses were a front and that the Rodríguez brothers were the second biggest cocaine traffickers in the world:<eos> Like Pablo and the Medellín cartel, they started out as run-of-the-mill criminals, bank robbers.

And a large part of that was due to a guy they called the Lion.<eos> You might remember him as a Medellín hustler who used to stuff bricks of cocaine into his jacket and smuggle them into Miami.<eos> Well, he stayed in Miami and he made it his town.<eos> He was responsible for a smuggling network that brought in Pablo's cocaine by the ton.<eos> He was great at it.<eos> But getting cocaine into the States wasn't really the problem.<eos> The problem was, what do you do with all that money?<eos> Sure, some of it could stay in the States.<eos> And the narcos did that.<eos> They bought crooked banks, real estate, car dealerships, race horses, art, you name it.
Give Velasco a call.<eos> Tell him to find the Lion.<eos> Carlos and I want to speak to him about business.<eos> It's time to get back to making money, brother.<eos> - Like the good old days, Pablo.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> What's up, Maritza?<eos> What happened?<eos> The police are looking for me.<eos> They want to put a bullet in my head.
Of course, Peña knew the information he had given Berna was already bearing fruit.<eos> For Colombia!<eos> The Castaños and their men were efficient, if not always subtle.<eos> It didn't matter.<eos> What's newsworthy about a few dead sicarios in the murder capital of the world?<eos> Of course, I'm not sure Javi knew just how fucked up things were really gonna get.<eos> Follow me and cover me!<eos> Hard to feel sorry for a bunch of drug dealers getting whacked, right?<eos> These guys had sown a lot of violence over the years... killed a lot of people.<eos> It was about time they got some payback.
There's no spoon, love. How about a fork?<eos> Martinez was right.<eos> We all need a method.<eos> Something to cling to when the shit around us gets so deep, we might go under.<eos> Something to guide us home when we feel we've lost our way.<eos> If we're lucky, someone gives us a method and we follow it.<eos> If not, we find our own.<eos> Pablo's enemies had found their own method.<eos> And it was an ugly one.<eos> They had opened up a new war against him, striking from the shadows.
Over there, motherfucker.<eos> Cousin, cousin, cousin, cousin.<eos> It's because he doesn't know how to lose, but that's fine.<eos> - Where are we headed, guys?<eos> - To the whores!<eos> Look how they left this place.<eos> We found both the guards.<eos> Stuffed into a trunk, burned alive.<eos> Did anybody see anything?<eos> We're sending spotters out, but... they either come back with nothing or...
- So that doesn't go too far?<eos> The good guys, they got guns pointing at their fucking head - and the bad guys get away with it?<eos> - Who are the good guys, Steve?<eos> That's us?<eos> Mr. President, these men, the Castaños, I've seen their tactics firsthand in the jungle against the FARC.<eos> Their method of war is murder.<eos> I think this is only the beginning.<eos> And it will get even worse.<eos> Colonel, I understand your concern.<eos> It's strange. They usually operate against the guerrillas but now they're operating against the narcos.
Which puts me in a spot because... I'm the one who suggested they approach you in the first place.<eos> Now, I don't know what you know about what it is I do, but understand this:<eos> I have our nation's long-term interests in mind.<eos> That's the beat I walk.<eos> And sitting here tonight, that means making sure the right folks are left standing when Escobar gets his bullet.<eos> So do Uncle Sam a solid.<eos> Don't complicate that.<eos> These folks are prone to emotional decision-making.<eos> Which can lead to bush league nonsense like... killing a federal agent.<eos> By the way, they found the lawyer.
And not some vigilante.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Guten tag.<eos> Join the DEA, see the world, right?<eos> The airport, anyways.<eos> Listen...<eos> I need you to prepare yourself for some blowback.<eos> It goes high up.<eos> And these people aren't gonna like it when I try to get myself out of it.<eos> If they come after you about what I've been doing, you protect yourself first.
And that has been a good decision for business as well?<eos> Because things are very difficult.<eos> And when all this shit is over, the organization will change, the routes will change, this whole city will change.<eos> And how do you know you'll still be in business, Judy?<eos> That's why I'm talking to you.<eos> If all of us from Medellín are united, we'll be able to say what happens to each one of us.<eos> Meet me at Montecasino with our associates, and you tell them you're on our side.<eos> She wants them to join Los Pepes.<eos> They say Pablo Escobar is fucked, that his time has come.<eos> And that they have to decide whose side they're on.

Bad news for Pablo.<eos> And there was more bad news coming his way.<eos> The thing about drug dealers is you can't trust them for shit.<eos> The Lion had been running Pablo's Miami operation for years, and gotten rich too.<eos> But the moment Cali offered him a better deal, he welcomed his new partners with open arms.<eos> I mean, who could blame the Lion?<eos> Pablo was on his way out and Cali was the future.<eos> He had introduced them to Pablo's bankers... Oh, thank you. ...his smugglers, all of it.<eos> Though Pablo didn't know it yet, his biggest rivals had pulled off a silent coup.<eos> They had stolen the crown jewel in his empire right out from under him.
Listen. I need you to be strong.<eos> Everything will end soon. But you need to be stronger than ever, Tata.<eos> I'll call you back soon.<eos> I love you very much.<eos> Tonight... we're going to fight like we've never fought before.<eos> We'll fight with everything we have.<eos> Fuck the Cali cartel!<eos> Fuck Judy Moncada!<eos> Fuck Los Castaños!<eos> We're going to show these motherfuckers who they are messing with, because we're still the Medellín cartel and tonight we're going to Montecasino!
But even in that moment, you were already the man of the house.<eos> In the face of all that violence and death, you were strong.<eos> You are a survivor.<eos> A man of action.<eos> I knew that day you were destined for great things, Pablo.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Colonel.<eos> Sit.<eos> So, did you decipher those codes?<eos> Are they real?
Where are you going?<eos> To Medellín.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no, Hermilda.<eos> You can't leave.<eos> My son needs me.<eos> How so?<eos> What you want... for him to turn himself in to those monsters...<eos> I don't want them to kill him.<eos> They're going to kill him either way, and you know that.
But we had to clear all that up, because contrary to what some people have been saying, this actually is a car show.<eos> - Well, not next week it isn't.<eos> - Next week is an exception.<eos> - Yeah. - But not when we go to Barbados either.<eos> No, Barbados is definitely another exception.<eos> But tonight couldn't be more "car-y" if it tried.<eos> I'm gonna prove that point because we're kicking off with this.<eos> Bear with me, bear with me--<eos> I agree!<eos> The thing is, though, various supercar makers have now taken the polar-bear-friendly technology from a Prius, and they are now using it to create raw, naked speed.
- What?<eos> I'm sorry to have to say this, but that Ferrari is useless.<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Later on in part two, when these two have stopped dreaming up idiotic and irrelevant tests that it can't take part in, we shall see.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Now, at this point in the show we like to sit down and chew the fat about new cars and motoring issues.<eos> Like, for example, why in Britain we have to drive at 50 miles an hour when they're doing roadworks to protect the workforce which is never there.<eos> Yes, okay...<eos> And why fully-grown adults have taken to riding around the city on children's toys?<eos> - Yes, okay. - I think they're called bicycles.
- That's a rattlesnake.<eos> - Is it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He's being killed.<eos> Quiet, everyone.<eos> Quiet, please.<eos> There's literally nothing we can do.<eos> He's yards away from us.<eos> Snakes are like herds of them.<eos> - They hunt in packs.
Now...<eos> I want to make it absolutely plain, 'cause I know this matters to anoraks, all three cars were running on exactly the same sort of tires.<eos> Yes, same tires, same track, same driver.<eos> So the times are down to the cars.<eos> Yup.<eos> And now it is time to reveal those times.<eos> Let me just make it absolutely clear.<eos> We don't know what they are.<eos> The producers have kept them from us.<eos> - They're top secret. - Yup.
showing off! Instead they don't count a fuck.<eos> But this is the time.<eos> Because if Conte pisses us off, it's one thing, but pissing off his own men is something else.<eos> You know, Ciro, we talked to Conte, he won't listen.<eos> Yeah. We don't have to talk to him.<eos> So, what is it, Ciro?<eos> There's a problem.<eos> If you knew all of mine!<eos> They're all pissed off.<eos> They want the stuff at Conte's price.
Excuse me!<eos> You sure it was them?<eos> Positive.<eos> Two, this is Three.<eos> Come in.<eos> Nyx, Four, anyone!<eos> Come in!<eos> Do you know who they were or where they went?<eos> Yeah, the Danker brothers.<eos> They probably took her back to their cabin.

They're very forgiving.<eos> When we first met, I tried to kill you all.<eos> Now I've been accepted as one of the crew.<eos> What's that?<eos> The "Raza" has just intercepted a subspace alarm from the planet's surface.<eos> The station has just enacted silent lockdown procedures and sent a coded transmission to Galactic Authority Central.<eos> - Up there.<eos> - Who are they?<eos> The Danker brothers.<eos> They're bad news.

If the GA secure the "Marauder" before we do, it won't matter.<eos> We'll all be trapped on this planet.<eos> Casto Capari.<eos> That's who she goes to.<eos> No, not Casto.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because a healthy girl like her, she'd fetch a far better price on Stropa-3.<eos> We'll cut out the middleman.<eos> We'll rent her out to the miners.<eos> When they're done with her, we'll sell her organs to the harvesters, her flesh to the meat traders, and I want whatever's left over.
You son of a bitch!<eos> Hey. Kid.<eos> Come on, wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> What...<eos> You okay?<eos> Oh.<eos> Take a minute.<eos> Everything's all right.<eos> There were these men, they...
I'm...<eos> You an artist? Oh, no.<eos> I'm just an art lover.<eos> Well, I'm a lover of art lovers.<eos> Does that count at all, or...<eos> Those are my sculptures there in the front.<eos> Really?<eos> I love them.<eos> The lady torso things?<eos> They're so beautiful.
No one would take it.<eos> The Jews, the vets, the gays.<eos> They all rejected it and said it was too big for their, like, showrooms or stores. Oh.<eos> The divorce table.<eos> He had to have it.<eos> I didn't want it, I paid for it, and guess who is now literally stuck with it?<eos> Oh, honey. Yeah.<eos> This is too big.<eos> And people don't really like, uh, shabby chic stuff anymore.<eos> They can't turn it around. What?
It's not like I don't miss him.<eos> You know, some nights. ...I feel like I am plunging thousands of feet below.<eos> And I wake up suddenly.<eos> What's wrong, Shekhar?<eos> What's wrong, Shekhar?<eos> Whenever you're scared of anything in life.. ...then you must face it.<eos> Fear is a coward.<eos> If you stare directly in its eye, it runs away.<eos> You know, people have woken up from coma even after 10 years.<eos> Sometimes they lose their memory..or something else.
- You got something?<eos> - She's in.<eos> We've got internal sensors and security cameras.<eos> Are they scanning for Tarium?<eos> - Only in the docking bays.<eos> - Why Tarium?<eos> We found evidence in the alternate reality.<eos> A single report that suggested the bomb may have been some kind of Tarium device.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> I've been around spaceports long enough to know that they always scan for it wherever ships are docking.
Why are you here, Portia?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Two.<eos> - You're in danger.<eos> - Aren't we all?<eos> You know in the alternate reality it was the destruction of Eos 7 that started the war.<eos> And you think the same thing will happen here?<eos> We think Ferrous smuggled a bomb on board.<eos> Three and Six are searching for it now.<eos> I also studied the events as they unfolded in the alternate reality.
- That's our house.<eos> - Still giving' orders!<eos> Pietro Savastano is back to raise Hell.<eos> He wanted to slap you... because he knows you're like a Neapolitan Mastiff.<eos> You fly off the handle.<eos> You don't understand his game.<eos> He wants us to rack up deaths, because deaths bring cops.<eos> It'll be crawling.<eos> And with the cops around, the dealing spots get blocked.<eos> Then people will say they got no life with us, it was better when Pietro Savastano was here.
- Bitch, I'ma call bell hooks on you. - Call her.<eos> Look, hey, but, Molly, you know what your problem is?<eos> No, but I know you're gonna tell me.<eos> Please enlighten me.<eos> You always try to control shit, and men don't like that.<eos> - You don't like that. - They don't like it.<eos> - He doesn't like that. - I actually think it's kind of sexy.<eos> Coat hanger.<eos> Seriously, where are your friends?<eos> Nah, see, I don't think they're your type.

- Just a degree.<eos> - Except for all the grateful women apparently waiting to suck my dick.<eos> - I would be, I would be.<eos> - Nasty.<eos> But, like, back to your friends, okay?<eos> - Kelli.<eos> - Like, what are some of their phone numbers?<eos> Like, off the top of your head?<eos> Yeah, and I'm sorry about my friends.<eos> They were a little crazy today.
But there is not a single day that goes by that I don't think of the child I lost.<eos> And I'm an old man now.<eos> I like to think that because of the child that I lost, because of the path that... that he sent me on, that I have saved countless other babies. Yeah.<eos> I like to think that maybe one day you'll be an old man like me talking a younger man's ear off, explaining to him how you... took the sourest lemon that life has to offer... and turned it into something resembling lemonade.<eos> If you can do that, then you will still be... taking three babies home from this hospital.<eos> Just... maybe not the way you planned.<eos> I don't know if that was meaningful or senile, but I thought it ought to be said.<eos> Your wife'll still be asleep for a little while.<eos> Go see your babies.<eos> They're excited to meet their father.

I think maybe they got a good one.<eos> Sorry. Just had to put the girls down.<eos> These people, they're your...<eos> My parents.<eos> Well, my adopted.<eos> They're my parents.<eos> You've been with them your whole life?<eos> From the start.<eos> A fireman found me.<eos> He took me to the hospital, and they were there.

Not even close.<eos> Heritage Falls, yep.<eos> Great.<eos> It'll be so much fun, yeah.<eos> ♪ For I'm going home ♪ How do you get up there so easily?<eos> Dad, look, my axe.<eos> Great, day one, tetanus.<eos> There's no tetanus.<eos> Would all the players sleep in there?<eos> No, they'd pitch their tents down on the sandbar.
But not my eyes and ears.<eos> I'm not your mole.<eos> - You're right. - Hm?<eos> I know.<eos> What am I right about this time?<eos> Okay. You need eyes and ears.<eos> I could be your mole.<eos> Won't work.<eos> People shut up when you're around.<eos> If they know I'm around.
A guy came in... fell three stories off his building into the alley.<eos> Ooh, Dumpster dive.<eos> Guys, don't mess around with intubation.<eos> Just crike him.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> There's too much swelling.<eos> Just cut him already.<eos> Come on, you guys!<eos> - There it is.<eos> - Okay, they got it.
I can't be the only one talking.<eos> Sisterhood is a two-way street.<eos> Is there anything you want to get off your chest?<eos> Any guy you're into?<eos> No.<eos> Miracles aren't always huge.<eos> The fever breaks.<eos> The stitch holds.<eos> The bone heals.<eos> That's why they can be hard to spot and why they can be such a pain in the ass.
This is the last place I want to be.<eos> But I saw Priscilla come in here.<eos> She took Flora from me before.<eos> I found that on the floor.<eos> Lee! What happened to you after the Lana Winters thing?<eos> Why the would I tell you?<eos> Come on, Lee, let us help you find Flora.<eos> We got all this equipment here just waiting to be used.<eos> We can work together to contact the spirits.<eos> Believe me! They will find us!
Well, in many ways, I understand Lee Harris.<eos> We are two women for whom trouble just seems to walk alongside.<eos> Which is why I think your rather crude analogy is actually quite true.<eos> Both Lee and I have the capacity, or the curse, depending on how you look at it, to be singular of thought.<eos> "Dogs with bones," as they say.<eos> When we latch onto something, it becomes our destiny and we will do anything to see it through.<eos> And what is that thing for Lee?<eos> Her daughter, of course.<eos> It's always been about Flora.<eos> If those settlers didn't want anybody bothering them... they shouldn't have chosen such a pretty place to make their home.
I just...<eos> - Oh, is it fine?<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is second Thursday.<eos> Vaccination day.<eos> We're about to get flooded by hundreds of patients needing shots on top of everyone else.<eos> I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.<eos> What's important is our patients.<eos> They can't be rescheduled like elective surgeries.<eos> They need you here and so do I. The answer's no.
Thanks.<eos> - Title IX is the school, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They didn't know?<eos> They said I didn't have a case, so now I'm here and they clearly don't want to help me either.<eos> You know, when the cops come back out, can you tell them that I left?<eos> I don't want to make a statement.<eos> Shouldn't you just...<eos> Pull it together, bitch.<eos> They're bringing the car around.
Died when I was 12.<eos> We're part of the same club.<eos> Your dad?<eos> No, mom.<eos> Car accident when I was nine.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - Oh, it's okay.<eos> Hey, we got it out of the way.<eos> There's nothing worse than someone asking what your parents do and...<eos> You tell them what your dad does and they go,
Super. Great.<eos> What flavors do you want?<eos> - We'll text you our orders.<eos> - Yeah, that's perfect.<eos> - Will you?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - All right. - Thanks, babe.<eos> Mm! My dream is to be a Westport detective.<eos> Mmm. Not a big fan of cops.<eos> - They're not so bad.

Not a big fan of cops.<eos> - They're not so bad.<eos> - Oh, maybe to you.<eos> Last time I dealt with them, I ended up in cuffs, and they made me drop my peanut butter fro-yo.
Yeah, but, like, funny stupid.<eos> Wait, was this the night that we...<eos> I had had a few drinks and I just needed to blow off some steam.<eos> Well, look, yo, I know you used to rap in high school, but it's weird seeing you like this.<eos> It was a mistake, okay?<eos> I never thought this would see the light of day.<eos> It's not that bad.<eos> Not that bad, Lawrence?<eos> Middle school kids have seen me rapping about pussy smells.<eos> For the rest of their lives, they're gonna associate pussy smells with me!
Over time, and also thanks to you, I thought I'd forgotten all that red. But phobias are stubborn, Mélanie.<eos> Seeing Catoun covered in blood scared me.<eos> I was staggered. I couldn't move...<eos> I killed her, Mélanie.<eos> I killed her.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> I'll clear Guillaume.<eos> What else can I do?<eos> Our friends at the chancellery will be thrilled.<eos> They will think I bowed my head so I could win their extra points.
Guillaume Vauban declared himself guilty of murdering C. Garrel.<eos> Order, or I will clear the room.<eos> It is my duty to warn you against that kind of hasty conclusions.<eos> Regarding my client's confession, I will have...<eos> You will speak when you take the floor, Mrs. Gasco.<eos> Right now, I'm going to have to ask you to remain seated.<eos> You may continue, Mr. Prosecutor General.<eos> Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> I think I know what Mrs. Gasco wants to tell us regarding Guillaume's confession.<eos> She will rightly point out the fact that innocent people sometimes confess crimes they didn't commit.
Anybody find that kitten?<eos> With the bloody--<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, but uniforms found a hole in a wall in a stairwell adjacent to the penthouse.<eos> Went straight through to the electrical system, some kind of pulse blew up the whole deal.<eos> What could've caused that?<eos> Lightning strike.<eos> Did that happen?<eos> Nope. We even checked the lightning rods.<eos> They still have lightning rods?
We're very good friends.<eos> You're a terrible assis-friend.<eos> ...Seattle police have ruled the death of billionaire entrepreneur Patrick Spring and several others an animal attack rather than a murder as was initially reported, though the nature of the animal remains undisclosed at this time.<eos> Sources within the police department will neither confirm nor deny-- Mm-hmm! --whether the tragic incident bears any connection to the recent disappearance of Spring's daughter, heiress Lydia Spring, now missing for over four days--<eos> Do you have any friends who can come by and help you with this, cleaning up, or-<eos> It's hard to keep friends when you can't go outside without worrying a gust of wind will knock you down.<eos> I barely get out of the house anymore.<eos> God.<eos> Why don't you move back in with mom and dad?<eos> Maybe they can help you.

I don't understand.<eos> You've lost your job, you've got that nut Dorian chasing you around, why give her all of your money? Surely--<eos> A disease runs in my family, it has for five generations.<eos> - Pararibulitis?<eos> - Yeah, right.<eos> How did you pay for treatment?<eos> You don't seem...<eos> Our parents.<eos> I was in college.<eos> They had more money back then.
And now... it's over.<eos> No, it's not--<eos> No, you can still have your daughter, you just bring us the other machine!<eos> Nobody move!<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Don't blame yourself.<eos> It always ended like this.<eos> Shut up!<eos> You would make a deal with these people?<eos> They killed Catherine!
And then, when my dad died and I was a dog and everything was hopeless, there you are with an army of weirdos, saving the day.<eos> It was perfect.<eos> You are perfect.<eos> Good luck, Farah. I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I just gave you $4 million.<eos> Wha... How?<eos> My phone.<eos> Have fun with your new friends.<eos> They seem insane.
That's our case.<eos> - Her father's death fits in.<eos> - Can you prove that?<eos> Soon.<eos> Where are the other two bodies? - Other two bodies?<eos> - From the crime scene.<eos> The tattooed men, one was bitten in half.<eos> Oh, they're gone.<eos> Two human corpses are gone?<eos> Well, they're not here.

Oh.<eos> Where are they existing currently?<eos> I think they were just transferred out to an FBI lab this morning for testing.
- What were you doing there?<eos> - Why are you doing this to me?<eos> Doing this to you?<eos> Answer the question.<eos> Who was the guy that I killed at the power station?<eos> Look, I'm just...<eos> I do power systems.<eos> Okay? I'm an electrician, technically, look, but people, organizations, individuals, they hire me to do... stuff.<eos> Illegal stuff.<eos> Look, they hit me up online, they wanted me to build some power converter to leech off a larger network.
I am not investigating anything!<eos> Then how will you get your lottery ticket?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> Would you let me finish?<eos> Go sit over there!<eos> Hello?<eos> Hang on. Hang on!<eos> Well, we find them too.<eos> It's the two guys from the hotel.<eos> They're obviously in on it.
- Someone shot at us!<eos> Hey, he only shot at me.<eos> And the house was even more mysterious, and we learned about that rock star, Lux DuJour.<eos> When did we learn about that?<eos> And this man, Gordon Rimmer, it's all very suspicious.<eos> He called the human Lydia "Rapunzel," ergo, vis a vis, I forward a theory!<eos> Are you Lydia Spring?<eos> You are?<eos> I want to go home, but I know you'll just be there now, so it's like--<eos> What we're dealing with here appears to be a criminal, or perhaps a group, that specializes in hypnotizing humans into believing they're specific dogs, and hypnotizing dogs into believing they're specific humans.
- Given Black Wing's significance...<eos> While you did discover some interesting phenomena, your research was inconclusive and without definable results.<eos> Mistakes were made.<eos> And worse is that you failed to keep the subjects contained and recover them from the initial breach.<eos> Now we have potentially dangerous individuals at large-- over 30 of them.<eos> And currently, we only have budget to surveil one...<eos> "Icarus."<eos> The one currently going by the name "Dirk Gently."<eos> The fact is, Ma'am, there's a reason that we haven't tried to bring in suspects after 15 years.<eos> They cannot be contained.
Yeah, well, I was there.<eos> You're really brave, sort of.<eos> Like crazy brave.<eos> Or maybe just stupid, but wow.<eos> And also surprisingly incapable.<eos> How've you survived this long?<eos> Well, that's why I needed you. Ha!<eos> God, how crazy was that?<eos> Those guys are total nutjobs.<eos> You think they're the ones who killed Patrick Spring?

Well, it's got to be connected, right?<eos> I mean, maybe they're part of the same group.
Agent Weedle, we didn't expect to see you so soon.<eos> This situation is a mess.<eos> You got anything on Farah Black?<eos> Lydia Spring's bodyguard?<eos> No, we haven't found her yet.<eos> Anything I can read on her?<eos> I have some questions. Only some?<eos> Sure.<eos> And the bodies from the penthouse still haven't turned up.<eos> We're starting to think they were stolen.
Come on.<eos> There you go.<eos> There's Lux.<eos> This is all Lux's stuff.<eos> What did you do to him?<eos> We found this thing, in the '60s.<eos> It came to us from another dimension or something.<eos> And then- and then we figured out that we could swap bodies with it.<eos> We started with animals at first. It was a spiritual thing.<eos> But then we realized, we could kidnap rich people and swap bodies with them, and then, when they outlived their usefulness, we'd just kill them and swap back.
He was taking food to a new place.<eos> That's ultimately what drew me there.<eos> I was diner and culinary school educated.<eos> So, I can cook a mean breakfast.<eos> But I was young and green, and... I didn't know what fine dining was.<eos> I walked in the kitchen.<eos> It was nothing like I'd ever experienced.<eos> It was... cutthroat.<eos> The cooks would sabotage you.<eos> They wanted to see you fail.
To find those ingredients, we need to find another person who loves that ingredient as much as I love it.<eos> About ten years ago, I was working in the restaurant, and someone said, "Alex, there's a guy outside who wants to talk with you about rice."<eos> And he said, "Please, can you taste this?<eos> We are producing a new variety of rice."<eos> And that was the black rice.<eos> [in Portuguese] Is this black rice?<eos> Yes, this is its flower.<eos> [Alex] How beautiful.<eos> [in English] When they decided to plant black rice, people started to laugh and said, "Those guys are nuts.<eos> They are planting black rice in a country where everybody only eats white rice."

It is Brazil.<eos> [Luiz] The menu at D.O.M.<eos> takes you on a journey through Brazilian cuisine.<eos> People who go to D.O.M.<eos> have to be open to seeing Brazilian products treated as delicacies.<eos> [Alex in English] Our chef's suggestion for lunch time since the very first day of D.O.M. is Workers' Food.<eos> [Luiz] The chef has managed to be subversive.<eos> He managed to make the elite eat rice and beans.<eos> But the presentation is so sophisticated and done with context, people feel authorized to like it.<eos> They don't need to be ashamed of liking it.
I'm serving a story.<eos> I'm serving my soul.<eos> I'm serving a conversation and I want you to talk back to me.<eos> I want you to dialogue with me.<eos> I'm triggering something inside of you... the memories inside of you.<eos> And if I do this, I know that I'm doing the right thing.<eos> I'm fascinated with people that I don't know.<eos> I wanna get a window into their life.<eos> You know, strangers adopted me.<eos> And then they gave me a different life that, perhaps, I shouldn't have had if I wasn't.
We find this in Europe a lot but not here.<eos> Oh, yeah, no, actually, that's right, they candy it.<eos> This, you've already smelled lots of times, but--<eos> - The chocolate mint?<eos> - The chocolate mint.<eos> -Oh, I love the chocolate mint.<eos> -Mmm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, I know it's, uh...<eos> These little guys are also interesting.<eos> They've got a nice texture to them.
- Oh, wow!<eos> Beautiful.<eos> - This fresh enough for you?<eos> You want to talk to them a little bit, and I think they're just, uh, just beautiful.<eos> You know, in Brittany, where I come from, we used to go get langoustine and, you know, those big langoustine?<eos> And when I saw the spot prawn the first time...<eos> We don't have that in France.<eos> -Mmm-hmm.<eos> -I don't know if you know that.<eos> Often, I feel that people overcook the shrimp in general, you know, and they just kind of lose what the shrimp is about.
I came in San Francisco in the '90s and I felt something.<eos> It's like, "This is home."<eos> The water was here.<eos> I remember the first time I went on the coast, I thought I was driving the coast of Brittany.<eos> I think, at a very young age, I wanted to travel the world.<eos> Because my dad really opened our eyes, to my brother and I, about the world.<eos> It's like, there's other things than just what you have around you.<eos> I think a lot of people came here to find answers at the time.<eos> You know, a lot of artists were here.<eos> It was a place where people felt safe to be who they wanted to be.
- Great.<eos> I'll go tell the chef.<eos> -Dominique, how are you?<eos> Hi.<eos> -Yeah, hi.<eos> -Hi, how are you?<eos> -This is my friend Bella.<eos> -Nice to meet you.<eos> -Hi, nice to meet you.<eos> You know, when I used to live in France, you know... you hang out with your friends and they're at your house until three, four o'clock in the morning.
-This is my friend Bella.<eos> -Nice to meet you.<eos> -Hi, nice to meet you.<eos> You know, when I used to live in France, you know... you hang out with your friends and they're at your house until three, four o'clock in the morning.<eos> Hi, how are you?<eos> - Welcome.<eos> - We have some mutual friends.<eos> We live close by and heard you're going to be in the neighborhood.<eos> Our friends came last night, so...<eos> -And did they like it?
At one point you need to, like, look at yourself and be, like, hard.<eos> It's like, "Hey, I mean, what were you thinking?"<eos> It's really hard with your parents.<eos> You know, you want to be there for their struggle.<eos> You wanna be present for their struggle.<eos> Coming back here...<eos> it's where it all started.<eos> It's where my parents come from.<eos> And when you look around... this place is the same when it was 20 years ago.<eos> They have something here that is special, that I think a lot of people are looking for.
I think this is beautiful.<eos> I think about the times that we used to drive to the beach, and... swim and play... and everybody was hot and sweaty, and you could smell the lotion, you know, the sunscreen lotion.<eos> Understanding where I spent most of my childhood, I think it has a lot of connection of what the restaurant is about.<eos> And I always say that it's not about us creating dishes.<eos> It's about us connecting everything... you know, from the start to the finish.<eos> I've always been searching to discover who I am.<eos> I'm still doing it.<eos> This journey has helped me to reflect on what matters and what doesn't matter.<eos> My parents were very close to each other.<eos> They were married for 45 years.
If you make your homework, you get sweets at night.<eos> So food was always a reward to me.<eos> My mom would always ask me, "What do you want for your birthday?"<eos> And still, I am turning 40 in a few weeks, and she asks me, and I always say the same thing, "I want pulpos en su tinta."<eos> That's my thing for special occasions at home, and I always craved it.<eos> Pulpos en su tinta is basically an octopus that has been cooked into a stew that has ink.<eos> Usually, little kids feel weird about octopus, and I always liked things that nobody else liked.<eos> And now, at Cosme, the restaurant in New York, we're doing an octopus that is fried.<eos> We just dust it with a little corn starch, and then we serve it with mole that is made with cashews.<eos> And so the beautiful moments from my childhood, they end up showing up in the menu in some way or form.
Chicatanas are flying ants, and they come out with the first rain that happens in the southern part of Mexico.<eos> So four or five days, you have chicatanas in the year, and that's it.<eos> To me, that's the definition of luxury, because you can only have it for four days and it comes from a very specific place.<eos> That's what I mean by the contrasts.<eos> If you have food available all the time, you probably wouldn't have eaten chicatana ants.<eos> If you weren't hungry, you probably wouldn't have eaten worms.<eos> But by that poverty...<eos> we found things that are delicious.<eos> By the time I... I was finishing high school, I knew I wanted to cook.<eos> When I told all my friends, they told me, like,
Yes.<eos> And go put on your shoes.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> People are going to think you don't like going to school.<eos> But that is actually true.<eos> By the time I graduated from cooking school, I was happy on how I was cooking.<eos> I felt I... I knew enough to open the restaurant.<eos> So I went back to Mexico, and my parents would have friends over, so I just started making dinners.<eos> They were like, "Oh, this is delicious."
I realized I was taking it too seriously.<eos> I went into cooking 'cause I had a lot of fun doing it when I was a teenager, and I love sharing with my friends.<eos> At some point, I forgot about it, uh...<eos> I was too obsessed trying to produce really high-quality food, and I forgot about having fun.<eos> I think that Mexicans love to have a good time... and if you're gonna have a restaurant in Mexico, you need to be a reflection of that, no?<eos> Of people having fun.<eos> Being laid-back and enjoying life, and enjoying cooking as much as you enjoy eating.<eos> So the next day, I walked into the kitchen, and I said, like, "Yeah, you can leave it on.<eos> It's fine." That just changed the whole dynamic.<eos> Once the cooks were enjoying their work, they performed much better, and that is when we started to get more and more customers.
My man.<eos> You're late.<eos> Traffic was bad.<eos> I thought you were doing shots of mezcal.<eos> No, no.<eos> By 2004, Pujol was getting to be known as one of the best restaurants in Mexico City.<eos> But still, something was not right.<eos> There was something that I didn't feel connected to.<eos> Most of my references at that point in time were these American chefs that started the New American cuisine.<eos> So, if you saw my dishes, they kind of looked like that, but, obviously, I was using Mexican ingredients because, uh, that's what I had available.
These are harsh living conditions.<eos> The farmers work very hard to survive.<eos> Beautiful room.<eos> They're arranged by date.<eos> There's a date on top<eos> - and then they go by age.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> How long do you keep them here?<eos> For four weeks.<eos> In this very modest region, they didn't have refrigerators or cold places for storing.
She was cooking there that day.<eos> And the meal was welcoming.<eos> It was warm and it was very tasty.<eos> You know, you really enjoyed it.<eos> So I really wanted to do a story on Ana.<eos> This editor, he said, "Slovenia, what is that?<eos> I mean, who is she and what is she doing?<eos> What's the interest?"<eos> So after that, what happened is I kind of had to invent a whole story to bring the people here and, you know, make them fall in love as well.<eos> And they loved it.
In the kitchen, it's a virtual United Nations.<eos> You get quite a good feeling.<eos> It's a very energetic vibe.<eos> Not too formal, not too rigid.<eos> A typical meal at Gaggan is a journey.<eos> It's an adventure.<eos> Everything that Gaggan's doing has roots in different regions of India.<eos> Almost all of it is street-food rooted.<eos> You can trace back the courses.<eos> No matter how sophisticated and crazy they are, they're all rooted in something very local, something indigenous.
It was a special spice blend.<eos> It was his family's blend, and he put it on the stock.<eos> And the whole flavor changed.<eos> I asked him, "What is that?"<eos> His answer was, "This will go to my grave."<eos> I hated him.<eos> I told him, "You're a disgrace to the chef."<eos> He took my head.<eos> He took me to my boss.<eos> He said, "These guys, who you train as educated chefs, they don't know how to respect."
I was physically manhandled in front of 100 people.<eos> There were so many stories in that hotel.<eos> We would hear stories that some trainee chef has been kicked, somebody has been slapped, somebody has been pushed.<eos> It was a disaster.<eos> That was the end.<eos> That day, actually, I quit it.<eos> And I never went back.<eos> There was so much hate in that environment.<eos> There was so much frustration in those guys.<eos> They took out all their frustration on us.
This is amazing.<eos> Chicken tikka masala symbolizes Indian food, no?<eos> I love my chicken tikka masala.<eos> It was not even Indian.<eos> This is a British invention.<eos> British brought us tea.<eos> Two hundred years back, we didn't have anything called tea.<eos> All we did was drinking yogurt as lassi.<eos> Even the naans, the breads, were not Indian.<eos> They are actually Persian.
And that's the quality I expect from you guys.<eos> Are we okay?<eos> Are we saying "yes" together?<eos> Yes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Ah, thank you.<eos> I love you all.<eos> The first part of the menu is a rapid-fire.<eos> I want people to be shot with food... at a point-blank range.<eos> You kill them before they even realize it.
Just put it in the mouth, and it gives you a little explosion.<eos> I want my first ten dishes to be finished in the first 25 minutes.<eos> And then you take the pace slow.<eos> He just takes people on this incredible journey to all regions of India.<eos> Lamb!<eos> Lamb!<eos> Lamb, lamb, lamb.<eos> There's a few standard things that stay on the menu, but there's constantly new things coming that are really surprising.<eos> You get what he calls Indian foie gras, which is goat brain, which is a delicacy in India.<eos> He often introduces it as Indian foie gras, without telling people what they're eating until they've had it.

And I thought, "How do I replicate it if I don't understand it?"<eos> So I used to buy El Bulli books.<eos> I had set up a small kitchen in my home, practicing things.<eos> First foam I made was in Red.<eos> I served somebody a foam and he thought, "What is this?<eos> What's this?<eos> Why are the foods like this?<eos> Why is the food like French food?"<eos> People thought I was mad.<eos> They hated it.

They said, "This is not Indian food.<eos> Don't change our food."<eos> I couldn't do fine food.<eos> I was fed up.<eos> So one day, I got drunk.<eos> I had a bad day with my boss that morning, and my executive chef.<eos> I went to a party.<eos> Drunk, drunk, drunk.<eos> Totally drunk.<eos> And then my friends, they all ganged me up and said,
"Bitch.<eos> Loser."<eos> "Marion the bitch is about."<eos> Look at this.<eos> 12 February "You bitch!<eos> Go and hang yourself!"<eos> It wasn't suicide, it was murder.<eos> I'm going to make war on the murderers.<eos> In letting Marion be bullied, insulted, criticized, without intervening, without informing us, your employees, dear Minister of Education, did not do their job.<eos> They allowed bullies to go unpunished and push Marion to suicide.

So I will find your ship, eventually.<eos> But you could save me a lot of time and yourselves a lot of trouble if you just give me the coordinates.<eos> Now, if by trouble, you mean death or torture, you're forgetting that these are clone bodies.<eos> You can't really hurt us.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> You see, the same way that you were able to target my transit pod, I'm able to do the same in reverse, sending a powerful subspace charge back the way you came.<eos> And if your bodies are still in their transmission pods, which I'm willing to bet they are, the charge will, in layman's terms, fry your brains.<eos> As for hurting you, well, well, this is Mr. Ostrander.<eos> He's a specialist in the field.<eos> See, these bodies may be cloned, but they still do feel pain.
And what's the point, right?<eos> Perhaps it was an experiment designed to test my machine-based responsiveness to human sentiments.<eos> Or an adjustment required in order for me to respond to a complex but ultimately irrational scenario.<eos> Or maybe it was a wholly impractical, completely illogical, compassionate act of kindness.<eos> Could be.<eos> I'm just wondering.<eos> - How's it coming?<eos> - Almost got it.<eos> You know having the travelers in the pods is just a legal requirement set up by GA convention?<eos> They don't actually have to be in there the whole time.
We were taken back to Lyon.<eos> On and off, on Touvier's orders, the militiamen let a prisoner out, and the next day we'd find his body in the woods, unrecognisable, tortured to death.<eos> - Who was Touvier?<eos> - He commanded the Milice.<eos> What became of these members after the Liberation?<eos> Many were executed.<eos> And Touvier?<eos> He was condemned to death in absentia.<eos> We think he was killed earlier, in 1944, with other members were trying to escape by swimming.<eos> They were shot by machine guns.
And it was also a network to get false papers.<eos> Paul Touvier, what do you know about him?<eos> Touvier?<eos> He lived in the flat of a Jewish family and he drove a car stolen from a Jew, and he systematically robbed and extorted Jewish salespeople.<eos> He'd give us up to the Gestapo for money.<eos> Haven't you ever heard of the treasure of the Milice?<eos> It wasn't only for the money.<eos> It was pure anti-Semitic.<eos> The militiamen were anti-Semitists.<eos> They had fun throwing a grenade in a synagogue on people praying... For the fun of it.
After that, you're leaving for La Paz.<eos> Delarue, a former resistant, worker at the Renault factories, before becoming a great cop at the crime squad head office.<eos> He was in charge of clearing the occupation legacy.<eos> He even published many books on the topic.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We must win this trial on abortion.<eos> We must manage to touch public opinion.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> You've got abortionist doctors?<eos> They're scared of being drummed out.
Double standards, depending on if we're French or not.<eos> OK.<eos> If it goes right up to the top of the government, I want you to be 100 % sure of your sources.<eos> And above all, no leak until the article's released.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> You saw the hostages before they were executed?<eos> It was on 28 June, 44.<eos> The day Henriot was killed.<eos> They were 7.

She told me what happened.<eos> She'd never mentioned it to anyone.<eos> I was there, that day.<eos> I don't really remember.<eos> My sister says I had nightmares for a long time after that.<eos> Our mother had just lit the candles for the Sabbath.<eos> It was cold.<eos> They came in to the yard...<eos> Léna said it was the tall one who did the ordering.<eos> He asked the refugees to go to the synagogue, because it would be a pity if they missed the service.

"They're dead."<eos> I was shocked.<eos> I said: "But you know it."<eos> She had got a document with the lists of Jews from Lyon, who died in Auschwitz.<eos> She was 13 once again.<eos> It was her 13-year-old voice.<eos> When there was a report on Eastern countries,<eos> Léna and I would always look at the faces.<eos> We tried to recognise them.<eos> They might have been alive when the Russians arrived.

They might have been alive when the Russians arrived.<eos> They might have gone with them.<eos> They might have been... stuck there, on the other side of the wall.<eos> She always waited for them.<eos> We can now give them a grave.<eos> I think Touvier has come back to live in the area.<eos> He's not dead?<eos> When I will have found him, you think your sister will accept to testify against him?<eos> You said there's prescription.<eos> Throwing a grenade at people because they're Jews, that could be a crime against humanity.
I'm the 8th hostage.<eos> The one who survived the firing squad in Rillieux.<eos> The militiamen had raided the Jews in their homes, in cafés, in the street...<eos> We were 11, all together.<eos> Come over here!<eos> What's happening?<eos> Henriot was shot down.<eos> - Henriot?<eos> - That's not good for us.<eos> They won't dare.

I'll call you back to give you my answer.<eos> It will be on my conditions.<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> Show me.<eos> "Paul Touvier<eos> "Care of Intelligence.<eos> "The Resistance continues and has sentenced you to death.<eos> Get ready."<eos> I'll call the cops.<eos> You think they'll come?

Looks like we're not as popular as we used to be.<eos> It's not you.<eos> We're Kurds.<eos> They're Arabs.<eos> Meaning? One group has been robbed of their rights, stripped of their land, had their people killed.<eos> And the other group is Arabs.<eos> I'm sure the Arabs would disagree.<eos> We both know it's not that simple.<eos> Dr. Callahan, may I speak with you privately, please?<eos> Every single one of these new refugees, they're nauseous, they're suffering from aches and pains, they're spiking a fever...

This is not the flu.<eos> Okay, Syd, you need to calm down.<eos> Don't tell me to calm down.<eos> These people probably have malaria, and they are now inside our camp, infecting everybody.
We don't have enough meds for a typhus outbreak.<eos> Hey, man. Welcome back.<eos> So, you got a piece of that trap stuck in your lung. We got it out just in time.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> When can I get back out there?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy. Easy, easy, easy.<eos> You just had open-chest surgery.<eos> You're gonna have to relax for a while.<eos> The animals will have to wait a few weeks.<eos> Oh, but they can't, though.
* The jittery TV<eos> * Glowing white like fire<eos> * And I called out the window<eos> * Down to the sea<eos> * And the devil Comes collecting * For nothing is for free<eos> * And I call out the window<eos> * Jesus rising by<eos> * Field.<eos> You know, I'm... to a fault, have had a thing about words, both, love and respect about words, but, a kind of fear about words, of where they can actually take you, and...<eos> Um, what they can expose and stuff about you.
- Snow. - No, I'm not afraid of her.<eos> We defeated you before. We'll do it again.<eos> Oh, I'm not the one who's going to destroy your... happy endings.<eos> Not this time.<eos> Then who is?<eos> You.<eos> You're going to destroy everyone's happy endings.<eos> You won't divide this family.<eos> Oh, I won't have to.<eos> The people from the Land of Untold Stories aren't the only ones with tales they don't want told.
I was 14 years old.<eos> A woman from my neighborhood came to talk to me about a job that involved travel.<eos> I wanted to be a model.<eos> I saw a casting call on Facebook.<eos> They got me in my underwear.<eos> And they told me I was very pretty.<eos> I was leaving my house, I was two blocks away, and two guys grabbed me...<eos> RESCUE OF THE TWIN SISTERS<eos> ADOPTIVE PARENTS AND THE MIRACULOUS REUNION WITH THEIR DAUGHTERS<eos> And they called to tell me I'd gotten the job.

Can you I.D. the location?<eos> Hold that thought.<eos> Sir!<eos> It was in her bag.<eos> What is this?<eos> What does this mean?<eos> Hello!<eos> I'll take Marcy.<eos> You send me the coordinates en route!<eos> It means that your people are in my lab trying to break into the containment unit, and they don't know what they're frigging doing.
I've had enough of this conversation.<eos> Let me see her right now, before I call your superiors and tell them you've been freelancing as a part-time private detective.<eos> I give up.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Lock down the building.<eos> Find her!<eos> Gleason, you gotta be kidding me!<eos> My men will find her!<eos> No!<eos> They will stand down and stay out of this!
Find her!<eos> Gleason, you gotta be kidding me!<eos> My men will find her!<eos> No!<eos> They will stand down and stay out of this!<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> Who knows what damage you've done.<eos> I've released all non-essential personnel.<eos> Where are my reinforcements?<eos> They should be there any minute.
Christ, I've changed parties 1 2 times!<eos> You really want to join the PEN?<eos> Come on, Bougon!<eos> You owe me one.<eos> It's time you returned the favour.<eos> Why do I owe you one?<eos> Who got you into politics?<eos> Who pissed you off enough to give you that push?<eos> I did.<eos> And my presence will reassure Μontreal's business community. They're not too happy about the rise of the PEN.
Just like back home.<eos> No, it's much better here.<eos> These people will do anything for an American dollar.<eos> Just thinking about it makes me wet.<eos> Look.<eos> Did you see that hot piece of ass?<eos> You're gonna cheat on your husband?<eos> It's not cheating in Cuba.<eos> it'd only be cheating if the locals were real human beings, but they're not.<eos> I mean, even in their own country, they don't have civil rights.

Τell me you're not serious.<eos> We're not really divorcing, are we?<eos> Τhat would be difficult. We never got married.<eos> We didn't?<eos> Look, Τita.<eos> You know... All I wanted was more attention than you gave your dog.<eos> You don't know what you're saying!<eos> When it wasn't politics, it was Chabot or beer, or the newspaper or your...<eos> Where are your dogs?<eos> They're in daycare for a few days.
So, if you'll excuse me, I'm going back to work.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - It's noon, sir.<eos> Τhat's what I said.<eos> Premier Bougon, after your wife's indiscretions, our public relations team thinks reporters will start looking into your past.<eos> Who's he?<eos> I'm the ethics commissioner.<eos> Ethics commissioner?<eos> Τhat must be a new position.<eos> If they look into your past, they're likely to find out about the Culture Μinister's past involvement in prostitution.
There will be 60 long seconds of silence on Twitter as a form of protest.<eos> This mass movement is reminiscent of the biggest revolutions that have shaped our civilization.<eos> ls it that bad?<eos> - The people have no leader.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Panic is setting in.<eos> It's not your fault, Dad.<eos> People think what they're told to think.<eos> Τhey read it in the paper, and they don't even question it.<eos> If they're even smart enough to read the paper.
♪ Oh, brother... ♪<eos> I had at last come home.<eos> If there was, in this, some illusion, there was also much truth.<eos> In the years in Paris,<eos> I had never been homesick for anything American.<eos> Neither waffles, ice cream, hot dogs, baseball, majorettes, movies, nor the Empire State Building, nor Coney Island, nor the Statue of Liberty, nor the Daily News, nor Times Square.<eos> All of these things had passed out of me.<eos> They might never have existed, and it made absolutely no difference to me if I never saw them again.<eos> But I missed my brothers and sisters, and my mother.<eos> They made a difference.

She was incredibly beautiful.<eos> She looked down at me with so beautiful a smile that I was not even embarrassed, which was rare for me.<eos> By this time,<eos> I had been taken in hand by a young white schoolteacher named Bill Miller, a beautiful woman, very important to me.<eos> She gave me books to read and talked to me about the books, and about the world:<eos> about Ethiopia, and Italy, and the German Third Reich, and took me to see plays and films, to which no one else would have dreamed of taking a ten-year-old boy.<eos> It is certainly because of Bill Miller, who arrived in my terrifying life so soon, that I never really managed to hate white people.<eos> Though, God knows,<eos> I've often wished to murder more than one or two.<eos> Therefore, I begin to suspect that white people did not act as they did because they were white, but for some other reason.
The role of the janitor is small, yet the man's face bangs in my memory until today.<eos> - I have done nothing.<eos> - Nobody says you have, Tom.<eos> But they might.<eos> The film's icy brutality both scared me...<eos> What for?<eos> ...and strengthened me.<eos> Because Uncle Tom refuses to take vengeance in his own hands, he was not a hero for me.<eos> Heroes, as far as I could see, where white, and not merely because of the movies, but because of the land in which I lived, of which movies were simply a reflection.<eos> I despised and feared those heroes because they did take vengeance into their own hands.

This was sometimes hard on my morale, but I had to accept, as time wore on, that part of my responsibility, as a witness, was to move as largely and as freely as possible.<eos> To write the story, and to get it out.<eos> We should all be concerned with but one goal, the eradication of crime.<eos> The Federal Bureau of Investigation is as close to you as your nearest telephone.<eos> It seeks to be your protector in all matters within its jurisdiction.<eos> It belongs to you.<eos> White people are astounded by Birmingham.<eos> Black people aren't.<eos> White people are endlessly demanding to be reassured that Birmingham is really on Mars.<eos> They don't want to believe, still less to act on the belief, that what is happening in Birmingham is happening all over the country.

One of the most terrible things, is that, whether I like it or not,<eos> I am an American.<eos> My school really was the streets of New York City.<eos> My frame of reference was...<eos> George Washington and John Wayne.<eos> But I was a child, you know, and when a child puts his eyes on the world, he has to use what he sees.<eos> There's nothing else to use.<eos> And you are formed by what you see, the choices you have to make, and the way you discover what it means to be black in New York and then throughout the entire country.<eos> I know how you watch, as you grow older, and it's not a figure of speech, the corpses of your brothers and your sisters pile up around you.<eos> And not for anything they have done.

There's my little girl.<eos> Peola, you may you home.<eos> Gee, I didn't know she was colored.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!<eos> Peola!<eos> Peola!<eos> I know very well that my ancestors had no desire to come to this place.<eos> But neither did the ancestors of the people who became white, and who require of my captivity a song.<eos> They require a song of me, less to celebrate my captivity than to justify their own.
That time is now.<eos> The root of the black man's hatred is rage, and he does not so much hate white men as simply wants them out of his way, and more than that, out of his children's way.<eos> The root of the white man's hatred is terror.<eos> I'm gonna kill you.<eos> A bottomless and nameless terror, which focuses on this dread figure, an entity which lives only in his mind.<eos> Run!<eos> Come on!<eos> I can't make it, I can't make it!<eos> When Sidney jumps off the train, the white liberal people downtown were much relieved and joyful.<eos> But when black people saw him jump off the train, they yelled, "Get back on the train, you fool!"

There are good prospects for practically all types of goods and services.<eos> All too often though, they are overlooked prospects.<eos> Since 1940, in San Francisco alone, the Negro market has increased by 89%.<eos> Here are millions of customers for what you have to sell.<eos> Customers with 15 billion dollars to spend<eos> Someone once said to me that the people in general cannot bear very much reality.<eos> He meant by this that they prefer fantasy to a truthful recreation of their experience.<eos> People have quite enough reality to bear, by simply getting through their lives, raising their children, dealing with the eternal conundrums of birth, taxes, and death.<eos> Negroes are continuously making progress here in this country.<eos> The progress in many areas is not as fast as it should be, but they are making progress, and we will continue to make progress.

the lie of their pretended humanism.<eos> This means that their history has no moral justification, and that the West has no moral authority.<eos> "Vile as I am,"<eos> states one of the characters in Dostoevsky's The Idiot,<eos> "I don't believe in the wagons that bring bread to humanity.<eos> For the wagons that bring bread to humanity, may coldly exclude a considerable part of humanity from enjoying what is brought."<eos> For a very long time, America prospered.<eos> This prosperity cost millions of people their lives.<eos> Now, not even the people who are the most spectacular recipients of the benefits of this prosperity are able to endure these benefits.<eos> They can neither understand them nor do without them.

[chuckles] It looks like Clover actually did it.<eos> She fake-napped my parents.<eos> Now, all we have to do is find where she stashed them, set them free, and they'll be convinced to leave forever and-- [groaning]
So, your reason for making alien contact is for better techno music?<eos> Well, yeah. And maybe meet a cool alien best friend to eat candy with or go cruising around in a tripped out space hooptie.<eos> [chuckles] Clover, let's make this happen!<eos> I'll stake out Mort's stump tonight.<eos> Oh, no, no no.<eos> I don't want Johnny Law poking around in my pad.<eos> And I will stake out the stump as well.<eos> Ooh, I'll make hummus.<eos> If the aliens come, let me do the talking.<eos> I'll simply explain to them that they're focusing on the wrong lemur when the perfect abductee has been right in front of them the whole time.
Maurice, situation report.<eos> Maurice?<eos> [Maurice continues whimpering] What we saw in there is not normal.<eos> We have to warn the village.<eos> Sorry, Mo-Mo, but we're on information lockdown.<eos> Nobody finds out about this.<eos> The citizens deserve transparency, Your Majesty.<eos> Well, I, uh... They deserve to know the truth.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Of course they do, but you know how citizens are.
-It is now.<eos> King Julien, the bunker's ready.<eos> We have to evacuate before it's too late.<eos> King Julien?<eos> Clover?<eos> Mort?<eos> I'm too late? The aliens must've gotten 'em already.<eos> Why? [sobbing] [shouts] Why!<eos> Everybody into the bunker.<eos> Let's go! There's not much time before they take you too!
-...futon situation.<eos> -That's okay, I'm-- You know what? I know where to find you now.<eos> I'll visit all the time.<eos> I-I'm not just saying that either.<eos> Bye, dear.<eos> [all humming] Yes, my peoples.<eos> I have confronted the aliens and showed them who's boss.<eos> Uh... my peoples?<eos> Could it be some sort of mass extinction event?<eos> Do not be ridiculous. They were obviously raptured up to the Sky Gods' palace in Frankri-La.
Lemur spirit, let's go!<eos> Yes! Willie, thank you for expressing your lemur spirit.<eos> Oh, no, actually, I was just raising my hand to ask if we could go home now.<eos> Ugh. Oh, yeah, Willie.<eos> Yeah, sure, yeah. Go ahead, no problem.<eos> Go ahead and leave, if you don't care about sacrifice, and its saucy handmaiden freedom!<eos> Why?<eos> Oh! I was just being passive aggressive, people.<eos> [screams] You're not actually supposed to leave!<eos> These idiots would be singing a different tune if they ever had to go to war.
What goes on in there? You tell me!<eos> Huh? Huh?<eos> But you can't, you see?<eos> Listen up, everybody.<eos> The butterflies attacked our water slide.<eos> Uncool!<eos> Un-cool! Seems like we should probably bond over this, and I don't know, I'm just throwing out ideas, spitballing, declare war or something.<eos> Well, if King Julien says we should go to war, then we should go to war.<eos> Of course we should!<eos> They attacked us and destroyed our water slide.
Afraid to ask, Your Majesty, but... what'd you do with the entire kingdom's supply of food?<eos> Don't worry, Mo-Mo.<eos> I just had Hector throw all the food into that giant fiery pit of lava over there on that hill.<eos> That darn idiot king's finally gonna kill us all.<eos> Bunch a ding dongs.<eos> What are we gonna do when we run out of Booty Doodles?<eos> Ha! Oh, Mo-Mo, that is never gonna happen!<eos> Man, this is working great!<eos> It's wonderful having the geckos help out.<eos> It's cost effective 'cause they work for praise!
He's just using flattery and fear to coerce you.<eos> And boy, is it working.<eos> [sighs] It looks like the people have spoken.<eos> They want their scorpions.<eos> Yeah, they do!<eos> Because we know scorpions don't sting lemurs.<eos> Lemurs sting lemurs!<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> As long as there's a lemur there to control them, these scorpions pose no threat.<eos> Could they easily take over the kingdom because they outnumber us?

Sometimes I glue a little hair on it so I feel more normal.<eos> You are normal, Karen, mostly.<eos> You should probably put the glove back on now.<eos> [narrator] King Julien was the most popular lemur in school.<eos> Ooh. A special tribute video to me.<eos> Or was he?<eos> The truth is, everyone in King Julien's class was only nice to him because he was the prince.<eos> No one will know it's me, right?<eos> [narrator] King Julien's friends were only pretending to be his friends because he was a prince and they had to.<eos> They pretended to laugh at King Julien's jokes.

That was some scoop, huh?<eos> "Lena Luthor's stated goal is to repair the damage "her brother did to the family name, "but by branding an alien detection device with the name 'Luthor, '<eos> Damn straight.<eos> "Though shareholders may delight at the financial prospects of such a device, "there is little for a concerned citizen to do but weep at the shameless "fear-mongering to the country's immigrant-fearing lowest common denominator."<eos> I was really proud of that sentence.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> It's...<eos> It's what you wanted.<eos> You said you wanted Lena Luthor's take on aliens. Well, here it is.<eos> She thinks they should be ID'd like lepers.
I don't strictly date aliens, for the record though.<eos> I do like them more than most humans.<eos> Why?<eos> I can relate to them, I guess.<eos> Growing up a non-white, non-straight girl, in Blue Springs, Nebraska,<eos> I might as well been from Mars.<eos> I was an outcast and I felt like it.<eos> Our alien neighbors, they are no different.<eos> Most of them are hardworking immigrants, or refugees just trying to get by.<eos> They have to hide who they are in order to survive.
"Amnesty" is just another mask to disguise registration.<eos> That's a pretty cynical opinion.<eos> Well, if it isn't the President's little pet alien.<eos> You're a traitor to your people.<eos> It's not us against them.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But I've been to half a dozen planets just like this one.<eos> You want to know what they all have in common?<eos> The locals lock away anything that they think is different.
Minor first degree burn and a bruised collar bone.<eos> You should be fine in a few days.<eos> Gee, I didn't think you cared.<eos> I'm just kidding.<eos> I owe you big.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Happy to.<eos> You did something for me too.<eos> You know, I um...<eos> I've been hunting aliens for so long that I never really stopped to consider that maybe they weren't all hostiles to be caged.
People have been forging paper records.<eos> We haven't set up a system to verify these sorts of claims.<eos> Rebuilding our database is the only solution to this problem.<eos> Immunity is on the table in exchange for a name.<eos> That's all I care about.<eos> We have to talk to them.<eos> They can't do this after what happened last night.<eos> What, that some Mexican restaurant got shot up?<eos> We can't let them get away with this.<eos> They're going to get away with this.
Some silly poem.<eos> It meant very much to him.<eos> I use it as a reminder... a reminder of him and a reminder of what I never wanted to become.<eos> Go on.<eos> How is the Dark Army behind this... whatever this is?<eos> It's one thing to question your mind.<eos> It's another to question your eyes and ears.<eos> But then again, isn't it all the same, our senses just mediocre inputs for our brain?<eos> Come on.<eos> Sure, we rely on them, trust they accurately portray the real world around us, but what if the haunting truth is, they can't?
I didn't see anything like that.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> No.<eos> I remember because the cops were asking every one of us questions about that night, and like I told them... cleaned up my station, and I went home.<eos> Derek, you said you were serious about punishing him.<eos> Yeah, but Joanna...<eos> Look at my face, Derek.<eos> You want the man that did this to me to do what he did and get away with it?<eos> But Joanna, I...<eos> Once you tell the cops your story, they're gonna ask you why you're just now confessing after months of silence.
All right. You know what, Emily?<eos> You're such a fun-stopper. You sound just like my doctors.<eos> Can you just bring me the brace?<eos> Like, when do I ask you to do anything?<eos> Thank you.<eos> [door chimes] Couple of customers tried to get in. But don't worry, I stopped them.<eos> Aw, dude, come on, man.<eos> What's wrong with the fish? What?<eos> I think the lights heated up the, uh... the water, yeah.<eos> -[stammers] Yeah, they're dead.

Why won't these dead fish swim?<eos> Okay, next plan.<eos> We're gonna tape the fish to the outside of the tank.<eos> That way, it'll look like they're floating on camera.
I was just embarrassed, and...<eos> You know, I thought if I posted a mean comment that you would stop.<eos> That doesn't even make any sense.<eos> Why would you be embarrassed?<eos> Because... [sighs]<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I'm just used to you doing this stuff around the house, but now you're putting yourself out there, and people are gonna think you're... People are gonna think you're different.<eos> I thought it was a good thing to be different. It is, it is.<eos> It's just... It's just when you're too different, people will be mean to you, and that doesn't just affect you because... we're sisters.<eos> So... they'll be mean to me, too.
What you do with it is up to you,<eos> [ Keys jingling ]<eos> This cop -- this cheap fuck gun-and-a-badge tough guy, I´d like to see him meet me somewhere,<eos> What?<eos> !

[Miranda] Are we there yet?<eos> [Jim] Not much longer.<eos> Hey, Patrick, keep an eye out for any theaters because, uh... one of them might work.<eos> Because it will be the one that I booked, uh, prior, earlier.<eos> Roger that.<eos> You two keep quiet.<eos> It's the feds.<eos> Let me handle this.<eos> Uncle Jim, we don't have time for this.<eos> Just tell them I'm a celebrity and they'll let us go.
I mean, he just jumped right in there without any warm-ups.<eos> That's sloppy.<eos> Now, any of you other smart alecks want to give it a try?<eos> Then watch the master at work.<eos> Style and substance.<eos> Miranda, you're up next.<eos> I don't want to wave a stupid flag. I want to ride a horse. I told you that.<eos> You can't ride a horse!<eos> Horses get spooked by flags.<eos> And then they kick a little kid. And then the little kid with a smashed-in face...
Her mother's had a DUI.<eos> Alternatively, you can just accept the fact that you're less attractive and uninteresting.<eos> That option may even be more realistic.<eos> I'm gonna go...<eos> Good talk.<eos> Um, Ms. Day, can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> Let's not pretend I have a choice.<eos> What is it? Um, I have some forms for a field trip I need your signature on.<eos> Shouldn't your parents fill those out?<eos> They're dead.
Pigs again.<eos> Matt brought the cops to the farm.<eos> They were just as shocked as we were by what we found in that barn.<eos> There was no sign of the rest of the Polk family.<eos> It was like they just took off and abandoned those... poor things.<eos> All I kept thinking was if that family treated their own flesh and blood like animals, what were they doing to my baby?<eos> We did a thorough search of the farmhouse and based on what we could gather, they were occupying the land illegally.<eos> Now, it looks like they probably knew we were coming, so they took the girl and fled before we could catch them.<eos> I guess they figured those boys could fend for themselves.<eos> Oh, Jesus. And now they could be anywhere.
Someone's talking to them now.<eos> I can do my own interrogating.<eos> Hey, sir!<eos> I can't let you go in there.<eos> That's my kid they took!<eos> Mason, let them do their job.<eos> For Flora's sake.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Come on, brother.<eos> A social worker tried talking to those boys to see if they knew anything, but... they could barely speak.
Mason, let them do their job.<eos> For Flora's sake.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Come on, brother.<eos> A social worker tried talking to those boys to see if they knew anything, but... they could barely speak.<eos> I'll give you another piece if you tell me your name.<eos> Croatoan!<eos> Croatoan!<eos> That was all they said.<eos> It was the only word they knew.
Priscilla is real.<eos> She's a child.<eos> She has a fondness for corn husk dolls.<eos> She died in the late 1500s.<eos> I believed Cricket had some kind of sight.<eos> There are people with the gift.<eos> Touched.<eos> Matt thinks I'm too gullible.<eos> I've read about these psychics.<eos> It all seems like magic, but they are just really good at the con.

! Where's Flora at?<eos> What did they say?<eos> That word that you said...<eos> Is she afraid?<eos> Is she all right?<eos> "Croatoan."<eos> What does it mean?<eos> Rest your pretty little heads.<eos> Cricket has all the answers you seek.<eos> The spirits are dark and malevolent, and they do indeed have your daughter.
A fugitive who murdered his own father...<eos> Colonel Mori?<eos> I swear it.<eos> - So how'd it go?<eos> - As expected.<eos> They'll return to Zairon with a plausible tale.<eos> They'll claim they encountered a Pyr destroyer.<eos> That'll explain the battle damage.<eos> And you're confident these men won't betray you?<eos> They swore an oath of loyalty.

- They'll remain loyal to me.<eos> - How can you be so sure?<eos> Because I know them.<eos> I wish you would've talked to me before you did it.<eos> - I couldn't take the risk.<eos> - What risk?<eos> That you would tell the others and they would try to stop me.<eos> They think that memories are dangerous.<eos> And what if they are dangerous?<eos> They're necessary.
All we do is share our deepest thoughts and feelings.<eos> Kids, could you leave the room, please?<eos> Faster!<eos> Geronimo!<eos> Marge, it's nothing.<eos> She's just my new best friend.<eos> What the...<eos> Why...<eos> Why are you mad at those eggs? !<eos> They didn't do anything!
Now, Homer, Tibor is no better than you.<eos> He just dresses nicer.<eos> I guess I could dress a little better.<eos> Probably.<eos> That's the most ambitious thing you've ever said.<eos> Guys, is there something wrong with the way I dress?<eos> No. If you're a typewriter salesman in 1953.<eos> Also, for a guy, you show way too much cleavage.<eos> Hey, these two have gotten me out of so many traffic tickets.<eos> Look, man, if people think your clothes are outdated, they'll think you're outdated.
I mean, the baby is already asleep.<eos> Enough!<eos> Time for revenge most sweet.<eos> - Uh... - Wait a minute.<eos> I thought you said "furious four."<eos> I did.<eos> Revenge!<eos> But first we dance.<eos> Will nobody stop these people?<eos> In Hell they make you watch them all in a row.
But, uh, where is Master Simpson?<eos> I believe he's... having a little Sherri.<eos> ♪ 600 ♪<eos> ♪ Yes, that's right ♪<eos> ♪ We've churned out 600 shows ♪<eos> ♪ It goes and goes ♪<eos> ♪ Two times 300 ♪<eos> ♪ And thousands of promos for ♪<eos> ♪ Shows that were bad ♪<eos> ♪ Yes, they were bad ♪
So saith the dirty-laundry man.<eos> That is why you're here, isn't it?<eos> To destroy a dead man's good name while his wife sits in the other room chewing Valium?<eos> I'm here to protect the firm.<eos> You say potato.<eos> I didn't destroy your life.<eos> When you sent those texts to Woody Hammond, you sent them to his company-owned cell phone.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> They were quite explicit... sexually.
God...<eos> I wish I was that young again.<eos> Tell me what you dreamed.<eos> No.<eos> Come on.<eos> We all dream.<eos> There's a stain on your ceiling shaped like a rabbit.<eos> Don't change the subject.<eos> I like rabbits.<eos> They're very attuned.
- What happened to Andy?<eos> The stroke rumor?<eos> Yeah, no, he's fine.<eos> Then where is he?<eos> He moved on. He quit.<eos> Tess, I promise you.<eos> Andy did not stroke out.<eos> I know this is scary, but together we can find your son.<eos> The problem with your phones?<eos> They're too perfect.
Okay, man, go ahead.<eos> Trying a new pitcher.<eos> You okay?<eos> We did it, Pop!<eos> We ain't done nothin' yet.<eos> Peaches?<eos> Nectarines.<eos> You're never gonna have the arm to get you to the majors.<eos> You'll never get further than I did, - minors at best.<eos> - But... A girl will never be able to throw hard enough to compete with boys, not as they start growing.
You know, like, maybe we came from the Earth or the Erf, or whatever you call it.<eos> You know, maybe you came from... Maybe we came from someplace else.<eos> But the thing is, we understand that we had to come from someplace, you know.<eos> You know, and no matter where were are on this planet, I mean, you know, we gotta be somewhere, and...<eos> And if you're gonna be somewhere, be a point of consciousness that really is understanding where it is located, even though you have access to a cybernetic portal that gets you involved into various experiences which are happening simultaneous all over the planet.<eos> Now, whether you believe in parallel dimensions, alternate realities, or "spirit gods,"<eos> like, it's... all the same shit, you know, and people are like, "I saw a ghost."<eos> And you're like, "Okay."<eos> You know, to me, ghosts are just temporal anomalies, you know?<eos> They're just residue of past occurrences or future occurrences happening simultaneously, that bleed through and kind of bend into the membrane of our current reality.
Lots.<eos> Lot of crops.<eos> Lot of crops, lot of industry.<eos> So much shit going down in the South.<eos> It's crazy. It's like...<eos> Sometimes there be people, they'll be like:<eos> "What's wrong with you?"<eos> I'm like, "I don't know.<eos> What's wrong with you?"<eos> And they be like, "All right.
She crazy. She crazy.<eos> How many of y'all own a gun?<eos> Oh, I saw that.<eos> You see that? You see that motherfucker?<eos> He was so quick, too.<eos> It was so quick. Realized, like, he was like, "Ah..."<eos> You're on camera.<eos> Guns are like...<eos> It's crazy, you know what I'm saying, 'cause guns are like guns.<eos> Like... Like the more you use them, the more they get used.
Grover: Gentlemen.<eos> You're gonna want to see this.<eos> So, while processing the place, CSU found a burner phone.<eos> We had Eric just go through it.<eos> Turns out, Agent Raine was texting with somebody about a half an hour before we showed up.<eos> "He's here."<eos> And this popped up a few seconds after.<eos> "Don't let him leave."<eos> Raine slept with Frontera to keep him there.<eos> Steve: All right, whoever those guys were, casing that house, they weren't there to extract Frontera, they were there to kill him, right?
Thank you for your time, Mrs. Valera.<eos> Where's McGarrett?<eos> M.E.'s office, why?<eos> Agent Halanu just called.<eos> According to their sources, the cartel instructed Frontera to be down at Victor Wharf in Pearl City 30 minutes from now.<eos> All right. He doesn't even know he's being set up.<eos> All right.<eos> What do we got?<eos> Frontera's people told him to wait inside this building.<eos> They should be arriving any minute.
- We'll figure it out.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> Calm down.<eos> Okay?<eos> You want some coffee?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Trees.<eos> Why?<eos> Because they're not real.
The "Raza" has indeed been surrounded and come under an offensive.<eos> The ship is reportedly adrift, its engines and weapons disabled.<eos> However, according to officials, the crew is refusing to surrender, which may leave Mikkei little choice but to destroy the ship, killing everyone on board.<eos> Why would I dream this?<eos> Maybe you feel guilty... because you're taking time for yourself instead of serving the crew.<eos> No.<eos> No, it's more than that.<eos> My friends are in danger.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Are you absolutely certain that they're your friends?
We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.<eos> The heavens beckoned a new generation of innovators and explorers, seeking to take human kind even further.<eos> We can push out into the solar system.<eos> Not just to visit but to stay.<eos> That was when Mars became real for all of us.<eos> And for those of us who were around to see the first days, it was... electrifying.<eos> The world's leading space agencies united as the International Mars Science Foundation.<eos> And joined with private industry to accomplish one shared goal.<eos> To build a home for humankind on Mars.<eos> People weren't just talking about the red planet, they were making plans to go there.
Oh my god, Ben, Ben!<eos> Ben, Ben!<eos> He's the type of guy that you'll really never know until you're close to him,<eos> he has a sense of humor.<eos> You know, going a day without him cracking a joke it's kind of like you haven't said something that made me laugh today what's up?<eos> I think some people are genetically programmed to want to go somewhere to leave their home and explore.<eos> You know you have to be very comfortable, losing that connection to those you've left behind.<eos> The type of person that you select to go to Mars has to have a family that understands the risk.<eos> My wife stayed home, hoping that I would not fall into some tragedy that I couldn't get out of, you have to have mental attitude of being prepared that something is going to happen.<eos> When I think about space explorers I think of their willingness to be so heart wrenchingly torn from the earth and everyone they love and everyone they know,
Blood was obliterating the lung and pleural space in the left, diminishing lung capacity and preventing him from properly oxygenating.<eos> After evacuation of a large volume of blood and clot, his spleen was noted to be extensively damaged.<eos> I was able to safely remove it but his vital signs remain unstable and he's still in guarded condition.<eos> He lost so much blood, joon, it's impossible to say now if he lives, or...<eos> The only thing is to wait...<eos> I think sending humans to space is our latest expression of the ancient human practice called human sacrifice,<eos> but really in the service of something much greater.<eos> The early astronauts were risk-takers.<eos> They were brave people.<eos> They had been test pilots and flown in the early age of the jet engines, and more than a few of them died.
But before we even entered Mars's atmosphere it was like she was trying to push us away.<eos> Retro rockets about to fire.<eos> And once we landed, she pushed even harder.<eos> What is Ben's status?<eos> How far did we overshoot?<eos> 75.3 kilometers.<eos> Come on, let's fix this.<eos> It's our guys up there.<eos> The workshop module.<eos> What if they can make it there?

Mars.<eos> Photographs reveal a cratered landscape, much like the moon and apparently hostile to life.<eos> It's actually the lack of resources that we have to worry about on Mars.<eos> We still have to figure out how to create them there.<eos> When we get to Mars we need to solve our basic needs and the basic needs are going to be food, water, shelter and a particular protection from radiation.<eos> The longer you spend on the surface, the more dangerous it is so you have to get underground and get away from radiation.<eos> There are a number of strategies that can be employed.<eos> One of them could be the lava tube.<eos> Rising from the flame, giant volcanoes.<eos> Volcanoes have existed on Mars for hundreds of millions of years, and as they died away, the tubes that carry the lava solidify and become huge long rooms.
We can inflate a habitat within a lava tube, but you have to be near them so knowing where we are on<eos> Mars and what the features are that we can use are extremely important.<eos> You'll have to be looking for water also.<eos> Now Mars has some trapped water resources.<eos> Everything we've learned about life as we know it requires liquid water.<eos> Full stop.<eos> So that's why the mantra for Mars exploration has been thus far follow the water.<eos> There's the possibility that there could be ice within lava tubes and we're looking to see, you know, what the feasibility of that is.<eos> We're still in the process of figuring out where those lava tubes are and mapping them is not a trivial thing.<eos> They're not so easy to find because they're underground.
They're not so easy to find because they're underground.<eos> So there's no shortage of hard, technical challenges that need to be addressed before we can have a sustained human presence on Mars.<eos> It's really important that we figure out how to get some of the basics.<eos> We'll use a set of drones to find a lava tube with the conditions we need to deploy a small domed habitat.<eos> And that little foothold will become humankind's first real home beyond the gravity well.<eos> Olympus town.<eos> Charged and ready.<eos> Unmanned aerial vehicles.<eos> We watched as our drones took off into the alien sky,<eos> knowing they were the only hope of finding the shelter and the resources we'd need to deploy the dome and complete our mission.
But if we couldn't find enough ice to supply settlement, we'd be stranded<eos> and the Mars mission would end.<eos> There's much to learn about Mars.<eos> I mean, we're still as of this week finding things out.<eos> We've sent orbiters, we've sent rovers, we've sent things there to explore it to get to know more about it.<eos> We have the interest and are on the edge of the robotic technology that would allow us to get there and do that work.<eos> So we're in the process of right now what we call precursor missions, robotic missions that go before the humans go so we can characterize what the resource is, where we would send humans.<eos> Something that people might find a bit surprising is that with modern orbiters, we've covered only about 3% of the surface.<eos> We just don't have the data volume coming back from Mars to get anywhere close to mapping the whole surface.<eos> If we want to have humans landing on the surface of Mars, we want to make sure that the place where they're going is safe, and you can't do that with 100 meter-per pixel resolution images.
We've got an international hero dead and five more stuck in a utility shack meant for two trying to find a needle in a haystack before their systems fail.<eos> We don't like the optics on this, Ed.<eos> Ophelia was doing just fine in the satellite business before we bought into your MMC initiative.<eos> If the most qualified astronauts on the planet can't make it work, how do you expect to make money selling tickets to people following in their footsteps?<eos> IMSF is already watching every move we make, waiting for an excuse to end this whole thing.<eos> We need to cut bait before they leave us holding the bag.<eos> Are you done?<eos> I made billions of dollars in private enterprise and then I did it again and again.<eos> Every small town car dealer knows about profits, bottom lines, and cutting losses.<eos> And they all know about fear.

what do you think your biggest challenge will be on this mission?<eos> Well, the biggest challenge would be finding those lava tubes, but the unknown to me is a bigger challenge than that.<eos> It's a vicious planet.<eos> The fire left them with less than a week of oxygen.<eos> IMSF sent me to make a decision. Is Vega now a rescue mission?<eos> Because if the crew no longer has the means to find a location in the lava tubes, they're going to have to deploy the dome on the surface.<eos> They're working on sealing off the lab now, but we're still waiting to hear about structural damage.<eos> What about the drones?<eos> Damage to the remote system was catastrophic.<eos> No way they fly again without additional supplies from Earth.
We're running out of options.<eos> Hana?<eos> We will find it.<eos> Aye-aye, Captain.<eos> Your faith is admirable, but unfounded, Mr. Grann.<eos> IMSF sent me here to determine whether or not you can stop this thing from becoming a global embarrassment, but what I can tell so far, that seems to be an inevitability.<eos> Ground penetrating radar isn't going to find us a site that isn't there,<eos> without the drones there's no way.<eos> My people have done the impossible.<eos> They can do it again.

those visions collided.<eos> Members of the committee, madames and monsieurs, madame secretary.<eos> With incredible success of the Olympus Town Settlement over the last four years, we at MMC feel that we're ready to go faster.<eos> With our new freighters almost ready for flight, we'll be prepared to start sending fifty people at a time beginning first quarter of 2041, almost a full two years ahead of our earlier projected schedule.<eos> We are really behind the schedule guys.<eos> Olympus Town power will be temporarily suspended in the greenhouse as construction crews are upgrading the lines.<eos> If you want something done on Mars, you gotta do it your damn self.<eos> The best scientists in the world...<eos> in the universe...<eos> But as you know, we need the infrastructure to support those settlers when they arrive, and that begins with power.
Big step Paul.<eos> Luckily for us, Dr. Richardson's decided to bring her husband along.<eos> Okay, I'm okay.<eos> Nobel prize-winning exobotanist, Paul Richardson, will be personally overseeing a parallel agriculture expansion, focused on his own hybrid plant technology that plans to eliminate Mars' reliance on Earth for food by 2048.<eos> Ladies, gentlemen, our dream is now a reality.<eos> No live matter.<eos> Successful transfer of Cygnus crew.<eos> Just want to check your eyes.<eos> Look me in the eye.<eos> - There they are!
What will life be like in an early Mars colony?<eos> Let's take some stages in terms of how we might do things on Mars.<eos> There is exploration, somebody going out and coming back.<eos> The next stage would be some sort of research station.<eos> You would mostly resupply it from Earth.<eos> You cycle people in and out on a regular basis.<eos> I would contend that that would look a lot like Antarctica.<eos> You don't have to fly into space obviously to go to Antarctica, but it's not easy to get to, and it's not easy to sustain life there.<eos> At the very bottom of the world there's a cheerless land where the long night is 125 degrees below zero, and murderous winds howl at 200 miles an hour across a desert as desolate as the moon.<eos> Before we used to send people to Antarctica, they crossed the Antarctic Continent and came back and waited 3 or 4 years before you sent the next expedition.
How long until they're completed?<eos> It's hard to say, we're currently using all the power we produce, which is driving our construction schedule.<eos> Well we're prepared to upgrade all of the outdated copper lines to maximize output from the nuclear fission reactor within six weeks.<eos> And how long would you need to take the reactor offline to complete this?<eos> My team's been drilling in the SIM for months.<eos> Once the lines are laid we just need one short power cut for each junction box.<eos> With all due respect, SIM is no substitute for Mars surface.<eos> It took us three months to install the lines, the dunes are constantly shifting due to sand drifts.<eos> We're prepared for that.<eos> I'm sure your people are excellent, I know they are, but no one is a hundred percent while adjusting from micro-G's.
End report.<eos> I'm working please.<eos> Dr. Kamen, do you have a moment?<eos> I don't mean to interrupt your work, but it seems to be never ending so I thought I would just drop by.<eos> Ah, sorry I forget myself.<eos> I'd offer tea but um, I've broken my second cup.<eos> Let me.<eos> It's okay, uh, I need to rebuild muscle after the transfer.<eos> So you can enjoy our tennis courts.<eos> They might not be so far away.
Alright, I'm ready.<eos> 77.79763.<eos> We're here collecting soil samples to take back to Texas to answer is that soil habitable, is there evidence of microbial activity in that soil.<eos> I mean, this is as basic as basic research gets.<eos> What is the limit of the most important thing to us?<eos> I think respect for life and an interest in life is a kind of fundamental human value really.<eos> Look at this sample.<eos> Get those guys right here.<eos> And so exploring the very ends of our planet is worthwhile, it's noble and it also serves society's needs, not just for scientific answers but also for a frontier to work in.<eos> Sometimes people look up into space for that and sometimes they look south to Antarctica and it's the same frontier.
They can cover the entire planet, and they can last for months.<eos> They're visible from space.<eos> Mars just kind of turns into a hazy, red ball, and we can't see surface features anymore with our satellites.<eos> The dust, it's not like sand.<eos> It's like talcum powder.<eos> It's very, very microscopicly small nasty dust particles.<eos> And if they get into your lungs, it's a human safety issue.<eos> So you would want to try to keep it out as much as possible.<eos> There's a lot of dust on Mars.<eos> You know we've learned from our rovers on Mars that they're constantly getting covered in dust.
Create some kind of hab module on earth, test that in advance.<eos> We've been here just over seven months and we've got just under five to go so it's like 140 something days left, um, it's been a long time.<eos> Hi-Seas is a NASA-funded research analog and simulation.<eos> It's located at about 8,000 feet on the slopes of Mauna Loa here on Hawaii so the crews we put there are very isolated.<eos> The goal of Hi-Seas is to be as close as possible to a Mars mission, so that means we put a lot of constraints on the crew.<eos> Groups of people living together is what civilization is, we're very good at it.<eos> Interestingly the biggest problem is when you have a small group of people.<eos> So you'll notice there are only four crew members here, and well here are the other, here are the other two.<eos> You have a small number of people, the, the biggest risk to the mission's success is those people not getting along.<eos> And even if they're very, very professional about it, if they're not getting along and they're not communicating enough, there's going to be problems.
To life and limb.<eos> Some people disintegrate psychologically and behaviorally and you look back at many of the explorations where humans moved where humans moved across thousands of miles you typically will see dysfunction occur in crews.<eos> It happened on shackleton's mission to the south pole.<eos> He puts his men off at elephant island and tries to get to South Georgia island, 800 miles in heavy seas.<eos> But he's got a very dysfunctional carpenter, psychologically sick, so he has to take him along cause he can't leave him with the crew because it's going to create chaos.<eos> On Mars, just like the nineteenth century explorers, you might see fragmenting of the crews and you find these dynamics in these historical records and you see how problematic they are for the success of the mission.<eos> Someone wrote this at the end of the fourth century,<eos> St. Augustine.<eos> My memory contains my feelings.<eos> Not in the same way as they are present in the mind when it experiences them, but in a quite different way.
with people with a vision.<eos> I really never had any doubts that it was possible to go to the Moon.<eos> Today I know.<eos> People being able to see with their minds what others had yet to be able to see with their eyes.<eos> There is a direct correlation between the dreams and the works of science fiction and the reality.<eos> We as humans over and over again create the future, we create the future we envision.<eos> And then we bring to bear our resources, our capital, our technology, our friendships, and then we make it real.<eos> What is this building called?<eos> This is the launch tower, so this is where the astronauts would go up,<eos> and then there would be a big arm that would swing over to the spacecraft, and then they'd walk down the gangway, climb in the spacecraft, go to space.
I know.<eos> I didn't expect to.<eos> What about you?<eos> You ever want to have kids?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Your mom told me you were like a mother to Trudy, the way you looked after her.<eos> Ma wasn't always around, so a lot of the time it was just the two of us.<eos> You know, Trudy had the best imagination.<eos> As long as I could turn it into a story or a game, she wasn't afraid of anything.<eos> I used to tell her that if we waved at the Japanese bombers that they would just keep flying and they'd leave us alone.
No thanks.<eos> I don't...<eos> Fair enough.<eos> I'm Hagan.<eos> Reverend.<eos> I saw you at Karen's service.<eos> - I'm not a Reverend anymore. - Right. No.<eos> Now you're... a what? A fighter.<eos> How does that sit with God?<eos> The problem with promising people their reward in heaven is they're liable to sit on their asses here on Earth, eating shit and hoping they'll sprout wings real soon.
But I can probably get them down to five.<eos> Five more years for a crime he didn't commit doesn't seem really fair.<eos> And losing a retrial and dying in prison doesn't seem fair either.<eos> - But we're not gonna lose.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> There's a good chance we will.<eos> - Jessica--<eos> - Rachel.<eos> Juries are unpredictable.<eos> Even if they'd been told to disregard something, they know he was convicted before.
Lots of sharp edges.<eos> This is so cool.<eos> I feel like a Bond girl.<eos> Your nana okay okay to keep up?<eos> You kidding?<eos> What do you do for power?<eos> Diesel or portable reactor?<eos> Diesel.<eos> But I haven't been able to get it restarted since the nukes.<eos> We also have solar arrays, but they took a hit too.
What can I do to prove myself?<eos> Test me.<eos> All right.<eos> I need brains.<eos> Fresh brains.<eos> For my research.<eos> Well, you may prove useful after all.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> When we last met, I was working for some very powerful people from a place called Zona.<eos> They had a cure on Zona.
I've spilled too much blood.<eos> Seen too many good people die for this mission to turn back now.<eos> Escorpion will change you more than you will change him!<eos> Then so be it.<eos> Something's burning.<eos> Zombies?<eos> Enders.<eos> Car thieves will be hung first, shot later.<eos> No questions asked.<eos> You must admit, They know how to stage an atrocity.
(rhythmic beeping and whooshing)<eos> She's very weak, but most of the mucous has been suctioned from her lungs, she's breathing easier.<eos> So we can remove the tube?<eos> Goal is to have it out later today.<eos> But once her lungs start filling with fluid, I want it back.
Happy now.<eos> (electrical pop, electricity whirs down)<eos> Looks like we lost power.<eos> Ma'am, step through, please.<eos> (electrical squeaking)<eos> (squeaking) Okay.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> The last security layer is within international jurisdiction.<eos> Before you can be admitted to the UN proper, you've got to get past a biometric hand reader.<eos> It maps the individual web signature of your palms.
How are we coming on the ice sculptures?<eos> Tell me you've got good news.<eos> This wedding has to be perfect!<eos> Well, darn it all if they don't keep melting in this sticky jungle heat.<eos> Aw, I really wanted those icy sculptie-wulpties.<eos> Ted!<eos> Dorothy!<eos> Get it together.<eos> This is supposed to be my ultimate dream wedding.<eos> If it falls short of my unrealistic expectations, I'm gonna throw a fit!
Who's trying to hurt me?<eos> Your Majesty, although it pains me to say this--<eos> Not really, but whatever.<eos> --my sister means to harm you.<eos> I can explain all of those.<eos> Clearly, this knife is meant for slashing and slicing... our wedding cake.<eos> [excitedly] Oh! Yeah, it's for the cake at the wedding. I'm totally not having second thoughts about at all.<eos> And this.<eos> You probably think it's poison, am I right?<eos> Mostly because it literally says "poison" on the bottle.
Even better!<eos> I've encased Mort in sand! Mainly so the royal eardrums can get a break from all his annoying Mort-ness.<eos> Hey, Mort, say something annoying like you do.<eos> [Mort mumbling] [giggles] See?<eos> [laughs]<eos> You next, Mo-Mo. Let's see... gonna need a lot more sand.<eos> Look, Maurice!<eos> [gasping and coughing] [inhales] A message?<eos> What's it say?<eos> Yes, Maurice, what does it say?

Frank! Frank!<eos> Ooh, Frank, a bunny.<eos> It's adorable!
Xixi, I need you to spread the word,<eos> Club Moist is coming back bigger than ever, and I want tushies in these seats.<eos> [Xixi groans] -Clover!<eos> -Yes, Your Majesty!<eos> If the Phantom shows up again, I wanna be ready.<eos> Get to work on a trap.<eos> A trap that is so insane, it even freaks you out.<eos> I'm talking full psycho.<eos> Let your freak flag fly!<eos> I have dreamed of a moment like this, but I never thought it would happen.
You know, I purchased this cognac for 100,000 British pounds sterling.<eos> Impressive.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Please, after you.<eos> It's too good not to share, right?<eos> You guys big cognac drinkers?<eos> Not really.<eos> Oh, well...<eos> See, the first time they distill the grapes, it comes out as this basically undrinkable wine.<eos> And it's only about seven or nine percent alcohol.
- A flat head?<eos> - Why?<eos> Well, he's probably spending a little too much time laying flat on his back.<eos> Because babies need to sleep on their backs, we really need to be vigilant about tummy time.<eos> Look, it's largely cosmetic.<eos> But Mateo's condition is pronounced, so there could be some visual disturbances, dental problems...<eos> Which is why some parents choose a helmet.<eos> A helmet?<eos> To reshape the head.<eos> It has to be custom-fitted, so Mateo would wear it 23 hours a day for about three months.
- I can't say that I have.<eos> Oh. Well, you're missing out.<eos> A true delicacy.<eos> A single dish starts over $200.<eos> You know what makes it so special?<eos> Poison.<eos> Worse than cyanide.<eos> And the most poisonous part... the ovaries.<eos> Got to love that.<eos> But people train for years to be trusted to serve this dish because one slip, and it will kill anybody who, uh, who eats it.
It'll get you.<eos> Well, weddings make even the sane a little nutty.<eos> Don't be too hard on them.<eos> Those two are never gonna make it.<eos> Why?<eos> Because he's already trying to be someone different for her, and that's a recipe for disaster.<eos> He's not trying to be different.<eos> He's trying to be his best self.<eos> Love inspires you.<eos> Hmm. Or it puts you in tights and gives you a hernia.
But you said it, the baby is a priority.<eos> Fast as you can, guys. We need to hurry.<eos> Laura's sticking with Reynaldo and the victim to maintain chain of custody, with whatever physical evidence they find on the body.<eos> Smart.<eos> This one's a first for me.<eos> It must have been quite the commotion out there this morning.<eos> Yeah, it's a understatement of the week.<eos> And we have no idea who this woman is?<eos> Techs confirmed that her prints are not in the system.<eos> We're waiting on the DNA, and patrols checking the gutters in the area for her bag, in case it dropped out of the van.
Well, I'd befriend SpongeBob but he's not real, so I can't do that, can I?<eos> But you can pal around with a hagfish?<eos> Hey, let's not pull at that thread.<eos> Okay. I'll fight SpongeBob, because he's so friendly we'll just end up tickling each other.<eos> Um, I'll befriend the seal, because he's trainable, which is the problem I'm having with my current friends.<eos> Which means I'll have to eat the hagfish.<eos> Isn't that gross?<eos> I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.<eos> I know.<eos> It makes its own gravy-- it'll slide right down.
Yeah?<eos> Live long and suck it!<eos> Birthday girl.<eos> Birthday girl.<eos> Birthday girl.<eos> Come in!<eos> Hi, Sheldon.<eos> Hello.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.
Is that all right?<eos> I'm sorry, but this is a litigious society.<eos> I'm gonna need verbal consent.<eos> Yes.<eos> You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.<eos> So, if you don't like Star Wars, why are you here?<eos> Oh, I'm just having fun.<eos> Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously.<eos> Like if the movie's bad, it's gonna ruin their lives.<eos> Is it bad?
Yes.<eos> You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.<eos> So, if you don't like Star Wars, why are you here?<eos> Oh, I'm just having fun.<eos> Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously.<eos> Like if the movie's bad, it's gonna ruin their lives.<eos> Is it bad?<eos> Did you hear something?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's bad.
Guys, wait up.<eos> You want to go grab a burger and a beer next door?<eos> - Well, I --<eos> - I definitely do.<eos> That movie brought up so much for me.<eos> Plus, I got to take my pill with food.<eos> - Yeah, I'm not so sure --<eos> - You're coming.<eos> - Maybe if you're there, he won't try and do his adorable British character for the hostess.<eos> Will you put this in my veggie burger and not tell me where it is?

- REBECCA:<eos> Your dad used to be an attorney, right?<eos> - BRIAN:<eos> Yeah.<eos> If you want to talk to him, why don't you hire him?<eos> You made a deal with us, but you're still entitled to an attorney.<eos> Did you think Dad was acting strange last night?<eos> I... think he's a little suspicious about how you got here.<eos> Dad?<eos> It is dangerous if I tell you the truth.
Packing shelves. $12 an hour.<eos> Mm.<eos> At least Kristen's... pulling extra shifts at the hospital.<eos> Only way we can afford this palace.<eos> You're gonna find your thing.<eos> Seriously.<eos> __<eos> (faint whirring)<eos> (chuckles softly)<eos> So you just think and it moves?
I tried to-to power the thing down...<eos> Nothing worked.<eos> So you're saying that you're innocent but your arm... your arm is guilty?<eos> Yes.<eos> I know how it sounds...<eos> Believe me...<eos> But it's what happened.<eos> I did not kill Kristen.<eos> I would never kill her.<eos> It was my... arm.
So if you could hack that arm, so could anyone else.<eos> I wouldn't say anyone else.<eos> But yes, it is at least possible that Aaron didn't kill his wife.<eos> Here's to hunting hackers.<eos> I think you guys should take a look at something.<eos> Earlier this morning, a U.S. Postal Service van swerved violently across several lanes of traffic, causing serious injuries and closing all southbound lanes.<eos> The driver of the van, who escaped with minor injuries, is making bizarre claims about what caused the 20-car pileup.<eos> I know what it sounds like, but I'm telling you, it wasn't me.<eos> The arm just... grabbed the wheel and took over.<eos> It was so sudden, I couldn't stop it.
I'm not avoiding you, Dad.<eos> (chuckles):<eos> I'm avoiding this conversation.<eos> Well, isn't that the same thing?<eos> No. No.<eos> Dad... (groans): Oh... Okay.<eos> This drug...<eos> And this is gonna be hard for you to get your head around...<eos> But... this drug, I think it's making me a better person.<eos> I mean, it's a work in progress.
But you yourself admit the software will learn.<eos> So there must be something to be learned.<eos> There's always something to be learned.<eos> Because every situation on the road is unique?<eos> - Yes. - Actually, Mr. Ephraham, don't you mean that there might be slight variations in a road encounter,<eos> - and that's all?<eos> - Yes, that's right.<eos> Thanks, Cary, for that correction.<eos> And why is it important for the software to learn?<eos> So it knows how to deal with all possible street encounters.

If the software learns, then it must not know what it needs to learn, right?
Are we in danger from A.I.?<eos> I think it's getting smarter.<eos> Every day.<eos> Learning our boundaries and its boundaries... it's evolving.<eos> I think there will be an adjustment period after it takes over,<eos> - but eventually...<eos> - Wait, I'm sorry to interrupt.<eos> Um, what do you mean by "takes over"?<eos> The singularity.<eos> When the system is capable of recursive self-improvement, when it is better at recalibrating, expanding and spawning than we are, the brief blip of humanity's reign will reach its inevitable conclusion.
But it's just, um, it's Jack's horse.<eos> And he really loves that animal. So...<eos> I just want to make sure that I give him the right advice if-<eos> You know...<eos> And you will.<eos> I heard the temperature's going way down tonight.<eos> - Did you hear that?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Are you guys going to be warm enough in your trailer?<eos> Oh, yeah. As long as the heater doesn't break down again, like it did last week, we'll be fine.
The electrical system for the elevator grid has shut down.<eos> Walter, I thought you said you had this was control.<eos> Our programmable logic controllers are under attack.<eos> It's behaving like Stuxnet.<eos> It was a cyber-attack on Iranian nuclear capabilities.<eos> Oh, no, it's introduced an infected rootkit onto the PLC, it's modifying the codes, it's giving unexpected commands.<eos> I got none of that.<eos> Building's been infected by a worm.<eos> It's spreading swiftly.<eos> It's targeting the individual systems.
It seals to contain the fire.<eos> The one damned fire protocol that's working.<eos> That's nice. Now get me out of here!<eos> Get back!<eos> This isn't working!<eos> What's the plan?<eos> We can't just sit here and watch him cook.<eos> Come on, what's that look?<eos> Okay, so the server room is protected by a hypoxic air technology system.<eos> It sucks the oxygen out of the room to kill the fire.
What's happening?<eos> Looks like the worm is reinfecting the system.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> ! No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Should not be happening.<eos> Sylvester, are you out of the game room?<eos> The doors are still locked, and there's smoke again.<eos> Why is this happening, Walter?<eos> After the reboot, somehow the worm reinstalled.<eos> But originally it came from your computer.
The sensors are on the edge of the panel.<eos> Once they get hit by the light, they should extend.<eos> You can use them like a staircase to get down to us.<eos> You got it?<eos> But step quick.<eos> I can only extend one at a time.<eos> Ah, come on.<eos> This might be a sign that this plan is highly dangerous and frankly, a little rash!<eos> Oh, that panel looks very flimsy.<eos> I'm gonna run the calculation on the chances it can even hold me.
- Nothing happened.<eos> Okay. But he said he was going to tell his mother something did.<eos> - I can't have that.<eos> - So?<eos> So I snapped his neck.<eos> - So you did do it. - Yeah.<eos> And I put him under the concrete slab.<eos> Were you present when the defendant made that statement?<eos> Yes.<eos> It was voluntary, and he had been informed of his rights.
Father's in Center Stage.<eos> Jesse: Vitals are stable.<eos> 10 of morphine, please.<eos> [ Frank gasps ] Wow.<eos> The knife barely missed his heart.<eos> Miracle he made it here without perforating the pericardium.<eos> We have them to thank for that.<eos> Nobody here wants to leave until they see this family survive.<eos> Let's stabilize the knife and transport upstairs.<eos> We don't need it nicking a vessel en route.
Stop it right now.<eos> Your mom's right, son.<eos> You're a hero.<eos> I think it's a good time for a break, don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll come back.<eos> You're younger than I expected.<eos> Vitamin "C" cream and exercise.<eos> I tried exercise once.<eos> It didn't take.
Suction.<eos> - [ Beep ]<eos> - Hey.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> He's well-trained.<eos> Doesn't waste a step.<eos> I meant the patient.<eos> Of course. [ Chuckles ]<eos> That knife tore him up pretty good.<eos> Sounds like it hit the spleen, a lung, and the top of the liver.
No. Why?<eos> Is there anyone you can call to join you here?<eos> Any other family?<eos> It's just me and my dad.<eos> I'm the one who gives him his medications.<eos> I bathe him, feed him, dress him.<eos> How old are you?<eos> 17?<eos> 18.<eos> Jeremy, this is hard, but the cancer has weakened your father's heart to the point where it could arrest at any time.
- Diffuse crackles throughout. - Okay.<eos> Okay, would you help her?<eos> Please fix this!<eos> I'm gonna raise the bed so you can breathe a little easier, okay?<eos> I need a BIPAP and an ultrasound.<eos> - Page Respiratory, stat.<eos> - Okay, wait a minute.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Her heart isn't pushing her blood forward effectively.<eos> It's backing up into her lungs, which is affecting her breathing.
I need thoracic, or I.R. or...<eos> Oh, he's starting to vomit.<eos> The tube could come out.<eos> Do something!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - Should I page Dr. Rorish? - No!<eos> Hudson, we need a surgeon.<eos> - How's my heart rate?<eos> - 210.<eos> It's fast, but it's not irregularly irregular.
- To a rave.<eos> - And ended up?<eos> - In jail.<eos> Right.<eos> This time, we do it my way.<eos> Hey, I did my time!<eos> Society forgave me.<eos> Why can't you?<eos> Thug life, yo!<eos> People, I'm gonna say a number, and I want you to tell me what you think it represents.
His name is Dave Park, which brings his friend total to one, as well.<eos> A tattoo?<eos> Are you kidding me? !<eos> That's a gateway rebellion.<eos> I mean, soon, she'll have face piercings, those things that stretch out your earlobes, ties to the underworld.<eos> What underworld?<eos> Oh, like she's gonna tell us.<eos> Why would she choose a tattoo of a japanese character?<eos> Wait.<eos> Is your issue the tattoo or the fact that it's japanese?
Every time I draw, you give me a kiss.<eos> Ready?<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Fast, faster.<eos> Good, thanks. (babbling)<eos> No, I-I'll do it. I'll do it.<eos> One right here, right here.<eos> Aah! Where you going?<eos> (whistles) My whole thing is, in every picture, my stomach is telling a story.<eos> Oh. My stomach just likes to tell the story of how much it likes bread.
I broke up with him.<eos> It's like you don't know that I broke up with him.<eos> Didn't know if you caught that 'cause my back was to you.<eos> Hey, everybody!<eos> Good news!<eos> My baby was delivered today.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Did I black out for nine months again?<eos> The baby didn't come out of my box, Earl.<eos> It came out of this one.
What is this, a hat tasting now?<eos> Well, it's not a cupcake tasting anymore 'cause you ate them all.<eos> You guys are hilarious.<eos> I don't need to taste those.<eos> You and Max are a part of Andy's past, and I would honored if you'd do our cake and come to the wedding as our guests.<eos> Oh, that is a great idea.<eos> Hey, there will be a lot of self-destructive man-children there.<eos> Max, feels like your kind of party.<eos> And it's on this awesome yacht.<eos> You know, technically it's not a yacht unless it's over 40 feet.
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I think.<eos> Are you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wait, you said you weren't okay.<eos> I meant emotionally.<eos> I jumped into a floor hole for feelings?<eos> Well, my feelings are really hurt, Max.<eos> It's been four years.<eos> Well, I don't know what to do, because like the Sad Hatter said, time goes forward; it doesn't go back.
She called and she said Reddington was missing, and she asked me to trace his burner number.<eos> She made me promise not to tell Ressler.<eos> You know where they are, and you're not gonna tell him.<eos> I only know the truth about my brother because of Reddington.<eos> I owe him for that this once.<eos> Why use Agent Ressler's laptop?<eos> When Liz called, I wasn't thinking.<eos> His laptop-- he must have left it at my work station.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was just there.
What's that for?<eos> I'm gonna amputate your leg.<eos> What do you think it's for?<eos> I'm taking the chip out.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> We can't stay down here.<eos> If we go up there, they will find us, and they will kill us.<eos> So I'm taking it out.<eos> Do we have a signal yet?<eos> It's weak, but they're ahead of us.
[ Cellphone thuds lightly ]<eos> [ Grunts ]<eos> Aah!<eos> [ Groans ]<eos> Where's my friend?<eos> !<eos> Jasper Skeehan took a break for lunch and hasn't returned.<eos> Incident report just came in on a walk-in at the ER<eos> With a GSW to the abdomen.<eos> Says it was a hunting accident, but doctors pulled out a .380 slug.
Just get us something, anything we can use to ID her.<eos> M.E. was able to pull a couple usable prints off our victim's hand.<eos> ID came back as Victoria Wasson, 26.<eos> She was in the system for simple possession.<eos> She used to be a dancer at the strip club Deluxe.<eos> It's up on Kingsbury.<eos> Raided it a few times when I was in VICE.<eos> It's an Outfit joint, totally protected.<eos> So, Victoria saw something she wasn't supposed to, and the Outfit killed her for it.<eos> Give the way the body was drilled full of holes so it would sink, that's a strong possibility.
That's for you.<eos> I failed.<eos> All right? I can't...<eos> I can't do it. I'm leaving.<eos> Help!<eos> Somebody!<eos> I need... help!<eos> The baby's coming.<eos> All right, all right, let's get you to a hospital.<eos> No, no! It's coming right now!
It's a little experiment in weird science.<eos> Observe as I take this half dollar and place it in my hand.<eos> I'm about to cause a little-known anomaly to the laws of physics.<eos> If I hold this flame at the right distance from the coin, it will completely, somehow, dematerialize.<eos> Now that you're done, we can return to our work.<eos> Wouldn't you like to know how this magic trick was accomplished?<eos> You never placed the coin in your left hand.<eos> You simply retained it in your right hand behind the fingers.<eos> The lighter had nothing to do with the trick.<eos> It merely served as a misdirect so you could dispose of the coin in your pocket, which is where it is now, correct?
I found something odd.<eos> Dr. Brennan found this glucometer at Vivian's house, so I double-checked, and Vivian wasn't a diabetic.<eos> So I took a look at this thing, and it's been modified somehow.<eos> I'm trying to figure out what it is.<eos> What if this is a dual access system?<eos> Passphrase plus biometric encryption.<eos> Oh, that is genius.<eos> You're saying the messages from The American could only be decoded when Vivian typed in a passphrase and plugged in a verification code?<eos> Drawn from her blood.<eos> It's reading her genetic markers.
Cop bar called Morty's.<eos> He was last seen leaving there about 1:30 in the morning.<eos> So you've been looking into this already.<eos> Well, when Gallo went missing, I started to have my suspicions, but without a body, I couldn't get very far.<eos> Well, do me a favor, next time you have your suspicions make sure you run 'em by me.<eos> I'm head of this case now.<eos> Julian Molina.<eos> Says here you're the right hand to the leader of La Serpiente.<eos> If that's what your little piece of paper tells you, it must be true.<eos> It also tells me, within the past month, you received two parking violations and a citation for littering.
Not feeling it, okay.<eos> Rosé?<eos> Mom, I'm not picking out my fabric color based on your favorite wine.<eos> Brandy.<eos> Is there a color that's not alcohol?<eos> I know you hate that fabric up in the sunroom.<eos> I don't want you to make the same mistake.<eos> Actually, I love the fabric in the sunroom.<eos> You're the one who hates the fabric in the sunroom.<eos> Well, it's so drab.
Buzz, wrong answer.<eos> Would you like to try Other Terrible Theories for 1,000?<eos> If you didn't kill Boyle, who did?<eos> Give me a name.<eos> (sighs)<eos> Kopi Luwak.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Never heard of him.<eos> It's Indonesian.<eos> There's this monkey over there-- maybe it's a squirrel or a rabbit-- it's not important.

At least you'll probably know a couple people there.<eos> I messed up again, didn't I?<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I'll go talk to her, honey.<eos> Okay?<eos> Don't go talk to her, you're not gonna talk to her.<eos> Just stop for two seconds. We need to finish this conversation, because what happened to me-- that is what drives me.<eos> That's what makes me get up every single day and do what I do and make sure the bad guys don't win.<eos> And if I have one regret, it's that I didn't do it sooner.
Look, I know what I have is good.<eos> Like, I snagged your super, super hot sister.<eos> We can stop right there. But heath just won't leave me alone.<eos> Like, we're chasing a serial killer here, and he keeps texting me about getting a cup of coffee.<eos> W-w-w-where are you going?<eos> Rosie, you sure about this?<eos> Yep. Your search found two missing persons...<eos> Jennifer Lee and Roger Jones.<eos> Turns out Roger had a defibrillator implanted two months ago.<eos> The latest model alerts a nearby hospital any time it delivers a shock to prevent sudden cardiac arrest.
- You want me to keep an eye out?<eos> - No, I'm cool.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> - Yo, um... apologies for, you know, getting up in your face like that.<eos> It wasn't right.<eos> - Forgiven.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> - A guy in my crew clocked me coming out of the firehouse.<eos> He seen me.<eos> - Did you tell him it wasn't you?
It's completely air-gapped.<eos> Never even touches the web.<eos> Even segmented from the rest of the NYPD internal network, not to mention all the files are encrypted.<eos> Now, unless he was invisible or psychic, nobody could get in there.<eos> Someone did get in which is why we need full transparency, access to your man from U.N.C.L.E. computer.<eos> I can't authorize that without clearance.<eos> Find the flagpole with your superiors on it and start climbing.<eos> Sir.<eos> This system might be too isolated.<eos> It's missing critical security patches and updates.
Previously on iZombie.<eos> DEVORE:<eos> This is FBI agent Dale Bozzio.<eos> She'll be looking into a string of missing person cases.<eos> LIV: Seems someone istargetingrichguys inSeattle.<eos> Suzuki's widow gave you a brain?<eos> I can't ask our lab to test it without saying where it's from.

PEYTON:
"PrestoFest, come for the illusions and stay for the sleight of ha..."<eos> Looks like we're going to be interviewing a whole lot of magicians.<eos> Sometimes I really hate this job.<eos> RAVI:<eos> Syd Wicked.<eos> I want to change my name to something cool like that.<eos> What do you think of Rick Bang?<eos> I think Rick Bang lives in a one-bedroom apartment in the San Fernando Valley and gets paid to do it on camera. Ow.<eos> Well, Steph told me how to figure out my porn name.<eos> Sadly, it's Polly Cripplegate.
(DRUM ROLL)<eos> (AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING)<eos> (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)<eos> Don'tforget totipyourservers.<eos> Jimmy,whatdo we do withthisrabbit?<eos> Now would be a good time for you to explain how that trick worked.<eos> Seattle P.D.<eos> We'd like to ask you some questions about Syd Wicked.<eos> He's not dead.<eos> I bet it's a stunt.
I'm gonna head upstairs.<eos> This Hare Krishna handed me a pamphlet about karma.<eos> Been meaning to check it out, so... (SIGHS)<eos> Cow brains.<eos> Maybe they're right.<eos> Maybe I'm chasing ghosts.<eos> I mean, I actually thought<eos> Suzuki had a human brain in his freezer.<eos> That's crazy, isn't it?<eos> You seem disappointed it's not human.
- You don't own the thing, but you want me to let you root around inside.<eos> - $3?<eos> - Hey, pal, we're the firefighters who put out that fire.<eos> We have some property that belongs to the driver, and we just want to give it back to him.<eos> - I think I can help you out.<eos> Guy left his wallet in the console.<eos> - Who abandons a camper in such a hurry that they leave behind a wallet?<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I supposed it was empty when you found it.
I fought under that flag.<eos> Just like Dad, just like Grandpa.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, you want to burn it, you don't love this country, get the hell out.<eos> It's not that simple, Danny.<eos> Oh, now we got to hear from the golden boy who never even wore a uniform?<eos> I wear one now, and no one respects what the flag stands for more than I do.<eos> You know what, then I'll tell you what.<eos> Hop on an airplane, go to some godforsaken hellhole, and watch all your buddies get blown away, then talk to us - about what the flag stands for. - Hey.<eos> Let's keep it civilized, okay?<eos> Look, everyone at this table respects your service, but when you defend the flag, you defend all the rights it stands for.
The one you ripped apart?<eos> Yes.<eos> We're putting her on the stand.<eos> - Thank you for coming.<eos> - We-we know you're very busy.<eos> I am, but...<eos> - We understand you're not entirely hap...<eos> - As my father would say, wha gwan.<eos> We'd like to tell you about our firm.<eos> It's not as big as Canning's,
That's good, thank you.<eos> Thought you weren't hungry.<eos> You know, I can order you your own side of bacon.<eos> No, I-I'm good.<eos> It just... it just smelled good.<eos> I'm glad you suggested that we meet here.<eos> How's the knee?<eos> Oh, it's good.<eos> It's good.<eos> It, uh, it swells, I ice it, you know.
I don't know.<eos> It just... Reminds me of something.<eos> Go with that.<eos> You're safe here.<eos> I don't want to be safe here.<eos> I don't want to talk about this.<eos> About what?<eos> Tell me.<eos> It's like the time my mom held me like this when my dog ran away and never came back.<eos> She kept telling me they didn't know how it got out, but I knew.
You got a twin?<eos> Okay, all right, uh, all right.<eos> All right, all right, you got me.<eos> You got me, okay?<eos> Full disclosure-- Katie and I?<eos> We came to Hawai'i to work the tourists, you know?<eos> We wanted to leave Palm Springs, fresh start.<eos> Simplify, change it up a little bit.<eos> So we went with the Badger game.<eos> It's where you target married men.
But isn't that a little extreme for larceny?<eos> Oh, that's funny.<eos> You think I'm kidding.<eos> No, sir.<eos> In fact, I think that happy-go-lucky got beaten into submission by ornery and forceful while you were still in the womb.<eos> (snickering)<eos> Yeah?<eos> Where are we with the trace on the pawn shop, Kono?<eos> All right, I pinged Katie's cell phone.<eos> And it registered at two cell towers this morning.
Okay, take it easy.<eos> I think you just saved our lives, Hank.<eos> I guess you guys are rubbing off on me, huh?<eos> Kaelani's gun was a .22.<eos> Same as the other shooters.<eos> DANNY:<eos> You all right?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> It took a lot of courage to do what you did, Hank.<eos> I mean, if this guy had got a shot off, it would have been one of us they'd be taking pictures of right now.
Where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> I'm not lying to you.<eos> I've never met him face-to-face.<eos> Okay, then how did you meet him?<eos> An associate put us in contact.<eos> Who?<eos> Who?<eos> Uh, it was a guy named Porter, but you're not gonna find him.
Hey, kids.<eos> - Son, big day for you.<eos> - Hey. Stand up.<eos> Oh, God. Sit back down.<eos> Your-your thing's coming out of the thing.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Guess what.<eos> A job opened up at the restaurant.<eos> - That's great.<eos> - And it's all yours.
Drink on the house.<eos> Tequila, two limes, please.<eos> Now, that's how you handle this.<eos> Come on.<eos> Learn from the master.<eos> This is your office?<eos> I would've expected...<eos> Yeah, this.<eos> Welcome to the inner sanctum.<eos> Only a chosen few know that it exists.
It's run by an algorithm.<eos> And math is not racist.<eos> Chumhum is very proud of its diversity and openness.<eos> Diana:<eos> And yet their Safe Filter deters people from patronizing businesses in African-American neighborhoods.<eos> Lucca:<eos> Chumhum is not responsible for the actions of those who respond to its software.<eos> It was Ms. Feldman's choice to open a four-star restaurant in a marginal neighborhood, not ours.<eos> It isn't a marginal neighborhood, It's a black neighborhood.<eos> Well, it's both, which really
- How do you figure?<eos> - It's customer based.<eos> I mean, the auto-complete is based on most used search requests, so, obviously, more people who typed in "Jamal"<eos> were interested in arrest reports than anything else.<eos> So, Chumhum's not racist... its users are?<eos> Well, one could argue that it's racist to override the results.<eos> Okay, we need to deal with the "animal" incident.<eos> I don't like the sound of that.<eos> Chumhum has photo-identifying software.<eos> It sorts your photos into categories.
Oh, I'm Jewish, by the way.<eos> - You're Jewish?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - A British Jew?<eos> - Yes!<eos> That is fabulous.<eos> British Jew.<eos> Tea and matzo, anyone?<eos> You're funny.<eos> Well, since you're British, we must do tea, even if it's iced.
I know, I know.<eos> It was pretty amazing, huh?<eos> Well, I mean, it's no Hope Diamond.<eos> (laughs):<eos> What?<eos> I gave him the friggin'<eos> Hope Diamond to give to her!<eos> That's a $350 million diamond, Carol.<eos> He gives her this stupid piece of medical equipment?<eos> It's so cold and impersonal.
The pain racing through your body after all the adrenaline's gone.<eos> The thing is, you're gonna break way before seven hours.<eos> Because you need me to talk before my team hunts down Jada Khaled?<eos> Because you never been in the military.<eos> Otherwise, you'd have known that the only thing that happens after you've had a paracord tourniquet on your leg for seven hours is amputation.<eos> Week one boot camp.<eos> Which part of your file shall we debunk next?<eos> Talk to me, Eric.<eos> Marshall Groller just took a call from an unknown number.<eos> It's coming from a burn phone and the signal's originating three miles from the ambush site.
I'm punishing my brain.<eos> And what did your brain do to deserve punishment?<eos> It's what it didn't do.<eos> We know that Duncan Brice is an abhorrent human being who'd rather hide evidence of toxic waste than protect his tenants.<eos> And he's almost certainly behind the death of Eddie Ross.<eos> He had an accomplice-- someone who went to kill Eddie while Duncan dealt with the drums.<eos> That's why we went to separate quarters-- to try and figure out who it was, right?<eos> I've been pouring through the man's life for hours now, trying to find someone he would plausibly approach for such a task, and I have nothing to show for it.<eos> How fares your brain?<eos> Actually, it thinks it found something.
It doesn't matter.<eos> Even if it's something small, if you two wake up together on Christmas morning,<eos> I guarantee you she'll have bought you something.<eos> Why?<eos> Women are more thoughtful than men.<eos> It's Christmas, she cares about you.<eos> At the very least, you should have backup plan.<eos> Like what?<eos> The emergency gift.<eos> You don't need it, you don't use it, but it's there if you do.
Oh, baby, are you okay?<eos> Oh, nope. Nope.<eos> Not falling for it.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> Just keep working that money-maker.<eos> Not the fork the face.<eos> Hey, bae.<eos> Guess what I just booked for Hawaii!<eos> A private boat that takes us to swim with the dolphins.<eos> Then it docks on a secluded beach, where the two of us are served a five-star meal at sunset.
Andy...<eos> I've got a very special present for you.<eos> Did this guy tell you he passed his real-estate-license test?<eos> I know.<eos> I helped him cram.<eos> - Ah, she's really drilling me pretty hard.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Listen, when I first got into real estate,<eos> I worked at one of those big firms with the blazers.<eos> I'd rather not say their name, but it rhymed with "century not very fun."
Props to my friend Wesley Snipes for that.<eos> - Get out of here, Tandy.<eos> - Okay. - I'll go.<eos> But I'm not saying good-bye.<eos> Okay, just grab anything and everything, 'cause you never know what Gail might need.<eos> This day is a real stinkerooni.<eos> I don't want to say Phil ruined Christmas, but he might have ruined Christmas, and...<eos> Melissa, you missed the bag.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> What is it? Come here.
Earthquake?<eos> No, that was a pressure crack from concrete at least 15 feet thick.<eos> I know my concrete.<eos> Isn't there a dam about a mile away from here?<eos> (vehicle doors closing)<eos> There.<eos> Mudslide.<eos> WALTER:<eos> It must have poured millions of gallons into that reservoir.<eos> It's well over the capacity line, and there's a crack in the dam face.
There's the motor.<eos> Wait for it.<eos> It's being sucked into the whirlpool.<eos> Here she comes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Happy!<eos> Happy, we got you!<eos> My foot's still attached to the motor!<eos> Help!<eos> It's pulling me down!
My foot's still attached to the motor!<eos> Help!<eos> It's pulling me down!<eos> Come on!<eos> Yeah!<eos> I think...<eos> I got you.<eos> Come on!<eos> I can't get out!<eos> It's pulling my leg.
That depends.<eos> How does $50,000 sound?<eos> For two months' work.<eos> Good morning.<eos> How'd you find us?<eos> Where's the brief?<eos> Don't you want to know why we left?<eos> - No.<eos> I want the brief.<eos> - It's nothing personal.
And him and Mr Scrooge, rowing in the street.<eos> What about?<eos> All I heard was, "Jaggers shall settle it."<eos> It's why Marley was so riled.<eos> And that can't come from me, Inspector.<eos> It just can't.<eos> I understand, miss.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> I forgot my newspaper.<eos> It's under your arm, sir.
Look, look, that's where we're gonna be playing.<eos> Over there, you see?<eos> That's Bellas Artes.<eos> What else?<eos> I'm still working on the seating chart and waiting to hear back from all your cousins on your mother's side.<eos> And also, um, did you look into getting an assistant for while we're down here?<eos> "Hai Lai," I don't... I don't have time.<eos> I mean, it's... this concert means everything, okay?<eos> It has to be perfect.<eos> I know, and I want it to be perfect.
Tell me everything that happened this morning.<eos> Okay, after we checked into the hotel, I asked the concierge where I could buy some presents for my family.<eos> What was his name, this concierge?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> It was Victor.<eos> So he gave me the address, and then when I got to the street, these two guys appeared out of nowhere.<eos> One of them hits me on the head.<eos> The other one grabs my violin case.<eos> Why did you take your violin with you if it's so valuable?
That's not happening.<eos> Get up.<eos> Come on. Get up!<eos> It's so comfortable on the table.<eos> Pillow was so nice...<eos> Just walk it off.<eos> - I'm so tired.<eos> - On your feet.<eos> Please, let me just sleep.<eos> Elizabeth, there's a couch right here; it's not nice.
Not bad.<eos> - Sure? - Yeah, yeah.<eos> All good.<eos> Apart from this bloody wasp!<eos> What's a wasp even doing awake at this time of year?<eos> Strange, isn't it?<eos> Sent here to hound me.<eos> Oh, tell you what...<eos> I went to see the jewel this week.<eos> - It's on temporary display at the British Museum.

- Look at my jumper!<eos> - I... I didn't see it.<eos> - What did you see, Sheila?<eos> - Oh, here he is.<eos> You saw it, didn't you, Lance?<eos> - Saw what?<eos> - The hooded figure in the back of the picture.<eos> No, didn't see anything like that.<eos> - Well, then why did you go deathly white?<eos> - It was looking at you, Lance.
I speak of legacy.<eos> Thank you for untangling your elusive metaphor.<eos> We begin with roots.<eos> May I ask a question?<eos> Do.<eos> If you wish calligraphy on your wall, why not summon a painter who can see?<eos> Can you not read the character I made?<eos> It is a symbol for fire.<eos> Then what is wrong?<eos> - It's upside down.
This might be "God.<eos> Four Class S heroes can take care of the enemy on the ground...<eos> The problem is that. We can't reach it.<eos> Any aircraft would be shot down in seconds.<eos> you're one of the top fighters in Class S.<eos> Give us your take.<eos> Class S rank 7.<eos> Said to be the strongest man on Earth and I see he is well respected by the other heroes...<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> It's too high in the sky. There's no way to attack it.
All right.<eos> Lily, where are you, honey?<eos> Lily.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Can you still hear me?<eos> Look at that fog.<eos> Can't see 10 feet.<eos> Heavy fog conditions...<eos> When it lifts and they start bringing people back here, all hell's gonna break loose downstairs.
Stay with me, Kenny.<eos> We got no choice.<eos> We got to black-tag him.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> ! - Wow, what a hero.<eos> This is the job, okay?<eos> Prioritize based on who we can reasonably save.<eos> We can save him.<eos> No, we can't.<eos> That concrete is cold, wet, and is expanding as it dries.
- What do you mean?<eos> - Well, no one's seen her, she hasn't checked in, she hasn't answered her radio.<eos> - You should go back with Connie.<eos> - All right.<eos> Will do.<eos> I'll go and look for Christa.<eos> Angus, take over.<eos> Okay. Lily, next up, I need you to bite off both ends of the pen.<eos> Like this?<eos> Okay. And the other side, so it's open like a straw.
And that they interrogated him and made him say what they wanted to hear.<eos> I came to pick up Jodi.<eos> - Did you hear me on that talker thing?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> They made a mess, didn't they?<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You know, I wouldn't even know where to look for my purse.<eos> 'Cause it was on the bed.
It finally had a compelling story of a vicious crime.<eos> It had a horror story to tell.<eos> And the media had twice as many court appearances to cover, you know?<eos> Twice as many shots you can do of Averys in jail jumpsuits.<eos> The state got three new charges.<eos> Something to give it a motive, to explain the crime.<eos> Something to up the ante, you know, at trial, because any time the state can add more than one count... particularly if each one of these counts carries an enormous potential prison sentence... the state increases its chances of winning in a very concrete, practical way.<eos> Because the defendant, if he's to win in any meaningful way, has to run the board.<eos> He has to have the jury come back "not guilty" on everything.<eos> For the state to win, it needs to have one charge stick.
We do have a report of a contact with a Michael Osmundson.<eos> "Michael indicated he was aware Steven was one of the last people to see the missing girl and jokingly asked Steven if Steven had her, the missing girl, in a closet.<eos> At this point, Steven asked Michael if Michael wanted to quote 'help bury the body' closed quote. And they laughed about this together."<eos> This conversation clearly is placed on Thursday, November ten.<eos> I now have a different witness to whom this statement has never been attributed, identifying the statement as having been made on November three.<eos> The implication is that this may have been before Teresa Halbach even is reported missing.<eos> What I'm left with is this jury having heard testimony from the first blood relative of Mr. Avery to testify here, his nephew and next-door neighbor, that amounts to a confession of a crime.<eos> There is no way to unwind this from the jury's mind.<eos> It has enormous unfair prejudicial impact.<eos> If there were a remedy short of a mistrial, and I don't know that there is, it would be something like the court instructing the jury that it may disregard as false all of Bobby Dassey's testimony
- Yeah, I assume so.<eos> - OK.<eos> Let's go to the bullet for a minute just to clear up a couple of things.<eos> To the eye, you didn't see any blood visible.<eos> - So you can't really say whether the DNA on that bullet came from blood or some other source, can you?<eos> All I can say was that it was nucleated cells.<eos> Which could mean blood or any other source.<eos> Right.<eos> All right, now your lab's protocol, it recognizes that there may be some contamination in these tests.<eos> Yes. And it tells you that if you go through these tests and the manipulation control is contaminated, that you are to report it as inconclusive for match purposes.
"Well, if the victim had been killed here, perhaps her blood would've soaked into those cracks," right?<eos> I assume so.<eos> Did you find Teresa Halbach's DNA on any of those swabs?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> If somebody had cleaned that garage floor with bleach before the police came, you would not expect to find any DNA, would you?<eos> [Culhane] No, I wouldn't.<eos> [Buting] But in this case, you did find DNA.<eos> You found Mr. Avery's own DNA. That's correct.<eos> [Baetz] She was shot a number of times.<eos> There would be massive pools of blood. It wasn't there.
[Buting] OK. But you didn't hear it hit the floor when it... whenever it got there, right?<eos> Correct.<eos> The floor's carpeted.<eos> Well, can I drop it on the floor here?<eos> [Kratz] What are we doing, Judge?<eos> Is this an experiment in front of the jury?<eos> If it is, then we need to replicate the conditions.<eos> [Buting] That's fine.<eos> We'll hold off on that.<eos> The bookcase hasn't come in so I don't know if they intend to introduce it or not, but it's not here.
- Can you talk to us?<eos> - Where am I gonna walk?<eos> I can't even see.<eos> How are his spirits?<eos> What did you guys talk about in this 20 minute period you were there for?<eos> - Anything you'd like to say?<eos> - Did he say anything about Brendan?<eos> Can you talk to us at all today?<eos> [Buting] When blood is taken for a blood sample or blood tests, it's put in a purple top tube.<eos> It has a preservative to keep it from spoiling, and that's a chemical called EDTA.
- Anything you'd like to say?<eos> - Did he say anything about Brendan?<eos> Can you talk to us at all today?<eos> [Buting] When blood is taken for a blood sample or blood tests, it's put in a purple top tube.<eos> It has a preservative to keep it from spoiling, and that's a chemical called EDTA.<eos> We do not have EDTA in our own bloodstream.<eos> If you find it in a stain, the argument is it must be because the blood was planted.<eos> And so I looked into could we test the stains in the RAV4 to try and make any kind of scientifically valid conclusion about whether or not the blood stain could've come from a tube of preserved blood as opposed to an actively bleeding person.<eos> And there was nobody who did those tests anymore.<eos> But then the State somehow managed to get the FBI to create such a test... and have it ready sometime in the middle of the trial.
Detrimental for my career.<eos> Oh!<eos> Detrimental for your career.<eos> That's not...<eos> Yes, for a lawyer!<eos> How do you argue your cases?<eos> I ask to postpone the trial for... for a week.<eos> Ah... I ask...<eos> And when...<eos> and when it's... Then it's
People are sleeping!<eos> I don't want to stay here one more minute.<eos> As soon as Pinglet gets back...<eos> I can't wait to lie down.<eos> My hat!<eos> Where is my hat?<eos> When you've traveled all day...<eos> Did I throw it here, with Pinglet's things?<eos> I like this hotel.<eos> It has an old-fashioned, authentic quality that I like.
- You think that's easy...<eos> - Don't start with me!<eos> To think they'd pick this hotel when there so many others!<eos> Just my luck!<eos> Instead of complaining, grab your jacket and let's go.<eos> - My jacket?<eos> - There, in the closet.<eos> What did you do with my hat?<eos> I don't know!<eos> It must be here.
"Safely!"<eos> Yes.<eos> I went to see the police chief.<eos> - Did you find him?<eos> - No, he was asleep.<eos> It's no matter.<eos> I'll go back this afternoon and tell him everything.<eos> - I won't be able to look at him.<eos> - You won't have to.<eos> I'll tell him it's involves a lady's honor, and he'll cover it all up.
Chimney sweeps are always taller.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I had no time to measure him.<eos> He attacked me.<eos> Bam! He punched me in the face and kicked me...<eos> Did he kick you in the eye?<eos> No, he punched me!<eos> He kicked me in the...<eos> That hotel got to me.<eos> It did.
So he's got to be more moldable.<eos> Rather than go through a 10-hour process of covering someone in head-to-toe, we took the approach of making it all as large prosthetic appliances.<eos> We're pre-painting everything in my shop. When we went to set, it was just a matter of assembling the puzzle.<eos> The special effects makeup guy, you know monsters.<eos> That's what they live for -- they turn into a monster.<eos> They become their own creation. Did that just happen?<eos> A decade of my life in this office in search of the truth.<eos> And all the time, I was being led by my nose through a dark alley to a dead end, exactly as they planned.<eos> The poster has become so iconic, it's really the heart of the show.<eos> Because it doesn't say, "I believe." It says, "I want to believe."
Sometimes it really helps me to scream and a movement to stay standing or to feel powerful.<eos> [Jerry] Falling, it's pretty minimal impact but it takes a toll mentally for sure.<eos> Falling over and over and over affects your psyche.<eos> [music] [upbeat music] [screams] My sister made that beanie!<eos> I can relate to the mental challenge that the sport does pose.<eos> You know when I'm photographing, I tend to not think about anything... you just do it.<eos> Ultimately it all comes down to can you focus your mind, clear out any distractions and just be in the moment.<eos> [Krystle] I had a friend who actually said to me<eos> "you know you're actually a landscape photographer "but you just happen to throw action figures into your landscapes."<eos> At first I thought it was funny but then I realized it's so true because it's not an adventure sport unless you have an adventure and therefore you have to be in a really cool unique, landscape.
Good catch!<eos> [majestic music] [majestic music] Alright in this particular case, only one got the salmon...<eos> Hey, better luck next time!<eos> [rapid shutter clicking] [Art] Ahhh, that's really nice.<eos> That mother has so much work, keeping those cubs out of harm's way and keeping them fed in the middle of a bunch of boar bears.<eos> [narrator] A male bear intrudes on a sow and her cubs' territory only focused on the scattering salmon.<eos> [mother bear growling] A mother will aggressively defend her cubs, putting herself at great risk in doing so.<eos> [growling] On this occasion the male leaves the confrontation and continues to chase salmon into the shallows.<eos> That was fantastic!<eos> This mother was chasing a big boar who's only interested in catching salmon, it comes out and it smacks him, but the bear is so interested in the salmon that it was on point, it actually got the salmon, as did she.
I'm sitting here just on the edge of the colony.<eos> I've got a super wide lens on and I'm just waiting for the penguins to walk up.<eos> Eventually they get inquisitive enough and we get a great shot with the penguin in the foreground and this incredible landscape in the background.<eos> [Peter] If there is one word I like to emphasise, it's simplicity.<eos> How do we get this photograph to tell a single story, so that we can communicate with our viewer.<eos> And I think if you nail simplicity, then a lot of the other aspects of composition and light, well, they just fall into place automatically.<eos> [Peter] The real challenge when you're presented with an amazing scene like this, is to be able to take something home with you that correctly captures the mood and the experience of really being there.<eos> [uplifting music] [uplifting music] [narrator] Peter's journey to Antarctica and South Georgia, following in footsteps and inspiration of Frank Hurley has been beyond his wildest dreams.<eos> It's now time for him to make the long journey across the Southern Ocean and return home.<eos> [Peter] I realise my voyage is coming to an end, but in many ways it's just the beginning.
I just do.<eos> Well, gentlemen, it appears that our time is up.<eos> Thank you for your attention.<eos> Not you.<eos> Little wog, let me tell you something.<eos> You don't pull a stunt like that in my class.<eos> You don't belong here and you can tell your Master Hardy I said as much!<eos> Now, get out!<eos> My sacred thread.<eos> It's to help ward off evil spirits.
You don't belong here and you can tell your Master Hardy I said as much!<eos> Now, get out!<eos> My sacred thread.<eos> It's to help ward off evil spirits.<eos> How did it work with Mr. Howard?<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> I got too excited.<eos> Not a word often associated with his lectures.<eos> How did you know that theorem?<eos> It came to me.
But I think you'll find the result will be the same.<eos> - Hardy.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Now what have you got yourself involved with?<eos> John.<eos> Good of you to come.<eos> Wouldn't have missed it for the world.<eos> So, now we see the work on partitions and the enormous breakthrough that has been achieved.<eos> All this, mind you, by a man whose limitations of knowledge when I met him were as startling as was its profundity.<eos> Opinions may differ as to the importance of Ramanujan's work and the influence it may or may not have on the mathematics of the future, but one gift it does show is its profound and invincible originality.
I want to hear more about you, Hans.<eos> Are you married?<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> - Well, why not?<eos> You don't mind, do you?<eos> I've been on my own a long time now.<eos> I'm too set in my ways.<eos> I think that marriage is the single thing we should all hope for in life.<eos> Really?<eos> It creates someone else.
She was wise. But even she did not understand the whole of it.<eos> You must accept who you are.<eos> Only then can you unlock the doors to your own potential.<eos> Embrace your father, and you will discover... powers that you never imagined.<eos> Where was this father when 80 good men perished next to me?<eos> Where was he when my mother was murdered?<eos> Your father has always been there, Hercules.<eos> You were just not ready for him.<eos> Zeus can't change the minds of mortals... but he has given you a gift.<eos> And be warned, abuse it and it will lead to your destruction.

Respect it, and it will save you and those you love.<eos> You will accept me... love me.<eos> We will have children... and you will love every one equally!<eos> Won't you?<eos> Equally!<eos> Iphicles. Restore me to my home.<eos> Return me to my father.<eos> The gods do not want this marriage.<eos> I do not want this marriage.<eos> Well, it Will be.
I know the boys helped you with that a lot.<eos> No, not at all!<eos> - That's good.<eos> Look at this. - Okay. There you go.<eos> Pass out the goodies. This is for the girls.<eos> Don't worry, we got you some absinthe.<eos> It's in the... Let's pour.<eos> You take this big elevator up, and when we got to the top, we flew a paper airplane off.<eos> - And what happened?<eos> - It flew!
No, not at all!<eos> - That's good.<eos> Look at this. - Okay. There you go.<eos> Pass out the goodies. This is for the girls.<eos> Don't worry, we got you some absinthe.<eos> It's in the... Let's pour.<eos> You take this big elevator up, and when we got to the top, we flew a paper airplane off.<eos> - And what happened?<eos> - It flew!<eos> It flew away, it went for miles. Went under the Arc de Triomphe, you know.
Yeah!<eos> Mr. Wernick. Those are not your wife's shoulders.<eos> Busted!<eos> Loving it though.<eos> Respect the vision.<eos> - Gotta go for it, right?<eos> That was so relaxing.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I hope I put your pancreas back where it belongs.<eos> I don't even know where it is right now.
Friendly advice for the foreigner in London.<eos> Lesson three. It's dusk, and you pass a stranger in the street.<eos> - Greet them politely.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> To take the conversation further, talk about the weather.<eos> Real brolly-buster, isn't it?<eos> Fact: Londoners have 107 ways to say that it is raining...<eos> - Can I have the last sandwich?<eos> - Oh, no, I need that. A wise bear always keeps a marmalade sandwich in his hat in case of emergency.<eos> ...and it's bucketing down.
We can.<eos> He's not our responsibility.<eos> He's a young bear who needs our help, Henry.<eos> It's just for one night, until we can find the right people to look after him.<eos> There you are.<eos> - OK.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I'm dreadfully sorry, I don't actually know your name.<eos> Well, I've got a bear name, but it seems to be rather hard to pronounce.
It's too dangerous.<eos> He's a Spook.<eos> This a noble profession.<eos> And your last apprentice?<eos> And the one before him?<eos> What happened to them?<eos> And now you come here for my son?<eos> I'm supposed to go with him.<eos> He is a bit scrawny for a seventh son.<eos> I dreaded the thought of this day but I knew it would come.
How can you be here?<eos> I'm not, Tom.<eos> I've passed on from this world.<eos> I stood against Mother Malkin.<eos> And I failed.<eos> But you will not fail.<eos> You are a seventh son, Tom.<eos> But you are also the son of a witch.<eos> There has never been anyone like you.<eos> Only you can wield the Umbran stone and end her reign of darkness before it begins.
Send in a nickel, win the big contest!"<eos> How dare you! Lots of people will like this.<eos> Well, nobody who's walking through the doors of this gallery.<eos> Now, please, clear out the clutter before the taste police arrive.<eos> We'll never break in!<eos> There's a secret society of gallery owners and critics who get together for Sunday brunch in Sausalito deciding what's "cool."<eos> Like McCarthy, in his hearings:<eos> "I anoint that painter.<eos> I banish that painter to Nowheresville."<eos> I think people buy art because it touches them.
UNICEF sponsors the Hall of Education.<eos> We can finally give back to the children of the world.<eos> Hello, everybody.<eos> I'm Lowell Thomas, standing in front of what will soon be one of the wonders of the modern world.<eos> When people ask me, "Why did she stay?<eos> Was it fear? Lack of confidence?"<eos> Margaret was trapped in a lie that she'd helped create.<eos> And now the cover-up was worse than the crime.<eos> Why did you have to promise them Cinerama size?<eos> Because it has to encompass all children, all races.
How could anybody say something so cruel?<eos> What do you care?<eos> It's my name being dragged through the mud!<eos> - Is he here?<eos> - Uh... yes. Which is perhaps why it's best for everybody if you...<eos> Who wrote this shit!<eos> Mr. Keane, this is not the venue.<eos> Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to the editor.<eos> What are you afraid of!<eos> Just because people like my work, that means automatically it's bad?
- That's not the same thing.<eos> - No, it isn't.<eos> Now talk me through your very scary memo, but keep in mind I don't have your Ph.D.<eos> Two weeks ago, I noticed a series of accounts in our Russian partner's records to which our company's computers are denied access.<eos> Massive currency accounts, all in U.S. Treasuries.<eos> Cherevin's made a total commitment to U.S. dollars when there's been a hurricane in the Gulf and a string of negative economic reports.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> It's external sterilised intervention.<eos> Like I'm an idiot, please?<eos> The dollar should be going down, but it's up.
Trust.<eos> Truth.<eos> I think it's like most opinions, best unexpressed.<eos> You talk like Pechorin.<eos> You've read A Hero Of Our Time?<eos> I had a misspent sophomore year.<eos> Really?<eos> That Russian romanticism is so achingly desperate.<eos> Desperate, yes. And insatiable.<eos> It's about not ageing before your time.
If there was ever a believer, it was me.<eos> My last story was about a police horse in Cupertino, California... who died of constipation.<eos> Actually, it's not a joke.<eos> But to begin with a dog and end with a pile of horseshit... there's a kind of poetry in there, somewhere.<eos> But this, this is horseshit.<eos> Me being up here.<eos> Look, I know I pissed off a lot of people over the years.<eos> Many of whom are in this room right now.<eos> But I think that's what good investigative reporting does.<eos> It ruffles feathers.
God knows where, and for what?<eos> Why can't you ever do anything sensible?<eos> I'm doing quite well, thank you.<eos> - Will there be anything else?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> That woman you're slavering over is practically an aborigine, you know.<eos> Raised on a timber camp.<eos> A timber camp?<eos> Yes, I thought you'd like that.<eos> Unfortunately, it burned down and killed her whole family.
And that, my lady, is the truth.<eos> The truth,<eos> (SCOFFS)<eos> Whatever the truth, the death of his loved ones haunts Hercules.<eos> Only the gods can help him, if he listens.<eos> Gather around, soldiers of thrace, and behold, when Hercules gives an order, even the gods listen.<eos> Zeus' master ironsmith, using the forges of yöur own citadel, has crafted these divine weapons that will make yöu invincible.<eos> As steel is hewn into shields, so, too, will yöu be hewn into warriors.<eos> Yöu shall carry the shield of Hercules!<eos> It's lighter.
- I was awake all night, please look,<eos> I was awake all night googling all the thwarted crimes over the past three months, and this symbol appeared at every single one.<eos> Look!<eos> Every single one of them.<eos> This one, look.<eos> Here, here, here, here, here.<eos> And it's an ancient Japanese symbol that means "family."<eos> Wait, it's on my laptop.<eos> I can't believe you brought me into this!<eos> Here, here. It's here.
This was all my fault.<eos> You were right.<eos> We weren't ready.<eos> No.<eos> It was I who wasn't ready to let you go.<eos> All you needed was to discover that your true power lies in believing in one another.<eos> There she is...<eos> - New York's secret weapon.<eos> - How's your arm, Vern?<eos> Well, it wouldn't be much use in a fight.
The results showed a brain aneurysm.<eos> Mr. Altmann... do you know what a brain aneurysm is?<eos> My uncle died of one.<eos> One minute he was brushing his teeth, the next, he was dead.<eos> Didn't even have time to rinse.<eos> It's a ballooning-out of an artery wall in the brain.<eos> - And when it pops? - That would be a hemorrhagic stroke.<eos> And I'm dead.<eos> The seriousness depends on the size and location of the aneurysm.<eos> How big is it?
And have you ever heard the sound of a thousand dying cats?<eos> Come on, Hall.<eos> We're playing together.<eos> I really hate you all.<eos> I've always thought of the cello as a solo instrument.<eos> It's probably why it's always made me so comfortable.<eos> Just me and my cello.<eos> But that night, sitting around the bonfire, jamming with Adam and everyone else, I realized I was wrong.<eos> The cello isn't a solo instrument.<eos> It's part of something bigger.
Yeah.<eos> Right below where our bedroom is.<eos> Anna.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my God, Tom.<eos> 220,000 pounds.<eos> What the hell was Ben doing with this much cash?<eos> What was he doing living in our basement with all this cash?<eos> Well, he was on disability, and maybe he had a big settlement after an accident?<eos> I just don't know why it wouldn't be in the bank.
Anna, please.<eos> I'm a school teacher at Morningside Primary school<eos> My wife runs a clinic just down the street from there.<eos> Sterling House?<eos> That's a, uh, women's shelter, right?<eos> They look after young women with drug addiction, take them off the streets.<eos> The government has withdrawn its funding, but they're hanging in there.<eos> My wife, Marie, isn't one for giving up.<eos> Anyhow... So, thank you for the tea.<eos> It was very good.
I need your help.<eos> Babe, it's me. Can you give me...<eos> Where's my money?<eos> Where's my money?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Me and my brother's money.<eos> Are you an idiot, you fucking cunt?<eos> And he died getting it.<eos> So, you can understand me wanting it back.<eos> Now, where is it?
I don't know.<eos> Please.<eos> Please. Where's the money?<eos> So, that's how you want to play.<eos> It's fine with me.<eos> Please...<eos> Please, stop.<eos> Please.<eos> Where's my money?<eos> Please. Where's is it?
All right, you can have your money.<eos> Just leave us alone.<eos> I want to see you and the money.<eos> When?<eos> Where? It needs to be in public for my safety.<eos> Tomorrow, noon, Victoria Park by the pond.<eos> And then you leave us alone.<eos> What now?<eos> The, um, the tracking device is sewn into the seam.<eos> It's virtually undetectable, and I can track you on my phone.
The secret's out.<eos> He's the good brother.<eos> Very cool of you. Thank you.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Before you get too excited, here's the deal:<eos> When it comes to Phillip screwing up, like he will you and I are partners, 50-50.<eos> - Okay? - That is a deal.<eos> You got it.<eos> Have you guys tried this kugel?<eos> It's terrible.
Yours has simply yet to reveal itself.<eos> These are but some of the scapulars of our fallen brothers and sisters.<eos> We have always been outnumbered in battle.<eos> Now, after many hard-fought victories, our ranks have thinned.<eos> Demons, however, remain strong.<eos> To help you survive against them, the Queen has asked us to provide you with weapons.<eos> Demons can only be descended by sacramentals, blessed objects such as the crucifix or holy water.<eos> Any object can be made sacramental by marking them with the blessed symbol of the Gargoyle Order.<eos> Descended?<eos> When a demon is killed its spirit descends to hell, where it remains trapped for all eternity.
When a demon is killed its spirit descends to hell, where it remains trapped for all eternity.<eos> How do you descend a gargoyle?<eos> We are sacramental beings of light and good.<eos> We ascend.<eos> And only at the hands of godless creatures that have no souls.<eos> You do not want those.<eos> They are blunt and crude, and far too heavy to wield.<eos> Adam, you have strength and speed and stamina far beyond that of any human.<eos> You would use those gifts. Take sides in a war that you are already a part of.<eos> I do not care how many demons it descended. You should've let me destroy it.
Perhaps he wasn't as magnanimous as you are, Doctor.<eos> Every scientist keeps a record.<eos> Even when their experiments end in failure.<eos> Look, there ought to be at least a record of his work somewhere.<eos> Drawings or a set of notes.<eos> Something.<eos> Just because something is yet to be found, does not mean it doesn't exist.<eos> But if Frankenstein was real, if he really did animate a human, would it help you to study it?<eos> Well, yes, absolutely.<eos> But, Mr. Wessex, it would have to be over 200 years old by now.
We are standing here today outside the Supreme Court, where over 100,000 people have gathered to await the verdict in the extraordinary trial of John Doe.<eos> The entire world is watching this bizarre trial, and nobody knows which way the jury will vote.<eos> But, one thing's for certain.<eos> Whichever way the...<eos> Wait.<eos> It looks like we may have a verdict.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience.<eos> Not guilty!<eos> This trial is unprecedented in our history.<eos> It has sparked controversy and evoked emotions worldwide.
Clever boy.<eos> That's exactly the point.<eos> Each one of them was a repeat offender planning to offend again.<eos> The threat they posed was never gone... until they were gone.<eos> That's an odd way to try and change the world.<eos> The world's a better place now.<eos> So you're saying none of these people, none of your victims, had anything positive to contribute to society?<eos> No.<eos> I'm standing today, just outside Parliament House, where members of the Speak for the Dead movement are publicly showing their support for John Doe.<eos> As you can see behind me, it has drawn much support, from both sides of the argument.
Well, I guess some people have pretty vivid imaginations, don't they?<eos> Some people claim to have proof.<eos> What proof, Ken?<eos> This whole... eye-for-an-eye thing.<eos> It's not really justice, is it?<eos> Well, it seems to be working.<eos> Oh, so... bring back capital punishment, the noose, firing squad?<eos> I never said that.<eos> Look, I'm not gonna sit here and pretend to have all the answers, Ken.<eos> But what I do know is the system as it stands... it doesn't work.
I did you a favor.<eos> I did what needed doing.<eos> There are so many of them out there, and some of them never get caught.<eos> They just keep going... again and again and again.<eos> Then it must make you feel impotent, John... being locked in here knowing that there are rapists and murderers and pedophiles roaming the streets, and now there is nothing you can do about it.<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> Their time will come.<eos> Really?<eos> How so?<eos> Because it's out there now.
- There's the bomb.<eos> - What's that?<eos> That's an old Russian missile.<eos> Has a radius about 5 miles.<eos> - How the hell did they get that?<eos> - Wait, if they launch that...<eos> - The city is ground zero.<eos> - We're gonna have to evacuate. - No time.<eos> - There's a fallout shelter.<eos> It won't help us against the NAD blast.
Wait.<eos> He never entered the building of mine.<eos> I saw the whole thing from my surveillance camera.<eos> His own man shot him in the back and left him for death on my doorstep.<eos> A cold blooded setup. Your full of shit.<eos> Now get down on your knees.<eos> - Get down on your knees!<eos> - Damien. - There's a problem.<eos> - What? The number didn't come through?<eos> No, it did.
That might have been that cop He said something about the Kragle.<eos> The President Business was going to use the Kragle to end the world in three days. I can't make any sense of it.<eos> The Taco Tuesday.<eos> I knew that was suspicous.<eos> There is no time to lose.<eos> We must find Vitruvius and get to the Office Tower before it's too late.<eos> Ok.<eos> How scary can someones' office be?<eos> THE PRESIDENT BUSINESS OFFICE<eos> President Business, we're trying to locate the fugitive but his face is so generic, it matches any other face in owr database.
For the children, for us.<eos> My love.<eos> GOD WITH US!<eos> Stop, this is finished.<eos> Leave.<eos> My days draw to an end, my son.<eos> - No, father!<eos> - They do... child.<eos> That is the nature of life.<eos> All that is left for me is to ensure my Kingdom receives the leader it deserves.
I took a sauna this morning.<eos> - But I feel good.<eos> - Sweetheart?<eos> Οh, I don't usually drink and cleanse. Just, like, personal policy.<eos> But thank you.<eos> Οkay, I guess I should be heading back.<eos> What, like, back to Arizona?<eos> Well, it's a terrific coincidence.<eos> You know, Maggie, you asked me about the insight retreat.<eos> Guess where it is this year?
But...<eos> It's not because I don't care or because I don't respect you or because I don't love you.<eos> It's because I'm a big pussy.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm just a huge, pathetic pussy.<eos> I could never be you.<eos> You can crash on the couch, if you want.<eos> Did you, by chance, read my script?<eos> And?<eos> It's great.
This is all your fault!<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> That's funny!<eos> As the days went on, Stefan darkened... further consumed by paranoia and vengeance.<eos> Pull down! - The torch! Flame!<eos> Make ready!<eos> Release!<eos> You failed me.<eos> The wall cannot be burned.<eos> It is indestructible.
He's probably armed.<eos> We're doing, you know, big shootouts, and right on day one, the armorers were showing us guns that I'd never even seen before.<eos> We've got quite a lot of weaponry on this series, and we're gonna start with Jack's gun.<eos> We've updated it for this series of "24."<eos> He used to have a HK USP Compact.<eos> We now have a HK P30.<eos> He also uses other agents' guns throughout, particularly the Glock 17, which is our CIA weapon.<eos> We've also provided gun cameras, which fit on the front, give something visual for the director to read off.<eos> Our different tactical agents, when we see them in the field... they have a HK MP7.<eos> They also have an M4 derivative, and this is a bit of fun, which is a corner shot 9-millimeter Glock 17, but if I show you how it operates, it just comes up like that.
Kid had to be killed.<eos> So nobody'd know he'd paid Marv back off.<eos> So that's what we did.<eos> - So you... - Yeah. - ...killed him.<eos> - Yeah, I did.<eos> I shot him in the face, twice.<eos> Then I wrapped his head in a towel and stabbed him in the heart... so he would bleed out, put him in my bathtub and watched him drain.<eos> Then I put him in an oil tank... with laundry detergent and lye and sealed it back up.<eos> Want to know what his name was?<eos> It's 2:00, Bob. It's 2:00.
Through thick and through thin.<eos> But we need a leader not a martyr.<eos> I need to understand what you're doing.<eos> I've lost my way...<eos> We all lost our way.<eos> The violence, the anger...<eos> I'm angry too!<eos> I'm angry that I live in a world where a man who picks your food can't feed his family.<eos> I used to think the fight was with the growers.<eos> It's with ourselves.
And the last flight is not so...<eos> - Well, it is not exactly... - Absolutely.<eos> Let me put it this way.<eos> First class.<eos> Business class.<eos> Economy.<eos> You.<eos> Bring it.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> If you look at this plane, you'll notice it's quite old.
Uh...<eos> Hey, Agnes and I always knew you'd wind up here when the dust settled.<eos> Yup, all this.<eos> This was my calling, wasn't it?<eos> Well, the dust, as you put it never really settled.<eos> There's been progress, though, right?<eos> I mean, foreign aid. Every time I blink there's another fundraiser.<eos> There's a big difference between being here and being here to be photographed being here.<eos> The money doesn't always make it to where it's needed most.<eos> It never leaves the city. It's useless.
Well, yes.<eos> I mean, I can take off.<eos> I'm still working on my landing.<eos> What are we still doing here?<eos> - You're wasting time!<eos> - Rita, if you start that engine, you die.<eos> This is as far as you go.<eos> No matter what I do... this is as far as you ever make it.<eos> There's a mimic buried 20 yards away.<eos> It attacks when you start the engine.
Collect your ammo.<eos> Must be a thousand mimics between us and the pyramid.<eos> What we gonna do? Walk up to the front door?<eos> - If we stay here, we die. - Yeah?<eos> We'll never get through.<eos> We could.<eos> In that.<eos> That ship will never fly.<eos> Doesn't need to fly.<eos> It just needs to get us across there with speed.
I know.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Okay.<eos> Where is it?<eos> What?<eos> The thing.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Seriously, Greg, where is it?<eos> You had it!<eos> Look, it can't have just disappeared!
Into a seasonless world where you shall laugh<eos> But not all your laughter<eos> And weep and weep, but not all of your tears<eos> Love gives naught but itself<eos> And takes naught but from itself<eos> Love possesses not nor would it be possessed<eos> For love is enough<eos> You should say, "I am in the heart of God"<eos> You cannot direct the course of Love<eos> If Love, it finds you worthy, directs your course
Did your stay on the mountain give you no time for reflection?<eos> Quite a bit, thanks.<eos> Then why do you persist with these treasonous acts and rebellious speeches?<eos> Treasonous?<eos> I have only spoken with love.<eos> Oh.<eos> Only love and flowers, was it?<eos> I believe this is yours.<eos> "Pity the nation that raises not its voice<eos> "Save when it walks in a funeral
You might die!<eos> Dear Almitra, we don't need to be afraid of death.<eos> "For life and death are one "Even as the river and the sea are one<eos> "How would we know the secret of death "Unless we look for it in the heart of life?<eos> "The owl whose night-bound eyes Are blind in the day "Cannot unveil the mystery of light<eos> "In the depth of your hopes and desires "Lies your silent knowledge of the beyond<eos> "And like seeds dreaming beneath the snow Your heart dreams of spring<eos> "Trust the dreams for in them is hidden the gate to eternity<eos> "For what is it to die but to stand naked "In the wind and to melt into the sun?<eos> "And what is it to cease breathing "But to free the breath from its restless tides "That it may rise and expand And seek God unencumbered?
She is.<eos> That thing keeps its host immune. That's how it goes unnoticed.<eos> Careful! We need her alive!<eos> Tell them to let her go!<eos> - You're making a mistake.<eos> - Let her go.<eos> That gun's not loaded.<eos> But this one is.<eos> Don't you understand? This parasite's the original strain.<eos> It's the only way to make the retroviral.
You two go down to the engine room.<eos> We'll meet back here.<eos> Now tell them!<eos> It's impossible.<eos> There must be a mistake.<eos> There's no mistake.<eos> Tell them right now to leave me alone or I swear I'll kill you.<eos> Tell them now!<eos> Tell me what?<eos> The parasite leaves its host when it finds a better one.
You know I'll take care of you.<eos> I'll do whatever it takes.<eos> And I'm proud of you.<eos> I know.<eos> Me and Miss Cut Bank. Chasin' it.<eos> You know my lot out there by the Filbans? The ol' junk heap I keep for spare parts?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'm sellin' it off to Marty Corcoran.<eos> If I may, sir, that place is a gold mine.<eos> Neither me or you or Match or none of us has been out there in years for it to be worth the taxes I cough up.
You're not gonna fuck this up, Georgie.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Did you see Mrs. Margaret?<eos> - And...<eos> The Postal Inspector should be here any day.<eos> That's good.<eos> That gives us a week tops.<eos> I need you to relax.<eos> Match did not torch the mail.<eos> I know... It's still in the garage.
Tell me a poem. Please?<eos> Okay.<eos> In my mind, there's a boy who exists in chains.<eos> Inside a cold, dark room of painful solitude is where he will remain.<eos> Behind these walls the sorrow is inevitable, as relentless as the passage of time.<eos> Mentalities corrupt and dark, brainwashed, and hopelessly blind.<eos> Prisons are packed with crowded spaces, lifers and guards with hollow faces.<eos> Shackled hearts afraid of changes, and weakened wills become complacent.<eos> Yet, I maintain with patience, time can limit but not shatter my will, strength blazed across my chest as solid as penitentiary steel.<eos> But the silence speaks, it tells me all I need to hear, it confirms my beliefs and its promises I have to fear.
- There's no room for criticism.<eos> - What's your criticism?<eos> I hate that we play victim when many of us, most of us, don't have to.<eos> Then you're exactly what's needed now.<eos> Maybe they're just waiting for someone to lead them.<eos> I don't want to lead them.<eos> What exactly are you trying to get me to do?<eos> Tell gay men to stop having sex.<eos> Do you think that this cancer is sexually transmitted?<eos> I think it is, yes.
Love charms... hypnotic, dangerous, put over jewelry... Forget about it. Lissa's been kidnapped.<eos> We have to hurry.<eos> Report from the gate. Nothing's come in or out.<eos> They're still on academy ground...<eos> Have you cleared this with Kirova?<eos> Better to beg forgiveness than ask permission.<eos> Yeah, and I put a sedative in her ass.<eos> Let me concentrate.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> - What is it?
Yeah, no, that's not gonna happen.<eos> He said something about you being "shadow-kissed"?<eos> She's not going.<eos> That's final.<eos> You look good, Vic.<eos> Which is ironic, considering it means more time rotting in jail.<eos> Don't take this the wrong way, Rose, but... I probably should have killed you.<eos> There's a compliment in there somewhere.<eos> I spent a lot of money on that charm.<eos> It didn't quite work out the way I wanted.

I probably should have killed you.<eos> There's a compliment in there somewhere.<eos> I spent a lot of money on that charm.<eos> It didn't quite work out the way I wanted.<eos> Mmm. It worked out well enough. Caused a man with no interest in me to burn off my dress, so...<eos> You're so tough, so one-of-a-kind.<eos> But you're still a girl.<eos> All this has happened, and what you want to know is, "Does Dimitri really like me?"<eos> It's a powerful charm, Rose, but it's not that powerful.
-Around? !<eos> You didn't think about calling your mom telling her you wouldn't come home?<eos> -Mom, chill..<eos> -Leo, do you know what time it is?<eos> You, out there, at night, in the dark...<eos> It's always dark for me, okay?<eos> No need for all this neurosis.<eos> -Why didn't you pick up your phone?<eos> -Mom, I'm sorry.<eos> Okay? It was in the backpack.
Here we go, stand by.<eos> Roger that.<eos> We're not here to make arrests, right?<eos> Breach!<eos> They killed two federal agents already.<eos> They're not fucking around!<eos> No matter what, we all go home tonight at the end of this mission.<eos> You know what you're doing with that thing?<eos> I was in the Army.<eos> It's the wrong way up.
I warned you.<eos> We fucked up.<eos> We fucked up, didn't we?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Can we talk?<eos> We stole the money.<eos> It was Breacher's idea.<eos> We thought it would make him happy.<eos> It was $10 million in cash.<eos> Went back for it that night, but when we got there, it was gone.
I didn't hurt anybody.<eos> I know you didn't, John.<eos> Come with me.<eos> The victim is 16-year-old Mellita Evans, a runaway, who was tragically found dead early this morning.<eos> The suspect in the alleged rape and murder of the young girl:<eos> John Luther, renowned evangelist and CEO...<eos> Did I do this to myself?<eos> It was just a matter of time, John.<eos> You're just a pawn in a much bigger game.<eos> It's about a powerful political movement based upon deceit.
We never thought we'd see this day, did we?<eos> But miracles can happen when we, as a people, unite with one voice.<eos> Our opponents boldly stated that we could never have Christians and Jews and Muslims standing together in solidarity.<eos> But they were wrong, weren't they?<eos> Dead wrong.<eos> This is the future of our evolution in this nation, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> This is no longer a Christian nation.<eos> In fact, it never has been.<eos> But the question now becomes how can a government survive and even prosper without the steadfast unity of its own diverse religious community?<eos> It simply can't.
May I call you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> Well, thanks for making my play better.<eos> So long, Josh.<eos> That Loretta girl gave a fair reading...<eos> Isabella gave a brilliant one.<eos> You have to make a decision today. Yeah.<eos> I don't understand what the problem is.<eos> It's not a problem. No one said anything about a problem.
Yes, that's what I was just saying.<eos> -I thought maybe we'd just sit down...<eos> Let me just say something here before we get started.<eos> Look, we're all professionals here.<eos> Which isn't to say that we don't have problems in our private lives from time to time.<eos> Of course we do.<eos> But what makes us professionals is that we don't let those problems slop over into our work.<eos> And we can't talk about them in any way, shape or form.<eos> Use it for your performance, let it fuel that, But don't let it distract you from our purpose here. Which is, of course, that old show business cliche, which I happen to really believe in.<eos> The show must go on and it will! -We owe it to the public.
Stop it, Al, just stop it!<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> This is all just a play!<eos> And who... Who is this?<eos> My father tore a hole in the sky. Everyone felt a release.<eos> Slow down, sir.<eos> You can't just come in here and ruin everything I'm doing, dad.<eos> Don't come towards me!<eos> Don't come, I'll blow this whistle again!<eos> If you don't let go of your past, it'll strangle your future.
Behind the Scotch.<eos> In his... In-in my office.<eos> He escaped once before and he stole it, briefly.<eos> I didn't want to give him that pleasure again, so I hid his casebook.<eos> Right.<eos> Doctor?<eos> I want to warn you.<eos> I do not know what Lamb's plan is for us, but I do know that if he believes you could jeopardize it, he will not hesitate to slit your throat.<eos> Deplorable conditions these, but soon I mean to make a change.<eos> And what better way to bring in the new century than by doing away with this godforsaken ward and all the backward thinking it represents.
He let me think I was the one who found out about Kent in Afghanistan.<eos> Why?<eos> Jamie doesn't wanna disappoint you.<eos> None of us wanna disappoint you. You're such a purist.<eos> Jamie would never have made the movie without Afghanistan.<eos> When I told him about Kent and the massacre, he thought it would make a good movie.<eos> He just had to figure out how to tell it.<eos> But why not tell it honestly?<eos> It's more entertaining this way.<eos> And now, it has a before and after, which, as you know, Americans love.
So this is the part where we say goodbye<eos> I promise I'll try to make it stick this time<eos> I always love breaking up with you 'cause<eos> The more bitter it got, the better the making up with you was<eos> And I think we can agree on the following things<eos> I'm an asshole and you're kinda needy<eos> I said it was casual<eos> And you pretended to believe me<eos> Our glass is empty<eos> At our best it was only half full
Hi.<eos> The turkey looks beautiful!<eos> And you got the red I like.<eos> I made everything just how you like it.<eos> I know you did.<eos> This red is so smooth.<eos> I don't know. It feels a little off balance to me.<eos> Yeah? What do you mean?<eos> I don't know. Like something doesn't belong.<eos> Maybe it needs to breathe a little.

For once, we're way ahead of the curve.<eos> By holding a gun to everyone on Earth and calling it protection.<eos> You know, I read those SSR files.<eos> "Greatest Generation"?<eos> You guys did some nasty stuff.<eos> Yeah, we compromised.<eos> Sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well.<eos> But we did it so that people could be free.<eos> This isn't freedom. This is fear.<eos> S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be.
That was a difficult winter.<eos> A blizzard had trapped half our battalion behind the German line.<eos> Steve, Captain Rogers, he fought his way through a HYDRA blockade that had pinned our allies down for months.<eos> He saved over 1,000 men. Including the man who would...<eos> Who would become my husband, as it turned out.<eos> Even after he died, Steve was still changing my life.<eos> You should be proud of yourself, Peggy.<eos> I have lived a life.<eos> My only regret is that you didn't get to live yours.<eos> What is it?
About nine minutes from now.<eos> Fury was right about that ship.<eos> Somebody's trying to hide something.<eos> This drive is protected by some sort of Al.<eos> It keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.<eos> Can you override it?<eos> The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me.<eos> Slightly.<eos> I'm gonna try running a tracer.<eos> This is a program that S.H.I.E.L.D. developed to track hostile malware, so if we can't read the file, maybe we can find out where it came from.
Who was he?<eos> You met him earlier this week on another assignment.<eos> I knew him.<eos> Your work has been a gift to mankind.<eos> You shaped the century.<eos> And I need you to do it one more time.<eos> Society's at a tipping point between order and chaos.<eos> And tomorrow morning, we're gonna give it a push.<eos> But, if you don't do your part, I can't do mine.<eos> And HYDRA can't give the world the freedom it deserves.
- She's gonna go to the cops! Keys!<eos> You want the key?<eos> - He made me do things I didn't want to do.<eos> - Shut up! Shut up!<eos> - Easy. Easy.<eos> What? You want more money?<eos> That's it, right?<eos> It's all about the money? It's all about the fucking money!<eos> Here's your fucking money!<eos> It's right there!
Something is wrong.<eos> They've just been woken and are already fading?<eos> Why?<eos> The sulcha and the selkie, all of us are connected.<eos> This is not good.<eos> Something must've happened to her.<eos> That's what I'm trying to say.<eos> I lost her down here.<eos> Did the selkie have her coat with her?<eos> No, it's at home.
Dear Mr Jameson New pix and invoice enclosed<eos> I think you should consider that maybe Spider-man is trying to help<eos> Sincerely, Peter Parker.<eos> Mr Norman Osborn, the legendary founder and CEO of Oscorp Industries has died.<eos> The Osborn estate has confirmed he is survived by his only son, Harry Osborn, who is the sole heir of the Oscorp corporate empire<eos> Osborn fundamentaly changed the medical profession's approach to human healing... and affected the lives of millions.<eos> I started Oscorp because I looked at the world around me and I thought.<eos> "We can do better. We should do better."<eos> Einstein said the world cannot be changed without changing our thinking but change isn't just a slogan.<eos> It begins with hard work.
I'll be out in a minute. Go eat.<eos> Finish your hush puppies.<eos> I'm full.<eos> In a minute, Lauren.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - What?<eos> - What are we doing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Fixing the sink.<eos> We're fixing the sink. It leaks.
You know when you send our soldiers to Vietnam without the weapon they needed to win the war you underestimated your enemy.<eos> You, hah you do that with this enemy,<eos> It won't be some border skirmish halfway around the world.<eos> This time the war will be for our streets, our cities, our homes.<eos> And by the time you see the need for my program, it will be too late.<eos> And you will have lost two wars in one life time.<eos> We're sorry, Dr..<eos> Trask.<eos> But your Sentinel Program,<eos> It ain't gonna fly.
It really broke him.<eos> He retreated into himself..<eos> I wanted to help do something so..<eos> So I designed a serum to treat his spine,<eos> Derived from the same formula that helps me control my mutation.<eos> I take just enough to keep myself balanced but, he takes too much.<eos> I tried easing him back but he just couldn't bear the pain<eos> Voices..<eos> The treatment gives him him his legs but<eos> It's not enough
I'll go check the generator.<eos> It's not the machinery, Is it?<eos> -I can't do this, my mind...<eos> -Yes you can.<eos> -It won't take it.<eos> -It's just a little rusty.<eos> You do not understand, It's not a question of being rusty.<eos> I can flip the switches, I can turn the knobs.<eos> But my power comes from here, comes from ..<eos> And it's broken.
His special adviser to combat this mutant issue.<eos> White House is....<eos> Raven doesn't realize but if she kills trask at an event like that with the whole world watching<eos> Then I came a long way for nothing.<eos> And there's more bad news, I saw in a report.<eos> They found traces of her blood in paris.<eos> for all we know they already have her DNA.<eos> That's all they need, to create the sentinels in the future.<eos> Now there's a theory in time physics that time is immutable.<eos> It's like a river, you can throw a pebble and it will create a ripple but the current always corrects itself.
It's about a bird?<eos> -What kind of bird?<eos> -A pigeon.<eos> About a pigeon.<eos> And what did the pigeon do?<eos> -It sat on a branch.<eos> -It sat on a branch?<eos> -And what did it do on the branch?<eos> -It rested and reflected.<eos> It rested and reflected?
Crikey!<eos> Nicolas, cage them.<eos> I've got some bad news for you, Dennis.<eos> You messed with the wrong birds.<eos> Because we are an elite unit, the best of the best.<eos> Cream of the corn on a platinum cob.<eos> And we're gonna take your deadly green goop and sashay right out the exit hatch.<eos> And just how are you going to do that?<eos> Deploy secret weapon.<eos> - The cheese, it burns!
You stole the Medusa Serum?<eos> Well, stole the serum, saved the day, did your job for you.<eos> Call it what you will.<eos> - Debbie!<eos> - Dave.<eos> - Dave!<eos> - He hacked into our system.<eos> Where's the sound?<eos> - Dave.<eos> Your microphone, it's not on.
- I have to loosen my utility belt.<eos> - No, I'm full.<eos> Just dump it in the ocean.<eos> You know, we're all in the same boat here.<eos> Actually, we're not. And perhaps you could express a little more concern over the fact that you stole and destroyed a $19 million vehicle!<eos> Bill me.<eos> - Corporal?<eos> Corporal?<eos> - We're picking up a signal, sir.<eos> It's five klicks southwest, but it stopped at that remote island.
And I have flippers!<eos> So it's flipping useless!<eos> All right, pooch.<eos> If you won't work with us, you better work for us.<eos> Our plan requires a diversion.<eos> I give the orders around here.<eos> Much as it pains me,<eos> I need you to act as our diversion for our operation, understood?<eos> Nope!<eos> This is our plan, and it requires you to cause a diversion.
My family were butchered by the Romans.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> "Sorry"?<eos> What would a Roman know of such things?<eos> I am not a Roman.<eos> I'm a citizen of Pompeii.<eos> Then why do I see Rome's eagle everywhere I turn?<eos> I'm no part of that.<eos> After a year in Rome, I hoped never to see that eagle again.<eos> And yet, here it is, thrust into the soil outside my home.
You go and leave me here.<eos> If you ride you have a chance.<eos> A chance at what?<eos> At freedom.<eos> But at what cost to you?<eos> Tell the guards I brought you here by force.<eos> The blame is mine.<eos> Get him off that horse!<eos> it wasn't his fault.<eos> The horse bolted. It was out of control.
Men killing each other for our amusement is not a sport.<eos> Everywhere.<eos> All new.<eos> I don't have time for this, Graecus.<eos> What are you suggesting?<eos> That we cancel the games?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Merely postpone them.<eos> This amphitheater has stood for a hundred years.<eos> It withstood the great earthquake.

This guy is crazy.<eos> Yeah, ese.<eos> Now, a few weeks ago... I pitched you a game and you didn't listen.<eos> That really hurt my feelings.<eos> You were there.<eos> So were you.<eos> Now, I'm going to pitch my game again and you're going to hear me out... or I'm going to beat the shit out of everyone in this room.<eos> And I've fought women before.<eos> I didn't win... but I'm down to redeem myself.<eos> What if we made a game so visceral... that it made you feel like you were in real life danger?
- Why do you say that?<eos> Because sometimes he sounds weird.<eos> He says Jesus has a horse.<eos> Well, all sisters think their brothers are weird.<eos> That's just the way it goes. Okay?<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, so, your dad's a preacher.<eos> He knows a lot of things, but he didn't know that Jesus has a horse.<eos> Didn't know that.<eos> It's beautiful.
Put down the guns!<eos> Anna?<eos> Yura?<eos> What? Do you know her?<eos> Yes sir, I know her.<eos> That's her ex-husband?<eos> Excuse me, may I speak?<eos> Put down your guns!<eos> There is a device out there called Rainmaker.<eos> It could potentially kill millions of people.
What? Do you know her?<eos> Yes sir, I know her.<eos> That's her ex-husband?<eos> Excuse me, may I speak?<eos> Put down your guns!<eos> There is a device out there called Rainmaker.<eos> It could potentially kill millions of people.<eos> No, no. Rainmaker destroys oil fields.<eos> Yes, but the byproduct is that it's a mist clouds... of radioactive toxins that gather in the lower atmosphere.<eos> And then when there's enough moisture, it comes back down and it'd kill... everything it touches. That's why it's called Rainmaker.
Please sit.<eos> Please.<eos> As explained to you, my client's situation in Germany is delicate.<eos> These are the details of his offer.<eos> As you can see, there are specific requests for some money to be sent to Chechnya. Hospitals and schools.<eos> Perhaps this is a joke?<eos> You have added a zero to test me.<eos> The figure is correct.<eos> Where did this money come from?<eos> It has come to him in the form of an inheritance.
- Here.<eos> Dr. Abdullah, may I introduce your benefactor, Issa Karpov, and his lawyer, Miss Richter.<eos> I wish to speak with Issa alone.<eos> Of course.<eos> Miss Richter?<eos> Please tell me, why you have decided to make this generous gift?<eos> Are you under duress?<eos> No. Look at me.<eos> It is unclean money, sir.<eos> It belongs to a man who has done great evil. My father.
- That's Dawson Cole.<eos> I thought maybe you'd need a hand.<eos> Hey. I thought you might want this.<eos> You can take it.<eos> I just didn't want to pack things away if you might want to keep 'em.<eos> It's OK. I don't want much.<eos> I'll make my own box.<eos> OK.<eos> - What?<eos> What is it?
How it's working?<eos> - All set.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Do we have any special?<eos> - No.<eos> Any doubt, light load.<eos> Oh, thank God, because... I have only three hours of sleep, and I have a mass setting.<eos> - Your sister's wedding, how was it?<eos> - It's really beautiful.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> Vista Pacific 7500. You are clear for take off on runway 2-8-1.<eos> Engage thrust mode.<eos> Eight knots.<eos> A pretty....<eos> It's a beautiful lookout.<eos> Look at that.<eos> On the air look alike.<eos> She lived in a castle.<eos> Look, it's here.
See, Theseus had promised his father that if he defeated the Minotaur, he'd hoist a white sail on his ship as a tribute but he was so excited to get back home he forgot and he flew the same black sail that he set out with.<eos> Well, thinking his son was dead, the heartbroken king flung himself onto the rocks below, another victim of the cruel tricks gods play on men.<eos> Well, I hope you ladies brought your handkerchiefs, 'cause the next thing you're about to see has been known to make some weep at first sight. Follow me.<eos> Completed in 438 BC, the Parthenon.<eos> From the Greek word "parthenes", meaning "virgins".<eos> "The ancient Greeks were masters of deception.<eos> "Even though the base of the Parthenon appears straight to the naked eye,<eos> "it is, in fact, completely crooked.<eos> "Indeed, if one were to leave one's hat on one side of the temple steps,<eos> "it would vanish altogether when viewed from the other."
I'm just letting you know. - All right?<eos> - Good night.<eos> Shit's going to be like... like "Daily Show" huge.<eos> I think those calls did the trick.<eos> And now we motherfucking wait.<eos> Damn it!<eos> There's a noise.<eos> I definitely heard some sounds. Just out here.<eos> Sounds like what I heard yesterday.<eos> Looks like it found me.
- You made it bro.<eos> - Todd, help me. You got him. You fucking got him.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> All right, we're clear, we're clear.<eos> All right.<eos> - Did you fucking kill that thing?<eos> - Yeah, I shot it, man.<eos> - I shot it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Is it dead? - I think so.
His dick is this big!<eos> "Hey, homie. I'm gonna fuck your wife with my giant dick."<eos> "My God, this is amazing." "My God, homie.<eos> "Homie." "Wow. My God." "It feels so good, homie." "What are you doing later?"<eos> "That's amazing."<eos> Okay, enough! Stop imitating!<eos> I get it! He's got a huge dick!<eos> And her vagina, "Bye!" It's ruined!<eos> Destroyed. Gone!<eos> It's like when you lend a fat friend your shirt, and it comes back, and it's all stretchy and flappy!
I love brunch. It's the best!<eos> And I get really excited when I smell freshly ground coffee.<eos> Me, too, because it's awesome.<eos> Like, way too excited.<eos> I want a tomato garden. How's that?<eos> I love going to The Container Store and buying containers.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I love our hand soap that's shaped like seashells.<eos> Why?<eos> It smells like lemongrass.
Live from WZIL, News 25 at noon starts now.<eos> Colin Evans, convicted of voluntary manslaughter for one of the most brutal murders in recent history, is up for parole today.<eos> Five years ago, Evans was one of the most wanted men in state history, having emerged as the prime suspect in the disappearance of five young women.<eos> Evans was eventually apprehended for the crimes, only to escape and elude authorities for several months, until the night he was arrested for the fatal barroom brawl that would lead to his manslaughter conviction.<eos> The evidence necessary to try Evans for the abduction of the five young women proved illusory.<eos> The DA's office decided to settle for what it knew it could prove in a court of law.
Number three!<eos> All fire on my command!<eos> Three!<eos> Two!<eos> One!<eos> He turned off the artificial gravity, everywhere but in here.<eos> I told you I had a plan.<eos> That was a pretty good plan.<eos> Yeah!<eos> There it is.
- Thank you, sir.<eos> Feeling okay?<eos> Flying is not my cup of tea.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> - You're a doctor.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Your bag.<eos> Can you fetch it up, please?<eos> Sure.<eos> It's right down here.
No matter what happens, drop down 8,000 feet.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Take this.<eos> - Lighter luggage up front.<eos> Keep piling please.<eos> Bring the heavier luggage down.<eos> Keep them going.<eos> Sir, keep that with you, I just need...<eos> Your nose.<eos> Yeah, it's bleeding, thanks.
Sorry. I'm sorry, I need your help.<eos> She won't come out.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Are you scared?<eos> I wanna see my daddy.<eos> I know you do, sweetheart.<eos> I know you do.<eos> You know, I was a daddy once to a little girl just like you, and when she was scared, you know what she'd do?<eos> She had a magic ribbon, very powerful.<eos> It'll protect you, just like your daddy.
Wanna stay for dinner?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ed.<eos> Hey, is it "make your own pizza" night?<eos> Sure, great idea. Great idea.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ipromiseto loveyou , to cherish you and to hold you and to be the rock in our relationship for the rest of our days.<eos> Ipromiseto be yourbaby'sbreath whenwewakeeachmorning.<eos> Andtobe youreveningrose atday'send.<eos> AndI promise tobeyoursafeharbor when the boat is rocking and when it's not rocking.
- I will dance with a golden toad.<eos> - Excellent!<eos> Get a good night's sleep, and in the morning, be sure to wear a comfortable pair of walking shoes.<eos> Who was that?<eos> - It's a surprise.<eos> Everything will be revealed to you at the appropriate time.<eos> Mm..hm. Now, back to bed.<eos> You know, when Shelby was little..<eos> Mom!<eos> ..she used to always go on about the wedding she was gonna have, and it always got bigger.
Remember when Dad used a studded belt on me? Yeah.<eos> I remember other things, too. I remember how he used to dote on you when you were little.<eos> No, I don't remember when I was little!<eos> I remember when I was eight and he hit me with a tennis racket.<eos> So you're gonna shoot him?<eos> Michael, he hit me, too. Remember when I scratched the car?<eos> It warms my heart a little to see the two of you showing some initiative.<eos> - Did you tell him?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> The game's not what it was in my day, I'll tell you that.
She was the only softness in me.<eos> - Jesus!<eos> - What is he saying, Elliot?<eos> I'm saying your mother never wore a seat belt.<eos> Michael, wait in the other room.<eos> - Just wait in the other room.<eos> For real?<eos> That game ruined me.<eos> I had everything before and nothing after.<eos> It poisoned me.
- What's all this, then?<eos> - Turing, Alan.<eos> Professor at King's.<eos> - Seems there's been a burglary.<eos> - Oh? What of?<eos> Well, that's just it. Nothing missing, really.<eos> What's he doing in Manchester?<eos> Something with machines.<eos> The project at the NPL.<eos> I checked, but he won't say what it's on.
Was she supposed to?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Alan Turing.<eos> Turing.<eos> The mathematician.<eos> - Correct. - However could I have guessed?<eos> Well, you didn't.<eos> You just read it on that piece of paper.<eos> King's College, Cambridge.<eos> Now, it says here you were a bit of a prodigy in the maths department.
It's only when you feed them back into Enigma that they make any sense. But we have an Enigma machine.<eos> Yes, Polish Intelligence smuggled it out of Berlin.<eos> So, what's the problem?<eos> Just put the intercepted messages - back into the Enigma and you'll...<eos> - Look, it's not that simple, is it?<eos> Just having an Enigma machine doesn't help you to decode the messages.<eos> Very good, Mr. Turing.<eos> To decode a message, you need to know the machine's settings.<eos> Now, the Germans switch settings every day promptly at midnight.<eos> We usually intercept our first message around 6:00 a.m., which gives you exactly 18 hours every day to crack the code before it changes, and you start again.
Attracting deer to within your shooting range<eos> This might be a little difficult at first. But remember.<eos> Practice make perfect.<eos> Now. Open your mouth like an O, while making these sounds.<eos> Then let them out with a little push. Like this.<eos> Okay. Now it's your turn.<eos> It was a deer.<eos> Now comes the elk.<eos> Unwrap this, Oskari.<eos> It should have a red cross on it.
We can't.<eos> We got the bike.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> They got bike racks on the front of buses now.<eos> Cool.<eos> Perfect.<eos> That's very convenient.<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> You forgot your bike!<eos> Oh, it's not ours.
What?<eos> You gotta get back here right now.<eos> One of those idiots is in the building and he's pretending to be my husband!<eos> Why don't you tell them he's not your husband?<eos> Because I don't even know what they're up to.<eos> He must be trying to sell the box.<eos> Just get back here!<eos> This microscopic robot, or nanobot can be injected into the human body to detect and cure cancer.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Can it sing?

No.<eos> No, it's your turn.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Just give me a second.<eos> It's your turn.<eos> Read 'em and weep.<eos> You've got such a nice face.<eos> - Nice?<eos> I mean, yeah, it is.<eos> It ain't much, but it does cover my unsightly skull.
It doesn't matter anyway.<eos> I know them all by heart.<eos> There's my mom when she's little.<eos> She has my eyes.<eos> Blue-gray with flecks of panic.<eos> And here's Mom teaching me how to swim.<eos> Notice how I'm grafted to her arm.<eos> Not a success.<eos> And there's a picture of a pony.<eos> I don't know why it's in there or who it belonged to, but... there it is anyway.
One anomaly.<eos> The sample arrived this morning.<eos> he's not a sample. He's a patient.<eos> He's Patient Zero.<eos> Mr Porter?<eos> My name is Dr. Edwards.<eos> We are.. on the verge.. of a global pandemic.<eos> And you are..<eos> the only known carrier of this virus who's asymptomatic.<eos> The good news.. is that it's not an airborne virus.
Might as well.<eos> Hey, enjoy yourself.<eos> Is that it? Anything else?<eos> - I think so.<eos> Wait, here we go.<eos> Oh shit.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Hey, thanks.<eos> To you and your wedding.<eos> May it last at least 7 months.
Come here!<eos> Look at this thing.<eos> - Do you believe that?<eos> - No.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Right.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> America?<eos> - Really, yeah.<eos> It says he carved it with a chainsaw.
Which gives us a 360-degree view of outside.<eos> It's fitted with a digital cinema camera that will, when we find one of these bad boys give us the shot of the century.<eos> A sight nobody but God has witnessed:<eos> the eye of the tornado.<eos> That means "cut," Jacob. Cut it.<eos> Let's get some B roll.<eos> Get shots of the claws, the instruments on the back, panel stuff.<eos> - Just give me stuff I can use. Okay? - Got it.<eos> My storm's expanding.<eos> That means it's going to be really big by the time it gets here.
Pete...<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> I gotta finish this.<eos> Trey, come on. Get in.<eos> - Let's go find your brother.<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> That's my girl.<eos> Dad, it's getting worse out there.<eos> Still no signal.<eos> My phone. It's not working.
Here, look.<eos> A friend from Interpol had sent me info.<eos> Carmini was unable to commit attacks Suresnes and Sartrouville he was seen in Spain.<eos> Carmini has nothing to do with it.<eos> Neither does Denard.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> How about the silly cartridges at his house?<eos> There is little time to know who fucked us.<eos> A ticket of the attack at Suresnes surfaced.<eos> It is great, that one.
Well, then why not do it, man? It'd be perfect.<eos> I'll help if you want.<eos> Have you watched my videos yet?<eos> No, what is it, Super Video Dude?<eos> No, man.<eos> It's Super Rad Video. Game Dude. Ah, rad.<eos> Hey, Angry Video Game Nerd!<eos> Hey, how you doing?<eos> Hey, I saw your last review and I was laughing my ass off.<eos> I just had to go buy the game on eBay and see how bad it was and man, you were right.
Alright, it sucks ass through a straw.<eos> That game is proof that we failed as a human race.<eos> It's a horrible abomination that fucks you harder than life itself, and I wish I could send every single cartridge off the face of this earth!<eos> See? That's exactly what you say in the video.<eos> I can't even be pissed off and have it mean anything anymore.<eos> It's better to get pissed off than to get pissed on.<eos> There's one thing that I could never get to the bottom of. Hm.<eos> Why is that Eee Tee game so infamously popular?<eos> Well, it's the worse game, but it's the greatest game story ever told.<eos> I mean when gamers found out Eee Tee was buried in that landfill, it became forever buried in our conscious minds.
So I'll let this demo walk the walk, so to speak.<eos> So what do you think about that, Nerd?<eos> So that's a yes?<eos> And then you just automatically assumed I'd be cool with this?<eos> Well, you never said anything about not reviewing the new Eee Tee game.<eos> Oh, but don't you understand? If I review the new one, I'm only gonna end up having to do the old one too.<eos> Then why not do both?<eos> I can't.<eos> I physically can't play that game.<eos> It caused me so much torment as a child, I'd rather quit reviewing games permanently. You know what?
Anyway, I was a rising star in their aerodynamics program, so they put me onto the ongoing top-secret Roswell project as their head reverse engineer.<eos> The UFO crashed there in 1947, right?<eos> When that sucker crashed in the desert, it broke up like one of those clay pigeons in Duck Hunt.<eos> There was metallic debris all over the desert. Or debriss.<eos> No, it's debris.<eos> Well, there's an s.<eos> Why isn't it pronounced debriss?<eos> A greater mystery than this.<eos> Anyway, the metal was like nothing on Earth.<eos> It was thin, almost identical to tinfoil, except that it reacted strangely when you played around with it, displaying strange magnetic properties.
I told you, butch Barbie. I know nothing.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Your friend, Doctor Louis Zandor, designed this game with the floor plans to our base.<eos> Don't you realize what a threat this poses to our homeland security?<eos> So what is this new Eee Tee 2 game you're selling?<eos> It's just a game.<eos> Well. You have quite the fan base I realize.<eos> The gamers are loyal to you.<eos> Have them send all their Eee Tee games to me.<eos> Join me, Nerd, and this game can be history, forever in the past where it belongs.
Then you people invented the nuclear bomb. That's when I came down to settle things 'cause when the game gets out of control, Dad's gotta take it away.<eos> Your dad? Death Mwauthzyx.<eos> If he found out I created a culture of warmongers and xenophobes, all it'll take from him is one 360 turn from the satellite dish on his head and.<eos> Existence as we know it will come to an end.<eos> Just a punishment for me, but a painful apocalypse for you guys.<eos> Psyche!<eos> So how do we stop this?<eos> I need my spaceship.<eos> That would help.<eos> Well, it's in a million pieces, wherever it is.
Care to give us an intro?<eos> And now presenting AVGN's long-awaited review, Eee Tee 2.<eos> He's the angriest gamer you ever heard.<eos> He's the Angry.<eos> Video Game Nerd!<eos> Let's get this baby fired up. Um, I know<eos> we don't have the original cartridges, but can this ship somehow play the old Eee Tee games?<eos> This ship was the old Eee Tee game.<eos> I can reload the bygone data from the circuitry.<eos> It claims to be even worse than the original.

Come on, you motherfucker, motherfucker, motherfucker.<eos> Come on, ugh.<eos> Fuck.<eos> And how come they can pass over a hole and you can't?<eos> Yeah, yeah, go ahead, pass over the hole again.<eos> Yeah, fuck you.<eos> I'm gonna pass over your mom's hole.<eos> Even if you find the pieces, it's worth Jack and shit.<eos> And Jack left town. That's because you need to find the phone home zone also.<eos> It looks like a space invader alien, but there's only one in the entire game.
Okay.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> He moved on, so can I.<eos> Hey...<eos> Keeping it lowercase.<eos> Keeping it casual.<eos> Really?<eos> !<eos> Okay... come on.<eos> The bar is so low, it's so very low.
Of course.<eos> Of course, she's like the coolest girl imaginable.<eos> I made that profile because<eos> I wanted to have something to throw in her face whenever she wanted to pull the trigger.<eos> And I know that's very immature.<eos> You could have broken up with her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I thought about that.<eos> People talk about how great it is to be single and that's bullshit, joining the single party.<eos> It's not a party, it's a bunch of people sitting around in the dark, texting.
Cassie!<eos> Cassie!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We're going on a day trip, do you want to come?<eos> Go get dressed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cassie, just come out the front door.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> What is this place?<eos> It belongs to the university.
We're definitely a band now.<eos> Why are we a band now?<eos> This is something only a band would do.<eos> This is band shit.<eos> Day trips, canoeing, kayaking.<eos> What do you think, James?<eos> I think we are three people paddling a boat, that's all.<eos> So what makes a band then?<eos> You don't make a band, a band makes you.<eos> It comes up and sweeps you along.

- I'm sorry! - (COUGHING) - I'm really sorry.<eos> Connor, you dozy little tit!<eos> - Wait, wait, wait.<eos> - Oh, man, my gums are numb.<eos> - This can't be right.<eos> - You flew, mate.<eos> You actually flew across the room.<eos> Sean...<eos> Look at his implant.<eos> - It's dead. - What?
- Wait, wait, wait.<eos> - Oh, man, my gums are numb.<eos> - This can't be right.<eos> - You flew, mate.<eos> You actually flew across the room.<eos> Sean...<eos> Look at his implant.<eos> - It's dead. - What?<eos> The shock must have turned it off.<eos> - It's dead.
Nate, Morse Code Martin was right.<eos> Smythe did kill his wife.<eos> He's alive, I knew it.<eos> I bloody knew it.<eos> Region 632-7560.<eos> Where's that?<eos> 632-7560...<eos> Got him.<eos> The hotel.<eos> Nate, your implant, it's flashing.
Monique! Where are you?<eos> I need... I need you.<eos> I need you now, darling.<eos> At the end of the summer, Swanny came back to find me.<eos> He got lost in the woods.<eos> Heat stroke like you wouldn't believe.<eos> Follow the river!<eos> Find the secret lake!<eos> Find the secret lake!<eos> That was a load of bollocks, wasn't it?
- Can't you just lock him out?<eos> - To reconfigure the system would entail taking each and every robot offline.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> But you can track his mother, though.<eos> Let me know where she is and I'll...<eos> The boy's mother is not a priority.<eos> But if we have her, we'll have him, can't you see?<eos> Everybody in this zone is now scheduled for a deep scan.<eos> A sky ship carrying 4,096 deep scanners is en route.<eos> It will arrive in 15 hours and 42 minutes approximately.
- But you turned me down.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> I care for you.<eos> I think you're wonderful.<eos> You don't need to marry me.<eos> I am already yours.<eos> If you don't marry me, I don't want to live.<eos> Our hearts should be as one.<eos> That's not where the heart is.<eos> It's here.
If you don't marry me, I don't want to live.<eos> Our hearts should be as one.<eos> That's not where the heart is.<eos> It's here.<eos> Pull the trigger!<eos> What if the gun was loaded?<eos> You'd be dead.<eos> Come on!<eos> Don't threaten me again with a fake gun.<eos> It's loaded.
I really wanted you as my brother-in-law.<eos> But you had to choose death.<eos> Look at you!<eos> A murderer's face.<eos> Why couldn't you have a friendly face like Xiang?<eos> You say you're innocent? Your face says different!<eos> And your name, Ma, it's too short!<eos> And now you've fallen short.<eos> Inspector Xiang's name is powerful!<eos> It has four letters!
You harvest their organs, sell them on the black market.<eos> Be fucking serious.<eos> Come on. This is not helpful.<eos> Think seriously.<eos> You're right.<eos> There's other things people have done. - There's plots.<eos> - For money.<eos> - The plot of the movie Speed.<eos> - Yes, there you go. Put a bomb on a bus.<eos> So we'll rig a bus so that when it goes below 50 miles an hour, it blows up.
What are you talking about? - I'm not sure what you mean.<eos> - This thing. My kidnapping. - Oh.<eos> Truth be told, Pop and I we've hit a rough patch.<eos> He's refusing to cover some of my expenses. Long story.<eos> Anyway, your timing could not have been better.<eos> Is this a fucking marlin?<eos> Rex, this is, uh, cool and all, but we decided, like, we're out. - We're not doing crime. - Not our thing.<eos> Yeah, no, he's right. No, the kidnapping is off, actually.<eos> No, no, no, it's on.<eos> - No, it's off.
It's okay.<eos> Want some tea?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Your home is so beautiful.<eos> The walls so thick and the wind organ ...<eos> They come apos; a monastery in Dharamsala.<eos> J apos;'ve met the Dalai Lama, c apos;'s a very cool guy.<eos> He laughs a lot.<eos> C apos; is like a guy with whom you would want to hang out, but apos; is impossible because it is the Dalai Lama.

At times, we all have to do that.<eos> I mean, we don't see with his eyes so we don't know the glory of his plan.<eos> Our lives unfold before us like puzzling reflections in a mirror.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> But on the day we rise, we will see with clarity and understand the mystery of his ways.<eos> Let us pray.<eos> There are three types of people in this world.<eos> Sheep, wolves and sheepdogs.<eos> Now, some people prefer to believe that evil doesn't exist in the world.<eos> And if it ever darkened their doorstep, they wouldn't know how to protect themselves. Those are the sheep.
So I see.<eos> Now, tell me, where did you get that beautiful cape?<eos> - My granny made it for me.<eos> - Is that so?<eos> I would love a red cape like that.<eos> You would look pretty foolish.<eos> I would, wouldn't I?<eos> May I take a look at it?<eos> - No, I need it badly.<eos> It's mine!
Are you crazy? !<eos> It's a bomb; that's what you're supposed to do.<eos> That's not what you do with a bomb! Are you insane?<eos> !<eos> What was that?<eos> It's not my phone.<eos> It's the thing, whatever that is.<eos> - What are you talking about? - It's that.<eos> That's what just made that noise.<eos> It, like, imitated my ring-tone.
Watch.<eos> Is one beep yes?<eos> Yo, that's so tight.<eos> Are we in a barn?<eos> Is Munch really a woman?<eos> Oh, come on, man, this thing is broken.<eos> Everybody knows Munch is a woman.<eos> Okay, I have a question.<eos> Are we gonna die tonight?<eos> Why isn't it answering?
Trains?<eos> Trains.<eos> Male, 40 to 50.<eos> Oh, sorry, did you want to be...?<eos> Er, no, please, be my guest.<eos> 'You jealous? '<eos> Shut up!<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> What doesn't?<eos> This skeleton, it can't be any more than...
Thank you.<eos> I hate being touched.<eos> Where are we?<eos> Seriously.<eos> What is this, Saigon?<eos> Don't make fun of 'Nam.<eos> Best years of my life.<eos> This place is awesome.<eos> My neck was so tight.<eos> What's it called? "No Hands." Isn't it great?
They say there's power in Boston.<eos> Some phone service in Denver.<eos> But things are far from what they were.<eos> Maybe it was all inevitable.<eos> An unavoidable collision between mankind and technology.<eos> The Internet was meant to make the world a smaller place.<eos> But it actually feels smaller without it.
I spent my life trying to reduce the brain to a series of electrical impulses.<eos> I failed.<eos> Human emotion....<eos> It can contain illogical conflict.<eos> Can love someone... and yet hate the things that they've done.<eos> Machine can't reconcile that.<eos> - Can you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Does the virus work?<eos> Once it executes, it'll wipe out anything with the machine's code on it.
It's my civic duty.<eos> I've known the sheriff for a long time.<eos> Listen to me, you little rodent.<eos> You're gonna keep your mouth shut.<eos> Now, you back to your office and you mind your own goddamn business.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Don't touch my wheelchair.<eos> You shouldn't have done that, Mr. Smith.<eos> No one touches my wheelchair.<eos> It belongs to my dead mother.
Women are tricky. Problem is, they're smarter than us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is Sonny.<eos> Hey, Sonny.<eos> It's Pete Begler with the Chiefs.<eos> Hey, Pete. What's up?<eos> Well, we're in the market for a QB, and now that you have number one, I was wondering if Brian Drew's available.<eos> I don't know. Haven't made up my mind yet.<eos> Is he healthy?<eos> Well, if you're askin' about his knee, it's stronger than ever. He's throwin' the ball a good 15 yards farther down the field.
What a feast.<eos> Let us in on your party.<eos> Don't get cocky, Bronze.<eos> I won't let you do whatever you want in the House of Taurus, no matter who you are.<eos> There will be many Gold Saints awaiting you.<eos> No amount of struggling will help you win.<eos> It might be a different story if you awaken to the seventh sense, though.<eos> Seventh sense?<eos> You don't know?<eos> It's exactly what it sounds like.
He begrudgingly gave me a ride.<eos> Where are you headed?<eos> Just down the beach there.<eos> - Can I come along?<eos> - Not really, no.<eos> Maybe later.<eos> That's fine, yeah.<eos> I won't keep you.<eos> Did you finish your book?<eos> Yes, I did. I don't know how good it is.

I don't want to hear another word of this superstitious nonsense uttered in this house again.<eos> If any of you are too frightened, well, you can leave.<eos> I am too frightened.<eos> We should go back to Oxford.<eos> Salvage what's left of the term.<eos> What about Jane?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We gave her a break, now we need one.<eos> Have you seen this sigil before?<eos> Does it mean anything to you?
With your neighbor, Mrs. Blangman?<eos> Mrs. Hillman.<eos> Whatever. She said your mom had a boyfriend.<eos> How would she know?<eos> She's nosy.<eos> She can't see.<eos> Wait... whatever.<eos> Even if my mom did have a boyfriend, doesn't it just make it that much more likely that she just ran off somewhere?<eos> - What?<eos> What? What is it?
Fine.<eos> I'm satisfied with my...<eos> My microbot?<eos> This doesn't make any sense.<eos> Puberty can often be a confusing time for a young adolescent flowering into manhood.<eos> The thing is attracted to the other microbots, but that's impossible.<eos> Dumb thing's broken.<eos> Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Why don't you find out where it's trying to go?
Last hug.<eos> Baymax!<eos> - Baymax! - Hey!<eos> Baymax!<eos> Baymax!<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I have found where your tiny robot wants to go.<eos> I told you, it's broken.<eos> It's not trying to go...
The following Sunday, 60 Minutes Australia revealed the whole hoax.<eos> He billed himself as a man of the supernatural, a man who could do amazing things.<eos> And thousands believed him, making him a celebrity.<eos> But it was all an elaborate hoax.<eos> The most basic fact about Carlos was that he simply doesn't exist.<eos> That's the real teaching of Carlos.<eos> But this doesn't even scratch the surface of just what a phoney Carlos is.<eos> I am Carlos!<eos> Though I had, just a year or so before this Australian event, actually met Jose Alvarez,<eos> I was very pleased at what it did for our relationship because it really cemented it pretty well.
One of the tests was a spindle with a small rotor on top that had a glass dome that fit over the top of this to protect it.<eos> Our jobs were to try to move that rotor without obviously removing the glass dome.<eos> I thought that was a pretty good test.<eos> It's connected to the base real well.<eos> I really was stumped.<eos> Then I look over to the side of the room and Steve was concentrating on the rotor and the rotor starts to move.<eos> Here you see Steve influencing the rotor.<eos> He's causing it to rotate clockwise.<eos> And they said, "Well, to make sure there is no air currents or "anything like that, can you make it move to the right?"<eos> So I start concentrating and slowly it starts reversing and it goes to the right.
You ain't in line to be starting quarterback on the streak team... because you've done the right thing. It's because you're 6'2" with a cannon for an arm.<eos> So, Tayshon, what do you believe?<eos> Well, down where I sleep, the dealers in Richmond make mad money.<eos> My aunt was an ER nurse. Worked her whole life helping people.<eos> Time came for her to get hers, they up and fired her... six months before they gotta pay her retirement.<eos> Dog-eat-dog. Take what you need.<eos> They don't care how good you've been.<eos> You sitting around waiting for somebody to pay you back, you going hungry.<eos> So why does a guy like Luke, who's a doctor, painter, writer, historian... take the time to invent a lie?<eos> It ain't a lie.
Peek at what you look like in our gear.<eos> If I'd have had these, I'd have been All City.<eos> Newest model from Nike.<eos> Mrs. Kelly, maybe you wanna open that last bubble package.<eos> Hey, what you got, T-Gram?<eos> Diploma.<eos> - With your name on it. - What?<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> No matter what, four years from now, when you have your real diploma... it will reward you and your family for the rest of your life.
Let the way you live your lives do that.<eos> Coach.<eos> I truly believe that life's most impressionable lessons... are ones where something bad happens to you... or something challenging confronts you.<eos> No one can climb into your head and hear what that little voice is saying to you.<eos> Is it saying, "Oh, no, we lost the streak"?<eos> Well, what's it gonna say?<eos> After today, you're gonna find out a lot about yourselves.<eos> And you know something, we're all gonna find out what this team is made of.<eos> The effort you put in during the off-season was commendable.<eos> But it has not translated onto the field.
Streak! - Let's go.<eos> Streak! Streak!<eos> Streak!<eos> Streak! Streak!<eos> Streak!<eos> There he goes!<eos> Growing up is tough.<eos> It's not easy.<eos> That's what our program's about.<eos> It ain't about the football.
- What the hell was that?<eos> ...takes a knee.<eos> Wow, rather than running in for his 89th career touchdown...<eos> Chris Ryan instead opts to take a knee.<eos> What are you doing, coach?<eos> Let him run it. Forty-one blast, come on. There's still time.<eos> Run it! Run it!<eos> - Mickey, Bob's not calling the plays.<eos> - You don't understand football.<eos> It's not about football.
I commit to 20 carries, 150 yards, seven tackles and no dropped passes."<eos> Once you say that, you hand the card to somebody, and you shake hands... and they say, "I hold you to that commitment."<eos> To the Kelly family, Landrin and Bevelyn.<eos> My heart breaks for your loss, and I pray for your recovery.<eos> God bless you both... and please, take some solace in the fact... that you did a fantastic job.<eos> I told you before, this is the last thing I'm gonna say.<eos> Growing up is painful.<eos> It's not easy.<eos> But that's what our program is about, in case you haven't figured it out.<eos> It ain't about the football. It ain't about scoring touchdowns. It ain't about the win streak.

- I got a girlfriend now. - Oh.<eos> I think you'd like her.<eos> I'd like you to meet her sometime. Hmm?<eos> - I had a scorpion in the house.<eos> - Did you?<eos> Yeah, but it was entirely my fault.<eos> I mean, I should've seen it sooner.<eos> Oh, you got him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was crawling all over the place.
Boy?<eos> I told 'em you weren't a virgin.<eos> I'm not a fucking virgin.<eos> Kill all engines.<eos> Who said I was a...<eos> Engine, 360 meters forward.<eos> Russian destroyer, bearing west-northwest, 20 knots.<eos> 208 meters.<eos> 200 meters.<eos> It's passing, heading south.
You be very, very careful.<eos> That's our way out of here?<eos> - Got you.<eos> - They've got the drive shaft.<eos> Okay, we're ready here, skip.<eos> Bring her in slow and steady.<eos> Will do.<eos> It's not moving.<eos> Come on.<eos> It won't budge.
Fraser.<eos> Keep pushing it.<eos> Fraser, it's the ridge.<eos> We're heading right for that drop.<eos> - Fraser, we need to stop.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Robinson, get rid of the gold.<eos> Can you keep it coming, Fraser?<eos> Yes, we can.<eos> We need to keep moving or we'll never get it started again.
- What do we say, Manolo?<eos> - Thank you, señora.<eos> Manolo. Always giving away stuff for free.<eos> Right, dad?<eos> Joaquin's father, captain Mondragon, had passed away fighting the fearsome bandit known as Chakal.<eos> Who's in there?<eos> Young sir, may I please have some of your bread?<eos> I'm so hungry.<eos> This bread is for my father.<eos> And it's delicious.
My champion easily woke... the sleeping beauty.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> It's a miracle!<eos> Thank you<eos> I'm...<eos> Alive.<eos> Cheers.<eos> One bite?<eos> Your snake!<eos> It bit me twice!
I'm getting rumors that he's looking to expand his operations.<eos> Where?<eos> That's where the rumors stop.<eos> But it will be one of ours.<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> I'm sorry, sir. He cannot be disturbed momentarily.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - How long will my father be? - He'll be done soon.<eos> Excuse the mess.<eos> It could be nothing.
Oh, that I can do.<eos> So, what do you want exactly?<eos> I've got my eye on this patch of land.<eos> Whose land?<eos> That's why I need your help.<eos> There are only two possibilities.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But with all due respect, if I wanted to rent a patch of land fair and square, I'd be meeting your father.<eos> Not you.<eos> It belongs to the Japanese.
- Why do you ask?<eos> She was reported missing.<eos> "And so dedicated, can long endure." Yeah. I remember her.<eos> What did she want?<eos> Weed, pills?<eos> She wanted a gun.<eos> I told her it's not my thing.<eos> I felt bad, though.<eos> She seemed really desperate.<eos> She said it needed to be small, so she could keep it close.
Fuck.<eos> The missing persons case of Amy Elliott Dunne.<eos> She is the beautiful blonde inspiration for the amazing Amy kids' book series.<eos> You're reading that diary again?<eos> You know how it ends.<eos> It interests me.<eos> Hey, Rhonda.<eos> "He's gonna kill me." The end.<eos> Why did he go to his dad's house to burn it?<eos> It's private. There's no one there.

Sodomize me.<eos> There were cameras everywhere.<eos> Please find this.<eos> Please find the tapes.<eos> She slit his throat with a box cutter.<eos> How did she manage to get a hold of a box cutter...<eos> If he had her tied up the whole time?<eos> Can't you just be happy your wife is home and safe?<eos> Amy, we found your diary.<eos> It contains many concerning allegations of mental and physical abuse.
Do you mind if I keep this for awhile?<eos> No. I think I know someone who can help us with this.<eos> I'm very happy your father is not sick anymore.<eos> I'm sorryl rushed off like that, without any explanation.<eos> It's been a difficult month.<eos> Not a lot of things happened here since you left.<eos> Except for 30s, of course.<eos> What happened?<eos> He lost his bird, Wittekop.<eos> Apparently it didn't return from a practice flight.
I think that I know where your great-grandfather is buried.<eos> Do you know who CherAmi is?<eos> No. CherAmi was a famous war pigeon.<eos> He saved 600 British soldiers in the Great War.<eos> It's... It's an incredible story.<eos> The British soldiers, they were lost in enemy territory.<eos> And their only hope of survival was their last pigeon, CherAmi.<eos> And the Germans, they saw the bird take off and they opened fire.<eos> And it was hit several times, but it kept on going.<eos> And it arrived at the command post, one eye shot out, a bullet in his breast and most of the leg that had the message capsule attached missing.
Mistake? !<eos> Where there's a lot of greed, there's plenty of mistakes.<eos> No!<eos> You see, I didn't know anything.<eos> They set me up.<eos> They ruined my plan.<eos> Plan?<eos> Your plan is going to end up the same way as Karl's.<eos> Where is the money?<eos> It was in here.
"My dear and trusted colleagues..."<eos> I miss you deeply as I write from the confines of my regrettable and preposterous incarceration.<eos> Until I walk amongst you again as a free man, the Grand Budapest remains in your hands, as does its impeccable reputation.<eos> Keep it spotless and glorify it.<eos> Take extra special care of every little-bitty bit of it as if I were watching over you like a hawk with a horse whip in its talons, because I am.<eos> Should I discover a lapse of any variety during my absence, I promise, swift and merciless justice will descend upon you.<eos> A great and noble house has been placed under your protection.<eos> Tell Zero if you see any funny business.<eos> "Your devoted Monsieur Gustave."<eos> Then there's a poem, but we might want to start on the soup since it's 46 stanzas.
Soon we learned...<eos> Blessings upon you both.<eos> not only was Agatha immensely skilled with a palette knife and a butter-cream flourish...<eos> - Mendl.<eos> - Go.<eos> she was also very brave.<eos> I believe she was born that way.<eos> Something's missing.<eos> A crucial document, either misplaced or, conceivably, destroyed.<eos> I don't know what it contains, I don't know what it represents,
- Does she?<eos> - Very much.<eos> That's a good sign, you know. It means she "gets it."<eos> That's important.<eos> Don't flirt with her.<eos> A radio telegram was delivered and signed for by the girl at 4:00 AM.<eos> The envelope was found near the body, but its contents were missing.<eos> However, the telegraph office always keeps a carbon of the ticker tape for 24 hours.<eos> I copied it down.<eos> It reads as follows,
Yeah, I do.<eos> I just told you, I...<eos> You're my lady and I'm your man, baby.<eos> And that's why, if you stick with me, I can give you what you want.<eos> Baby, stop right there<eos> Let me clear the air<eos> Baby, look into these eyes Let me apologize<eos> I know what you're thinking of<eos> You're thinking, "Where's the love?"<eos> Babe, the love ain't gone It's here where it belongs
- Okay.<eos> Doing all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, it'll start to numb in just a couple minutes.<eos> The more that we can make you appear like that body the soul once inhabited, the better our chances.<eos> You feel that?<eos> - No.<eos> - Okay.<eos> The astral corpse, it wants to keep living.<eos> Living is what it knows.

There is no option but to accept their help.<eos> Asbjorn, the monk is not one of us, he is a Christian, you should rethink.<eos> Who gave us shelter?<eos> Who helped us escape?<eos> If we wanted dead, we would already be. He had many chances.<eos> The decision is yours.<eos> And I ... I'll be watching this monk.<eos> Snake Way.<eos> The peaks. Used to climb and hunt.<eos> It crosses the highlands and ends at sea.
Did you know I used gay slurs in high school?<eos> Yes, directed at me.<eos> Dude, I am so sorry for being a homophone.<eos> Are we gonna talk about how weird you were today with Dickson?<eos> Look, I don't think the tattoo means what you think it means.<eos> I mean, for all we know, a lot of people could have that tattoo.<eos> This tattoo? This absurdly specific tattoo? Name one other person who has this.<eos> For starters, Zook has it.<eos> Zook has the tattoo?<eos> I think it's pretty popular.
- Lassie.<eos> - I-I couldn't get him.<eos> It's all right.<eos> We understand.<eos> Is Vance okay?<eos> V-Mac is not okay.<eos> So you had the drop on our bad guy, and somehow, with him dead to rights, you let him get away?<eos> Look at me when I'm talking to ya.<eos> What happened to your fearless desire to die, officer?<eos> It--it's totally still there.

Correct.<eos> And you can tell this just by... hearing his voice?<eos> It's more complicated than that, but yes.<eos> What else can you tell us about the caller?<eos> Hard to be certain from the quality of the tape.<eos> Sounded like a white male-- possibly in his 30s-- from the South of Chicago, but he's tried hard to soften the accent, not unlike yourself, counselor.<eos> Now you're from where, Riverdale?<eos> When you say it's hard to tell for certain... that the tape is unclear, that it seems to be a white male--<eos> The underlying ethnicity is hard to fully hide from trained ears.<eos> - Yes, it's a good recording.
Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here ?<eos> The Arkenstone is the birthright of our people.<eos> It is the King's jewel.<eos> Am I not the King ?<eos> !<eos> Know this, if anyone should find it ... and withhold it from me ... I will be avenged.<eos> Dragon sickness ... I've seen it before.<eos> That look, the terrible need.<eos> It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo.<eos> It sent his grandfather mad.
It seems they bring good luck.<eos> You don't really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck.<eos> Magic rings should not be used lightly, Bilbo.<eos> Don't take me for a fool, I know you found one ...<eos> - No.<eos> in the Goblin tunnels, and I've kept my eye on you ... ever since.<eos> Well, thank goodness.<eos> Farewell, Gandalf.<eos> Farewell.<eos> You uhh ... you needn't worry about that ring, it fell out of my pocket during the battle.
Your eyes.<eos> - And your voice, too...<eos> - I have to leave, Father.<eos> I must go back there.<eos> This is how the dead come back to life!<eos> This is the happiest day of our lives!<eos> Calm down, you'll crush me!<eos> Did you feel something?<eos> Danger.<eos> I can feel it, it's everywhere.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Mom's gonna kill you, you know that, right?<eos> Then we'll just have to do it twice, then.<eos> I, Keith, take you, Sabine, to be my wife.<eos> My first love was everything all at once.<eos> The kind you never fall back from.<eos> Never try to.<eos> Never want to.<eos> A love so big, so strong, it never dies, never fades, never loses its electricity.
I don't expect you to help. I just wanted...<eos> If you're that worried, you should go to the police.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Claire!<eos> Hi.<eos> I want to report someone stalking me and my child.<eos> Can you tell us what happened?<eos> Somebody sent me a children's book.<eos> And?<eos> And it contained violent and graphic images of my child and me being murdered.
Where is she?<eos> Where's Nicole?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Where, where, where?<eos> A van.<eos> Where she had her fourteenth birthday<eos> Fourteenth birthday?<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Where's the van, man?<eos> Where is it?

Honey, can you get some more wine?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Joey, could you bring us a bottle of the '63 Chateau Lafleur, please?<eos> We're out.<eos> We have the 2009 Twin Oaks.<eos> That's fine. Why don't you bring us two of those?<eos> We have one.<eos> I was told I'd get everything I desire, and you guys are kind of dropping the ball on this one.<eos> Desire is everything.<eos> When it fades, life ends.
It's like you left me and changed into somebody else.<eos> Look, I'm by myself all the time.<eos> Writing is a God-awful existence.<eos> You should be grateful you blocked my creative voice.<eos> It would have been hell to live with.<eos> Wendy?<eos> Yes, Chad?<eos> I'm ready for my dessert now.<eos> Sure. Sure, Chad.<eos> What is it, honey?
Chad, please.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> I had a dream.<eos> I was as light as a bird, a spirit flying through the air, and I could see my home and my family.<eos> But then I woke up.<eos> And I was on the ground.<eos> When you step out of a dream,<eos> What you thought was real, wasn't real at all.<eos> Nothing is as bright or clear but the dream is always there.<eos> And it gives you hope that one day it will return and, if you're lucky, you'll see your friend again.
Beautification of the patient.<eos> But no less important, celebrity to be gained by the surgeon.<eos> All of what you speak of is most alluring.<eos> But the decision is not mine, it's up to Charles.<eos> Oh, very well.<eos> But you will at least help me convince him, will you not?<eos> We'll see.<eos> Excellent.<eos> I haven't devoted much time to the garden.<eos> It could be so beautiful.
He struck the machine on his leg against the wall enough to break it.<eos> Yes.<eos> Go, Charles. You must ensure the success of the operation.<eos> We'll return shortly.<eos> Well?<eos> I removed the box, but the swelling is much worse than I imagined.<eos> Perhaps it was a vulgus.<eos> What?<eos> I may have cut the wrong tendon.<eos> I'm worried that if it... does not heal properly and gangrene sets in, then we will have to amputate.

Look around.<eos> Look at everything we have.<eos> The rugs, the new curtains, the chairs.<eos> Really, Charles, look at everything.<eos> You must confess that considering the quantity, the cost isn't too dear.<eos> Those are all extravagances!<eos> I could have done without them all!<eos> But you enjoy it.<eos> - Do you not sit in your chair every day?<eos> - But I didn't need it upholstered.
Tonight's tag-team winners: John Cena and Sin Cara!<eos> Oh, Cena!<eos> Oh, my gosh, you're wonderful!<eos> Welcome, fans.<eos> You should be excited, because I am about to lay on you something very heavy:<eos> Our very own WWE Championship belt!<eos> Yes, it's solid gold, encrusted with priceless gems and jewels.<eos> But any WWE Superstar will tell you it's not about the glitter.<eos> The championship belt represents honor, respect, hard work, dedication... the very soul of WWE.<eos> As you know, ever since Kane's WWE Championship match was overturned... this championship belt has been held vacant... and so it shall remain until a true champion rises and proves himself worthy... this weekend in the main event at WrestleMania!
The creature had a mean streak a mile wide and twice as ugly.<eos> It had never been beaten, ever.<eos> Until it met... Sin Cara Grande...<eos> Sin Cara's great-great-great-grandfather.<eos> He challenged the bear on this very spot... long before there was ever a WWE City.<eos> The battle between man and bear was epic.<eos> The bear was a horrible, unstoppable beast.<eos> But when the match was over... it was the man standing victorious.<eos> The bear could not contain its anger.<eos> It unleashed its rage on the town.

Have you seen him somewhere?<eos> No.<eos> [Religious song playing on a radio].<eos> Why are you wearing this helmet?<eos> I learned from taxi, even in heavy traffic it can be spotted from long distance because of flashy yellow color.<eos> so?<eos> So it will be easy for the God also to spot me in heavy crowd.<eos> They say that animals don't suicide.<eos> Its a dog named nikku of sweeti singh who lives in ramesh nagar in delhi.<eos> it did three suicide attempts in past one month.

To Ireland.<eos> Actually, I'm not sure I'm gonna enroll in Berkeley for my master's.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, with Ben going to Harvard and everything,<eos> I thought I might just check out the east coast for a while.<eos> Really?<eos> But you've wanted to get your master's in history since you were like two, Soph.<eos> It's not like Berkeley's going anywhere, and neither is history.<eos> So, uh, is this quaint little village everything our potential historian hoped it would be?
What's your record?<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Man I'll fight anybody, okay?<eos> Listen, pretty boy, I'm pretty sure you got all kind of reasons why you wanna become a fighter, man.<eos> But if I let every kid who walked up in that office a shot in the cage, man, I'd be on a street corner somewhere begging for change from people like you.<eos> And I know you ain't got none.<eos> Yeah, but you don't understand... Look, kid!<eos> It's brave of ya, but the answer is simply no.<eos> I'll tell you what, though, since you did take the trouble of comin' all the way down here, man, here's two tickets to tonight's fight.<eos> It's gonna be a good one.
No, no, no. I just don't involve myself with any of these so-called religious organisations.<eos> Well - in your case that would probably be very wise.<eos> Best keep yourself to yourself.<eos> Take care, now, Dr. Quirke, won't you?<eos> So did you hear about this murder in Crimea Street?<eos> I'd have thought you'd know all about that yourself.<eos> Well, I know how she died but I don't know who killed her.<eos> Was it not a burglary?<eos> That's what's going about.<eos> I thought it might have been something to do with... Declan Costigan.
"But kind of helpless, too"<eos> "Love's a devil"<eos> "But a lovable devil, it is"<eos> Should I chase it away?"<eos> Or should I hold it in embrace?" "Offo!<eos> Should I chase it away?"<eos> Or should I hold it in embrace?"<eos> "Should I wield it like I'm proud?" "Or slap it away?<eos> "Look here it is... with pocketfuls of mischief"<eos> "Just like you, it's quirky too" "it's impulsive, but it's thoughtful too"
Don't even think about it.<eos> Krish, go inside.<eos> Krish, go!<eos> First tell him to leave.<eos> Krish, go to your room!<eos> Mind the glass...<eos> Just go, Krish!<eos> Every time you reconcile, he acts out again.<eos> Just let the glass be!<eos> It'll cut his feet, and he'll learn a lesson.
First, you have to discuss clothes and jewelry.<eos> Second, all women lose their tempers at the same time!<eos> So many demands already...<eos> God knows what will happen in the future!<eos> This is for you.<eos> Oh, you shouldn't have!<eos> This too.<eos> Please come! Sit!<eos> Have some chicken!<eos> It's delicious!
Christina, will you shut up!<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> You never talk to her like that.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm sorry, Jen!<eos> I got a guy who beats his wife's face in, in front of their kid, and the next day he's back home.<eos> All right. I got a lady who throws her kid into a ravine.<eos> You want another one?<eos> Last week, an alleyway off Buck Street, first call of the night,<eos> I pull a baby out of the bottom of a dumpster.<eos> I'm giving it mouth-to-mouth. It's already dead.
'But sometimes salsa just throws you out for a spin.'<eos> Oi, wanker, nice shirt.<eos> 'I don't know where I was when I fell in love with salsa.<eos> 'But I know exactly where I was when it stopped.'<eos> Who do you think you are?<eos> Barry Manilow?<eos> 'Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Nationals...'<eos> 'I never turned up that night.<eos> 'I just phoned him and told him, "Salsa's for pussies."<eos> 'And I guess that fire in my heels, 'it just went out.'
I love lathes.<eos> Oh, while I remember, we can also provide, um, promo videos.<eos> - Isn't that right, Bruce? - Mm.<eos> Actually, I think we've got one of those on this computer right here.<eos> Not on that one.<eos> Let me have a look.<eos> Yeah, I think I saw the one for the DML vertical lathe on here - somewhere the other day. - No.<eos> - Wait, there it is. Hold on. - Is it?<eos> Yeah, this is a really good example of the videos we can give you.<eos> 'Hello, with a Meehanite frame annealed for maximum rigidity, 'it offers perfect jib-bed flushing each and every time.
Well, I love questions.<eos> So you like Latin music, huh?<eos> - The mix tape.<eos> - Oh, right, the mix, yes.<eos> Oh, I am a Latino boy big time, I am, music wise.<eos> Thanks for listening to that.<eos> It was a real labour of love for me.<eos> That track at the end of side one, oh...<eos> That's my favourite track.<eos> - Isn't it just so er... tracky? - It's so...
Well, you know, I just mean you just seem like a, you know, a normal man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> More normal than ever now.<eos> How so? What's that mean?<eos> Well, I just found out this morning that I'm not shooting blanks anymore.<eos> Well, all right.<eos> Doctor's prognosis, I'm a fully fertile male specimen.<eos> Well, let me be the first to congratulate you.<eos> Welcome to the tribe.<eos> You know, sometimes I think this world deserves the shit storm that it gets.
Okay.<eos> So we have our main characters.<eos> Not quite.<eos> There is another character that was just as important as the two of us.<eos> Mmm.<eos> New York City.<eos> Ah!<eos> Mmm.<eos> So New York City is like another character? Yeah.<eos> So if there was a movie about your relationship, it would probably start with aerial shots of the Manhattan skyline.
My flight leaves in an hour.<eos> I have to leave.<eos> Wait!<eos> Molly.<eos> I love you.<eos> I don't know what you want me to say.<eos> You ran my business into the ground.<eos> No, he didn't!<eos> No, he did not.<eos> Molly, not only did Joel save your candy shop, but he also made it possible for it to flourish forever.
There has existed for 20 or 30 years now a universal declaration of animal rights.<eos> It contains ten articles.<eos> It was drafted 200 years after 1789.<eos> No one could think freely if his eyes were locked in another's gaze.<eos> As soon as gazes lock, there are no longer exactly two of us.<eos> Staying alone becomes hard.<eos> It is not animals who are blind.<eos> Man, blinded by conscience, is incapable of seeing the world.<eos> What is outside, wrote Rilke, can be known only via an animal's gaze.<eos> And Darwin, citing Buff on, maintains that the dog is the only living creature that loves you more than it loves itself.
Wolski speaking.<eos> Is that the police?<eos> I'm not at the station anymore.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Has the parcel arrived?<eos> Yes, a parcel has arrived.<eos> Have you opened it?<eos> Was I supposed to?<eos> No.<eos> It's for me.
They won't come out!<eos> It's the bird that bothers you, right?<eos> I hope you realise that this is madness.<eos> - I think it's dead.<eos> - It's faking!<eos> And where are you headed now?<eos> We could still go dancing.<eos> No kidding.<eos> What?<eos> What is it?
Drop the weapon!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> I've got him!<eos> I've got it under control!<eos> You are a coward, Lonely Wolf.<eos> - Why are you here?<eos> - What's up?<eos> What's going on?<eos> And the wolf... where did it come from?
After all we've been through, you're still fighting.<eos> Do you want a second chance?<eos> On second thought...<eos> Cut.<eos> Mr Bayu, I am Novi, the assigned reporter.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Could you set up the camera?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I've read your report on Dharma.<eos> It was sound.
He didn't recognize you.<eos> Wait, wait, wait a minute.<eos> - Let me try something.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> The feed from all the cameras, they can be generated as one signal if we cross the frequency.<eos> OK, you can see it, right?<eos> When the ping-pongs are closed together, they can build a real-time 3D model like this.<eos> It's a bag.<eos> All the cameras are inside of the bag.<eos> From the shape of the bag, it could be lying inside a trunk.

Not particularly.<eos> - How'd you know I was the mailman?<eos> - I'm not deaf.<eos> You want some chicken?<eos> No, thank you, sir.<eos> Say, what happened here?<eos> - My dog got killed.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> The blood.<eos> Where does it lead?

When I moved here, no one believed me.<eos> I hunted the beast. I went in the woods and I killed it.<eos> But it got to me first.<eos> I have tried everything and nothing works.<eos> All I want to do is live and worship and kill in solitude and die in peace!<eos> - No more killing, James. No more killing.<eos> - You have to!<eos> You have to kill what you attack.<eos> If you draw blood and you leave it alive it carries over,<eos> - it transforms with you.
Why are you unhappy?<eos> Is it something...<eos> - What am I not doing?<eos> - Otto.<eos> What happened?<eos> How did I not know?<eos> Is it because of my accident?<eos> - No, it's not. It isn't.<eos> - No.<eos> Because I know it was stupid and it's all my fault but I'm gonna be up completely soon.
Well, you just think of yourself as the biggest loser ever, right?<eos> Well...<eos> I really don't know what's happening.<eos> I just sort of... I just sort of muddle through my days, you know.<eos> And I'm...<eos> I'm stunned like you said.<eos> Well, I don't wanna scare you too badly, but divorce is hands down the worst thing I ever went through my entire life.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause no matter how horrible the marriage was...<eos> I don't even think it was that bad.

Bryan Mills is the owner of the apartment... and the ex-husband of the deceased.<eos> - Who's this?<eos> - It's me.<eos> You're on the news.<eos> I didn't do it, Sam.<eos> Obviously, you didn't do it.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm going down the rabbit hole.<eos> The code still the same? Yeah.<eos> It's still the same.
Nobody in, nobody out.<eos> "Text from your phone asking Mom to meet you...<eos> "at the Rancho Berrego the night she died.<eos> "Someone used your phone?"<eos> Call Dotzler!<eos> Santa Monica Aviation.<eos> This is Mr. St. John.<eos> I'll be there in 15 minutes.<eos> Get the plane ready.<eos> It'll be ready.
Hi.<eos> I'm Tasha. Friend of Sam's.<eos> I'm just going to use your, uh, toilet.<eos> It's just to the left.<eos> Hey, do you want a beer?<eos> I'm here to drop something off.<eos> Still, no harm in a beer, right?<eos> That's everything you need.<eos> So, um, what's the plan?<eos> Keep the phone charged, and when it rings, answer it.
That's why it's a snake. They call it a snake.<eos> THE MALOJA CLOUD PHENOMENON .<eos> FORBIDDING,<eos> THE CLOUDS RISE ABOVE THE MALOJA PASS.<eos> THE SO-CALLED MALOJA SNAKE.<eos> Wilhelm was fascinated by this film.<eos> He used to marvel at the fact that the true nature of the landscape, revealed itself in these images.<eos> The black and white creates a distance, sets the passing of time.<eos> It's almost a century old.<eos> Actually, it comes from very far away,
- When?<eos> - Next week.<eos> Where?<eos> Wherever you want, she'll come here, if you like.<eos> Maybe I'll tell her to book the Waldhaus.<eos> - When's the movie opening?<eos> - It opened last week.<eos> Have you read a paper lately?<eos> I'm sorry, you wanted one?<eos> It's playing in St. Moritz if you wanna see it.
Cruelly.<eos> - Okay, cruelly.<eos> - Yeah, cruelly, because she's up to no good.<eos> You're not in that character's skin, you...<eos> I have no choice, I have to be them,<eos> I have to identify with them, it's funny, I feel it... viscerally.<eos> It can be... literary, but still be true.<eos> I can feel the difference, I can hear it.<eos> Maria, we gotta go, sun's about to go down.<eos> I know a shortcut a little further up, it's steep, but it'll take us straight to Val Fex.
You want me to show you?<eos> Come here.<eos> This is the bend we just went around, 10 minutes ago, and just around there is the view of the valley.<eos> - See that?<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Pain in the ass! Jesus Christ!<eos> I don't know why you're so dead-set on making this play say the opposite of what it was meant to say.<eos> At 20, you saw Sigrid's ambition and you saw her violence because you felt this in yourself.<eos> - So, what I'm saying... it... this text is like an object.<eos> it's gonna change perspective based on where you're standing.
In the real Shalimar, there is an outer laser shield which is 12000 volts.<eos> The codes to this outer laser shield are changed everyday!<eos> Who's going to stop this electric current now?<eos> My father?<eos> But he never went to Dubai did he.<eos> Hey you listen, Don't go on my dad!<eos> GUYS" guys" Nandu?<eos> - Sorry!<eos> The laser-shield is computerized.<eos> So it will be hacko-fied!

Where here?<eos> ♪ ♪ Here.<eos> Tow to. ♪<eos> No, no.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> This is Tattoo, and I said "tow to" as in "tow your car."<eos> This is a funny language miscommunication.<eos> I can't get out here because I don't nave my money.<eos> It's in my purse, which is in my car.
Don't do it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, you be good.<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> What?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> No, I...<eos> No. Take this.<eos> Pookie, I can't take your crack.<eos> It's worth about $10 on the street.

I have everything I need here in my wee bag.<eos> Are we going to witness an explosion?<eos> Oh, goodness me! No, I hope not.<eos> I'm astounded you have all your paraphernalia - contained in yon small pouch.<eos> - Indeed it is, Mr Turner.<eos> Everything except God's good sunlight.<eos> Daddy, Mrs Somerville is a natural philosopher.<eos> - Is she, now? - Mathematician, astronomer, geologist.<eos> The universe is a wondrous thing, is it not, Mr Turner?<eos> It is, to be sure.
- Good morning to you, Mr Leslie. - Rabbie.<eos> - Good morning, Mr Turner.<eos> My other piece, where is it located?<eos> - We placed it in the anteroom.<eos> - The anteroom.<eos> - Mr Carew!<eos> - Stanny.<eos> - Is it for His Majesty?<eos> - Indeed.<eos> - I hope it meets his expectations.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir, for your charity.<eos> - Haydon?<eos> - You have been most kind.<eos> Most kind in your placement.<eos> You have finished me.<eos> You might as well have taken my painting and put it in the outhouse.<eos> Better yet, taken it out of this building and thrown it in the Fleet.<eos> Haydon, I am hard... hard set - to understand your indignation. - And as for you, my pupil...<eos> Your painting, sir, is hanging next-door to that of Mr Turner.<eos> - It is in fine company. - This is treachery!
- Good day to you, Mrs Booth. - Good day to you, sir.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> My father and I are marvelling at this glorious work.<eos> Er... might I be correct in remembering that we had the good fortune of viewing it at the Academy last summer?<eos> Indeed.<eos> Well, I must say, it is no less impressive on its second viewing.<eos> Perhaps even more so.<eos> Is it not, Father?<eos> Indeed so.<eos> I recall it provoked much heated and stimulating discussion long after our viewing.

What is this heinous implement?<eos> Merely a gentle holding brace, sir.<eos> Puts me in mind of a surgical instrument.<eos> - Does it hurt?<eos> - Not in the slightest, I assure you.<eos> So, if I may...<eos> Not too uncomfortable for you, Mr Booth?<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> What is the significance of the looking-glass?<eos> It is to illuminate your good self, sir.
"By thy bosom so throbbing with truth<eos> "Its short heavings to me...<eos> speak reproof<eos> "By the half-blushing mark on each hill<eos> "Oh, my Molly, dear Molly, be still."<eos> There.<eos> What ails thee?<eos> Let me take your hat.<eos> - My sketchbook.<eos> - It's not here.

Fiorello.<eos> 718-555-4377.<eos> Does that sound about right?<eos> 41 Ocean Avenue, Howard Beach?<eos> Oh, you fancy, huh?<eos> Listen, you got some crazy fucking list, you know what I'm saying?<eos> And I got it. And that's what I am trying to explain to you.<eos> I got a fucking P.O. box.<eos> Yeah, and in that P.O. box, I got a will.<eos> And in that will it says you better not fucking mess with me or my man, you understand me?
She wants real food.<eos> She will get what the doctor ordered.<eos> But Mom!<eos> She doesn't like it!<eos> Momma!<eos> So, here's your baby back.<eos> And there is the tekkamaki.<eos> It's sushi.<eos> My dad FedEx'd me the fish from New York.<eos> It's a little undercooked, son.
Tonight, every talent from every season will gather together to celebrate all the realms of Pixie Hollow.<eos> Wow!<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> Everyone in Pixie Hollow is here!<eos> It's so great to have the Winter Fairies join us.<eos> I'll say it is.<eos> It's enough to give you the vapors.<eos> Tinker Bell, don't you Tinkers ever stop tinkering?<eos> Can't seem to get this latch to open!<eos> It had better not stick like that for our grand finale.
It's enough to give you the vapors.<eos> Tinker Bell, don't you Tinkers ever stop tinkering?<eos> Can't seem to get this latch to open!<eos> It had better not stick like that for our grand finale.<eos> - Is it starting?<eos> - No, that's just Clank.<eos> The thing is pretty loud, eh, Bobble?<eos> Indeed, my bugling buddy.<eos> Sure makes me thirsty, though.<eos> It's starting!
I'm moving closer to campus.<eos> Why?<eos> Look at this dump.<eos> It's ridiculous.<eos> Looks like I'm still in grad school.<eos> Well, did you already find a place?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's great.<eos> And they'll let me move in on the 15th.<eos> Well, where is it?
- Do you want to write songs?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> What are we talking about?<eos> About the fact that the most idiotic thing that anyone has ever said is that if you just put your mind to it and believe in yourself, there is nothing you can't accomplish.<eos> I say that!<eos> Does that make me an idiot?<eos> No, no, not you.<eos> Other people.<eos> How can I make my script better?<eos> Right, well, it could be more... Organised.
- Why would I go near him?<eos> Well...<eos> Yes, of course... you're right.<eos> Why would you?<eos> Forgive me. But...<eos> Oh, my poor girl.<eos> We don't belong here at all.<eos> We'll go home to Denmark soon.<eos> I love the desert.<eos> I like how it fills me.
I've heard a lot of far-fetched things about Zuluaga since I got here.<eos> Do you know what I think?<eos> He was an unpredictable officer.<eos> Don't you agree?<eos> No.<eos> Come on, Lieutenant. Calm down.<eos> This is no time to get upset.<eos> We should be relaxing and enjoying ourselves now.<eos> Are you going to the ball the Minister of War is giving?<eos> They say it'll be very elaborate.
Yeah I do.<eos> Listen I've got this um book.<eos> I really want you to check out.<eos> Which book?<eos> - You read Voltaire much?<eos> - I've heard of him.<eos> Now well... It's called Candide...<eos> Classic Voltaire.<eos> Highly regarded as one of his greatest works.<eos> What's it about?
No, can't say I have.<eos> Not even a little bit?<eos> No not even a little bit.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know Percival, I just haven't.<eos> Hypothetically speaking... say you believed in fate.<eos> That everything has a purpose, that everything happens for a reason.<eos> Where the fuck is this book?<eos> Why do you think Annie died?<eos> It was here two fucking days ago, I swear to God.
Mad about or...<eos> Always watch out for her, won't you?<eos> Yes, of course I will.<eos> -Thank you. -I'll get this.<eos> -No, no, let me get this, please.<eos> This was my idea.<eos> -You can get the next one.<eos> -All right.<eos> -I like your hat, by the way.<eos> It's new.
I'm not checking up on you!<eos> Do you not think I might just like seeing you from time to time?<eos> Not really, no.<eos> I was going to ask you to come to the Society of Corpus Christi dinner with me.<eos> No, listen, there's no mass or prayers or anything.<eos> It's a charity bash.<eos> Few dances, few speeches, we'll have a laugh.<eos> Sarah and I went every year.<eos> I just... ..don't want to go on my own.<eos> It's usually crawling with spinsters and widows.
My father carried James Connolly out of the GPO after the surrender.<eos> He shared a cell with Eamon De Valera.<eos> He lost his friends, family, everything to free this country.<eos> Whereas uncle Bill, I'm sure you know... ..people don't respect him as much as they did my father.<eos> He never said anything about the blood. -What blood?<eos> -The blood that we found<eos> -beside April's bed. -What kind of blood?<eos> April's kind.<eos> Why didn't you say anything?<eos> Because up to now we didn't know whose it was.
No.<eos> I just... I don't want a hug.<eos> You know, something that helped us was, um... we did something together that, um, helped her purge emotionally.<eos> I don't know if I want to hear<eos> - about your ex-wife's purging, Zach.<eos> Laughter yoga.<eos> It's really good.<eos> You'll like it.<eos> You start with fake laughter.<eos> It turns into real laughter, and it helps suppress all of your stress hormones.
Please, tell me we're not stuck like this.<eos> No, no, we just need a little more time.<eos> Listen, listen, i-it's my kid's birthday today, okay?<eos> And I wasn't even supposed to be onsite, okay?<eos> Oh, no, someone has to pick her up from school!<eos> No, it's-it's gonna be okay.<eos> We'll have a nurse call her mother.<eos> No no, she's not in the picture, okay?<eos> You got to... you got to try my sister, okay?<eos> And her number... it's in my phone, okay?
What happened?<eos> Ah.<eos> Um, my girlfriend... wife, actually.<eos> We got married tonight.<eos> Wow.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Uh, guess I'm her "something blue."<eos> She climbed a fence after jumping out of our taxi.<eos> While it was moving?
She'll need 100 milligrams of phenytoin, no more than 50 a minute.<eos> God is our refuge and strength, always ready to help in times of trouble, so we will not fear, even if earthquakes come and mountains crumble into the sea.<eos> Another doctor?<eos> Yes.<eos> We're trying to figure out what's wrong with your wife.<eos> Hmm.<eos> She had a tonic-clonic seizure.<eos> Okay.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> If her brain continues to seize, it will eventually wear out and start shutting down.
Go.<eos> Any medications?<eos> - Statin. It's for high cholesterol.<eos> - Statin's okay.<eos> Have you ever been under a general anesthetic?<eos> Yes, and no complications.<eos> I think that's enough questions, yeah?<eos> Oh, he's just going through the checklist, sir... which, legend has it, you wrote.<eos> Great to see you, Thomas.<eos> Hey. Now get this appendix the hell out of me before it blows.
Lie? Yes.<eos> What if they don't believe me?<eos> Play to your strength.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Now, what is my strength?<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> Plead rookie mistake.<eos> They'll cut you some slack.<eos> Is that my pen?<eos> It's old, but still producing ink.
- Oh, I'm good now. - Mm-hmm.<eos> You're a right miracle worker, aren't you?<eos> You got my last miracle.<eos> That's all you're getting.<eos> You'll be in my prayers.<eos> I'm sure I will.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Hey, I'm Dr. Goran.<eos> Hey, Chief.<eos> What is it?
Mina, I've asked politely, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> The coq au vin is almost done.<eos> Excellent.<eos> To the dining room.<eos> Nothing like a nice merlot to take the edge off.<eos> Cheers, everyone.<eos> Mina, this wine is awful.<eos> It's been cooked.<eos> It tastes like it was sunning in a moldy basement.
If there's any ferrous metal anywhere inside your body, the magnetic field will put it out, and forcibly.<eos> In our last class, I was asked a question that I couldn't answer.<eos> As Professor Radisson pointed out,<eos> Stephen Hawking is an atheist. He also wrote a book called "The Grand Design"<eos> in which he says the following:<eos> "Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing."<eos> And to be honest, I didn't know how to refute that.<eos> I mean, after all, Hawking is clearly a genius.<eos> But, Professor John Lennox, who teaches mathematics and philosophy has demonstrated that there are not one, even two, but three errors of logic contained in that one simple sentence, and it all boils down to circular reasoning.<eos> Hawking is basically saying that the universe exists because the universe needed to exist, and because the universe needed to exist, it therefore created itself.
What happened to you?<eos> When a 12-year-old watches his mother dying of cancer, it's only natural to beg God for her life.<eos> He'll promise anything to his make-believe grandfather in the sky, including to love and worship him forever, if only he will spare her.<eos> Sometimes the answer is no.<eos> Tell that to me the day you lose someone you love.<eos> She died believing a lie.<eos> She died believing that someone out there loved her even while he was strangling her to death.<eos> A God who would allow that is not worth believing in.<eos> That is why, Wheaton, you will find the most committed atheists were once Christians, but we took the blinders off.<eos> We saw the world for what it truly is.
Those days haunt me. The days before they took us away.<eos> Those last days in our homeland.<eos> I'm haunted by that decision that I made on behalf of the rest of our family.<eos> It seems that the years have taken everything else with them...<eos> I still think of those letters we sent to our relatives.<eos> I'm looking at our free wild apple tree now.<eos> The hay around it is chest-high.<eos> Its branches no longer look towards the sky.<eos> Instead they droop towards the ground.<eos> Does it long to enter the soil where its roots are hidden or does it still hope to burst into bloom?
So Pinocchio is like, going down on his girlfriend, like, eating her pussy, you know?<eos> I know this joke, Tony.<eos> I mean, Pinocchio is down there eating pussy.<eos> I mean, he's down there eating and licking it all up and she goes:<eos> "Oh yeah, oh yeah, eat that pussy, Pinocchio!<eos> Come on, get it!"<eos> I think you got the joke wrong.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yeah, she's supposed to say, "Lie to me, lie to me. "<eos> See, 'cause see... His nose grows and it goes in her vagina.
"Oh yeah, oh yeah, eat that pussy, Pinocchio!<eos> Come on, get it!"<eos> I think you got the joke wrong.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yeah, she's supposed to say, "Lie to me, lie to me. "<eos> See, 'cause see... His nose grows and it goes in her vagina.<eos> That's... No, no, no, no.<eos> You ruined it... That's not the joke.<eos> Yes it is because... when Pinocchio lies, his nose gets bigger.<eos> It goes up...
Third person!<eos> I start off with a nice circular motion and then I pick up speed.<eos> And then kablowy.<eos> Kablowy... You come like Batman?<eos> Very nice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, a little sign shoots out of my dick.<eos> Right into Robin's mouth.<eos> You need to tell us, where does the dildo go?<eos> Oh, it stays in the drawer.
It's not gay.<eos> Oh, it's pretty gay.<eos> No it's not.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's the point.<eos> That's pretty gay.<eos> If I was gay, I'd just ram that jolly dildo right up my stupid asshole.<eos> Thatta girl.<eos> It's because I'm straight and I know that I got this big black dildo in my desk drawer...<eos> Oh, it's black.
How fast can this thing go?<eos> Oh, you can play double or triple speeds, but that's for the experts.<eos> As fast as you can.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Congratulations!<eos> You're a winner!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come on, you owe him a dollar.<eos> There it is!<eos> It's beautiful!
You've made something of yourself out here.<eos> You know, a lot of people can't say that.<eos> You're a good sheep farmer.<eos> Oh, my God, please.<eos> I suck at sheep.<eos> Louise was right. I can't keep track of them.<eos> There was a sheep in the whorehouse last week.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wandered in there, and then when I went to pick it up, somehow, it had made $20.
She could learn English.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I've been thinking about putting my mum in a sheltered home.<eos> I've been reading about this place.<eos> It's really interesting.<eos> The decor is made to look like the '50s and '60s so the elderly can feel younger.<eos> It takes them back to, like, a younger, happier time.
The restaurant owner swore at us, but never fed us<eos> How do I calm my belly?<eos> Wait a minute<eos> Brother, how much for the coal?<eos> 10kgs for 2 rupees<eos> That's a lot<eos> The market price<eos> The price will fall today<eos> - Come Where to?<eos> The coal once saved our lives it'll feed us now
To cause a rift between us<eos> No point in going over the past<eos> Let's plan our next move<eos> The law will help us<eos> So it'll be on our side?<eos> There is law and order and a system here<eos> Like hell there is!<eos> What law and order and system do you mean?<eos> The system only grabs<eos> It snatched away our childhood and put guns in our hands

Oh, I see.<eos> You saw something you liked and you wanted to sample the merchandise.<eos> No, it's not like that at all.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You're right. You don't understand.<eos> Then help me.<eos> - I'm going to go.<eos> - Kylie...<eos> I only brought it up because I don't want it to be an issue moving forward.<eos> Porn is not what it used to be, okay?
Okay, Hazel Grace?<eos> Okay!<eos> What's in your nose?<eos> Jackie!<eos> I'm really sorry about that.<eos> No, it's totally fine.<eos> It's called a "cannula." And it helps me breathe.<eos> See this little friend right here?<eos> He feeds oxygen through your tube.<eos> Will it help me breath, too?
But I believe in these writers, and the show has never gotten a fair shake.<eos> I say we give it one more chance.<eos> That's my truth.<eos> And it never got a fair shake why?<eos> Because it's... it's opposite that stupid talking dog.<eos> Anything against it is gonna get buried.<eos> Explain to me why that's a hit.<eos> Seriously, what the fuck?<eos> So it's a dog that talks.<eos> It says funny things.
Her or me?<eos> You.<eos> I'd rather not say.<eos> Beverly, I'd like to try an exercise.<eos> All right.<eos> If your vagina could speak to Sean right now, what would it say to him?<eos> If my vagina could speak, we'd be having an entirely different set of problems.<eos> I sense your discomfort.<eos> But, please.<eos> I suppose, if it could speak it would want him to know...
If "pucks" was half this good, you'd still be on the air.<eos> Flattered and hurt.<eos> You guys, it's so good!<eos> I swear, if you let us do it, we won't change a word.<eos> Really?<eos> Could you put that in writing?<eos> What are you doing? No, no, no.<eos> Let me be absolutely clear with you, and you, Mr. club sandwich...<eos> This script isn't going to you.<eos> It isn't going to fox.

Not with me.<eos> I've also got Carol rance here.<eos> Kim wants to come over, too.<eos> No! This is fun.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll call back if anything changes.<eos> Nothing is going to change.<eos> Aren't you going to get that?<eos> We never use that phone.<eos> It came with the house.
As the Genpou family butler, what would I do if I could not accomplish something of this level?<eos> Of course you too must have noticed...<eos> Rotten butler that you are.<eos> Then, you know the brand of the wine too?<eos> Château Bonheur of year 75.<eos> Find the distribution route of the cigar and wine.<eos> They're both famous brands.<eos> As you command.<eos> High class club?<eos> While it looks like a common club house from the outside, there is an underground venue available to selected members only.
Are vast and ever changing, and our task is to meet them.<eos> With respect, no man can meet infinite demand.<eos> The king's commands are not infinite, De Ville.<eos> They are the king's commands.<eos> Well, quite so, but the aqueduct can only do so much.<eos> When we began construction, I was under the impression that...<eos> The past is history.<eos> Our task is to suppress nature to our will, according to the present plans.<eos> But, monsieur, the money being spent.<eos> The aqueduct will carry sufficient water to the gardens of Versailles because it must.
Delighted.<eos> But the mystery remains, madame.<eos> What is a woman of such restrained sophistication doing with Nolly here?<eos> I speak from the opposite end of the fashion scale.<eos> I don't apologize for it, I like it about myself.<eos> Answer, madame.<eos> Stop me talking.<eos> It was the only thing I knew how to do, for money.<eos> And you enjoy your profession?<eos> It stimulates you?

Having all read Huckleberry Finn, can anyone tell me what "the good lie" means?<eos> Huck uses lies to survive in undesirable situations.<eos> Exactly.<eos> But later in the book, the lies change.<eos> How so?<eos> They change because Huck changes.<eos> Yes. Keep going.<eos> When he tells the slave hunters that he has no slaves, his lie is credible.<eos> So he lies well.<eos> But what is more important... is that it is an unselfish lie, because it saves Jim.
- This?<eos> A lion.<eos> - I'm serious, a lion. - Okay.<eos> Yeah, it was a lion.<eos> From Africa.<eos> Come on.<eos> The smell of this lion was very sweet like rain.<eos> That was a surprise to me.<eos> He put his mouth onto the leg of my brother.<eos> I tried to pull the lion off... but it clawed me.
No.<eos> She was nice.<eos> My mom used to say that I was born pissed off and Kelly was born chipper.<eos> "Chipper"?<eos> Happy.<eos> She was always happy.<eos> I used to tease her. I used to call her Chipper.<eos> She hated it.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Oh, she got cancer two years ago, and... it just ripped through her like a firestorm.
- You're a funny guy.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> He's publishing a novel.<eos> Here. Read it.<eos> When you're done, call Paris Première for the interview.<eos> - When's it for?<eos> - Yesterday.<eos> Great!<eos> You see, there were two lines and a sheet stuck on it...<eos> It's a series of collages, but it's hard to explain.
Mr President, good evening.<eos> Thank you for inviting us here, to your office, from where you've governed France for 12 years.<eos> Before we start, I have a sensitive question for you.<eos> I would like you to answer as frankly as possible.<eos> François Mitterrand, was there, between 1983 and 1986, a phone-tapping cell here?<eos> I'm astounded you've begun the debate on such matters.<eos> If I'd known you'd fall so low, I wouldn't have agreed.<eos> It's my duty as a journalist to ask you.<eos> If I'd known you were like that...<eos> I don't need to waste my time on such matters. It's a fabricated controversy, and nothing to do with me.
"The Mature Man's Guide to Style..."<eos> My God, do not move.<eos> Hold that up right now.<eos> "...for a man's best years."<eos> Just pose with the cover, please?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Would you like to hear the section on hairclips?<eos> How's your book, Ben?<eos> It's good, it'll be done soon.<eos> Is it better, or worse than your New Yorker story?
My God, do not move.<eos> Hold that up right now.<eos> "...for a man's best years."<eos> Just pose with the cover, please?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Would you like to hear the section on hairclips?<eos> How's your book, Ben?<eos> It's good, it'll be done soon.<eos> Is it better, or worse than your New Yorker story?<eos> It is without a doubt longer.
- That's his name.<eos> - Hey, I just thought of something.<eos> - What?<eos> I told Siri earlier how much I loved your place, and that all you guys were missing was a dog, and now, one appears.<eos> You have your chance.<eos> We're not getting a dog.<eos> - Siri, it's not a dog. It's Timmy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> "I'm not just a dog. I need a house. And I like you guys the best."<eos> You guys have that little backyard. It could run back and forth. Yeah.
I'm not gonna play this game with you.<eos> I got to go through. Really.<eos> Get back.<eos> - A dragon.<eos> - No, it's not a dragon. It's a...<eos> It's a Xiangliu.<eos> Mythical snake demon.<eos> It looks like a dragon.<eos> I say we kill it.<eos> No, it's asleep.
Thanks, buddy.<eos> - He recognized you.<eos> - Yeah, that was awesome.<eos> Give me the tablet!<eos> Stay back! Stay back.<eos> - Stand back! - Whoa!<eos> Back!<eos> - Your nose, it's...<eos> - What about my nose?<eos> Your nose is dripping. - What? - It's melting.
Yet, he's still handsome.<eos> No one shall look at, or mention, my nose from this moment forward!<eos> I'm sorry, I forgot what we were talking about.<eos> We've run out of time.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You got to straighten the pieces.<eos> Straighten the pieces right now or they're all gonna die!<eos> You too!<eos> A world without Camelot is not a world worth living in.<eos> Dexter, what is it?
No, leave that one open.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I am Samuel Lever, and you know what that means: I have the finest machines from California to New York City!<eos> Refurbished, replenished, retooled, rerouted, but not retired!<eos> All guaranteed by me.<eos> Don't need no warranty, take a good old look and see.<eos> Selling starts in two minutes, not three.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, one day the water is going to come back.<eos> It is the reason we have all stayed behind in this God-forsaken land.<eos> It's not hope, it's certainty, and when that day comes, you are going to need this equipment.<eos> It will never be cheaper, and when the rains come, it will make you the kings and queens you know you are.
Out of the dusty earth.<eos> The things that we have complained about for their brutal consistency can now be seen as good graces and fair working conditions.<eos> In a few moments, this tributary will distribute its life sustaining gifts on this small piece of land.<eos> I raise these scissors in thanks to the state water works.<eos> Who thankfully reversed their decision to run an irriduct to st.<eos> Walstan.<eos> It's been a long time since we've seen such an act of peace and brotherhood around here.<eos> For this, we are sincerely grateful.<eos> Let us say a prayer.<eos> That this piece of land, small as it may be, can be more than a symbol.

Yes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> God damn vultures heading west again.<eos> They'll eat all our new seed.<eos> This thing don't fire straight.<eos> Piece of shit.<eos> Who knew about you.<eos> You're messing with my sights, cheater?<eos> Lucky shot.<eos> It is off.
"Bring the safe."<eos> Gabriel. I'm so glad you're here.<eos> Now I know we're gonna find him.<eos> What was in the safe?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Just dad's laptop. The computer was in the safe?<eos> Yeah. He was real paranoid about his memoirs.<eos> He's been dictating them for months.<eos> He said it was easier to talk to a cat, so I made the recorder voice-activated, even had it auto-upload to his laptop.

I can't wait. Lily.<eos> I'd rather be in your shoes than hers.<eos> Meet s.I.D. Synergetic interlocution device.<eos> The only one of it's kind in the world.<eos> Syna... what?<eos> Synergetic interlocution.<eos> - In English? - Well...<eos> Greek, originally.<eos> But I felt the Latin equivalent of dialogue had more connotations...<eos> What does it do?
Your eyes see it, but your head can't make no sense of it.<eos> And we go in there...<eos> And for three whole days, we shoot the wounded horses.<eos> All day long.<eos> Sunup to sundown, just shooting horses.<eos> And they were some hot summer days.<eos> I ain't never smelt nothing like that' top.<eos> Do you know how you kill a horse?<eos> Pet it on the forehead, no?<eos> And it becomes your friend, it goes like this.
Parrish's ship?<eos> You found the schedule?<eos> Ma'am.<eos> She's gone.<eos> She's gone?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> One of the whores helped her past the guards.<eos> She said Max had a boat waiting.<eos> I went to check.<eos> It's no longer there.
Good.<eos> A pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bahari.<eos> And it's a pleasure, sir.<eos> HAJ: I hope your time here has not been too unpleasant.<eos> Well, the nature of prison is...<eos> It's prison, right? Yes.<eos> Please.<eos> Yes.<eos> As you know, the discipline of media espionage is a new one.<eos> Oh, yes, it is everywhere.
One type ladle, a little shabby.<eos> I do not know, me ... religious must lead by example, right?<eos> Especially in the countryside.<eos> Perhaps I should write about that?<eos> Just thinking about it, it gives me the creeps.<eos> Yes, write about what you want.<eos> More ... it would not be better to write for a major newspaper instead of that rag?<eos> With all the evil that you give yourself ...<eos> I do not feel give me harm.<eos> I do not know, I see you pat all week on your computer, I think ... if you do not pricked me this journal I do not even know it exists.
But who reads this newspaper?<eos> Who buys it?<eos> Sorry, my dear Necla, I disagree.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I get sometimes letters from readers that strengthen me in what I do.<eos> Despite all the evil that I give myself, as you say, I think it is worth it.<eos> - For example, yesterday ...<eos> - Yes, but sometimes on the internet I see very bad authors get to extol.<eos> Everyone has his little fan club.<eos> It should not take that seriously.
But nobody thought wrong.<eos> The boy made a mistake.<eos> He took it badly what happened.<eos> But it's a kid.<eos> Of course.<eos> You asked why he did that?<eos> Because this incident ... could have serious consequences.<eos> Of course, I asked him.<eos> So what?<eos> In fact, Mr. Aydin, it was very marked by the seizure.
When I was little, I did not like that.<eos> But now I love wasabi.<eos> How cold!<eos> I'm frozen to the bone.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Where is Aydin?<eos> I do not know.<eos> Perhaps the village.<eos> It is not in his office?
Oh, my God! Are there snakes here?<eos> Oh, yeah. There's rattlers, there's serpents, there's cobrinhas, which are tiny little cobras.<eos> Fuck, no!<eos> Okay, no, it's just a sign that was blowing in the wind.<eos> That was a bad example.<eos> But shit is fucking crazy out here, man.<eos> Look around. What town are you in? Town?<eos> Um... Shit, I don't know. I don't know.<eos> Uh... Okay, there's a sign.<eos> It says... It says "Mexico" on it. Mexico.
You have a degree in psychology, Miss Mars.<eos> What do you think that says about a person?<eos> Compulsive, clearly.<eos> Addictive personality.<eos> Possible adrenaline junkie.<eos> But that's not me anymore.<eos> I haven't worked a case since I transferred to Stanford.<eos> And why is that?<eos> The price was too high.<eos> It ruined friendships and relationships.
Meanwhile, this is my 11th client in the past six months claiming that the sheriff's department planted contraband on them.<eos> You have a serial number on that gun?<eos> So if we're to believe this police report Weevil left the reunion, dropped off his foxy wife and his "Most Changed" trophy and, still wearing his dress shirt and slacks teamed up with the motorcycle gang he left a decade ago to harass the richest divorcee in Southern California?<eos> Well, when you say it like that, I start to see some holes in it.<eos> I'm gonna talk to some of those gang kids. See if any will come forward.<eos> See if there's a Beretta registered to Celeste Kane.<eos> I have this.<eos> It's my case.<eos> You already have a job.<eos> It's in New York.
I promise you they will.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Christ. One week without a ship and you go completely to hell.<eos> Is it too much to ask that you not pick a fight over every insult thrown our way?<eos> Especially when I'm out there swallowing what little pride I have left trying to set things right.<eos> I see we've graduated to opium.<eos> Miss Guthrie has dealt us quite a blow.<eos> But we still have assets.<eos> Eight loyal men, my wits, and an unshakable captain.<eos> I'm doing what I can to regain us our livelihood, but once that's done, this crew, such as it is, will need its captain back.
MUSIC STOPS<eos> I am composing.<eos> You were dancing.<eos> I was road-testing.<eos> You what?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I'm bringing you your morning tea.<eos> You're not usually awake.<eos> You bring me tea in the morning?<eos> Well, where do you think it came from?
Still, free bar, wouldn't have been a good mix.<eos> Oh. God, wow!<eos> Is that...?<eos> He came.<eos> So that's him, Major Sholto. Uh-huh.<eos> If they're such good friends, why does he barely even mention him?<eos> He mentions him all the time to me, never shuts up about him.<eos> About HIM? Mm-hmm.<eos> Urgh!<eos> I chose this wine, it's bloody awful!
Describe him.<eos> Short blonde hair.<eos> Dark hair. Long.<eos> Ginger.<eos> I like gingers.<eos> Couldn't tell.<eos> He had a mask on.<eos> He's stealing the identity of corpses, getting their names from the obituary columns.<eos> All single men.<eos> He's using the dead man's flat under the assumption it will be empty for a while.
I couldn't imagine life out of this uniform.<eos> I suppose, given the circumstances, I don't have to.<eos> When so many want you dead, it hardly seems good manners to argue.<eos> Whatever you're doing in there, James, stop it, right now!<eos> I will kick this door down!<eos> Mr Holmes, you and I are similar, I think.<eos> Yes, I think we are.<eos> There's a proper time to die, isn't there?<eos> Of course there is.<eos> And one should embrace it when it comes.
Thank you.<eos> OK, everybody, just dance, don't be shy.<eos> Dancing, please.<eos> Very good.<eos> Sorry, that was one more deduction than I was really expecting.<eos> Deduction?<eos> Increased appetite...<eos> I'm starving.<eos> Change of taste perception.<eos> Oh, I chose this wine, but it's bloody awful!
Are you doing a mime? Go.<eos> Or I'll cut you.<eos> Oh, not from there.<eos> Let me help.<eos> Now, concentrate.<eos> OK, you asked for it.<eos> Are you concentrating yet?<eos> You broke my arm!<eos> No, I sprained it.<eos> It feels squishy.
Oh, that's him, isn't it?<eos> You said he'd be taller.<eos> Some members of your little fan club.<eos> Do be polite.<eos> They're entirely trustworthy and even willing to search through the toxic waste dump that you are pleased to call a flat.<eos> You're a celebrity these days, Sherlock.<eos> You can't afford a Dr.ug habit.<eos> - I do not have a Dr.ug habit.<eos> - Hey, what happened to my chair?<eos> It was blocking my view to the kitchen.
One of his rivals. He was spitting.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Sherlock Holmes, you are a back-stabbing, heartless, manipulative bastard.<eos> And you, as it turns out, are a grasping, opportunistic, publicity-hungry, tabloid whore.<eos> So, we're good then?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Where's the cottage?<eos> Sussex Downs.<eos> Nice.<eos> It's gorgeous.
I've been thinking about you.<eos> Really?<eos> I want to see Appledore.<eos> Where you keep all the secrets, all the files, everything you've got on everyone.<eos> I want you to invite me.<eos> What makes you think I'd be so careless?<eos> Oh, I think you're a lot more careless than you let on.<eos> Am I?<eos> It's the dead-eyed stare that gives it away.<eos> Except it's not dead-eyed, is it?
Merry Christmas!<eos> 'Man down, man down.'<eos> Get away from me, John! Stay well back!<eos> Do not fire on Sherlock Holmes!<eos> Do not fire!<eos> Give my love to Mary.<eos> Tell her she's safe now.<eos> What have you done?<eos> As my colleague is fond of remarking, this country sometimes needs a blunt instrument.<eos> Equally, it sometimes needs a dagger, a scalpel wielded with precision and without remorse.
Could be a pavement artist.<eos> Piss artist more like.<eos> Yes, well, there but for the grace of God.<eos> What? Saying I could be a tramp?<eos> Don't use that word, Tom.<eos> What, tramp?<eos> Yes. It's insulting.<eos> It's like gypsy or half-caste.<eos> You can't say it.<eos> Well, whatever it is, I don't like it.
Nobody owns the air.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, if you want the air, you can have it...<eos> This is what you want! Stop, stop!<eos> Isn't it? ! Is this what you want?<eos> Is it? ! Stop it!<eos> Get down off the sofa, Graham.<eos> Give the balloon to Tamsin.<eos> It's her birthday.<eos> It belongs to her.
Tell me what's wrong!<eos> There's something, I don't know, like...<eos> Who the fuck is crying on vacation day?<eos> - What's goin' on?<eos> - What did you do to her?<eos> No, I didn't do anything.<eos> Listen, there's a beaver in the bathroom.<eos> That's really great news, haven't you been looking for beavers since we got here?<eos> No, no, there was something wrong with it.<eos> It was fucking rabid or something.
Then again I've never seen a real beaver before up close so...<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Well, maybe you should try going down on me once in a while, Buck.<eos> That was not a normal beaver.<eos> I can tell you that much.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Normal beavers have pupils in their goddam eyes, don't they?<eos> Fucking chicks, come on.<eos> The beaver obviously had something.<eos> Wait, I mean, did it bite anyone?
- Just take your fucking shirt off.<eos> Calm down.<eos> You fucking bitch!<eos> Fuck!<eos> All right.<eos> Come on, come on, come on!<eos> They're fucking everywhere!<eos> Oh, the truck!<eos> The truck.<eos> It was still running, last time I checked.
We talked about this.<eos> Save some of that stuff for your Times interview.<eos> Times? Fuck the Times.<eos> You act like you've never had a bad review before.<eos> I could take one, but every one?<eos> "Every one," really?<eos> Come on, man. Look at this shit.<eos> "Andre Allen is the most pathetic character in cinema today.<eos> "If he ever put out another movie,<eos> "I would not see it if it was playing in my glasses."
You a real journalist, or like Miss Detroit?<eos> Funny.<eos> Look, they just told me that you're gonna be doing this.<eos> I'm sorry if I'm late.<eos> Congratulations on the wedding.<eos> And the movie.<eos> You know, some friends and I saw you a few years back at Purchase.<eos> You were really great.<eos> Thank you very much for doing this interview.<eos> Why, 'cause your boy James Nielson said he wouldn't watch my next movie if it was playing in his glasses?
'Cause whenever you say no, people want an explanation.<eos> Yeah, I'm the same way with meth.<eos> I just take it.<eos> Is it true that Erica helped you get clean?<eos> Do you even know what my movie's about?<eos> It's about Dutty Boukman, a self-educated slave who, once in Haiti, became one of the leaders of the revolution where Haitian slaves killed over 50,000 whites.<eos> Yay, dead white people.<eos> Dutty did not shut up and play nice.<eos> You know, normally, after someone says they saw your movie, they give you some sort of opinion, you know...<eos> They go, "I saw your movie and I thought it was good."

Yo, yo, Silk.<eos> You're Hammy the Bear!<eos> Yeah, yeah, have him pick me up at the Coffee Shop.<eos> Yeah, Union Square.<eos> Two iced coffees!<eos> Hammy!<eos> Hammy, I love you, man!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Chelsea is James Nielson?<eos> Why, 'cause your boy James Nielson said he wouldn't watch my next movie if it was playing in his glasses?
I'm really sorry.<eos> What I did was wrong and it was creepy and it was weird.<eos> And I know you won't believe me, but I actually did it because I like you.<eos> All right?<eos> The fan in me just wanted to know what happened to that guy that I saw at Purchase.<eos> You liked me?<eos> Yes, that made me laugh and cry.<eos> You can't touch the girls.<eos> She took my wallet.<eos> I don't know where it is, but she has it.
In three days, you will fly from New York to Beijing, where you will transfer to a commercial airline that takes you directly to Pyongyang.<eos> I'm sorry, this is completely unrelated, but, um, what happened to your glasses?<eos> Oh, I...<eos> I got LASIK.<eos> Between the time I saw you and now?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Now, our intelligence suggests that you will be taken here, to Kim Jong-un's personal compound.<eos> So, preceding the interview, you are going to shake Kim's hand, administering a fatal dose of poison with this, a transdermal time-delayed ricin strip.<eos> When you shake his hand, the poison will be absorbed into his skin, where it metabolizes for a 12-hour period.
- It's very offensive, 'cause basically if you think about what you're saying to me, you're saying because I'm a girl, and because I'm attractive, my only use for this agency would be to manipulate men.<eos> I think it's offensive, too.<eos> and that's exactly what I said to Aaron.<eos> I said that bitch is blind as a bat.<eos> Can we please move on?<eos> We have a dictator to kill.<eos> When handling the ricin strip, operate with extreme caution.<eos> Even momentary flesh contact with the exposed strip is fatal.<eos> The poison will lay dormant for 12 hours.<eos> After it passes the blood-brain barrier, your heart rate would shoot up to 160.
It's a fucking tiger.<eos> It's a fucking tiger.<eos> Yes.<eos> A tiger.<eos> You fucking led my friend into a tiger patch?<eos> I told you there were tigers there.<eos> Guys, I'm very unhappy right now.<eos> Look, it's really dark out there.<eos> He probably doesn't see you.<eos> Oh, it fucking sees me.

Please tell me you know that that's a stupid idea.<eos> Please, please don't try to fight the tiger.<eos> I'm gonna make a run for it.<eos> Do not run for it!<eos> You will die.<eos> It's coming.<eos> You go, go, go, buddy!<eos> Go, buddy!<eos> Look out, look out!<eos> It's coming after you!

I will be in charge of every aspect of this transmission.<eos> Dave and the show itself are very dependent on me when it comes to how we actually shoot the show.<eos> I've watched every episode in preparation for this interview.<eos> Wow!<eos> I particularly enjoyed the Miley Cyrus camel toe episode.<eos> Oh, the camel toe episode.<eos> That was good.<eos> I've never heard this expression before.<eos> But after seeing it, it is a perfect representation of her vagina.<eos> It is; it looked exactly like that, yeah.

Face!<eos> Man, this is so nice.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Now, don't take this the wrong way.<eos> You can ask me anything, Dave.<eos> Do you pee and poo?<eos> You've heard the stories, huh?<eos> Yes, I pee and poo.<eos> So you have a butthole.<eos> I've got a butthole, and it's working overtime.
Fire!<eos> I've been grazed!<eos> - How's the puppy?<eos> - Puppy is okay!<eos> You protect that puppy with your life.<eos> We got to do something!<eos> He's gonna fucking kill us!<eos> We're in a tank!<eos> Shoot him back.<eos> It's loaded!
- What is that?<eos> That is dried blood.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I'll have to take it back and analyze it and date it.<eos> We won't know until then, so go ahead and take that as a sample.<eos> - That's cool.<eos> Hey, your wire.<eos> - Your wire.<eos> - What?<eos> It must have snapped.
Me too.<eos> I'll stop by.<eos> Bye, John.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I'm going to stop by the power plant to check the output levels.<eos> Power plant?<eos> Yes.<eos> Come on.<eos> The motor generates enough power for the entire valley.<eos> In fact, it could power the entire West Coast.

They're just as stubborn as women.<eos> Frisco, you are wasting an unconscionable amount of time... bringing your copper ore up this way.<eos> You ought to build a rail line down to the smelter.<eos> I know, but it's such a difficult job.<eos> Besides, the mine's output doesn't justify the expense.<eos> That's nonsense.<eos> You see that pass to the east?<eos> Huh.<eos> It's an easier grade with softer stone.<eos> It wouldn't take a lot of curves.
- We're about to have a disaster on our hands.<eos> - Who is this?<eos> I'm a lineman in your California division.<eos> Let's leave it at that.<eos> They tell me it's orders from the Unification Board... and to mind my own damn business.<eos> What's your name?<eos> It doesn't matter. I'm outta here.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Wait!<eos> Thompson's PR people were heavily promoting his big speech, predicting it would be the most-watched broadcast in history.
Your world is in a downward spiral, and you will ride it down to destruction.<eos> But if you share the values of our strike, if you believe that your life is a sacred possession... for you to make the most of, if you want to live by the judgment of your own mind, not edicts from the State, then follow our lead.<eos> Do not support your own oppressors.<eos> Stop letting the system exploit you.<eos> Form your own communities on the frontiers of your crumbling world.<eos> Your rulers hold you by your endurance... to carry the burdens they impose, by your generosity when you hear cries of despair, and above all, by your innocence, which cannot grasp the depths of their evil.<eos> The world you are living in is the world they wanted.<eos> Leave them to it.<eos> Those who have left you are eager to build a better world, a world of freedom and opportunity, a world based on mutual respect.<eos> In that world, you will rise in the morning... with the spirit you knew in childhood... The spirit of eagerness and adventure... and the confidence that the world is what it is... and is there for you to discover.

John.<eos> I need you to know, I never wanted to leave you.<eos> You're my forever.<eos> It's the end.<eos> It's the beginning.<eos> In the name of the best within you, do not sacrifice your sense of life to an enemy... that would claim your precious mind.<eos> Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark.<eos> Do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration... for the life you deserve, but have never been able to reach.<eos> The world you desire can be won.<eos> It exists.

Do you understand?<eos> Choose your puppy.<eos> A Doodle?<eos> What?<eos> They're gun dogs.<eos> Oldest working breed.<eos> Easy to train.<eos> A pug?<eos> It's a bulldog, innit?<eos> It'll get bigger, though, won't it?
Darryl, he was gonna bring down the family.<eos> Shut up.<eos> You're dumb.<eos> Dumb.<eos> Dumb ass!<eos> Huh. This gonna turn federal.<eos> This... this gonna turn into a federal situation, and when it does, you two are dealing with it, 'cause I'll bury you and<eos> Desi Arnaz 'fore I let you ruin this family!<eos> You understand me?<eos> Now go on, take that body to the Haitian, and pay him to make it disappear.
Can't help you there.<eos> This fake guard, you catch any security video... of him loading the truck this morning?<eos> The server went down this morning.<eos> So did our backup.<eos> Some kind of virus.<eos> We lost the last 24 hours of footage.<eos> And the missing cash, any way to trace that?<eos> Serial numbers?<eos> Markers? It's unbanked cash from the tables.<eos> Yesterday it was in someone's pocket.
House Hollard was strong once.<eos> House on the rise.<eos> That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me.<eos> I can't take it.<eos> It's very, very kind of you, but I can't.<eos> I don't have anything else left.<eos> That's all.<eos> Take it.<eos> Wear it.<eos> Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world.
The first flower... bloomed on December 28th.<eos> As these ancient forests grew and died and sank beneath the surface, their remains transformed into coal.<eos> 300 million years later, we humans are burning most of that coal to power and imperil our civilization.<eos> Remember that asteroid back in the formation of the solar system... the one that got nudged a little to the left?<eos> Well, here it comes.<eos> It's 6:24 AM on December 30th on the Cosmic Calendar.<eos> For more than a hundred million years, the dinosaurs were lords of the Earth, while our ancestors, small mammals, scurried fearfully underfoot.<eos> The asteroid changed all that.<eos> Suppose it hadn't been nudged at all.<eos> It would have missed the Earth entirely, and for all we know, the dinosaurs might still be here but we wouldn't.
And... trying.<eos> And... trying.<eos> And... trying.<eos> And... trying. And... trying.<eos> We also tried not killing him.<eos> We tried to just leave.<eos> We tried to get as far away as we possibly could.<eos> We tried to just put it all behind us.<eos> But no matter how fast or how far we'd go no matter where we went or what we did none of it seemed to matter.<eos> Cause when morning came... and it always came.
I think you should fight him.<eos> This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle.<eos> I speak as a firsthand witness.<eos> Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne.<eos> Be careful, though.<eos> This one is clearly mad with lust.<eos> It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night.<eos> ( light laughter )<eos> A fine vintage.<eos> Shame that it spilled.

I've seen what you've done.<eos> I was up there, and the only place you are going is to jail.<eos> No one knows what happened up there.<eos> Only you know that.<eos> And it's not only bad news.<eos> When we found you, you were badly injured. Your right arm was torn straight off.<eos> - It was not torn ....<eos> - When we found you, it was cold. The snow had chilled all, and that was very good.<eos> - And then we found your arm in the car. - In the car?<eos> It was slightly bruised and quite pale for some strange reason, but the surgery was a success.
Looks really cool.<eos> Took some pictures too.<eos> Looks sick, but still cool.<eos> I am not supposed to be in here, but I snuck in here like a ninja.<eos> Oh, I am Bobby.<eos> I am here on vacation with my mom.<eos> She ate some bad fish yesterday, so ... yeah ..<eos> Cool.<eos> Seriously cool.<eos> It looks burned. And old.
I said that you and I would go with the Dean's wife and talk to the Dean...<eos> - Earth to Aidan! - Hmm?<eos> Um, Dean Whitman.<eos> Oh, uh, yeah! Totally.<eos> If you were to give me just 5 minutes alone outside,<eos> And his wife.<eos> Gross.<eos> I was just admiring your bracelet.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> It was my grandmother's.
About love, I guess.<eos> Don't get addicted to nicotine.<eos> See you.<eos> - I don't want to see you anymore.<eos> - Salaam-Alaikum.<eos> Get out.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Do you see this big, bad dog?<eos> He can knock the world out.<eos> It's yours for 8000 forint.

Everything is closed!<eos> You can go this way.<eos> Quickly, they are here.<eos> - Can you see Hagen?<eos> - No.<eos> Take my bike.<eos> I'm sorry about the other day.<eos> Forget it.<eos> What is it, Max?<eos> What is it?
You are not to eat any blood, either of bird or animal!<eos> Damn your superstitions, Andrea!<eos> We're not gonna make him drink it!<eos> There's a folio in my loft, top shelf, west wall.<eos> Beneath the boar's skull.<eos> Red cover, embossed with an Islamic star.<eos> Ibn-al-Nafis.<eos> What?<eos> Arab physician and scholar, practiced in the 13th century.<eos> He disproved Galen's assertion that blood moves through invisible pores and argued that it travels from the heart to the lungs through the veins and arteries, just as the canals of Venice bring provisions to the city.
Two visits in a week, brother.<eos> I must be blessed to receive such a holy honor.<eos> Perhaps I simply lack satisfactory entertainment.<eos> Or perhaps your plans for Florence, have fallen short of their aims.<eos> How could you possibly know this?<eos> Your guards?<eos> I shall remove their tongues.<eos> Your face is mine, Alessandro.<eos> I know its every contour, what causes it to smile, to grimace.<eos> It reveals all.
What do you want from me?<eos> Hold her.<eos> I see it! Hold her!<eos> There it is.<eos> Here comes the cake.<eos> Oh, our little Tim's...<eos> Look. - Look. Oh.<eos> Look! -The cake.<eos> What a great cake!<eos> Yeah, really, it's great.

Among the Ancient Celts and Druids of the British Isles, the Pleiades were believed to have a haunting significance.<eos> On the night of the year that they reach the highest point in the sky at midnight, the spirits of the dead were thought to wander the Earth.<eos> This is believed to be the origin of the holiday once known as Samhain, now called Halloween.<eos> All over the Earth, our ancestors told wonderful stories to explain how the Pleiades came to be in the sky.<eos> For the Kiowa people of North America, it happened something like this.<eos> Long, long ago, some young women snuck away from their campsite to dance freely beneath the stars.<eos> Rock, save us!<eos> Rock, take pity on us!<eos> The rock heard their cries and grew taller.<eos> Until it became what is today known as the Devil's Tower.
The stars in the nebula below Orion's Belt are newborns, around five million years old, and still swaddled in the gas and dust that gave birth to them.<eos> The stars in the Pleiades are already toddlers, about 100 million years old.<eos> They've shed their blankets of gas and dust, but they're still bound together by their mutual gravity.<eos> Another few hundred million years, and they'll drift apart and go their separate ways, never to meet again.<eos> Most of the stars of the Big Dipper are adolescents, roughly half a billion years old.<eos> They've already drifted apart from their birth cluster, although we can still trace their common ancestry.<eos> Eventually, they'll spread out around the Milky Way galaxy.<eos> But most of the familiar constellations are a mix of entirely unrelated stars, some faint and nearby, others bright and far away.<eos> Our own Sun?<eos> From the distance of even a few light-years, it's hard to find amidst the other stars.
But as the Sun consumes hydrogen, its core very slowly shrinks, and the Sun's surface gradually expands in response.<eos> It happens very slowly, imperceptibly, over the course of millions of years.<eos> But in about a billion years, the Sun will be ten percent brighter than it is today.<eos> Ten percent may not sound like much, but that extra heat will have a big effect on Earth.<eos> When the Sun finally exhausts its nuclear fuel four or five billion years from now, its gas will cool and the pressure will fall.<eos> The Sun's interior can no longer support the weight of the outer layers, and the initial collapse will resume.<eos> Nothing lasts forever.<eos> Even the stars die.<eos> Helium, the ash of ten billion years of hydrogen fusion, has built up in the core.<eos> With no nuclear fire to sustain its weight, the core collapses until it becomes hot enough to start fusing helium into carbon and oxygen.

But there's an even more dramatic fate that awaits a rare kind of star.<eos> There's one of them in our galaxy.<eos> It's so unstable that when it goes, it won't become a mere nova or supernova.<eos> It'll become something far more catastrophic... a hypernova.<eos> And it could happen in our lifetime.<eos> There are few places on Earth to get a better view of the night sky than the Australian Outback.<eos> No buildings, no cars, streetlights, nothing out here;<eos> just lots of starlight... and the occasional kangaroo.<eos> You can get a particularly good view of the Milky Way from down here.<eos> The center of our galaxy rises high in the sky, and it arches across the heavens like the backbone of night.
Thank you.<eos> Somebody I want you to meet.<eos> Uh, this is my lovely lady.<eos> Mary Jane, this is Leanne.<eos> Hi, a pleasure to meet you.<eos> I love your show.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> So the place is ready, right?<eos> I'm itching to move in.<eos> Unfortunately, it's not going to be ready for another month.
What did you say?<eos> If you need a tour guide, you get a tour guide who say, "Look over here, look over there" and everything.<eos> If you want to find your hidden treasure, that's the way.<eos> Wait. Papillon, look.<eos> That isn't actually the right way.<eos> This one here. This is a much more direct route.<eos> Sometimes the wrong direction is better. No.<eos> Nobody uses this corridor.<eos> Why not?<eos> It's a bad place.
I like it.<eos> Well, he must have seen a lot of stuff.<eos> He did.<eos> If you think about it, all those years, all the things that he saw with his eyes through those lenses.<eos> Also, before he retired, he was a microbiology professor.<eos> What's that?<eos> That's someone who studies things you can only see with a microscope.<eos> So, really, really, really tiny things.<eos> Hey!<eos> I know the albums are fascinating, but I could use a little help getting this place set up so it's nice and cozy for when Grandpa comes home.
You know, I figured out who you represented.<eos> Really?<eos> When I was much younger, years ago,<eos> I went and saw Wei Ling Soo. Have you heard of him?<eos> He's a Caucasian who disguised himself as a Chinese, and he billed himself as the Great Oriental Wizard.<eos> I see, and did you enjoy his performance?<eos> I did, very much.<eos> He was brilliant.<eos> He, he vanished a live elephant.<eos> I mean, it just was completely shocking, but of course, it was mechanical tricks that one could learn with enough practice.
Does this thing open the roof?<eos> Yes, let me show you.<eos> I've never forgotten this.<eos> You find that menacing?<eos> I'd say it was pretty romantic.<eos> Penny for your thoughts.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Well, you know what my thoughts are?<eos> I've already told you I want to marry you. That we'll get married at summer's end at the Donaldsons' yacht.<eos> It's enormous, and it can accommodate all the guests we'd want to have.
I see it quite differently.<eos> Hoodwinking is what we do.<eos> Now, you've got to understand that since we were boys, I have played second fiddle to that egomaniacal, self-regarding... Genius.<eos> Yeah, he's a genius at what he does, and I turned out to be a mere mortal.<eos> But now, after years of trailing in his wake, and I admit, some envy and resentment, I have finally put one over the great Wei Ling Soo.<eos> I have fooled the man who could not be fooled.<eos> Not quite, Howard.<eos> How did... You admired this effect when you saw my show in Berlin.<eos> I said I'd teach it to you if you behaved yourself, but you have not behaved.<eos> It's a trick, Sophie.
Well, I would say the opposite.<eos> And so your suggestion that I, I be honest with Olivia and tell her that irrational as it seems, I've fallen in love with Sophie, that's a preposterous notion.<eos> It's lunacy.<eos> Yet I can't help feeling that...<eos> That you love Sophie.<eos> Yes, I understand. You're puzzled and bewildered because your foolish logic tells you that you should love Olivia.<eos> Foolish logic?<eos> And yet, how little that logic means when placed next to Sophie's smile.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> That the world may or may not be without purpose, but it's not totally without some kind of magic.
Flores was then transferred to St. Joseph's Hospital in serious but stable condition after suffering smoke inhalation.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll give you $500.<eos> This is a custom racing bicycle, sir.<eos> Designed for competitive road cycling.<eos> This bike has a light-weight, space-age carbon frame and handlebars positioned to put the rider in a more aerodynamic posture.<eos> It also has micro-shifters and 37 gears, and weighs under six pounds.<eos> I won the Tour de Mexico on this bike.<eos> $700 is as high as I'll go.<eos> It cost me over $8,000 new.
Can you start tonight?<eos> Doing what?<eos> I run a successful TV news business.<eos> We film breaking stories.<eos> Maybe you saw my item this morning of a fatal carjacking.<eos> No.<eos> I don't have a TV, but that sounds cool.<eos> Do you have a cellphone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Does it have GPS?
Ben Waterman wears the same gold tie on Fridays.<eos> We're leading with it.<eos> That's your third start this week.<eos> I'm focusing on framing.<eos> A proper frame not only draws the eye into a picture but keeps it there longer, dissolving the barrier between the subject and the outside of the frame.<eos> Is that blood on your shirt?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I recently heard of a Mexican restaurant called Cabanita.<eos> Have you heard of it?<eos> It's also on your sleeve.
Animal life on Earth goes back millions of years.<eos> Yet most species only use 3 to 5% of its cerebral capacity.<eos> But it isn't until we reached human beings at the top of the animal chain that we finally see a species use more of its cerebral capacity.<eos> 10% may not seem like much, but it's a lot if you look at all we've done with it.<eos> Now let's discuss a special case.<eos> The only living being that uses its brain better than us.<eos> The dolphin.<eos> It is estimated that this incredible animal uses up to 20% of its cerebral capacity.<eos> In particular, this allows it to have an echolocation system that is more efficient than any sonar invented by mankind.<eos> But the dolphin did not invent the sonar, it developed it naturally.
- Wait for me.<eos> Miss! Hello?<eos> - Hey!<eos> Miss! - I need help. It's urgent.<eos> You cannot be in here.<eos> We are operating! Please, get out!<eos> You wouldn't have been able to save him anyway.<eos> The tumor had already invaded the cortex and the right side of his spine.<eos> Somebody put a bag of drugs in me. I need you to remove it.<eos> It's leaking.
I'll see you later.<eos> Hello.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Abdou!<eos> I didn't know you were back.<eos> Put the barriers away.<eos> - How's your arm?<eos> - It's OK.<eos> Did you resume the trainings?<eos> - What is it?
Hello.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Abdou!<eos> I didn't know you were back.<eos> Put the barriers away.<eos> - How's your arm?<eos> - It's OK.<eos> Did you resume the trainings?<eos> - What is it?<eos> - "What is it"?
It's cool? That's how it works, it's cool?<eos> - You tweet on it.<eos> - Is that like texting?<eos> No.<eos> - Sign me up.<eos> - OK.<eos> So, what do you want your username to be?<eos> Carl.<eos> You can't just put Carl.<eos> It has to be 'at something'.
- OK. - I am not cloying.<eos> I am not needy.<eos> I don't care what you think.<eos> You're not getting to me.<eos> I'm not needy!<eos> Chocolate lava cake is not just undercooked chocolate cake.<eos> That's not what makes the center molten.<eos> You take a frozen cylinder of ganache and you set it in the ramekin so that as the outside cooks fully, the inside becomes molten! OK.<eos> OK.<eos> It's fucking molten, see?
Is this on the background of PAX6 overexpression?<eos> You're a first year?<eos> I know, it's surprising I can put together a sentence.<eos> Sorry, I asked my last three lab assistants not to come in... and I'd sign their credits.<eos> Anyway, this is just one step in a very, very long process.<eos> This is a rough estimation... but let's just say that the human eye has 12 working parts, right?<eos> Simplest eye having one.<eos> So, if we can fill in the gaps, the evolutionary gaps... using single mutations... we can map out the most logical progression... of the most basic eye... to the most complex, fully formed human eye.<eos> I don't understand, why take the time?<eos> We know that it evolved.
The guy that fixes the building.<eos> Can you call him?<eos> I don't know this guy.<eos> I don't have his number.<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> Here.<eos> It's under "Super."<eos> - What?<eos> - Your phone is dead.<eos> - It's dead?
You all right?<eos> Any more drinks?<eos> Yeah, it's just a smell, I can't place it.<eos> Maybe it's your perfume?<eos> Any more drinks?<eos> No, actually, we'd like to know what your perfume is.<eos> - You don't have to answer that.<eos> - It's Trésor.<eos> Trésor?<eos> - It's lovely.
Dr. Simmons.<eos> From Yale.<eos> She did this test on Tobias.<eos> Dr. Simmons?<eos> From Yale?<eos> She's one of five people who have access to the eye database.<eos> My company owns a patent on iris biometrics... and consolidate all their data into one database... and Simmons is one of five people that have access.<eos> But you have access to it, too.<eos> Sort of.<eos> I can find the iris code... run it and see if it's in the system and then check the IP address... and check when and where it was registered.
It's bigger than me.<eos> It's bigger than Sofi.<eos> Then maybe you should go.<eos> I would, but I...<eos> I didn't know Sofi.<eos> It's a false positive, you understand?<eos> It's an error.<eos> It has to be an error.<eos> It's statistically impossible. Data point.<eos> If I drop this phone a thousand times, a million times... and one time, it doesn't fall... just once, it hovers in the air. That is an error that's worth looking at.
If I drop this phone a thousand times, a million times... and one time, it doesn't fall... just once, it hovers in the air. That is an error that's worth looking at.<eos> You're so fucking stubborn.<eos> Technology has barely touched Mira Devi's daily life.<eos> In her hut, muscle, not machines, gets the chores done.<eos> That is about to change for Mira and perhaps millions like her.<eos> At this center, her irises are scanned with biometric devices.<eos> They're uploaded and then sent to a massive server.<eos> Once this information is processed... out comes a twelve-digit number for her and her only.<eos> India's unique identification program started just a year ago.<eos> If it succeeds, India will become the first country in the world... using biometric data for identity purposes on a national scale.
Do you hear me? The banks made more money...<eos> - Frank.<eos> - I have got the right to shoot anybody who is on my property, who sets foot on my property.<eos> - I don't want to do this.<eos> - Frank, I know this is your home.<eos> Put the gun down and let your family out, please.<eos> Look up there.<eos> Look up there!<eos> You see that?<eos> That is the sun and it is shining.
You know I'd never do anything like that.<eos> Come on, you know me better than that.<eos> I mean, well, it does cure cancer.<eos> It does.<eos> Come on.<eos> Helen, what's wrong?<eos> What's wrong, Mom?<eos> My diamond bracelet's missing.<eos> Well, you just had it yesterday.<eos> Well, it's not here today and I want to wear it to the gala.
Yeah.<eos> After the divorce, we became friends.<eos> Really?<eos> Yes.<eos> See, there is life after a bad relationship.<eos> You've just got to keep searching for it.<eos> Oh, good, you found it.<eos> Where was it?<eos> In the laundry room under some dirty linen.<eos> Oh. Wonder how it got there.
- Psychologist.<eos> Well, the offer stands if you want to run with me.<eos> I miss running in a pack.<eos> Okay, Logan, don't take this the wrong way.<eos> I love you and I am so grateful to have you in the city, but I don't want to run.<eos> Period.<eos> I don't want to make a social outing of it.<eos> Okay. But you have to get on a schedule.<eos> Once a week, otherwise this is just going to keep happening.<eos> You push the change until it finally overtakes you.
Cliff Barnes will never be a free man.<eos> He murdered J.R.<eos> He says he was framed, Sue Ellen.<eos> And in all my dealings with Cliff, I've never seen him lose a fight he was determined to win... and win it fast.<eos> So, what was on the agenda this morning?<eos> Treviño is gone.<eos> What the hell is Cliff up to, and can he really get away with this?<eos> All right, thank you.<eos> Our legal department received a letter from my father's lawyer this morning, giving his proxy to Nicolas Treviño.<eos> As for the super majority, our lawyer has never seen the statute invoked, but it does exist.
Of course she's gonna keep having babies if you keep taking care of them.<eos> This is the only rent your mother and I ask of you, Patrick.<eos> I don't need to take the test, cause I know it'll come back dirty.
And second those who aren't government agents.<eos> They'll both ask you about me.<eos> When you don't tell them anything..<eos> ...they'll say that they're taking you to a 'safe' place.<eos> Why are you stressing on "safe"?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> There will be a gun hidden in the car..<eos> ...which they'll use to transport you.<eos> Gun?<eos> If it's a Skoda, it'll be under the left seat.
Oh, I haven't been here since I was a kid.<eos> Why is that?<eos> I think it's because my mother thought Paris was the enemy, in a way.<eos> My father was here on business all the time and... I think... You kind of got the feeling that he loved Paris more than he loved his wife or his son.<eos> Why are there... guns in my room?<eos> My husband's business took him to Africa, and he loved safari.<eos> He was always game shooting.<eos> That explains the dead animals on my wall... the pig and the cow.<eos> It's a wild boar.<eos> I can't remember what else was on the wall. I wouldn't think it's a cow.
Or...<eos> I can arrange it so that you can see your daughter again.<eos> Did you know that Kim had another baby?<eos> A boy.<eos> Any update on the Bauer intercept?<eos> Actually, yeah.<eos> The intercept originated from a local Internet cafe, just on the other side of town.<eos> Did you check the cafe for surveillance cameras?<eos> Snake eyes on that, but look... here.<eos> The cafe, see where it is?
Kate, are you threatening me?<eos> I can do this, okay?<eos> I can find Bauer.<eos> I'm asking you to let me.<eos> Belcheck, pull over at the end of the block.<eos> Chloe, Chloe, look at me.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yeah. Okay, good, 'cause we need to move fast.<eos> Take this phone.<eos> It's gonna be secure for at least an hour.
That's Rev in the john.<eos> Offender must have booked.<eos> Call it in.<eos> Clear the rest of the building.<eos> Take him upstairs.<eos> Beheading...<eos> - That's a signature cartel move.<eos> Lindsay, put together a description of the guy who answered the door, see if you can find him in any of our databases.<eos> Hey, is your transmitter all right?<eos> - It cut out.
Your grandfather made it for you.<eos> To give to the man I love.<eos> Come on, you won't miss me.<eos> Practice at 6:00 every morning. Classes.<eos> All those college guys.<eos> Got to pack.<eos> Meeting my parents for breakfast before I hit the road.<eos> What you got there?<eos> I owe you for the necklace.<eos> You know what it means to me.
It's good for your psychotic profile.<eos> But let's get rid of the size 10s.<eos> Let's go, Ben.<eos> Miles to go before you sleep.<eos> Now, Ben, you know that's not fair.<eos> You get your ass out of there or I'm going to come down there and shoot you.<eos> All right, Ben, I'm coming down.<eos> You are one smart son of a bitch.<eos> Look at that sun, Ben.<eos> It really likes you.

♪ Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace ♪ ♪ Versace, Versace, Versace ♪ Been trill.<eos> That's fine.<eos> It's not weird between us.<eos> It's a little.<eos> Here's an invoice for our time.<eos> I think the little one likes you, mommy.<eos> Dalia.<eos> And he has a goatee, just like daddy Altman.<eos> That was not a goatee.<eos> If anything, it was a soul patch, and it may have just been something left over from lunch.
All right, don't tell me you want cheerios if you don't want cheerios, okay?<eos> Here, come on. Take the cheerios.<eos> I'm not gonna...<eos> Do you want 'em?<eos> I gotta feed you.<eos> Come on, take it.<eos> Here. Take some cheerios.<eos> Take it.<eos> - How's the baby?<eos> - Dude, it's not taking it, man.
Well, maybe you could meditate inside.<eos> Or maybe you could cook inside.<eos> - It's a barbecue.<eos> - Well, I'm a vegan.<eos> - You don't have to eat it.<eos> - Smelling is ingesting.<eos> - Not really.<eos> - Mom, I found it.<eos> I found the sweater.<eos> It was in the big suitcase the whole time!
I don't know.<eos> I just feel like I'm being so selfish.<eos> That's B.S, you've had my back for years, now it's your turn.<eos> I cut back my hours at the hospital.<eos> I'll be here for the kids.<eos> Taking care of those two is harder than you think.<eos> I take care of people with cancer.<eos> I got this.<eos> The kids don't have cancer, Jack.<eos> Cancer's inside everyone, it's just a matter of whether or not it metastasizes.
(Stabs)<eos> (Grunts)<eos> I didn't think I could do it.<eos> But I did.<eos> And so will you.<eos> Because what we're doing is necessary and just.<eos> Margot: We are fighting a war, Naveed. All that matters is winning.<eos> Pete:<eos> The drone pilot's name is Tanner.<eos> It's all over the news.
Lock into my phone.<eos> Get back to me.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm almost at Finsbury Square.<eos> Meet me at Liverpool Street Station.<eos> How will I recognize you?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll find you.<eos> Once it's in my hands, of course, the car will arrive for you.
He's playing us.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Bauer!<eos> Agent Morgan, put it down!<eos> He's got no idea where the device is!<eos> - He's lying just like he lied about everything else!<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I put a tracker on the device.<eos> - I can tell you where it is.
Come on.<eos> Cheng.<eos> Take the device.<eos> Why did you do this?<eos> What, this?<eos> I didn't do this.<eos> You did.<eos> When you tried to deceive us.<eos> We paid you to develop the override, not for you to give it away for the rest of the world.<eos> Your government would've got what it paid for.
Are you insane?<eos> How do you know him?<eos> He was with Chinese Intelligence, headed security at the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles.<eos> His own country had him arrested.<eos> He's supposed to be rotting in prison.<eos> He kidnapped Jack, had him put in a secret prison outside of Beijing and tortured him for over a year.<eos> When Audrey Heller went to go look for him, he did the same thing to her.<eos> The device has been altered.<eos> What have you done?<eos> Yates modified it so that it focuses on the U.S. drones. That's all. Well, you will restore it to the original state.
But we need you to do this and do it now.<eos> Fast. Before Cheng manages to start a war.<eos> I'm running some purpose-built subroutines, but it's gonna take a moment.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Make sure you tell Bauer.<eos> Ritter.<eos> Mr. Bauer, all closed-circuit cameras for a two-mile radius have been scrambled for several minutes.<eos> Copy that.<eos> What about satellite?<eos> I'm scrolling through now, but... it was out of position.
This conflict could escalate very quickly.<eos> We can't afford to be unprepared.<eos> I do not want to be the first one to threaten the use of nuclear weapons.<eos> Sir, we have warhead superiority of ten to one.<eos> If push comes to shove, the Chinese will blink.<eos> What makes you think they're gonna blink?<eos> As I said, Mr. President, we have nuclear superiority of ten to one.<eos> We fired the first shot, albeit unintentional.<eos> - Yes, we did, but, sir...<eos> - I think we should keep the alert level where it is.
It's rather sensitive, sir.<eos> Maybe...<eos> Maybe you want to sit back down.<eos> I don't need to sit down. What happened?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Sir...<eos> It's Audrey.<eos> She's dead.<eos> She was shot by a sniper during her meeting with Jiao Sim.<eos> It was one of Cheng's men.
As a way of kind of taking control of that in some way or turning it to my advantage, I decided to write about it, and because bad weather is much more interesting to write about<eos> - than good weather... - Yeah. ...I was quite happy when I would wake up and it was a miserable, stormy...<eos> - ...cold, windy day. The entries sort of grew into other things as well, and Susie was heavily pregnant at the time, with the twins.<eos> So, she features in it a lot.<eos> There's a sequence where you see two men in a van very briefly, and you say you forgot to write about them until five days later.<eos> But you think about them all the time and you question yourself in here as to whether it's because you're thinking about twins.<eos> Ah, well, you know, on one level, I'm a very practical kind of person about the way I go about certain things.<eos> But, er... there's another side that's very superstitious, and I can tend towards seeing sort of things in things, especially if the basic day, which... which this is, is starting to be kind of churned in the mill of the imagination,<eos> and that's what's happening with, er... the weather.<eos> The weather is becoming not real, it's becoming fictitious because I'm writing about it.
- I don't feel credible. - You are.<eos> I don't believe in me.<eos> Got a guy, Anna?<eos> No.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> No reason.<eos> We never see you with a guy and you never mention one.<eos> No, there's no one in my life.<eos> You know, Anna... Love can be closer than we think.<eos> It can be right before our eyes and we can't see it.
Well, if you could just take a look at what I got here. You know, you might find it a little interesting.<eos> I've done the research and, look, the area needs another auto shop.<eos> All right? Here look.<eos> This is my location right here.<eos> There's like 10,000 cars that go around this circle.<eos> It's a prime spot.<eos> It makes perfect sense. Here, look.<eos> This is it right here, and it's just sitting there empty.<eos> I'm not looking for that much cash. Just enough to cover the rent for 7, 8 months and then I'll start turning a profit.<eos> And my business plan, it's good, all right?
My sister's a wine rep, okay?<eos> And there's an event tonight.<eos> Um, uh, Danny, sorry.<eos> I can't go out tonight.<eos> Um, I'm dressed like a chubby Marty McFly.<eos> I mean, obviously, you don't care so much about your appearance.<eos> That one actually hurt a little bit.<eos> Danny, I don't think we're up for going to some party with a bunch of strangers.<eos> Is that true, guys?<eos> This wine... is it free?
Most boys would be sleeping for days after a seizure like that.<eos> Hey, Maggie.<eos> Hi, Ray.<eos> You looking for my sister?<eos> Yeah. She's out back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks. Hey, Ninja caught a rat.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A big one. That's great.<eos> Yeah, it's in the barn.
- Really?<eos> - Really.<eos> Well, you're in luck, then.<eos> My friend from high school, Jimmy Benina, just moved to L.A.<eos> Normal hair, normal hands.<eos> I've never smelled his wiener, but super nice guy.<eos> Why don't I set you up?<eos> That'd be great.<eos> - Great. - Great.<eos> All right, so the guy with the one ball, was it in the middle or on the side?

- Will he testify?<eos> How do you know you can trust him?<eos> Let's just say he has a good reason to want to see Proctor put away.<eos> As long as that reason wasn't your gun in his face.<eos> I think you got the wrong idea about me, Ms. Medding.<eos> You are hardly the first cowboy cop I've ever dealt with.<eos> You all smile, play the game, but you'd really rather just shoot first and ask questions never.<eos> And here I was thinking we were just starting to hit it off.<eos> From what I understand, you've been down this road before with Kai Proctor.<eos> If I'm gonna get a search warrant, it needs to be bulletproof.
I'm going to phone her right now.<eos> Maybe that's why she didn't come to work today.<eos> Mom...<eos> No Lailu.<eos> It can only be her.<eos> I pawned it!<eos> What?<eos> I bought an IPad.<eos> It's really cool.<eos> It even has a voice activator.
It's not always about race, pal.<eos> You seen many swimming pools in this neighborhood?<eos> Does Kenny know how to swim?<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> He said when he was little, you took him swimming all the time.<eos> Said it was his favorite thing he did with you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> When we still lived together, I used to crack open this fire hydrant on hot days.<eos> We called it "going swimming. "<eos> Remember that one time when the water spray shot out so hard, it flew Ray Jennings across the street?
What shall I do with him?<eos> Nothing, that's not his fault... poor sucker.<eos> Little asshole...<eos> Wash your mouth and go back to work!<eos> I am done, huh? Motherfucker!<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I was at the casino.<eos> You gonna give me my money back now.<eos> You forgot about that money...<eos> it's mine now.
What shall I tell these people?<eos> - Oh, Gary just usually makes up an excuse.<eos> -Okay. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, the Vice President has to step out for a moment to take a phone call with a senator.<eos> He's having a big problem.<eos> It's...<eos> I will be back very soon.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> "Love is patient, love is kind.<eos> - "It is not jealous, it is not pompous.

Couldn't just let us take the fucking truck.<eos> Did they see you come in here?<eos> Man, I don't think so.<eos> - Did they or not?<eos> - No! Look, there's a door down here about four more flights.<eos> You come out under the bridge.<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Where's the truck now?<eos> It's still up on the bridge.
Where are you two headed?<eos> Oooooh! Ryder said he's not speaking until after he gets back from this party wee going to.<eos> He's very committed to his character.<eos> That is so sweet...<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Were those my 1,000-thread-count sheets?<eos> You know what?<eos> He is going to be a ghost when he gets home.<eos> So what do you think of my costume?<eos> Oh, yeah, it's great.
You know, I bet it was in "Mamma Mia."<eos> Joey: Hello! I'm back!<eos> In a minute!<eos> Look, Dr. Radler...<eos> I wish she'd stop doing that.<eos> Oh, Joe, I'm so glad you're here.<eos> Hey, you want to hear something weird?<eos> Do you know when I got home, there was some stray black cat taking a pee on the front lawn?<eos> I chased it off, but it was really weird...<eos> Before it left, it looked at me just like this.
But this isn't some kind of fresh start.<eos> You're not my husband again until I say so.<eos> - That's fair. That's fair.<eos> - Yeah, it's fairer than you deserve.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - Uh, is this Howard?<eos> Who's this?<eos> - My name's Gordon.<eos> Um, I'm calling about a job.<eos> What time is it?
About 10:00.<eos> 10:00 it is.<eos> - All right.<eos> See ya then.<eos> - I'm gonna need that phone.<eos> - Well, I don't think you can just...<eos> - You gonna give it to me, or you gonna make me come over and get it?<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Your cell, too.<eos> - It doesn't even get reception here.
Sinner.<eos> - Look, I know you said the whole the thing about the mouth and the shooting, but...<eos> - Doesn't sound like it.<eos> - Well, I'm... I'm just kinda hungry.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where are we going? - If you wanna get something to eat, we can get something to eat.<eos> - Well, how do you know there's gonna be food around here?<eos> - Saw a sign.<eos> - Well, I didn't... I didn't see any... I didn't see a sign.<eos> - Well, it was there.
- You want me to tell you about my killing.<eos> Don't you?<eos> You been wanting me to tell you about that since we met, - You don't... you don't have to talk about it, if you don't want.<eos> - No, that's all right.<eos> It's OK.<eos> I... it's fine.<eos> OK, look.<eos> Uh... when I was a kid, I had this golden retriever named Misty.<eos> I mean, that dog was dumb.<eos> He would bark at the wind if it heard it.
Fires the gun.<eos> Bullet hits the lion in the ass.<eos> It... it jumps up, honest to god, about 8 feet in the air, does a double back flip, lands on all fours, and it is gone into the woods, just like that.<eos> I mean, pow!<eos> I mean... it... next morning, I come out with my .22, and I'm gonna finish it off, you know?<eos> I look around, not too far... about a couple hundred yards beyond the room for our house.<eos> Lion's there. Dead.<eos> And it's, uh, its cub is trying to suckle at it, you know?<eos> Get the last bit of milk.<eos> I come up too close to it, and it stops, and kind of looks up at me with these desperate eyes.
Do you think I'm fucking stupid?<eos> What?<eos> I knew when I shook your hand.<eos> Look me in the eye, I'm talking to you!<eos> Bread...?<eos> You don't fool me! You've never played pelota!<eos> With those hands? Come off it!<eos> The league finished a few months ago.<eos> Look, this is what a 2,000 lb. tuna does to you on the Ivory Coast, when it gets the nylon line round your neck and...<eos> Nearly a ton weight, pulling for twenty minutes, and it couldn't beat me.
If we're going to be honest, we'll say everything.<eos> Fine.<eos> Have you said all this to Antxon?<eos> I don't have to like Amaia, he's the one marrying her.<eos> And, anyway, look at them.<eos> How could it go badly?<eos> That hand is low.<eos> You said on your waist.<eos> Your little finger isn't on my waist.<eos> It might be on the very limit but I'm not touching the soft zone.
Thanks, Strode.<eos> Oh, and, Lassie, if you happen to run into half a bear in the alley, don't shoot it.<eos> You got it, buddy.<eos> It's 6:00 in the morning, Lassie.<eos> - We're missing something.<eos> - It's called sleep.<eos> This place is as close as we're gonna get to solving Baxter's murder.<eos> - We gotta keep looking.<eos> - Where?<eos> It's a victimless crime, Shawn.
Yeah.<eos> I knocked the table, I was annoyed.<eos> I bet you were.<eos> It's a 200-year-old single malt you love telling me about.<eos> Shall we go over it, so we're all clear?<eos> Everything's in place.<eos> The tests from Leonid show that it works on a long-term trial, as you know.<eos> So we're still on schedule.<eos> The medic from the interrogation center had his little accident.<eos> So your alias is Cedric Saunders, and it stood up with their background checks.
Another guy thought he was God.<eos> Just to see what would happen, we put 'em in a cell together.<eos> Straight off, they started whaling on each other.<eos> Real dirty.<eos> - Who won?<eos> - It was even.<eos> But the devil had the better moves.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, is that plane following us?<eos> Shit, it's firing something.
Yeah, well, I won my fantasy baseball league last year.<eos> Let's not talk about Jack, okay?<eos> I'm happy to not talk about Jack.<eos> What's the smoking rule in here?<eos> Is he making a face?<eos> Is that...<eos> That's just how he looks.<eos> So, I had a very vivid dream the other night about us.<eos> A vivid dream?<eos> What was it about, this vivid dream?
I'm talking about that-that prescription to life thing.<eos> Right, except it's subscription to nature.<eos> Whatever.<eos> No, you have this backwards, kid, I saved your life.<eos> But then I saved your life.<eos> When were on the train, we ran into each other, and we got back together.<eos> You mean, when you stalked and followed me onto the train?<eos> I saved your life because you got off at Chico.<eos> You weren't supposed to get off at Chico.<eos> You were supposed to go on to Portland, but because of me you got off at Chico instead and you weren't on the train when it derailed.
Why are girls so scared of cockroaches?<eos> Cause you think they're gonna hurt you even though they can't.<eos> Just like I'm afraid "always" will hurt me.<eos> - They're both irrational.<eos> - False on so many fronts.<eos> Why?<eos> Girls are afraid of cockroaches because they're gross and they carry disease, proven by the fact that they were one of the biblical plagues.<eos> Also, they also love to lay eggs in your vagina.<eos> Secondly, it's not irrational to think that commitment can hurt you...<eos> Because it can.
I said, turn around, not walk away.<eos> Sir...<eos> - I'm Sergeant Cohen.<eos> - Officer Loren.<eos> - Loren?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I... I was told to report here.<eos> It might have been a mistake.<eos> I thought the new station is up and running already.<eos> Yes, it is.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is good.<eos> This is good. What's around you?<eos> - Woods.<eos> - Okay.<eos> What else?<eos> - Wait.<eos> There's a sign.<eos> - Okay, what does it say?
All rise in the matter of The People vs. Homer Simpson.<eos> The people call Hollywood ultra-producer, Judd Apatow.<eos> Homer Simpson is an enemy of art.<eos> Art created by writers, directors, and the guy who uses a computer to erase or enhance nipples.<eos> And not just the people who dream for a living, but the people who depend on us.<eos> The spin class instructors, the personal rabbis, Seth Rogen.<eos> It's true, I need him.<eos> I saw a bootleg DVD of The 40 Year Old Virgin for sale at a car wash.<eos> They left off my director's commentary!<eos> It didn't even have a blooper reel!
How do they think they're gonna get six articles and turn it into a book'?<eos> Well, we would also do the ones from the Lake District, from the English ones.<eos> What did you think of them? I didn't read them.<eos> I was in America, acting.<eos> They were a lightly fictionalized account of your adventures in the north of England.<eos> How were they lightly fictionalized?<eos> The names were changed to.<eos> What about my name?<eos> We kept your name, but the girls' names were changed.<eos> So how do they know it's fictionalized if it says
He doesn't like me to say. Oh. Doesn't like me to share that.<eos> Does he drink a lot?<eos> Well...<eos> So this is the anchor. And then if you want to stop somewhere, you drop the sail; Is that right'?<eos> Where are you from, then?<eos> Wales, right'?<eos> Wales, South Wales, Port Talbot.<eos> Oh, I love the accent. Do you?<eos> Yeah, it's beautiful.<eos> Seriously? Yeah, it's really lyrical.
That's no entry.<eos> Can we have the sat nav on now, please? Okay.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Uh, we're well, I think we're in we're in the outskirts of Rome.<eos> Right. Well, we're-we're here. We've arrived already, so...<eos> We're near the Piazza del Popolo. What signs?<eos> There are no signs. If you follow signs for the center...<eos> Guide us in. Ask her just to talk us in, like a stricken pilot in an airliner.<eos> Have you not got your sat nav?<eos> It's having trouble finding the, um, satellite.
There's a lot of similarities. Yeah.<eos> Two short, brooding, intense actors, promoting products they genuinely love.<eos> Hello. You all right?<eos> Yeah, great.<eos> I've got Joe, and we're just about to get on a plane to Naples.<eos> Okay. How is he?<eos> Good.<eos> He's great. We're gonna get a cab from the airport, and we'll go to the Fontanelle catacombs, okay?<eos> Why are we meeting at a cemetery?<eos> Well, it's on the edge of town, so it'll be easy, 'cause Naples is crazy for the traffic, and I've always wanted to see it.
I'm afraid so.<eos> I'm trapped in a fantasy forever!<eos> Kiss my flat plastic butt, reality.<eos> Daddy-daughter time will never end!<eos> Inventing this toy world to live in is the smartest thing my brain-damaged brain ever did.<eos> Nothing bad can ever happen here.<eos> Great throw, Homer.<eos> Put it in Tupperware, boys.<eos> We'll rebuild it tomorrow.<eos> Homie, ask yourself-- can you really live in a paradise if you know it's just pretend?
How would you recognize David Eischers code?<eos> With it you can change the world.<eos> - Do you understand what the code does?<eos> - Yeah... It made you.
What is this all about?<eos> I want to see my husband again, David.<eos> The brain will do a lot for your son too<eos> - Jonas.<eos> We can both get what we dream of.<eos> You do not dream of anything.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> You know nothing about that.<eos> Davids memory device may be in the brain that you have,<eos> But without David's body it is useless.
- Jonas.<eos> We can both get what we dream of.<eos> You do not dream of anything.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> You know nothing about that.<eos> Davids memory device may be in the brain that you have,<eos> But without David's body it is useless.<eos> It must be connected to the skull.<eos> - It's won't be easy to get it out of the grave.<eos> - It's not there anymore.
It's not only this.<eos> - How did you become who you are?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> It may sound a bit clumsy...<eos> Was there a code or something else? Or...<eos> Are you built like this?<eos> No.<eos> There is a code... that makes you like this... Free?<eos> There was a code, but it's ruined now.<eos> It is no more.
Come, I'll show you where there is electricity.<eos> I heard Hub Sec sirens.<eos> It was best for everyone that no one was here.<eos> I locked up the code properly.<eos> You did not think I had thrown it away? I made a sad discovery.<eos> - It's empty.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> It's empty.<eos> It was probably a one-time code.<eos> Now it's just in your Hubot.
Douglas!<eos> Douglas.<eos> Douglas!<eos> Douglas, wake up!<eos> Douglas!<eos> Do you still have the device that tests for the HSE Trojan?<eos> - Ummm...<eos> Now? - Now.<eos> Yea...<eos> It will surely still be here.
Five minutes.<eos> Beatrice...<eos> -... I have improved the code.<eos> What have you done?<eos> Removed the need to survive.<eos> - You have not given it to Jonas?<eos> No, it 's not finished.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You can not own the code.<eos> It belongs to everyone - it does not belong to me.
Yes, it is similar.<eos> Perhaps you also created what we see up there?<eos> It's possible, but to be sure I need... More time.<eos> You always want to have more time.<eos> But there... That's not the same.<eos> It's different there.<eos> And there... it is not complete at all.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> That code, is the same as what's in him.<eos> - We know that it works poorly.
But there... That's not the same.<eos> It's different there.<eos> And there... it is not complete at all.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> That code, is the same as what's in him.<eos> - We know that it works poorly.<eos> - The code was incorrectly installed.<eos> - It was you who said it.<eos> - It may still be something wrong with the code.<eos> It can also be basically correct.
He'll be fine.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - No problem.<eos> Allowing us to predict that some particles can, in fact, escape a black hole.<eos> So, black holes are not, in fact, black at all, but glow with heat radiation.<eos> The steady emission of heat energy causes the black holes to lose mass<eos> and eventually they disappear in a spectacular explosion.<eos> It's very, very simple, in the way that a body loses heat.<eos> - Second law of thermodynamics. - Right, it's thermodynamics.<eos> If we can imagine that a black hole is, indeed, losing particles and over time, will diminish in size, it will evaporate, it will...
Yeah.<eos> Then bring a knife to school.<eos> If they take it off of you and beat you up, you go around their houses at night and burn them down with their families inside.<eos> What's the worst they can do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here.<eos> You keep it.<eos> You're giving this to me?<eos> Yeah, man, it's yours.
Papa, speak to Mansur, please, first.<eos> Why?<eos> It's not Mansur's money.<eos> Not until I die.<eos> Until then it is mine and Mama's money.<eos> And she loves this village.<eos> She said brakes break for a reason.<eos> Look.<eos> Wow.<eos> It has a covered yard, like the one in Mumbai.
You know they hate us.<eos> Aren't you angry?<eos> No.<eos> We're not visitors anymore, Mahira.<eos> This time we will not run.<eos> You know what they say.<eos> If you can't beat them, join them.<eos> I can clean my own wall.<eos> The outer wall is not your wall.<eos> Technically, it belongs to the village.
Your chip detector had a cluster of steel shavings on it.<eos> Flakes from the gears.<eos> That's what caused the trouble.<eos> Well, you could just replace it.<eos> Order a new one from A-G Parts.<eos> It'll be here by the end of the week.<eos> Right?<eos> What?<eos> Your gearbox... It's...<eos> It's out of production. Long since discontinued.
The high beam steam takes off 50,000 miles, easy.<eos> Welcome, Mr. Secretary, to the grand reopening weekend of the magnificent...<eos> It's a pleasure to be here, Spinner.<eos> And is it a pleasure to see you, sir?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> So, now, what's this I hear about a fire?<eos> Fire...<eos> The Whitewall Fire is contained, sir.<eos> - Right.<eos> - It's under control.
You're welcome!<eos> - What?<eos> - Because you're fixed!<eos> Wait.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, that was the hardest thing I've ever done.<eos> You've got yourself a custom-made epicyclic, concentric reduction gearbox.<eos> A new gearbox?<eos> No.<eos> It's better than new.
Or it can disguise a plant as an animal, evolving blossoms that take on the appearance of a wasp-- the orchid's way of fooling real wasps into pollinating it.<eos> This is the awesome shape-shifting power of natural selection.<eos> Among the dense, tangled limbs of the vast Tree of Life... you are here.<eos> One tiny branch among countless millions.<eos> Science reveals that all life on Earth is one.<eos> Darwin discovered the actual mechanisof evolution.<eos> The prevailing belief was that the complexity and variety of life must be the work of an intelligent designer, who created each of these millions of different species separately.<eos> Living things are just too intricate, it was said, to be the result of unguided evolution.<eos> Consider the human eye, a masterpiece of complexity.<eos> It requires a cornea, iris, lens, retina, optic nerves, muscles, let alone the brain's elaborate neural network to interpret images.
But what would life be like on other worlds?<eos> Worlds with a completely different history, chemistry and evolution from our planet?<eos> There's a distant world I want to take you to-- a world far different from our own, but one that may harbor life.<eos> If it does, it promises to be unlike anything we've ever seen before.<eos> Clouds and haze completely hide the surface of Titan, Saturn's giant moon.<eos> Titan reminds me a little bit of home.<eos> Like Earth, it has an atmosphere that's mostly nitrogen.<eos> But it's four times denser.<eos> Titan's air has no oxygen at all.<eos> And it's far colder than anywhere on Earth.
Well, maybe you can help us, Mr. Gribbs.<eos> We have no idea where we're going. - Mm.<eos> Well, maybe we can help each other.<eos> I'd be happy to navigate this river if you two can provide the vessel.<eos> Do you have a vessel?<eos> So, Mr. Gribbs, what brings you out to the jungle?<eos> As you might have guessed, I'm in the blooper business.<eos> Animal bloopers.<eos> Nowadays, the big money is in rare and exotic bloopers, and this place is a gold mine.<eos> I reckon, if I can find a harlequin pygmy sloth in this here jungle and get it to bloop on this here camera, then this here Gribbs would be a wealthy man.
You mean besides you?<eos> - I will cut you. - Yeah.<eos> Did you know them?<eos> No.<eos> This is as close as I got.<eos> I want to hear what they're saying.<eos> We can't.<eos> We can only go where my memory can take us.<eos> Listen, I've got to check her gym locker still, but it doesn't look like the artifact's anywhere here at the school.<eos> It must be quite powerful to have such a lasting effect.
- Elise?<eos> That's it.<eos> That's... that's what familiar, the logo.<eos> - Yeah, honey, 'cause this is...<eos> - Do not start.<eos> She does not like pools.<eos> The room service here is fantastic.<eos> Hey, guys, wait.<eos> This hotel...<eos> It was in the news about year ago...
I hold out dignity.<eos> I would pay for a private asylum in the country.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> We'll stay at home.<eos> She will need opiates before long for the pain.<eos> She will cease being who she is.<eos> Then I'll love who she becomes.<eos> Berth 17 is ahead.<eos> Why this ship?<eos> It came from Cairo four months ago and has been in quarantine since... for what they're vaguely describing as "typhus or an unknown foreign disease."
If I seek demons, and in the chase am destroyed no harm will come to mankind.<eos> You could yet astonish the world.<eos> I'm tired of your temporising, demon.<eos> Do what you have promised me.<eos> So it shall be to all those near you.<eos> Look upon him, Frankenstein.<eos> Look upon your work.<eos> Do not weep.<eos> I have learned that skill.<eos> It brings no solace.
I brought you an orange.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Everyone likes oranges, I reckon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Reading again?<eos> Thank you for the book.<eos> Paradise Lost.<eos> That was sweet.<eos> Are you reading it?<eos> Well, it's awfully long.
Yes, I believe I am still alive.<eos> Would you come into the light for me?<eos> And look up to the left, to the right.<eos> I fear I'm not looking my best.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> Your visual responses are perfectly adequate.<eos> High praise.<eos> No wonder you're not married.<eos> May I listen to your heart?<eos> Such as it is.
I can't seem to get it out of my head.<eos> "No more let Life divide<eos> "what Death can join together."<eos> Your clean hands are trembling.<eos> Are you afraid?<eos> Not of you.<eos> You think you know a greater demon?<eos> Tell me of him, or shall I tell you?<eos> Is the examination over?<eos> It has not yet begun.
Maybe we got the buyer.<eos> I'd imagine we're looking at their good-faith deposit.<eos> Comms. Jackpot.<eos> Looks like it might be a good day after all.<eos> Bubba, get your ass over here.<eos> Stop fiddling'.<eos> If we can get hold of CENTCOM... and let them know that we're mission forward... they might not flatten the place before we get there.<eos> - How's your Persian, bro?<eos> - Fuckin' awesome.<eos> If it was backwards.
What do you want from the cart?<eos> Do you have the new Harry Potter book? No.<eos> This is not the new Harry Potter book.<eos> This is the old one.<eos> I already read this one.<eos> I want the last book.<eos> Which one's that?<eos> The last book? It's, you know...<eos> You... you see that book there?<eos> It has no cover on it, huh?

Fuck you!<eos> You locked up us here for years!<eos> For what? !<eos> To show the world that you are good guy and we are bad guy? !<eos> Fuck you!<eos> You and America are the bad guy!<eos> - You American are the real terrorists!<eos> - Hey, keep it down!<eos> I looked for your book, you know?<eos> YourHarry Potter book... it's not in the library.
You're fooling with me, huh?<eos> No.<eos> No, it's really not there.<eos> You're sure it's not there?<eos> Huh?<eos> Are you sure the book is not there 'cause, you know, once, one of these guards... he told me that he has seen it in the library.<eos> You know... you know, he... he... he... he was... keep telling me each week that, "I will bring it next week.<eos> I will bring it next week," but he never bring it for me.<eos> He's probably fucking with you.<eos> It's not there.
No, sir.<eos> You're not friendly with him?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - You don't talk to him?<eos> We have spoken.<eos> I am... Not...<eos> I...<eos> - Like I said in my report...<eos> - I've read your report.<eos> I know what it says.
Let's get something to eat.<eos> Used to be, the burial of a man of Joe's stature would have brought a thousand Romani.<eos> Today, how many?<eos> A hundred?<eos> All you kids want to do nowadays is move on, become real Americans.<eos> It breaks my heart.<eos> Well, times are changing.<eos> The world's different now.<eos> The world's always changing.<eos> Doesn't mean it's getting better.
Excuse me<eos> That old guy gave them a beating all<eos> - How old type<eos> - You know<eos> The old type, Rudo Type<eos> - I thought you had removed<eos> - Almost..<eos> But then came another old type-<eos> What?<eos> It żLlegó what?
Yes, I know.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> You'll be fine, okay, honey?<eos> Please bring back Mum.<eos> I promise.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey!<eos> - What happened to the taxi?<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> It cost $ 90.
Robert Pickstock.Yes.<eos> But any issue from Robert Pickstock would be illegitimate.<eos> They'd have no claim on any money.<eos> If Parliament follows the Russell Committee's report on Illegitimacy and Inheritance, that could change.<eos> In any event, I think the news of the committee being convened gave hope to Terence Black.<eos> Adrian Weiss, employed by Black, discovered a direct bloodline going back five generations and several changes of name to Samuel Blaise-Hamilton.<eos> Where's your evidence?<eos> It all seems a bit circumstantial.<eos> At the time of his death, Adrian Weiss was drawing up a coat of arms.<eos> It was unnamed, but it included various clues in the form of rebuses, heraldic jokes which would suggest it was meant for Terence Black.
I need to see to Evie.<eos> She's just about to leave.<eos> Just waiting for John.<eos> John's not coming.<eos> I need to see her now.<eos> John, I'm still here, waiting.<eos> Can you give me a call when you get this message?<eos> What is it? What's wrong?<eos> Evie, could we go and sit down for a minute?<eos> No. What is it?
Yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> It's tomorrow, isn't it?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Look, I mean, I know why you want to move on, Sandy.<eos> It's just that you know every inch of these islands, people trust you, so if you have to leave, it's going to make my job twice as difficult... ..which is why I'm going to make a case to have a DC based at this station.<eos> Really?<eos> Hmm. I can't promise you it's going to work, but I'll try.<eos> Evie Watt's here.<eos> The money from the fund, where did it come from again?
And now her phone's gone, the laptop's been wiped and she's dead.<eos> If she was taking photos randomly, did she even know what she had?<eos> See?<eos> Look at the way she's holding the bag.<eos> First, I thought it was just security, you know?<eos> Like a teddy bear or something.<eos> But it's not just that.<eos> She's guarding the contents, she's guarding the phone.<eos> So you're saying, whatever she had, it was already on the phone at this point?<eos> And that she knew it needed protecting.
Come here, boy. There you go.<eos> I suppose you blame me too, huh?<eos> Hello, Jack.<eos> You need to take better care of this dog.<eos> Mm. I feel horrible.<eos> I got all the dogs chipped, but at least they're not running away to anywhere I can't find 'em.<eos> He's just looking for Will.<eos> Isn't that why you're here?<eos> Listen, uh I understand why you felt you had to file that report.<eos> You questioned my judgment when it needed to be questioned.
- So there are no issues here, then?<eos> - We may proceed.<eos> - Page six.<eos> - The bridge.<eos> The committee on foreign investment will approve a pilot infrastructure project to build a bridge over the Long Island Sound from Port Jefferson to Milford in exchange for a 25-year toll-taking contract.<eos> Before we consider the bridge, there's one more item I'd like to discuss. Consider?<eos> I thought the bridge was definite.<eos> - Nothing is definite.<eos> - This bridge is a priority-one item.<eos> It's very important to your president. I understand.
- Let's see if Feng is bluffing.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> We must learn from Longstreet.<eos> He rode too high in the saddle.<eos> If a bullet comes my way tomorrow, it will not be an accident, and I must be quick to duck.<eos> Gentlemen, thank you for coming.<eos> Is the vice president attending?<eos> No, he's not.<eos> He's out of town.<eos> I've just decided to use his office because it's a bit bigger than mine.
Maybe you're right this time, too.<eos> I shouldn't have told you about all this.<eos> It's my cross to bear, not yours.<eos> And I should be the one that deals with it.<eos> And I will.<eos> Right now you can see what it feels like to be a caged animal, where just a glimpse of the sky constitutes a room with a view.<eos> Could I get a café con leche, por favor?<eos> Sí, señor.<eos> Your money may be buying you special privileges in here...<eos> But it's not gonna get you out.
I didn't know what your expectations were.<eos> [Clicks tongue]<eos> Well... cards on the table.<eos> I'm not in the market for anything serious, so if you're okay with that...<eos> I just got out of a serious relationship, so I'm not really in the market, either.<eos> Then drinks it is.<eos> Hey, Uncle Bobby.<eos> I see you're admiring our new artwork.<eos> I actually picked this bad boy up in Tulum.<eos> Figured it'd look great in the office.
Let's get into the bastards!<eos> All as one!<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Let's do it, come on!<eos> You came in from two sides...<eos> here and here.<eos> We built a roof to protect us from shell fire.<eos> Instead we made a trap for ourselves.<eos> Inside it was bayonets, knives, hands, teeth.<eos> It was so dark and close, we did not see who it was we struck.
Take care, your fate is in there.<eos> It is a silly peasant game.<eos> You have to drink it first.<eos> Now we wait.<eos> We decide everything here by coffee.<eos> Business, holidays.<eos> Even our husbands.<eos> And that works?<eos> When two families come together to arrange a marriage, the young girl serves them coffee.<eos> If it is sweet, she approves of the match.

That's the way.<eos> Straight arm.<eos> Englishers, always with rules.<eos> Give me the stick. Give me the stick.<eos> The Greeks are deeper inland than I thought.<eos> They terrorise the people and burn the towns.<eos> We used to be one country, now we are constantly at war.<eos> Joshua, pick up a gun!<eos> I'm from Australia... yes.<eos> ANZAC Bey, don't invade a country if you don't know where it is.
Carla's always right.<eos> Carla's not right, and she's engaged.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - Really?<eos> Uh... new Carl proposed last week.<eos> She's moving on with another Carl?<eos> ! I thought he was a rebound Carl, and I thought we were giving off sparks.<eos> See?<eos> My gut is wrong.<eos> No, it's not wrong about Meredith.
In the investigation I'm going to say that this morning I was placing poison in the kitchen<eos> Because everything was full of bugs, which on the other hand it is completely true<eos> And that coincidentally a little rock got inside a pan.<eos> What are they going to tell me<eos> This is madness<eos> Hey, this shit wasn't expired, right?<eos> It doesn't say the expiring date<eos> How was it?<eos> When a poison is expired<eos> Is it more or less deadly
Around 30,000 dollars<eos> That you'll send me on Monday at first hour of the morning<eos> I'm sorry I ask...<eos> What would those expenses be?<eos> Outside there's the whole police<eos> If somebody saw or heard anything we will have to put them in the story<eos> We have to be ready against any loose ends this story might have<eos> -So if everyone agrees...<eos> -I'm sure that the money will arrive you on Monday...<eos> But it comes out of the money we talked earlier
Kiss her!<eos> -Romina.<eos> -Yes?<eos> Now comes the bouquet and the Rio carnival ...<eos> I don't know if you want to continue or... Suspend it. End it.<eos> But why?<eos> Why are you being so bitter?<eos> Girls, here it goes!<eos> We are also missing the pastrami, right?<eos> You know how much did it cost?
What are you waiting for, a porter?<eos> How could you do this to me?<eos> Without telling me?<eos> This way, they get a real holiday.<eos> They're staying till September?<eos> Paul, your fight with their mother is not their fault.<eos> 17 years, not one phone call, and when it suits her, she ships me her kids.<eos> "Suits her"?<eos> A divorce?<eos> I said it wouldn't last.

Sure, in Provence, we use garlic.<eos> In Bayonne, you'd get chilli.<eos> In India, curry.<eos> You got any bananas?<eos> A few peaches.<eos> Where's the tea?<eos> The shelf by the sink.<eos> A black sachet.<eos> Seriously, you don't buy fair trade?<eos> Fair is when it doesn't cost an arm and a leg.
Same time, every evening.<eos> And now it's time for the chiggers.<eos> The what?<eos> They're like tiny, tiny mosquitoes.<eos> Rapaciousl Little bastards!<eos> When do they stop?<eos> He's still got it.<eos> I'm at low tide here.<eos> Have a drop of farigoule.<eos> It's thyme liqueur.
When do they stop?<eos> He's still got it.<eos> I'm at low tide here.<eos> Have a drop of farigoule.<eos> It's thyme liqueur.<eos> Anything from herbs is fine by me.<eos> - It's natural.<eos> - Can't do any harm, right?<eos> Shit, it burns!<eos> It disinfects.
- Here.<eos> - Ice?<eos> - That's fine.<eos> You told our daughter about the medal?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Because of the time difference.<eos> Well?<eos> Learning foreign tongues?<eos> Check out that cute little butt.<eos> Shit, it's Léa.
Odawara, on the Tokaido Highway<eos> He's got a sword!<eos> They were banned years ago!<eos> Battosai's passed Odawara.<eos> He'll come through the village.<eos> Probably.<eos> Let's arrange a welcome.<eos> Could I have my sword back?<eos> How?<eos> It's of no use to anyone but me.

"Snozzberry?<eos> Who's ever heard of a snozzberry?"<eos> "We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of the dreams."<eos> I can't believe they remade it.<eos> - That's what I'm talking about.<eos> - Hey, sorry.<eos> - It's time for us to go. - Okay.<eos> By the way, have you seen my notebook?<eos> It's a big, blue thing.<eos> It has all my notes in it.
- Who bakes.<eos> - For the--<eos> - She's a bake lady, Gus.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - For the--<eos> Look at this poor guy.<eos> Assistant league.<eos> Assistance league.<eos> Have you seen my notebook by the way?<eos> It's a big, blue thing.
You knew someone. Like, really knew him.<eos> He came to your birthday party, et cetera.<eos> He wasn't invited to my birthday party.<eos> What?<eos> I think Adam's feeling is that you're callous and disconnected.<eos> Are you feeling anything?<eos> Yes.<eos> Beyond wondering when your book is gonna hit the stands?<eos> It's an e-book, Adam.<eos> It's never gonna hit the stands 'cause there are no stands and you know that.
'You should have checked with me first.' That's what I'm doing.<eos> 'No, no, before you said anything.' I know, I know.<eos> I'm sorry. Let me contact the Education Minister at PA.<eos> OK. So should I. 'Look, no.<eos> Just leave it to me.'<eos> If I've made a mistake, I want to apologise for it personally.<eos> 'If? '<eos> You've MADE a mistake, Nessa, a big one.<eos> He says they could not possibly have approved this grant.<eos> Their records suggest it went to the Shekba Institute of Higher Education.
It, um it makes me feel better.<eos> - Cheating on your wife?<eos> - Having a secret.<eos> One that I can call my own.<eos> - What if Atika tells Rachel? - No, she won't.<eos> She can't. Secrets are weird.<eos> People think you share them.<eos> But you don't.<eos> They have two sides. Either you own them or they own you.<eos> And this secret, it owns her.
Just get here safe.<eos> You come here often?<eos> I used to, with a friend. We used to love coming here and looking out to the sea.<eos> That friend is called Masako?<eos> You said you saw my painting.<eos> It's of a girl playing the piano in the silvergrass.<eos> Where did you see it?<eos> In the room where she played the piano. I saw your painting first, with your name on it.<eos> There's a notebook.<eos> I suppose it's for you.
He couldn't say a single word.<eos> Later, he told me that he felt like he was having a fever.<eos> In fact, my heart was racing as well.<eos> His beats seemed to be a bit peculiar.<eos> Then one day, we started sharing our deepest thoughts. That year, his father passed away from tuberculosis and left the family in financial crisis.<eos> Although life was very hard, his mother would never borrow money from relatives.<eos> Instead, she had him sell us that piano that she brought over when she got married.<eos> I know. How painful it was for her.<eos> This piano is in such great shape.<eos> It must have been very dear to your mother.
I'm not taking 'em.<eos> Are you collecting them again?<eos> I just want to go to sleep.<eos> You'll soil your pants when you die, you know.<eos> You want your son to see you like that?<eos> I wasn't gonna let Kevin find me here.<eos> I was gonna go out on my boat.<eos> That thing in the yard?<eos> - The hull looks cracked.<eos> - Well, then, let it sink.
Go do something, Henry.<eos> All right. I Will.<eos> Henry?<eos> Henry, where are you?<eos> I'm so tired of yelling my brains out.<eos> Henry?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You know,<eos> I always thought that someday I'd bring the grandkids up here, show 'em their dad's old train set.<eos> We'd dust it off and put the tracks together, get it running again.
You, I don't see you as a pills person.<eos> Something more aggressive.<eos> The wrists.<eos> But that would take so long.<eos> I think I'll be going now, but I do appreciate that you sent that note.<eos> You came for a nice dose of schadenfreude and it didn't work.<eos> Sorry. Sorry.<eos> Thank you for the tea, Louise.<eos> I'll see myself out. What have you got in that purse of yours?<eos> It's as big as a suitcase.
So I asked myself how many Ukrainians do I know who could report a robbery in progress before that robbery was actually in progress?<eos> And then I thought<eos> Rabbit is Ukrainian.<eos> Maybe he could point me in the right direction.<eos> So what do you say?<eos> Can you... point me in the right direction?<eos> Go... now.<eos> I had a feeling.<eos> Well... it was worth a try.<eos> Someday I will lose my patience and this wall between us... the one you count on to keep you safe... it will come down.
No. Andres would never take his own life.<eos> Never.<eos> Carmen, drew came to christopher a few days ago, And he was crazy with grief over the explosion.<eos> Drew came to see me, too.<eos> He was upset, but my boy wouldn't take his own life.<eos> Ms. Ramos?<eos> Detective linnell.<eos> I'm the lead on your son's case.<eos> We're gonna need someone from the family To positively I.D. The body.<eos> It only has to be one of you.
But it's a pending pardon... Pending on what you decide to do.<eos> I gave Cliff my word.<eos> Do you really think Cliff Barnes is gonna let bygones be bygones?<eos> He's gonna come after the Ewings for his own vengeance.<eos> And I'm gonna stop him any way I have to.<eos> Is that what you want, Elena, more bloodshed?<eos> That's not my problem.<eos> I understand you wanting justice for what J.R. did to your family, but the Barnes-Ewing feud is a whole other beast, and it doesn't involve you.<eos> You want to take that dog for a walk, fine.<eos> But if it bites somebody, it's because you let it.
I don't care if you're sorry.<eos> Keep that baby quiet, or I will.<eos> Don't you ever touch him.<eos> Little wildling bitch.<eos> You should have stayed with your own kind.<eos> - Are you listening to me?<eos> - Shut your mouth.<eos> What?<eos> It's just an owl, you dumb bitch.<eos> No, it's not.
- I wasn't asking you.<eos> He can stay.<eos> Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse.<eos> Tell us what you saw.<eos> I'm sorry, Lord Baelish.<eos> I have to tell the truth.<eos> I'll tell you everything.<eos> Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.<eos> My name is not Alayne.<eos> It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark.
I've never held a sword with a proper edge.<eos> This is no place for me to be.<eos> You're not afraid?<eos> Of course I'm afraid.<eos> There's a band of wildlings coming to kill us.<eos> If you're afraid of a band of wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a white walker?<eos> I didn't know I was going to kill it.<eos> But I had to do something.<eos> I didn't have any choice.<eos> It was going to kill Gilly and take the baby.
The matter's closed.<eos> I'm opening it again.<eos> You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell.<eos> You're still betrothed to Loras Tyrell.<eos> And you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.<eos> I will not.<eos> Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands.<eos> Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow.<eos> You have on several occasions made great claims about your commitment to this family's future.<eos> Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was.
Could you bring me that vial over there?<eos> The blue one.<eos> No, no, no. Not that one.<eos> You don't even want to touch that one.<eos> Next to it.<eos> That's the one.<eos> When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me.<eos> He said,<eos> "Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while.<eos> Make it count."
I've never realized she had feet before.<eos> It's actually very interesting, the broken shackles around her ankles are about her being free and moving forward, and lighting the path to freedom.<eos> Yeah, you just read that out of the pamphlet, didn't you?<eos> [Fin Whispers] Hey.<eos> Hey baby.<eos> Fin.<eos> Hey, you're going to be ok.<eos> Am I?<eos> The shark... kept chasing me.<eos> And it had this huge scar across its face.
Yeah, you just read that out of the pamphlet, didn't you?<eos> [Fin Whispers] Hey.<eos> Hey baby.<eos> Fin.<eos> Hey, you're going to be ok.<eos> Am I?<eos> The shark... kept chasing me.<eos> And it had this huge scar across its face.<eos> And I shot him in the eye.<eos> But it took my hand.
You get back to Manhattan now!<eos> Mom, Dad's phone keeps going to voice-mail.<eos> My God.<eos> Fin listen to me, Martin and Vaughn they're at the Mets game, ok?<eos> I don't know, Martin's phone must be dead or something but, could you try to get to them?<eos> I don't have a ticket.<eos> How am I going to find them?<eos> [Sigh] I sent April a ticket even though I didn't think you were going to use it.<eos> Ellen: Listen, that ballpark is right on the river.<eos> It'll be the first place it hits.
Come.<eos> We've had a little accident.<eos> That's my student, Wendy.<eos> Wendy, this is Jasleen.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Can I help?<eos> Oh my goodness.<eos> I'm gonna get in the back.<eos> Cannot put these in the trunk because it's full of rain, it's flooded.
I won't choose the dead over the living, so why are you?<eos> I'm sorry, Elijah.<eos> This whole thing was doomed from the start, you know?<eos> Yes, we saved the city, and I'm not complaining about the witches losing their power, but this did not go down the way I thought it would.<eos> You surprised me, though.<eos> You were quite resourceful today.<eos> How did you find them down at the docks?<eos> You're not the only one with clever little spies in the quarter, Nik.<eos> Sometimes I think I don't give you your due, little sister.<eos> I knew Elijah's plan was mad, but I really thought it would work.
How do you feel?<eos> I'm okay. How's your arm?<eos> Man, shut up.<eos> I'll throw a Hadoken and you see how you like it.<eos> Ken, stop.<eos> It's this way.<eos> You got like this sixth sense all of a sudden, like you've been here before.<eos> I think I have...<eos> a long time ago.<eos> What is it?
Get in the shower, Steve!<eos> ♪ I cannot sleep ♪<eos> ♪ I cannot dream tonight ♪<eos> ♪ I need somebody and always ♪<eos> You know, I'm really glad I went.<eos> It was nice being Randall for a while.<eos> God, Jim!<eos> Jesus, Billy.<eos> What about her present, man?<eos> Got it covered.
- Oh!<eos> - Oh, sure.<eos> Why not?<eos> You leave me without so much as saying good-bye, and that's supposed to be okay?<eos> [Gasps] You didn't tell him?<eos> No, no, I-- I left him a message.<eos> You might as well have just sent me a text saying, "I'm out."<eos> No, no, no, guys.<eos> It was a video message.<eos> I spent several hours finishing it, it was full of detail that made it even more personal than an actual conversation, and holy crap, man!
The white room.<eos> Peter. Peter. Look into my eyes.<eos> Look into my eyes.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Look into my...<eos> That's it.<eos> Peter, it's me.<eos> It's Alan.<eos> Alan, the blood.<eos> It's black.
We can examine the results ourselves.<eos> Inject more rats?<eos> And see what happens.<eos> I should've known.<eos> They were never gonna use it for something good.<eos> Move a few genes here and there, activate the replication cycle.<eos> Bingo, you got yourself the perfect weapon.<eos> it wasn't my fault, right?<eos> How was I supposed to know it was gonna go sideways?<eos> You can't make a virus and expect it to follow instructions, right?
I'm cold.<eos> Do I have to wait much longer ?<eos> Maybe it works just for you.<eos> I'm home.<eos> Just a minute and I'll tell you.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> You're awake ?<eos> I didn't sleep at all.<eos> You washed my costume ?<eos> - It stank !
A real gentleman.<eos> Hey!<eos> Are you there, man?<eos> Know what?<eos> I'm leaving tomorrow.<eos> You know why?<eos> I'm sick.<eos> They found toxins in me.<eos> Here's a tip:<eos> I swallowed soap, it has toxins in it.
Us?<eos> Who said anything about us?<eos> You did.<eos> You've helped me grow strong.<eos> You've provided the means by which I can obtain Princess Twilight's magic.<eos> And now you are no longer of any use to me.<eos> But you said this was a sign of your gratitude and loyalty.<eos> A gift from someone close to you.<eos> My brother who betrayed me.<eos> It is as worthless as he is.
Two weeks ago, an invisible dome crashed down on Chester's Mill, cutting us off from the rest of the world.<eos> Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead, we still don't know.<eos> Every day it tests our limits, bringing out the best and the worst in us.<eos> Some say we'll be stuck here forever, but we will never stop fighting to find a way out.<eos> Chester's Mill sentences Dale Barbara to death.<eos> The egg... it's doing something.
You're him, aren't you?<eos> You're that murderer.<eos> I'm not a murderer.<eos> Besides, this town's got bigger problems.<eos> The groans are coming more quickly.<eos> Are you timing these things?<eos> They are getting stronger, like a... a... pregnant woman's contractions.<eos> Only instead of giving life, people could die if they don't wake up.<eos> You sound awful confident about that.<eos> I've been studying the dome since it came down.

Just pull the damn lever.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it now.<eos> Do it!<eos> I can't do what you do.<eos> Coward.<eos> What...?<eos> The dome didn't want us to kill you.<eos> It wants us to end the killing.
Mummy!<eos> Mummy!<eos> No!<eos> Mummy!<eos> Iris speaking.<eos> Nick, I've got Quireynen on the line.<eos> The DNA.<eos> I'll start matching it.<eos> We did our best but the sperm sample came back with 'no profile'.<eos> It was a very delicate sample.
No, and we encourage our members to avoid time travel, unless it has been approved for strategic purposes.<eos> You could have put an end to all of this at the execution.<eos> That would be suicide.<eos> Against my belief system.<eos> You just mentioned sacrifice.<eos> The important part of all of this, the part that concerns you personally, Kiera...<eos> Destiny is not set.<eos> Time is not immutable.<eos> The continuum is like a tree.<eos> It can grow wild, or it can be cultivated.
You gotta try harder, hon.<eos> Smile, for Pete's sake.<eos> Maybe wear a nicer tie.<eos> You gave me this tie.<eos> Well, if you were a better salesman, I'd have bought you a nicer tie.<eos> At least take a look.<eos> I keep thinking maybe it's the settings.<eos> Kitty says Chaz fixes things around the house all the time.<eos> Says he took the toaster apart over the weekend.<eos> Now it's good as new.
Oh, So it's like a-like a walrus spine?<eos> No, it's more like a walrus cock.<eos> Shut up.<eos> I'm a dirty boy, aren't I?<eos> That's a walrus dick?<eos> No, no. That's the baculum.<eos> That's the bone that's found in the penis of most placental mammals... excluding man, of course.<eos> That's not fair.<eos> Well, it is an aid of sexual intercourse.<eos> It maintains a stiffness for the animal during coital penetration.
I awoke on the shores of a very small island... regurgitating seawater and discombobulated beyond belief.<eos> And then as I stood to my feet... I saw the sweetest sight my orbs have ever taken in.<eos> I saw my savior.<eos> I saw a walrus.<eos> A walrus?<eos> A walrus saved your life?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - What?<eos> This curious fellow loomed over me... with tusks as tall as Scylla and Charybdis.<eos> But it was- it was as gentle as a milking cow... when it took me into its blubbery body to keep me warm... as if I were a newborn chick, you see.
These woods are full of them.<eos> Something poisonous.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> A spider bit me?<eos> Yes, well, I'm so sorry.<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> - Phone?<eos> - I gotta make a call.<eos> Well, I'm afraid the doctor stepped on it and broke it.<eos> I'm afraid it lies in pieces.
How... how did you do that?<eos> Why, whatever do you mean?<eos> The book.<eos> It's...<eos> I mean...<eos> You don't...<eos> It's gone!<eos> The book is gone!<eos> Gone?<eos> Why it's right there.
I shouldn't be here.<eos> It's very kind of you, but...<eos> Mrs Aston, we want to be able to help you.<eos> You can't.<eos> How can you be so sure about your husband?<eos> That he's not the father?<eos> I know.<eos> It's once in a blue moon.<eos> And then we... We use a rubber.<eos> I told him it must've leaked.
Doris is giving her baby up for adoption.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> It's been so quick.<eos> There's been time to tell Sister Julienne, to get the adoption agency involved.<eos> I saw the woman leaving.<eos> Jenny, this is an enormously hard situation to deal with alone.<eos> I'm your friend.<eos> You would have confided in me before...<eos> And I wanted to, but you've had such a bee in your bonnet about this wretched promotion.<eos> Doris has to give up her baby because it's black.
Try and find time each night to practise.<eos> You'll sleep better and the exercises will become second nature.<eos> I want that, Miss.<eos> More than anything.<eos> Your patients are in good hands.<eos> I can't thank you enough for coming.<eos> The fact that you asked me in the first place gives me every hope for the future.<eos> I shall keep in touch.<eos> I should like to see how you take on the world, Nurse Miller.<eos> When you've finished huffing and puffing, we expect every pillow and blanket returned in the condition it left Nonnatus.
- You have said gently.<eos> Are you an idiot captain?<eos> I just said not to kill him in front of the whole world.<eos> You would have been able to push him gently against the net.<eos> That is all.<eos> In addition, you are a good shooter?<eos> Sorry. President. He has reached the magnetic zone before my shot.<eos> To go further was dangerous.<eos> A ray gun does not work there.<eos> - It does not work.
Attention. Breathe first over it.<eos> You see, it does not help.<eos> You are going to die in the swampy. Everything will be the same.<eos> Will not be actually.<eos> You know what the trick is.<eos> I found and eliminated a small part. Without which their system will no longer work.<eos> What kind of small part?<eos> This small part. It is I.<eos> A micro virus spread throughout their system.<eos> Soon it will switch off the leaders the direction of the planet.
In addition, they float.<eos> Look. This is a perfect island!<eos> You really want to navigate on this island?<eos> Yes. It will take us all the three!<eos> The rest. It is the case of the wind!<eos> You are completely crazy!<eos> No. I am a genius!<eos> Kristi?<eos> If these islands are floating, the wind walks around as if he wants.<eos> It blows from the continent alternatively, back to the mainland.
What?<eos> The wind. The wind. The wind, Erwin.<eos> I do not sense anything.<eos> The guidance system to the target is activated.<eos> Enter the code!<eos> This means my code worked.<eos> The code?<eos> Yes. My code. This means that worked.<eos> Erwin. Your code worked!<eos> It worked!
- # nobody<eos> - Plus, we've both had mad cow disease.<eos> - Now before you go and say no--<eos> - Oh, whoa, whoa.<eos> We need a truck.<eos> - Well, then you are in luck because I impounded Some poor sap's food truck last month For not having a proper food handler's permit.<eos> - Will we need the permit?<eos> - Oh, I don't even know if there is such a thing.<eos> - Ha! Well, in that case, show us our truck!<eos> - It's in the police impound lot getting ready for auction.
Cold-blooded.<eos> - Jake. - Yeah, business is really booming, huh?<eos> Hey, the jig's up, moose! - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Game over, big country!<eos> - Well, well...<eos> Huh. You think we can bench that much?<eos> - Shawn, that is cruel and disrespectful.<eos> - Sorry I'm late. Stupid baby classes again.<eos> - Lassie, I am sensing that your practice baby Has had many accidents.<eos> It also has brad dourif hair, Which is beyond unsettling.
- Mm-hmm. - All right.<eos> Well, talk to me when you get some hard evidence.<eos> Mcnab! - Yes, chief?<eos> - Scan the notes on that fake baby's butt, And email it to me stat.<eos> - Hey, guys, I just wanna tell you That I love what you've done with your food truck.<eos> - Oh. - Your food's much better than the mexican fusion food Your truck used to serve before we impounded it.<eos> I'm a big fan of the just-microwaved taste.<eos> - Our truck used to serve mexican fusion?<eos> - Yeah, it was called "mouth of the border."<eos> - That means it would've been direct competition to mauricio.
I'm a big fan of the just-microwaved taste.<eos> - Our truck used to serve mexican fusion?<eos> - Yeah, it was called "mouth of the border."<eos> - That means it would've been direct competition to mauricio.<eos> We didn't know that because we never saw the signage.<eos> - Gus, it is possible we have been driving The killer's truck the whole time.<eos> What's up, son?<eos> You frank patton or what?<eos> - Is that my old truck? - We'll ask the questions here.<eos> - We know it used to be called "mouth of the border," And we know that mauricio sanchez Was one of your chief competitors.
I'm afraid I must insist.<eos> On whose authority?<eos> I am now Mr Selfridge's Deputy.<eos> He has given me a free hand on all creative decisions.<eos> But, if you wish to discuss it with him personally...?<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> I'm glad you decided to stay on.<eos> But, I'm still a little confused.<eos> Wh-What exactly is your role?<eos> Apparently anything Mr Selfridge wants it to be.
You and Mr Edward seem close, Miss Hawkins.<eos> We enjoy spending time together.<eos> He is older than you and has a certain reputation.<eos> I can look after myself, thank you.<eos> And unlike you, I enjoy a gentleman's company.<eos> If there's a promotion on British linen we should make the most of it.<eos> But why do we need quite so many sheets?<eos> So we don't run out, of course, even if everybody else does.<eos> What about the soap?<eos> You'd be surprised how quickly it goes.
I heard the attack was bad.<eos> Very bad.<eos> And your family?<eos> No word.<eos> But my manners.<eos> You must excuse me.<eos> All I have left is in this bag.<eos> No gift for your kindness.<eos> Oh, nonsense.<eos> Now drink your coffee before it gets cold.
Mm. Good girl.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> By the way, Harry Selfridge asked me to invite you to a card game tomorrow evening at Delphine's club.<eos> Although I'm sure you're far too busy for cards these days.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> I will absolutely relish giving that Yank the trouncing of his life.<eos> Oh, it's wonderful!<eos> Harry, look at the new uniform sample.<eos> Isn't it just perfect?<eos> It looks very smart and fit for purpose.
Even Buckingham Palace has got...<eos> Oh, don't stop on my account.<eos> Miss Towler, I'm sure Miss Hawkins meant no harm.<eos> Of course she did.<eos> She always DOES.<eos> You're pathetic!<eos> I wouldn't be surprised if it weren't you that informed on him.<eos> Don't you see the damage this does?<eos> Miss Towler, this is neither the time nor the place.<eos> Leclair helped make this store what it is.
A-ha.<eos> The protege.<eos> With the help of Mr Selfridge, of course.<eos> He was the one who sent Miss Towler to Paris.<eos> I expect that little trip opened your eyes.<eos> Oh, it did.<eos> The Moulin Rouge - quite shocking.<eos> But I wouldn't have missed it for the world.<eos> Miss Towler always had a natural talent.<eos> It just needed to blossom.
And believe me, there is nothing in the world I want more than to smash your smug little face into the middle of next week.<eos> So what's it gonna be?<eos> I will drag you through the courts.<eos> I will make sure my lawyers rake through the details of every half-remembered adulterous afternoon.<eos> Believe me, Mae, by the time I've finished with you, you will wish you were dead and buried.<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> That bit there.<eos> How are we this morning, ladies?<eos> Look, Miss Hawkins.<eos> The article - it's all about Miss Towler.
Me, too.<eos> Can I come?<eos> Pa, make them take me with them.<eos> Gordon, take your sister.<eos> Go on, do it for me.<eos> Everyone, it is Thanksgiving in a couple of days and I want us to sit down together for an entire evening as a family.<eos> We're going to give thanks for our many blessings. Just as we've always done.<eos> All right?<eos> This place will be heaving with customers by the time you and Agnes put your magic in.<eos> Well, it's gonna need a spruce up before the wedding, that's for sure.
The rules of immigration has changed.<eos> We're stuck here.<eos> Stop going around in circles.<eos> Just ask the man what we came here for.<eos> We want to dance, Jimmy.<eos> Somewhere where we won't be getting a guard... or a priest poking at us with a stick.<eos> Somewhere warm.<eos> Please, Jimmy, will you open up the hall again?<eos> Aye.<eos> It's falling to pieces.
Only we've had more than one.<eos> No, fell off the roof of this house.<eos> What did he say? That I killed his son?<eos> The man's a lunatic.<eos> He's said something before, has he? At the time, yes.<eos> He'd gone quiet for the last few years.<eos> Only you said you didn't have any connection with Whitley Bay.<eos> Still, seems like the sort of thing we might have needed to know.<eos> Can you just admit it?<eos> Your memory's not what it was.
Did you see the new carriage the Andersons have?<eos> Father prefers we walk.<eos> Mr. Borden, how is everything?<eos> Fine, fine, fine.<eos> Your daughters are looking lovely.<eos> Lovely?<eos> If they're so lovely, why don't I have many grandchildren by now?<eos> Are we having the mutton again for lunch today?<eos> You don't have to eat it.<eos> I do worry it's making us all sick.
Lizzie, you can't burn that dress after they've asked for it!<eos> They'll think you're hiding something!<eos> Just go back to bed!<eos> Do you want to go to jail?<eos> This will get you in so much trouble!<eos> Just go back to bed, Emma!<eos> Excuse me, I'm here to speak with the Staff Sergeant.<eos> - Go right in, Miss.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> We attempted to collect the item, but the officer was told it no longer existed.
I'll come back.<eos> Fawn, I'm glad you're here.<eos> So am I.<eos> Nyx has discovered a dangerous animal in Pixie Hollow.<eos> We could really use your expertise.<eos> I am on the verge of perspiring over here.<eos> Do you see the signal?<eos> I had my first direct sighting earlier today.<eos> This is no ordinary predator we're talking about.<eos> It's bigger and faster than anything we've ever seen.
Newton remembered all too well what Hooke had done to him the last time he put forth an idea.<eos> Just when Halley may have begun to wonder if Newton was bluffing as Hooke had done earlier, a messenger arrived with an envelope from Newton.<eos> Here are the opening pages of modern science with its all-embracing vision of nature... universal laws of motion, gravity... not just for the Earth, but for the cosmos.<eos> Halley raced back to Cambridge.<eos> Mr. Newton, I beseech you to work all of this into a book as soon as possible.<eos> I can assure you the Royal Society will publish it.<eos> But there was one little problem.<eos> We are in agreement that Mr. Newton has produced a masterpiece.<eos> However, I'm afraid the Royal Society has... well, regrettably sales for the History of Fish... have not lived up to our financial expectations.<eos> It's an impressive book.
It doesn't lead to other questions.<eos> Along came Newton, a God-loving man who's also a genius.<eos> He could write the laws of nature in perfect mathematical sentences-- formulas that applied universally to apples, moons, planets and so much more.<eos> With one foot still in the Middle Ages,<eos> Isaac Newton imagined the whole solar system.<eos> Newton's laws of gravity and motion revealed how the Sun held distant worlds captive.<eos> His laws swept away the need for a master clock maker to explain the precision and beauty of the solar system.<eos> Gravity is the clock maker.<eos> Matter obeyed commandments we could discover, laws the Bible hadn't mentioned.<eos> Newton's answer to why the solar system is the way it is opened the way to an infinite number of questions.
Her speed is not added to the speed of light.<eos> The light from her motorbike still travels at the speed of light.<eos> Nature commands,<eos> "Thou shalt not add my speed to the speed of light."<eos> Also, no material object can travel at or faster than the speed of light.<eos> There's nothing in physics that prevents you from traveling as close to the speed of light as you like.<eos> 99.9% of the speed of light is just fine, but no matter how hard you try, you never gain that last decimal point.<eos> For reality to be logically consistent, there must be a cosmic speed limit.<eos> The crack of that whip is due to its tip moving faster than the speed of sound.<eos> It makes a shockwave, a mini sonic boom, in the Italian countryside.
"Dark stars," Michell called them.<eos> With all due respect, Father, surely your friend was mistaken.<eos> If no one can see them, then how can we possibly know they exist?<eos> Did you see the man who left those footprints, John?<eos> Why, no, Father.<eos> I did not.<eos> But do you know that he exists?<eos> John Michell is one of the greatest scientists you've probably never heard of.<eos> He lived and worked in England in the 18th century.<eos> If he ever sat for a portrait, it no longer exists.
Every one of those rectangles is a plant cell.<eos> And those tiny green vehicles are its energy factories.<eos> If we could steal their trade secrets, it would trigger a new industrial revolution.<eos> But to spy on them, we're gonna need to go deeper still.<eos> What alien world has the ship of the imagination carried us to this time?<eos> It's the cosmos... Contained within a dewdrop.<eos> We're on an industrial espionage mission.<eos> If we can penetrate the trade secrets of the manufacturing process in that chloroplast, let's just say our whole future hangs in the balance.<eos> This chloroplast is using sunlight to break water molecules into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen.<eos> It combines the hydrogen with carbon dioxide to make sugar, and releases the oxygen as a waste product.
This chloroplast is using sunlight to break water molecules into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen.<eos> It combines the hydrogen with carbon dioxide to make sugar, and releases the oxygen as a waste product.<eos> To see how it happens, we have to go even deeper, get even smaller.<eos> We're talking atomic scale.<eos> Bingo.<eos> This assembly line is the heart of the molecular industrial complex.<eos> At the molecular level, things happen too fast for us to see. So we'll have to slow them down about a billion times.<eos> Those larger molecules are carbon dioxide.<eos> Each one of them is made of one carbon and two oxygen atoms.<eos> When sunlight strikes a green molecule of chlorophyll, it sets in motion a series of chemical reactions, breaking apart water molecules and freeing energetic electrons.
These molecules have particular shapes.<eos> When I inhale them, they stimulate a particular set of receptor cells in my nose.<eos> An electrical signal then travels to my brain, which identifies the scent as lilac.<eos> Other scents are carried by different molecules with different shapes.<eos> But when I smell a flower or the smoke from a campfire or the grease from a motor gear, I'm often flooded with memories.<eos> Why is it that a simple thing such as the scent of a flower can trigger powerful memories?<eos> It has to do with the way our brains have evolved.<eos> Our sense of smell kicks in when the olfactory nerve in our brain is stimulated.<eos> That nerve is located very close to the amygdala, a structure that is integral to our experience of emotion.<eos> It's also very close to the Hippocampus, which helps us form memories.

Just think of the infinite possibilities that arise from different arrangements of those atoms.<eos> Here's to the atoms in this cup and in this wine... And to the laughter they make possible.<eos> Dispersed through the Clay of the cup are microscopic mineral grains, different kinds of crystals, each with its own distinctive atomic architecture.<eos> Mineral structures are exquisite, but they have a limited repertoire.<eos> A grain of quartz is a lattice of the same three atoms repeated, without variation, over and over again.<eos> Even a relatively complex mineral lattice like topaz, composed of ten or so atoms, can only repeat the identical atomic structure again and again.<eos> Toenon, to free it from the lattice prison of endless repetition, you need an atom that can bond in all directions with other atoms like itself as well as with atoms of different kinds.<eos> Behold the carbon atom... the essential element for life on earth.<eos> Why?<eos> Carbon is special because it can bond with up to four other atoms at a time.

Their job is to keep the protons from getting out of line.<eos> They overwhelm the protons with their strong attractive nuclear force.<eos> A nucleus with two protons is element number two, otherwise known as helium.<eos> A nucleus with six protons is element number six, which is carbon, the fundamental building block of life.<eos> The nucleus of a gold atom has 79 protons.<eos> They attract 79 electrons in clouds around it.<eos> The way light interacts with those electrons is what makes gold glitter.<eos> Every additional proton in the nucleus requires enough neutrons to bind them together...<eos> Up to a point.<eos> There's an upper limit to the number of neutrons you can stuff into a nucleus before it becomes unstable.

You might ask, "well, who in their right mind would bury an astronomical observatory so far underground?"<eos> Those who hunt the most elusive prey in the cosmos:<eos> The neutrino.<eos> This enormous array of light detectors surrounding 50,000 tons of distilled water is a trap designed to catch neutrinos only.<eos> Other particles, such as cosmic rays... mostly protons and electrons that rain down from space... cannot get through all that rock above us.<eos> But matter poses no obstacle to a neutrino.<eos> A neutrino could pass through 100 light-years of steel without even slowing down.<eos> Neutrinos hardly interact with matter at all.<eos> That's why you need so much of it to catch even one of them.<eos> On those rare occasions when a neutrino actually does collide with a particle of ordinary matter, it produces a ghostly, ring-shaped flash of light.
If nothing can travel faster than light, how could that possibly be?<eos> This is a dead star walking.<eos> It may look normal, but deep within it something cataclysmic is happening.<eos> This blue super giant star has already begun to explode inside.<eos> Like rats deserting a sinking ship, the neutrinos produced in the heart of the exploding star race outward at near the speed of light, through overlying mass in only a few seconds.<eos> But the shock wave of the exploding gas plods along from the center of the star at 1/10,000 the speed of light until it finally reaches the star's surface, turning it into supernova 1987a.<eos> It took hours for the explosion to reach the surface of the star and blow it wide open, exposing the super hot core.<eos> The neutrinos had an insurmountable head start.<eos> That's why the flash of light arrived on earth so much later than the shower of neutrinos.<eos> Before anyone had ever snared the wild neutrino, it existed in the mind of a theoretical physicist.
So why didn't I flinch?<eos> Because the laws of science differ fundamentally from those of other human endeavors.<eos> In order for an idea to become a scientific law, it has to unbreakable.<eos> That's why I was willing to bet this face on the laws of conservation of energy.<eos> Now, if you try this at home, take care not to give the cannonball a push.<eos> That's adding energy, and the ball will surely come back and do some damage.<eos> You just have to let it go, like this.<eos> By lifting the ball, you give it gravitational energy, which is the potential to fall and accelerate.<eos> The cannonball is going fastest when it's at the bottom of its arc, and at that moment, it's converted all of its gravitational energy to the energy of motion.<eos> As it swings, the cannonball is constantly exchanging one of these two kinds of energy for the other, but the total amount of energy remains constant.
What is this?<eos> It's the nature of light and time.<eos> Because light travels at a finite speed, to look across space is to look back in time.<eos> So the farther we see, the older the light.<eos> This is as far back in the history of the cosmos as we can see with light.<eos> It's a baby picture of universe, when it was only 380,000 years old.<eos> That's 15 minutes into January 1 on the cosmic calendar.<eos> If we look as far as we can see in any direction using microwave telescopes, this is what we see, the glow left over from the Big Bang.<eos> Imagine that all the matter and energy of the observable universe was concentrated into something no larger than this.<eos> That's the size of the universe when it was a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
Even the constellations would have been different back then.<eos> The dinosaurs were still more than 100 million years in the future.<eos> There were no birds, no flowers.<eos> And the air was different, too.<eos> The atmosphere had more oxygen than at any other time in Earth's history, before or since.<eos> This allowed insects to grow much larger than they do today.<eos> How?<eos> Insects don't have lungs.<eos> Life-giving oxygen is taken in through openings in the outside of their bodies and transported through a network of tubes.<eos> If an insect were too large, the outer reaches of these tubes would absorb all the oxygen before it could ever get to its internal organs.
Meanwhile, the trees just kept springing up, dying, falling over and getting buried by the mud that built up over eons.<eos> Eventually, there were hundreds of billions of trees entombed in the Earth, buried forests all over the Earth.<eos> What possible harm could come from that?<eos> This cliff in Nova Scotia is another kind of calendar.<eos> It tells the story of that other world that once flourished right here.<eos> And this is the death mask of that 300 million-year-old tree.<eos> It was cast by minerals that replaced the original wood cell by cell-- in other words, a fossil.<eos> The tree surrendered its organic molecules to the environment long ago, its carbon and water.<eos> Only its shape remains.<eos> When this tree was alive, it took in carbon dioxide and water and used sunlight to turn them into energy-rich organic matter.
When plants die, they decay, and this reverses the transaction.<eos> Their organic matter combines with oxygen and decomposes, putting carbon dioxide back into the air.<eos> This balances the books for the chemistry of Earth's atmosphere.<eos> But if the trees are buried before they can decay, two things happen...<eos> they take the carbon and stored solar energy with them and leave the oxygen behind to build up in the atmosphere.<eos> That's what happened around 300 million years ago.<eos> There was an oxygen surplus.<eos> That's how the bugs got so big.<eos> And what became of all that buried carbon?<eos> It lay there for eons before dealing life on Earth its most devastating blow of all time.
This is part of the 400 mile-long Guadalupe Mountain chain that runs through Texas and New Mexico.<eos> It's the world's largest fossil reef.<eos> All this was once a great inland sea.<eos> The reef flourished and grew for millions of years, and was home to multitudes of sponges, green algae, and animals too small to see.<eos> When these creatures died, they sank to the bottom and were buried in the silt.<eos> Over millions of years, their remains were converted into oil and gas.<eos> Eventually, the basin silted in and the reef died.<eos> This marine ghost town was then buried a mile beneath the surface.<eos> Later, tectonic forces lifted the skeletal reef high above sea level, where it was eroded and sculpted over eons by wind and rain.<eos> Just imagine what this place looked like 275 million years ago, when it was a vibrant, tropical inland sea, dotted with islands and brimming with life.
Tiny crustaceans eat the bacteria, and the larger animals eat the crustaceans.<eos> One day, on some future Earth, these mountains could very well end up above the water.<eos> Tectonic forces continue to shape our planet.<eos> The future is also another planet.<eos> It was a volcano like this one that created the Hawaiian islands millions of years ago.<eos> We live on the crust of a seething cauldron.<eos> At the center of our planet, there's an iron core.<eos> It's nested inside of a larger, liquid iron shell.<eos> Wrapped over this is the part called the mantle.<eos> It's rocky but hot and viscous.
Once there was a world not so very different from our own.<eos> There were occasional natural catastrophes, massive volcanic eruptions and, every once in a while, an asteroid would come barreling out of the blue to do some damage.<eos> But for the first billion years or so, it would've seemed like a paradise.
No one is burning coal or driving big gas-guzzlers on Venus.<eos> Nature can destroy an environment without any help from intelligent life.<eos> Venus is in the grip of a runaway greenhouse effect.<eos> Why does it look like we're inside a bowl?<eos> It's due to the intense atmospheric pressure.<eos> That's the wreck of Venera 13.<eos> In 1982, the scientists and engineers of what was then the Soviet Union successfully landed this spacecraft on Venus.<eos> They managed to keep it refrigerated for over two hours, so it could photograph its surroundings... and transmit the images back to Earth before the onboard electronics were fried.<eos> Venus and Earth started out with about the same amount of carbon, but the two worlds were propelled along radically different paths, and carbon was the decisive element in both stories.<eos> On Venus, it's almost all in the form of gas-- carbon dioxide-- in the atmosphere.
Maybe it has nothing to do with the coal and oil we burn.<eos> Maybe it's those damn volcanoes.<eos> (deep rumbling) Every few years, Mount Etna, in Sicily, blows its stack.<eos> Each big eruption sends millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere.<eos> Now, combine that with the output of all the other volcanic activity on the planet.<eos> Let's take the largest scientific estimate-- about 500 million tons of volcanic CO2 entering the atmosphere ever year.<eos> Sounds like a lot, right?<eos> But that's not even two percent of the 30 billion tons of CO2 that our civilization is cranking out every year.<eos> And, funny thing, the measured increase in CO2 in the atmosphere tallies with the known amount we're dumping there by burning coal, oil and gas.<eos> Volcanic CO2 has a distinct signature-- it's slightly heavier than the kind produced by burning fossil fuels.
Maybe if we could see it... (car engine starts)<eos> If our eyes were sensitive to CO2-- and perhaps there are such beings in the cosmos-- if we could see all that carbon dioxide,<eos> then we would overcome the denial and grasp the magnitude of our impact on the atmosphere.<eos> But the evidence that the world is getting warmer is all around us.<eos> For starters, let's just check the thermometers.<eos> Weather stations around the world have been keeping reliable temperature records since the 1880s, and NASA has used the data to compile a map tracking the average temperatures around the world through time.<eos> Yellow means warmer temperatures than the average, for any region in the 1880s.<eos> Orange means hot.<eos> And red means hotter.<eos> The world is warmer than it was in the 19th century.
People all over the world made the difficult transition from nomadic cultures to agricultural ones that used solar energy more efficiently.<eos> It gave rise to civilization.<eos> We stand on the shoulders of those who did the hard work that such a fundamental transformation required.<eos> Now... it's our turn.<eos> Once there was a world...<eos> If life ever existed on Venus, it would have had no chance to avert the hellish destiny of this world.<eos> This runaway greenhouse effect was unstoppable.<eos> Once... there was a world... ours.<eos> And that world is now.<eos> There are no scientific or technological obstacles to protecting our world and the precious life that it supports.
- Detective Rizzoli.<eos> Hang in there. [sniffles] [sighs]<eos> You'll call us when you find my nephew?<eos> You'll be the first call we make, okay?<eos> - What?<eos> - Smell my perfume.<eos> - You like it?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> It's strong.<eos> No, it's not.
All I can say is that the contents of that pen are vital to national security.<eos> I should just cancel the damn lecture.<eos> Daniel, it's the Sorbonne.<eos> It's one of the oldest, most prestigious universities in Europe.<eos> You've wanted to lecture there for years.<eos> - Why would you cancel?<eos> - Because I don't want to help the FBI with some half-assed espionage scheme.<eos> You'd like nothing better than to be an international spy.<eos> You're just mad because they won't tell you what's so important about the pen.<eos> It might have a poison tip, you know?
I'll be right back.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, you!<eos> Serge.<eos> What do I do with this pen once I get it?<eos> On the north side of Notre Dame, there's a bronze marker.<eos> Point zero.<eos> That's the geographic center of Paris.<eos> Walk 20 paces due west, and you'll see a cobblestone that's darker than the ones around it.<eos> It's loose.
Let me introduce you to Mark Ridley Thomas,<eos> - Los Angeles County Supervisor.<eos> - How are you, sir?<eos> Pleased to make your acquaintance, young man.<eos> - It's a pleasure.<eos> - Pastor Marks,<eos> I would love for you to meet Officer Kaz Nicol, the son of Captain Nicol.<eos> Kaz, let's cut right to the chase.<eos> We live in a whole different era now, where you can take advantage of social media, you can take advantage of what's happening when it comes to YouTube.<eos> But you gotta take advantage of this hot media moment, because it may not ever come back the way it is right now.
I gotta go.<eos> Kaz... Hey.<eos> Officer Nicol.<eos> I was more than willing to break bread with you.<eos> But I'm not sure I can support someone who looks like a college boy.<eos> It was a 26-year-old minister that led the civil rights movement.<eos> Are you comparing yourself to Dr. King?<eos> Not at all, Reverend.<eos> What I mean to say is, progress rarely comes from those who are content and secure.<eos> It comes from those who've been unsettled by what they've seen.
I gotta talk to the label, 'cause, you know, we don't wanna confuse the public about who you are.<eos> I think you made it clear who's running things.<eos> Tell 'em I wanna do it.<eos> You know, I was thinking about Ryan Tedder producing my song.<eos> Can we find out his schedule?<eos> Oh, Noni, we can't delay the album.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, the buzz right now is insane.<eos> We can't take any chances.<eos> It needs to be out.
____<eos> The paradox is clear.<eos> We defend the Constitution and the few remaining protections it provides.<eos> But for our troubles... we're savaged by the public.<eos> Until one of our detractors is charged with a crime.<eos> Then... we become their best friend.<eos> Their only friend.<eos> Thank you.<eos> In addition to the unique eastern exposure, this house has outstanding flow, and this living-room is the largest we've seen.<eos> It's 342 square feet, it's actually the smallest we've seen.
So, let's look at the plus side.<eos> This is a recent reno, they will install new appliances, uh, there's minimal street sound, and, have I mentioned, the former tenant started her very own successful cupcake company, right here.<eos> That's a good thing she was making cupcakes, 'cause you couldn't fit a whole cake in here.<eos> Why so shy in there?<eos> I was hoping you'd speak up.<eos> You asked me to come along, I'm gonna give my opinion.<eos> I asked you along because the brokers think a couple was more stable.<eos> You brought me along for stability?<eos> That's a first.<eos> Besides... your red couch, there's no way it's gonna fit in that living-room.
You brought me along for stability?<eos> That's a first.<eos> Besides... your red couch, there's no way it's gonna fit in that living-room.<eos> - I hate to tell you, I got rid of it.<eos> - What?<eos> The one from Syracuse?<eos> - Why?<eos> I liked that couch.<eos> - I remember.<eos> It was firm, but forgiving, in all the right places.
- A file?<eos> - Why would you do that?<eos> - To protect him.<eos> What he stood for.<eos> Last year, he won a verdict in this horrible murder. A teenage girl.<eos> The client was innocent, only... her father wouldn't accept the jury's verdict.<eos> Afterward, he sued Chris for defamation.<eos> The trial was coming up.<eos> Our entire strategy was in that file.<eos> I knew if it became part of a crime scene, it would go public.
In fact, he should be here.<eos> - How much... how much?<eos> - Hold on a minute.<eos> I'll beat whatever he's offering.<eos> - No no no...<eos> I was here first.<eos> - I'm sorry, Al.<eos> But I do have an ethical duty to take each and every offer as a seller.<eos> I... I did try to reach you...<eos> Besides... your red couch, there's no way it's gonna fit in that living-room.
Fine, move to Manhattan, see if I care.<eos> Well I can't now.<eos> I'll probably buy a new sofa.<eos> You should come over tonight and try it out.<eos> Yaeh I can't.<eos> I gotta...<eos> I gotta... wash my hair.<eos> - Oh fine.<eos> It's a really nice couch.<eos> - I bet it is..
We've handled worse on the dodgeball court.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> He's not kidding.<eos> That didn't work in dodgeball.<eos> Captain america: It's called rising to the challenge.<eos> Don't worry about my missile. Worry about yours.<eos> Let's get ahead of it.<eos> I am.<eos> I thought your arm was hurt.<eos> It is.
You mustn't blackmail people.<eos> Here's a cover letter.<eos> Harold is a very sensitive man.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> What do you think?<eos> "My life depends on this." A bit much, isn't it?<eos> Why do you want to study here?<eos> I love Alice's sweater.<eos> You know?<eos> It reminds me of the spring-summer collection.
You bet.<eos> It's because of porn.<eos> All the housewives want it, but it's a weird thing to do.<eos> Look out for the cops at the roundabout.<eos> - Want to drive?<eos> - I don't have a licence.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> I like that tower block.<eos> It's lovely.

I'm glad you understand.<eos> Instead of embroidering the dominant flower, I could do a gradation of colours.<eos> Warm and cold tones, like a wave.<eos> To illustrate your work with something other than flowers.<eos> A change would be good.<eos> No.<eos> The idea of embroidering the flower was good.<eos> I liked that.<eos> When I saw the bottle, I thought it was silly.<eos> It's not great, but it's the first one, Alice. Keep it.
Pop, I can't.<eos> I'll be here for you, okay?<eos> But... you got to ask her for forgiveness before you can ask her for help.<eos> Oh, Jane.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Can I get you some tea?<eos> Uh, no, thanks.<eos> Why did he tell me?<eos> Why do I always have to be the oldest?<eos> Prostate cancer is one of the most survivable cancers if it doesn't spread.

Go take care of your mother.<eos> - But he's a suspect, Vince.<eos> - And Frost and I n handle him.<eos> - Where'd you get that shiner?<eos> - What shiner?<eos> I'm guessing it happened when you took Natasha Osmanski's wallet.<eos> - Who?<eos> - More like, "what?"<eos> Dumb move to leave it in your glove compartment, Wayne.<eos> No idea how it got there.
Actually, could you cover for me?<eos> And then if you're not too busy after school, maybe you could come by and give me your physics notes.<eos> Yeah. Thanks.<eos> Mr. Fitz?<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Please come in.<eos> And close the door.<eos> Whoa! Where's my book?<eos> Okay, it was right here.
Oh, over there.<eos> Hanna. I can't.<eos> I'm sorry, just looking at the sign gives me heebie-jeebies.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> They're all behind glass.<eos> Hanna, come on.<eos> There's nothing to be scared of.<eos> Reptiles first appeared 340 million years ago in Carboniferous Period.<eos> The snake is so cool.<eos> Do you think it eats mice?
I found a bunch of old tapes that he recorded stuff on.<eos> Yeah, he didn't trust his own memory.<eos> Your voice was on there.<eos> It was?<eos> He recorded you when you were sleeping, and then, you woke up and got annoyed.<eos> Yeah, he was a funny guy.<eos> Did you date other guys in high school?<eos> Did I date other guys in high school?<eos> Sometimes, on the tape,<eos> Brian would talk about you and a guy, and I kinda wondered if it was dad.
I have just been under so much pressure at work, and it's lessened my libido.<eos> That happens, Victor.<eos> That's a real thing.<eos> Then my wife is never gonna work.<eos> It is a lot of responsibility being the sole breadwinner.<eos> I know.<eos> I did it for years.<eos> But I learned to leave my work at the office to make time for you.<eos> I don't want our marriage to fail.<eos> I... it won't.
A bullet had ruptured his orbital plate causing subarachnoid hemorrhaging.<eos> He bled to death in my arms.<eos> So... no.<eos> Blood doesn't bother me.<eos> I saw a 13-year-old get burned alive outside a madrasa.<eos> Couple of PFCs got drunk, got a can of gasoline, took a Bic lighter to her burqa.<eos> They called it "Hot Potato."<eos> Court martial called it a "thrill kill."<eos> A bear will kill because it's defensive.<eos> A lion will kill because it's hungry.
I can't climb a cliff.<eos> I can't do this alone, Mike.<eos> You're not.<eos> You're not.<eos> How can this be happening?<eos> This weekend totally sucks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I suck.<eos> I promise, first thing that we'll do when we get home is we'll put my phone in the microwave.<eos> It'll explode like fireworks while we make love on the kitchen floor.
- Hey, Jo.<eos> So I hear your victim's at some local morgue out there and thought I'd come up and give you a hand.<eos> Oh no, Jo.<eos> Al and I've got it.<eos> Don't ruin your weekend.<eos> Carry, you have no idea about these rural coroners.<eos> I heard that some morgues're doubling as feed stores.<eos> Jo, it's the Hamptons, not Kansas, okay?<eos> - How is the weather?<eos> - The weather is great, it's nice.
- to the rope from the beach.<eos> - Looks like it just came of the shelf.<eos> Did you just buy a new anchor for your boat?<eos> - You don't have to answer that, George.<eos> - I most certainly did not.<eos> What're they doing with that spray?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah. Watch where you step.<eos> - That's called luminol.<eos> - And what is luminol?<eos> It's a kind of luminescent, which means it glows in the presence of blood.
Did you know him?<eos> - I have met him.<eos> - Police Inspector in Næstved.<eos> He retired in the 90s after his two children were murdered.<eos> - Did you say something about a package?<eos> - In there.<eos> TO CARL MØRCK SECTION Q<eos> - What the hell is this?<eos> - Is he yours?<eos> It belonged to a retired police captain who died.
The video was supposed to be of Atrians telling their arrival day stories.<eos> I'd like to share mine.<eos> That Red Hawk said that humans don't want us here.<eos> Well, I know that's not true.<eos> Because on arrival day, I met a human girl who saved my life.<eos> I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for her.<eos> But if I met her today, we couldn't walk down the street together without causing harm to one or both of us.<eos> That's the reality of our world.<eos> The integration program isn't perfect.<eos> But it has shown me that there are more humans out there like that girl than there are Red Hawks.
So, I ran into Bennett when I was leaving the clinic and he has that systems analysis that you asked for.<eos> What was that about momentum?<eos> Oh, oh, I feel the momentum.<eos> Ok.<eos> What?<eos> You're going now?<eos> Just for a few minutes.<eos> Everything ok?<eos> Oh, yeah. You know this old boat.<eos> It's always something.
Do it for Clarke.<eos> I am doing this for Clarke.<eos> They'll float you, Jake.<eos> If you do this, I won't be able to stop it.<eos> You're mad.<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> You want to think Jasper's a lost cause, go ahead.<eos> - You're wrong.<eos> - I hope I am.<eos> Whatever this stuff is, it has to have had antibiotic properties.
You're mad.<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> You want to think Jasper's a lost cause, go ahead.<eos> - You're wrong.<eos> - I hope I am.<eos> Whatever this stuff is, it has to have had antibiotic properties.<eos> Let me take a look.<eos> Before you refuse my help, remember who aced botany in Earth skills.<eos> The grounders used it as a poultice.<eos> I'm thinking a tea might be even more effective if we can figure out what it is.
This is the robot who claims to be from the future.<eos> Can your present-day robots do this?<eos> Uh, no, no, they cannot.<eos> Not sure why they'd want to-- gorbid.<eos> Now, why are you here?<eos> What is your mission, uh, so to speak?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Man, this guy doesn't ask permission-- he just goes right in you.<eos> Bender's mission protocol is definitely intact.<eos> It just requires a delicate procedure known as "unplug and re-plug."
- She's devastated and I should... - You were saying that... You were saying that Millstreet's dropped all of David's projects?<eos> Right, that's right. For now, yeah.<eos> So, my book is dead?<eos> Um... Do you happen to know another publisher that I could maybe slip the manuscript to if I do decide that I really want to try to keep it alive?<eos> Okay, um, if I do give you another name, will you get the fuck out of here?<eos> Yes. Great.<eos> Great, I'll be back.<eos> Honestly, I just...<eos> I loved your husband.<eos> You know the person who gave me this told me that it used to belong to Edna St. Vincent Millay.
Listen, I feel your pain.<eos> I really do. But, honey, I think you're projecting a little bit.<eos> You feel my pain?<eos> How do you feel anyone's pain?<eos> All you do is talk and talk and talk and talk.<eos> And every time I come home to my apartment, you're just here talking.<eos> And at first it was kind of fun, but now I'm getting pretty fucking sick of listening to your mouth run.<eos> I'll go to my room, give you a little space.<eos> It's not your room, it's my room.<eos> The whole apanment's mine, and for the low, low price of $2,100 a month, it could be yours, but it isn't.
And then there's us.<eos> We take care of things at home.<eos> We are the Rear Detachment.<eos> Yes, we're soldiers.<eos> Okay, that's enough.<eos> If somebody in this room took my flag, give it right back, now.<eos> No questions asked.<eos> Except for "why?" and "how could you?"<eos> Okay, there's gonna be a lot of questions, so just give it back now so we can get started.<eos> - I think I know where it is.
Sister.<eos> We'll need to transfer Mrs Adams<eos> The labour ward is overflowing, I'm afraid.<eos> That social worker in there is a disgrace.<eos> Well, I know she likes a drink, but disgrace is a little harsh.<eos> Mrs Thomas, we'll have you into a cubicle as soon as possible.<eos> Alright?<eos> The system is stacked against them.<eos> It's the only system we have.<eos> Well, it needs to be changed.
The vice president is on the line.<eos> Mr. Vice President.<eos> Normally, I would ignore your call, but I am in a good mood today.<eos> - Not even you could ruin it.<eos> - Are you funneling money to the Republicans?<eos> What on earth are you talking about?<eos> About 20 million in GOP Super PACs.<eos> You know I never make political contributions.<eos> That's the fastest way to upset my investors.<eos> I know the money is coming from a casino in Missouri, and I know it's coming from Feng.
- Tell me what you want.<eos> - We want the money to stop flowing to the Republicans.<eos> - And what do I receive?<eos> - I've told you what we want.<eos> - Now it's your turn.<eos> - So you can mislead me again?<eos> Things have changed.<eos> We have nothing to gain by misleading you.<eos> What do you think of my garden?<eos> It's very beautiful.
Your eyes.<eos> That sounds really, really dumb. No.<eos> I don't know. I felt like I wanted to tell you everything.<eos> That I could trust you, even though I didn't know you.<eos> You can.<eos> I've never trusted anyone.<eos> Have you ever loved anyone?<eos> No.<eos> I've never expected much from the world.<eos> It's ugly.
I find any communication of a non-mathematical nature very difficult.<eos> Because I don't talk much, people think I don't have anything to say, or that I'm stupid.<eos> And that's not true.<eos> I have lots of things to say.<eos> I'm just afraid to say them.<eos> I know that I'm strange in lots of ways.<eos> I think I see the world in a different way to other people.<eos> I've always been like that.<eos> Would you like to play with it?<eos> Are you scared it will eat you?
But after a while it would look something like that.<eos> And, as we can see, that is a binary number.<eos> And a move that consists of turning a face-down card face up and the card immediately to the right of it<eos> could be that a one Followed by a one, will turn into a zero followed by a zero.<eos> Or it could be a one followed by a zero turning into a zero followed by a one.<eos> In either case, we can see that the number in binary is strictly decreasing.<eos> And that means?<eos> Which means that the sequence must terminate.<eos> Because?<eos> Because you can't keep taking away from a positive integer - without it turning negative.
You feeling the CO2 yet?<eos> I was... going over the rapid response test.<eos> I was rechecking them.<eos> Peter, can you see me?<eos> Of course I can see you.<eos> Who's the pretty one?<eos> Sarah, this...<eos> This is my brother Peter.<eos> Sarah, you had something you wanted to tell me about the rapid response test?<eos> It doesn't work.
I'm sorry, Millie.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What do you reckon?<eos> It's nice.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're welcome. It's French.<eos> How do you like the wine?<eos> Erm, I don't know. I'm not sure how it's supposed to taste.<eos> It's supposed to taste like this.<eos> Oh, then it's nice, I suppose.
It would. Yeah.<eos> I mean, we basically know what we need to do to make it do that.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Okay.<eos> We can't really do it right now, but it's a pretty easy alteration.<eos> I trust that the fit will resolve itself.<eos> But yeah.<eos> I like it very much.<eos> Are we worried about this fabric getting super pilly?<eos> Well...<eos> I mean, I like that it has texture.
Tessa: The town of Chatswin had an undertow, and it was always looking for ways to suck you back in.
Oh, my God, Gus!<eos> I did it!<eos> I made it!<eos> Calm down.<eos> I did it!<eos> Well, Detective Brannigan.<eos> I can certainly see why the mayor insisted on me hiring you as our new head detective.<eos> Okay.<eos> I would be lying if I said I wasn't impressed with your file.<eos> It's impeccable.
This one here is Belle Starr.<eos> And this little beauty is Beatrix Kiddo.<eos> Whoa!<eos> It's so freeing!<eos> I mean, I know that you probably think that I am completely objective, but I'm far from impartial.<eos> I always assume that everyone's guilty.<eos> Always!<eos> Even if a court frees them, even if someone else confesses later.<eos> And at night, before I drift off to dreamy land,<eos> I've got a wall of suspects right up there next to my cat paintings... because it centers me and gives me sweet, sweet dreams.
Everybody's sneaking up on me today.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't-- I didn't mean to.<eos> Oh, it's okay.<eos> It's just...<eos> What-- what happened to your neck?<eos> I don't know. I-I wrenched it or something.<eos> How?<eos> Don't know.<eos> I woke up yesterday, and it was stiff.
It's about my father.<eos> Whoa. The phone belonged to Nox?<eos> Why would he have a phone?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> But whatever his reasons were, he was willing to risk everything.<eos> That's why I have to find that second phone.<eos> I need to know who he was communicating with.<eos> Okay, I've set this up to ping the phone that sent the text.<eos> Ping?<eos> Yeah, um, we send the signal out to the other phone, and if it's on, we get a ping, like an echo.
Go!<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, cyper is real?<eos> You know.<eos> That's how Roman saved you.<eos> Honestly, I'm relieved.<eos> I hated having to lie to you.<eos> Why couldn't you just tell me the truth?<eos> Cyper only works when it's mixed with Atrian blood.<eos> If people found out that it could cure disease and bring you back from the brink of death...
Hey. So much for normal.<eos> You mean most high schools don't get into interstellar brawls?<eos> Or save aliens from medical crises.<eos> Nope, just us.<eos> What happened there?<eos> I, uh, tried to punch a Collier swimmer and missed, but this vending machine is real unhappy about getting in my face.<eos> You know, I'm quite a virtuoso with a first aid kit.<eos> Hey. Hello, Earth to Roman.<eos> So, I lost the signal.<eos> I had it, but then it started moving off fast like someone was driving away.
Where were y...<eos> Where were you two weeks ago when I was putting that shit up?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Sorry about your plans.<eos> It's fine.<eos> But we had it here last time.<eos> No, we've never had that, sir.<eos> But we do have a great California Grenache blend.<eos> It's a nice full-bodied red, spicy but easy on the palate.<eos> It strikes a lot of the same notes of fruit and cocoa.
Well, you know, I was a little drunk, and I hope that I didn't come across as--<eos> As...?<eos> Well, as you know, one of those guys that...<eos> Yeah, it's fine.<eos> It's fine. I should have told you I was starting here before you went too far.<eos> Listen, I would also love it if you could consider me and my lead artist, Owen, for the new game. I know you guys are just getting started--<eos> Yeah, it's not early days, unfortunately.<eos> We've got a very short development window.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> - Then I'm your man. -Yeah? Well, it will be 24/7.
-Hello.<eos> So can we-- Can we talk for a sec?<eos> Uh, can I get you a beer?<eos> You can buy me lunch.<eos> You got any cash on you?<eos> - What?<eos> -Please.<eos> He is-- Where would you like to go?<eos> You know, I've always loved to cook, and my dad was an amazing cook and actually had a restaurant.<eos> It was in this gnarly, old gas station off the I-5, but it was the best Peri-Peri chicken you've ever had.
Oi! I been dragging this thing since Marble Arch.<eos> What, are they buckets?<eos> Surprised you have to ask that, coming from Accrington.<eos> — Does anything get rid of love bites?<eos> - No, where's Mark now?<eos> - Listen up.<eos> - Where have you been? Everyone, take a bucket and start rattling.<eos> This is for the miners. - Miners?<eos> We agreed on a banner, Mark.<eos> It's a show of solidarity.
Oh, sounds like heaven.<eos> - Support the miners.<eos> Very happy Christmas to you too.<eos> There is now a danger that has become a threat to us all.<eos> It is a deadly disease and there is no known cure.<eos> The virus can be passed during sexual intercourse with an infected person.<eos> AIDS.<eos> Anally injected death sentence. Heh.<eos> Will you switch that off, please, Tony?<eos> But it's spreading.
It's called the Great Atlantic Fault.<eos> And it starts here in Spain, and then it goes under the Bay of Biscay, and then it comes up in South Wales.<eos> And then it goes under the Atlantic for miles and miles and miles, and it comes up again in Pennsylvania.<eos> My father used to talk about it.<eos> - Yeah. - And mine.<eos> - The dark artery.<eos> - That's it. Yeah, that's it.<eos> And you could take a miner from Wales or Spain, or America, and you could show them that seam, and they would recognize it.<eos> There's no other coal like it.<eos> It's perfect. Pure.
Cheers.<eos> Oh, I can probably get you some more.<eos> Next week, if you want.<eos> He'll call.<eos> Okay.<eos> There are no gay artists on this label. I'm sorry.<eos> They don't have to be gay. That's the point.<eos> This is a coming together of all different people——<eos> Reception.<eos> It arrived about 10 minutes ago, Barry.
But that is a super-cute De La Renta.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Suburgatory 3x05 - Blame it on the Rainstick Original air date February 26, 2014<eos> Hey, seniors.<eos> Now, as you all know, I'll be overseeing the tanning unit, as well as all subsequent field trips wherein we will be tanning your unit.<eos> Curious... who here knows the proper tanning form?<eos> If your hand's not in the air, don't despair, as I will be going over all that.<eos> Now, those of you with more junk in the trunk, you will need to be vigilant about performing a maneuver known as the butt-cheek check.<eos> And if you're white as chalk like Tessa, you need to start slow.<eos> If you drop a cracker into a fire, it just burns, and so, too, will you.
Karishma..<eos> Karishma..<eos> Karishma..<eos> My name is Meeta...<eos> They say, If you think of hic the person thinking of you... then... it stops the hiccups...<eos> Then you should definitely say my name cause I've been thinking of you, since the time I sat in your car...<eos> Meeta...<eos> Meeta...<eos> See, a hiccup is essentially an involuntary spasm of the diaphragm which causes sudden closure of the epiglott-is, which creates the 'hic' sound.<eos> And the remedy for that is to just let it be, but if it lasts too long, take medicines like maloperidol, nanoclopramide and ﬂorpromazine, which won't be in the car...
I won't ride you, don't worry!<eos> Lust move 'ID degrees...<eos> Er north-west<eos> Which degree?<eos> The horse will destroy everything...<eos> What're you doing Pappa?<eos> ! No, No, No!<eos> Just come here... under the light... ya<eos> Watch out, there's horse-shit there!<eos> If the horse is at the main door, it will chew all the ﬂowers away!
How about if the stadium also revolved?<eos> Clockwise and anti-clockwise?<eos> Great idea yea?<eos> Sir, the crowds will get dizzy...<eos> I just want to know if you can give me the money?<eos> This ball is made of the same polymer...<eos> Pappa, I need money...<eos> Okay... then take it...<eos> Take it?<eos> It's all yours...
I mean, that is just not enough for an accurate match.<eos> Then how do you explain what Gabriel saw in his cyber-render?<eos> Remember, cyber-renders are like dreams.<eos> Partially created by the chip, partially by Gabriel.<eos> I know what I saw, doc.<eos> Yes, but what you saw may literally be a figment of your imagination.<eos> It's a first-gen chip seven months into beta.<eos> Mistakes are possible.<eos> What about Luther Vick's tattoo?<eos> It's pretty distinctive.
Mistakes are possible.<eos> What about Luther Vick's tattoo?<eos> It's pretty distinctive.<eos> Luther inspired a lot of crazies to get the same tattoo.<eos> Sorry, Gabriel.<eos> Only one way to find out if I'm right.<eos> Send me to Texas.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> This virus is unpredictable.<eos> It is highly aggressive.
Private contractors, firms, bases.<eos> Folks, let's stay on-problem.<eos> We'll talk again at 0800.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That'll be all.<eos> Lillian, stay a moment, please.<eos> I understand your reasoning for deploying the asset, but I want you to understand that the risks are massive.<eos> If we're not using this program to save American lives, why have it?<eos> Clockwork will be perilous as long as there's only one Gabriel.<eos> You want a hundred of him, a thousand, then the program has to not only continue to prove itself, but it must endure.
Dad, you need to look at this.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - You see it, right?<eos> - What is it?<eos> Viruses are clumsy.<eos> They colonize at random, pass only through membranous tissue.<eos> But this one's unique.<eos> It travels through the sweat glands, which means it is all over the carrier's skin.<eos> He infects anyone he touches.<eos> Yet the virus doesn't affect him until it converts, which could take weeks or months or years.
Well, it wasn't Luther we found in there, was it?<eos> When are you gonna arrest this general of yours?<eos> You don't just arrest the director of Defense Intelligence.<eos> We need proof that Carter's involved.<eos> How are you gonna get that?<eos> He's arrogant and probably doesn't think he's done anything wrong.<eos> He'll make a mistake.<eos> But that's my concern.<eos> We can't make a cure without Luther.<eos> What is it?
- Did you speak with Conte? - I think there shouldn't be any problems.<eos> - Good.<eos> Actually, there is a problem.<eos> The Romano brothers.<eos> The car dealers?<eos> Their dealership is located in the area.<eos> Where is he?<eos> You should've fixed it.<eos> I've been there and was told that the dealership is off limits.<eos> It belonged to their late father.
If he doesn't see?<eos> We'll make him see again that I make the rules, not Salvatore Conte.<eos> Lady lmma, excuse me...<eos> I'd like to ask Don Pietro if I can go.<eos> Go, I'll tell him.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> - Ciro!<eos> Do you like this couch?<eos> Mamma Mia!<eos> It's beautiful.
Wow. (Door opens) That was...<eos> I know.<eos> You gotta tell 'em!<eos> Soylent Green is people!<eos> We've gotta stop 'em somehow!<eos> (Laughs) They were eating people this whole time?<eos> How have I never watched this movie?<eos> I knew you'd like it.<eos> (Turns off TV) Just wait till we get to "Scarface."<eos> Apparently, it set the world record for number of cuss words.
Well, at least make sure you take some of your work with you.<eos> I don't want you to get in any more trouble with Larissa.<eos> Thanks, but I should be good tonight.<eos> My calendar's clear.<eos> I'm just gonna go home and crash.<eos> Okay.<eos> I still have some serious reservations about these projected earnings, especially considering your client's recent deal with Bell Atlantic.<eos> Uh... why?<eos> There's nothing wrong with that deal.<eos> I've heard from reliable sources that it may not go through, which would change the stock valuation considerably.
- I was done sleeping.<eos> Look what I found.<eos> "Dear ducks, my name is Mallard P. Quack.<eos> "I am not a real duck.<eos> Stay away.<eos> "Translation: Quack, quack.<eos> Honk, quack, quack, quack, honk."<eos> Did we get milk?<eos> - You put it in here, right?<eos> - Yeah, no, it's in the fridge.
Which means we got plenty of time to talk about your womb and other married-people things.<eos> Right now, I think we should just be on our honeymoon.<eos> Right?<eos> Right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Pancakes.<eos> Pancakes.<eos> You ready?<eos> This thing's massive.<eos> - Where'd it come from?
Okay.<eos> So... bit of milk.<eos> That's an egg.<eos> Shut up.<eos> - Now for the cinnamon...<eos> - Okay, I got it.<eos> I got it. Got it.<eos> Well, I made the coffee.<eos> Well, I thought today, maybe, if you're up for it, we could go out onto...<eos> What is it?
If it's not real, what's the point?<eos> You don't have to put on a mask for me, Kenny.<eos> It helps me deal with myself.<eos> Kenny.<eos> Ok.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> Never again.<eos> Promise me, you're not gonna go marathon man at night anymore.<eos> It's not the vampires that I'm worried about.<eos> The wolf... The wolf can come out whenever it wants.
She's sending me a message.<eos> I'm supposed to help her.<eos> How did you pull this off?<eos> Club?<eos> Getting the vampires in line?<eos> After the virus, there was a pretty big vacuum of leadership, and I stepped in.<eos> Oh! Who would even try something like that?<eos> - It's me.<eos> - Suzanna?<eos> (Growling and snarling) The wolf can come out whenever it wants.
I'm sorry, I'm new to this.<eos> I'm not used to meeting people who understand.<eos> And how did you know what I was?<eos> I mean, I'm standing right next to you, pregnant and a werewolf, and I can't smell you.<eos> Yeah, I've been one longer.<eos> Normally, I wouldn't... come up to you, but I got a hit of...<eos> - not fear, distress, maybe.<eos> - Yup, that's me in nutshell.<eos> - I'm sorry this happened to you.<eos> - I hate that thing for what it did to me, so how is it possible for me to be grateful too.
I know.<eos> I'm sorry, work called, and it's crazy.<eos> - It's an all-hands kind of thing.<eos> - I just got off the phone with Nora.<eos> - She says it's a ghost town?<eos> - It's because it's a different wing.<eos> - Mm-hmm... - So...<eos> Look, I already put in for these 2 weeks off.<eos> I need to book something.<eos> - My clicker finger, it's getting itchy.
The kind that shimmer when the life just drains away from them.<eos> Don't you love that?<eos> If you wanna turn this into a game, that's fine with me.<eos> I'm strong, I'm in this, and I have nowhere else I need to be.<eos> Amy.<eos> Amy.<eos> Good.<eos> Talk about her.<eos> Well, what would you like me to talk about?<eos> That her blood was thick, and it tasted like cloves?
How can I forgive you when I don't think you fully understand what you've done?<eos> I am filth and you have never met anyone who has hated so much what he is.<eos> And that's why you gave me hope.<eos> Please...<eos> Please forgive me.<eos> Someone has to forgive me.<eos> That's enough!<eos> I have a name to give you as well.<eos> That of my very first kill.<eos> The name, it still tortures me.
Honestly though, I've seen you change, and every month, you hum and haw and hiss and pooh-pooh on it, and it really doesn't seem that bad.<eos> I'm just gonna say it.<eos> - Sally, I'm sorry.<eos> - Stop apologizing.<eos> Let me finish.<eos> You don't know what this curse is yet.<eos> You don't.<eos> You don't know what I've done to you.<eos> The wolf doesn't just change you physically.<eos> It changes who you are.
Oh, I think that's about to change.<eos> Aren't you going to work, Dad?<eos> One of us has to stay home with you guys.<eos> And your mom can't quit her job at Google.<eos> They need my help hunting down those self-driving cars that turned evil.<eos> Oh, you passed another rest stop!<eos> I am not stopping again.<eos> But I had a large soda!<eos> I said get the small!<eos> It was only 50 cents more!

Where's my money?<eos> Where's... my... mon... ey?<eos> It's been a rough patch, man.<eos> Hope you got something to cheer me up.<eos> Well, there is one fun fact<eos> I've been saving for an emergency situation.<eos> Did you know there really was a Duncan Hines?<eos> Where's my money?<eos> Do you have my money?<eos> Where is it?
But with slingshot in place of lamp.<eos> I wanted to fly.<eos> I know it sounds a little crazy now, but I suddenly thought maybe we can all fly, but somehow we've forgotten that we can.<eos> You don't still think that, do you?<eos> Hey, I'm not flying anywhere with this broken wing.<eos> Bart, here's another doctor that would like a few words with this young man.<eos> This hospital has another doctor?<eos> So they're transferring him to another hospital.<eos> Well, I hope he gets out soon and takes his bird back.<eos> I don't care for how it circles the cat.
Daughter!<eos> You are coming back to Japan!<eos> There are 87 old people who need you to take care of them.<eos> No.<eos> Please... Please.<eos> I was becoming cuddly.<eos> I deleted rants from my blog.<eos> You can retrieve rants if you did not empty your trash.<eos> Goodbye!<eos> Now I know I've got a heart... because it's breaking.
Mr. Simpson, I am the executive vice president of the World Football Federation.<eos> Ooh! What you Americans call "soccer."<eos> D'oh! I'm sure you are familiar with the World Cup, the quadrennial drama unmatched on the planet!<eos> Oh, yeah. That's the thing the guys at the dry cleaners get so excited about every four years.<eos> I'm afraid there has been an epidemic of referees being bribed to throw games.<eos> From the premier leagues to the playgrounds, all has been tainted.<eos> We need a symbol of integrity like yourself.<eos> Of course I am, but how do you know?<eos> Oh, your daughter's speech went viral.<eos> No, no, I mean it spread like wildfire.
Andres Cantor, you know that is incorrect usage.<eos> I have no control...!<eos> This job has taken its toll...!<eos> Eu gostaria de um...<eos> Hang on, hang on.<eos> ...placa de...<eos> Hang on, hang on.<eos> Here you go, honey.<eos> How'd you eat the meat without the vegetables?<eos> Well, the stomach wants what it wants.
I hate to think of the things this mirror has reflected.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> There's a signature that the frame covered up.<eos> "Johan Oldenveldt."<eos> Here he is!<eos> "Johan Oldenveldt, painter.<eos> "Lived in Amsterdam, Paris.<eos> Prolific early 20th century naturalist."<eos> Ooh, I think this was painted by someone famous.<eos> Maybe it's valuable.
I never even heard of that guy.<eos> It's not like it was painted by Leonardo Da Vinci Code.<eos> Now, here's what makes art valuable--<eos> One: nudity, two: holograms, three: something terrible happening to Jesus.<eos> Ah yes, seascape, marvelous natural light, classic use of gouache.<eos> You're right.<eos> This is an early-career Oldenveldt.<eos> Quite valuable.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I expect it to go somewhere between 80 to $100,000.
This is an early-career Oldenveldt.<eos> Quite valuable.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I expect it to go somewhere between 80 to $100,000.<eos> Nobody touch it!<eos> Bart, stop looking at it!<eos> But I want to see it!<eos> No, you'll wear it out!<eos> Baby, you saw something in this painting, and you were right.<eos> Wow, the Van Houtens owned this for years, and never knew how much it was worth.
Look, there are things you can forgive, and there are things you can't.<eos> So, which one is this?<eos> That's something you got to figure out for yourself.<eos> I got a bead on those tire treads, if you want to...<eos> What's up?<eos> So, the tires were only made for one kind of car.<eos> It's a 1989 Geo Metro.<eos> Town this small -- there's only one registered here.<eos> Deputy says it belongs to a guy named Roger who works night security down at the mill on the north side of town.<eos> So, this thing teleported, but it has a job and car.
It's Enochian.<eos> The message isn't for you.<eos> "Be afraid.<eos> Your Queen."<eos> Abaddon's getting more brazen.<eos> She thinks I'm losing my grip.<eos> Listen, you said Crowley was only useful till we got the Blade.<eos> We got the Blade.<eos> You know, boys, I'm in debt to you.<eos> You forced sobriety on me, and now I can see the situation for what it is.
Is this a party?<eos> She's your lure.<eos> Best a vamp could ask for.<eos> And you better believe you don't get that good at it unless you enjoy it.<eos> In her own sweet way...<eos> Girl's as bloodthirsty as any vampire.<eos> Easy.<eos> Sorry. Sorry.<eos> I made you a sandwich.<eos> It's out there if you want it.
We'll figure out the Mark later. Just hold on, okay?<eos> Get you some help.<eos> You will never get away with this.<eos> Get away with what?<eos> You told a silly story to a group of less-than-believers.<eos> I'll clean up your mess in an hour.<eos> You give our brothers and sisters far too little credit.<eos> They will soon learn that you have been playing them.<eos> And then?<eos> They will do nothing because they are frightened little sheep following my crook wherever it leads.
He worked in community outreach.<eos> And what does that mean?<eos> Some of my troops are stationed at a local hospital.<eos> They help where they can.<eos> Minor miracles -- it's nothing that would attention.<eos> So, what was he doing in that video, with the stabbing?<eos> The Enochian runes that were carved in his chest --<eos> I...<eos> I think that they were meant to focus energy.<eos> When he stabbed himself, it unleashed all that power.
Can you do that, Talia?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You want me to do it now?<eos> Just give us ten minutes.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You gotta push it all the way over here to the right.<eos> Looks like we're having engine trouble, folks.<eos> I'm gonna pull the bus over and take a look.<eos> There it is.<eos> I've already called another bus to take you on your way, so it should be here in a minute or two.
It's one hundred thousand.<eos> - Listen...<eos> - Your hand, please.<eos> When all's said and done, I'll give you an equal amount.<eos> Think it over, I'll call you this afternoon.<eos> I couldn't stand Milan anymore.<eos> Did you find the gift?<eos> Yeah, I found it.<eos> Like it?<eos> It's pretty.
Behind your eyes Does anyone know what there is<eos> Maybe you got feelings for me<eos> Never before someone has regarded me like you<eos> No one else will ever watch me like you<eos> A feeling that does not die<eos> Because it's all I have left<eos> Thinks another of you<eos> Is the sun bigger<eos> And warms you more<eos> And it beats, it beats hard
- The Gay there greets us. - Yes.<eos> Take on your jacket.<eos> It's cold.<eos> Never before has me someone regarded like you<eos> No one else will ever me watch like you<eos> A feeling that does not die<eos> Because it's all I've left<eos> Thinks another of you Is the sun bigger<eos> And warms you more<eos> And it beats, it beats hard,
- Do you remember me?<eos> - Tell him, Ody!<eos> And you?<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> What?<eos> You. Do you remember me?<eos> Your are out of mind.<eos> Damn.<eos> So, I give you all the money what I have here, okay?<eos> It is in the desk.
Girl, but I just wanted you to know... it should not be... uncomfortable.<eos> There is nothing else you want... you know... the right person...<eos> I loved it completely... and worshiped as the amazing guy you are.<eos> You took the words out of my mouth.<eos> Glad to know you so well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My name is Harrison Wells.<eos> Tonight, the future begins.<eos> The work that my team and I are going to do here... change our... understanding of physics.<eos> It will bring advances in energy, advances in medicine, and believe me, the future... becoming faster..., what they think.
That's just it.<eos> There was no outcome.<eos> We both know that power like that doesn't just vanish.<eos> I say someone stole it.<eos> I'd like to know who, And then I'd like to make an ally out of them.<eos> To what end, exactly?<eos> I'm tired of being threatened And controlled by our tyrant brother.<eos> If you want to stop a bully, You need the power to stand up to them.<eos> I expect such behavior from niklaus.<eos> It's so very disappointing when it comes From you, rebekah.
Wait.<eos> I know some people.<eos> There has to be some sort of...<eos> I don't know...<eos> Antidote or...<eos> Cami, I need you to promise me one thing, that when it gets bad, I need you to be as far away from me as possible.<eos> There has to be some sort of way.<eos> Of course there is.<eos> If you want to save your Uncle's life, all you have to do is take this...<eos> And make sure it ends up in Klaus Mikaelson's heart.
I love it.<eos> You have given me so much to work with.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> That's great.<eos> What about you, darling?<eos> What are you looking for in a man?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Whatever you think is best.<eos> Well, what's best is whatever your heart desires.<eos> So what does it desire?
I know.<eos> But if Opal finds out...<eos> What is it?<eos> Look at all these ugly shoes!<eos> Opal's a maid.<eos> She likes to be comfortable.<eos> Yeah, well, 10 pairs of black loafers?<eos> Come on!<eos> You know, once I get this bag packed, I'm sending you home.<eos> Is it stuck?
And the day my dream comes true, I'm gonna be as happy as you are.<eos> What if it doesn't come true?<eos> What?<eos> Well, lots of people have dreams that don't work out, Or they get their dream and then it goes wrong.<eos> That's not gonna happen to me.<eos> But what if it does?<eos> Won't you need something else in your life, Something that'll give you joy?<eos> My dream is gonna come true.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> It just has to.
And she's been going over the mess you've made of kenny's estate.<eos> So, we know you've been stealing from daddy hand over fist.<eos> That's a lie.<eos> Mr. Miller, I have statements from all your accounts, Even the ones in the cayman islands.<eos> I told you she was good at her job.<eos> This is all a big misunderstanding.<eos> I did move some money around, but I was investing it...<eos> For you...<eos> for the family.<eos> You shouldn't use that word, Since you don't know what it means.
Where were you?<eos> Well, first, we were in the shower...<eos> Not now, Javi.<eos> Zoila, grab your purse.<eos> You got to go with me.<eos> Listen to me, menso.<eos> You left after 20 years of marriage, destroying my self-confidence and my self-esteem.<eos> The one thing in this world I am sure of is that I don't have to go with you anywhere ever again.<eos> Valentina's in jail.<eos> The police found blood in her car, and she won't say where it came from.
Oh, my God.<eos> She didn't want me to call you guys, but I didn't know what else to do.<eos> Well, you did the right thing.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Do you know what happened?<eos> You'll have to ask her.<eos> Mija! What's going on?<eos> They said they found blood in your car.<eos> I know it looks bad, but I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> I swear. We're willing to believe her if she tells us whose blood it is and how it got there.
We can examine the results ourselves.<eos> Inject more rats?<eos> And see what happens.<eos> I should've known.<eos> They were never gonna use it for something good.<eos> Move a few genes here and there, activate the replication cycle.<eos> Bingo, you got yourself the perfect weapon.<eos> It wasn't my fault, right?<eos> How was I supposed to know it would go sideways?<eos> You can't make a virus and expect it to follow instructions, right?
Coffee?<eos> You're trying to scare me away?<eos> On the contrary.<eos> I'm here to reassure you.<eos> Some manage to survive.<eos> People who've won 100 million.<eos> Precisely!<eos> So many depressions, divorces, family feuds and destroyed families! Fingers severed for a PIN. Forgeries and suicide.<eos> Money drives people mad, Mrs Guerbette!<eos> It's the cause of 80 % of crimes!
Over there.<eos> Remember?<eos> Yeah... the rent-a-bike.<eos> You couldn't park it.<eos> With a load of angry protesters coming at me.<eos> That's what stressed me.<eos> It was sweet.<eos> And over there, remember what you said to me? The only time you came with me?<eos> What?<eos> You said this place was too green. It needed more concrete because the air was too pure.
Yes, we all do.<eos> Jenna, it's cool.<eos> I gotta get to class.<eos> So was he blowing me off because he thought<eos> I'd blown him off?<eos> I was confused.<eos> But I didn't have time to be, because I was working my way down the list, and I had to hurry if I was gonna fix my life.<eos> It's almost 7:00.<eos> Aren't you gonna eat?<eos> I can't, I have to finish this essay and make sure it captures the essence of my brand.
I had made Nonnatus House my home.<eos> When I needed peace and comfort, when I needed to grieve and to be restored, I did not go far.<eos> It was as though its roof still sheltered me, as though I was still safe within its walls.<eos> Sister Julienne, has the post gone yet?<eos> No.<eos> You're in luck.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> I don't wear this any more.<eos> I thought it could go to the Girls' Brigade donation for the home.
Vincent?<eos> You've got company.<eos> Can a man not sleep?<eos> Sorry to disturb you, sir.<eos> Is he a meths drinker?<eos> Not yet.<eos> He's my brother.<eos> He's been fighting the bottle since he opened his first pay packet.<eos> That's the trouble with drink.<eos> It hates those who love it most.
It's the Chinese, the Russians?<eos> Americans ?<eos> Aliens ?<eos> It is good, the program?<eos> He made three trips around are bed<eos> He sat, he stood up.<eos> He sat down again, he got up.<eos> It is exciting.<eos> - Well, he sits down.<eos> The phone, it is where?
It's still not you?<eos> It's not in your methods that.<eos> You, you're in the kind, I do everything fart.<eos> We know you, you know.<eos> Meanwhile, I can not believe.<eos> So who is it ?<eos> It is I who asks the questions tonight.<eos> - It is corked, it plonk.<eos> Give me a glass of water instead.<eos> Vire me this wine, it annoys me.
We shall never know where they are.<eos> I know.<eos> There is one year, six months before you enter the service, was raided in a certain Ribeiro.<eos> To arms trafficking.<eos> We found the weapons.<eos> And found an envelope with 100,000 euros.<eos> We not expected.<eos> The guy came out 5 years cupboard.<eos> So where does the money go?<eos> In fact, it was Fresnes .
If we lost that game, we wouldn't win anything so... it was a high risk game.<eos> 36 minutes in, almost a 7,000 gold advantage in favor of MUFC<eos> Toward the end of the game, we made a couple of mistakes that put two heroes on the sideline for us.<eos> And they had all five still up and decided that they were going to go for our Throne (Ancient).<eos> They're probably just going to push for the base.<eos> They're going GG!<eos> They want to go for the GG!<eos> No Fortification anymore!<eos> We were really close to losing our Throne.<eos> It's below 20 percent HP
Hello, Max.<eos> I'm dropping these off, they were my Albert's shoes.<eos> They shouldn't go to waste, you should sell them.<eos> I don't sell shoes, Mrs. Stevens.<eos> And his overcoat is in there too.<eos> It's very nice, you should wear it.
That diamond is not meant to be under bulletproof glass with a bunch of tourists in Bermuda shorts gawking at it.<eos> Better than being lost behind a brick wall.<eos> See ya.<eos> See ya.<eos> Hey, thanks for going all Terms of Endearment on the doctor for me.<eos> It was fun.<eos> Okay, that diamond is ours, Neal.<eos> We are gonna get it back.<eos> You want to rob the state department?<eos> Well, it hasn't gone there yet.
Let's lock down these neighborhoods, put an end to this thing.<eos> I agree with Lopez.<eos> If I thought that would make a difference, don't you think I would?<eos> All we can do is try to contain this.<eos> The only one who can stop this is Javier Acosta.<eos> Lopez: There are dead Lords all over the streets.<eos> You promised me this was over.<eos> Marciela, too?<eos> I know you're hurting, but if you don't stop hunting for Lavar Quintel's son, this was is gonna spin out of control.<eos> Ryan, I do not want to make your job any harder than it has to be, but we have the Lords on the ropes.
If you can bring me a juicier story in the next 48 hours, I'll publish it.<eos> If not, I'm running with what I've got on cyper.<eos> Rumor has it those red hawk savages were aiming for the market when they blew themselves up last night.<eos> Still convinced the humans aren't out to wipe us all off the face of their earth?<eos> Not all humans are Red Hawks, Drake.<eos> Look around you, Roman.<eos> Humans put us in this prison.<eos> That's why I don't make a distinction.<eos> Oh, that's right, you're a Trag now, you only see the world in black and white.<eos> Trags see the world how it is.
Good.<eos> We shall expect to hear from you presently.<eos> They say you can perform miracles, that you have seen the kingdom of God.<eos> You can see the kingdom of God.<eos> But you must be born again.<eos> Born again?<eos> How can you be... born again?<eos> You must be reborn.<eos> Not in the flesh, but in a spirit.<eos> The wind blows where it wishes.

We know that you subscribe to bridal magazines.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> So there's no denying it.<eos> That is unfortunate.<eos> No, it's not. You're supposed to share your dreams with your friends.<eos> Okay, fine, I'll share.<eos> I do want what you guys have, okay?<eos> Can I jump off this roof now?<eos> Kate, you're gonna have a wedding.<eos> And it's gonna be beautiful.
- Hi! - April.<eos> Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you.<eos> Peyton talks about you and your daughter nonstop.<eos> - Oh! - I'm Samantha.<eos> It is so great to meet you, Samantha.<eos> Come on in.<eos> My husband's getting the wine from the car.<eos> You wouldn't, by chance, have a decanter, would you?<eos> It's a 1955 chÃ¢teau haut-brion.<eos> It really should breathe.
Clear?<eos> I got it.<eos> Do your thing.<eos> The fetus's vitals are stable.<eos> Good.<eos> Drill?<eos> If we can relieve the pressure on Gabriella's brain, with any luck, she can carry this baby to term.<eos> I'm inserting the drill.<eos> How many weeks until the baby's due?<eos> It's viable now, so I can do a C-section if necessary.
Uh... rolling.<eos> I am standing in front of the neurological research and treatment center, known as the Cube, where my aunt, Dr. Catherine Black, is the director.<eos> She's been called the Marco Polo of the brain.<eos> She's pretty awesome.<eos> My aunt's a role model for me.<eos> So happy to see you.<eos> - You look amazing.<eos> - So do you.<eos> I-I love this shirt.<eos> - It is so cool.
Little anxious to go home, but otherwise, lovely.<eos> Well, I'm happy to tell you that you can go home.<eos> We've had all your test results back.<eos> Everything is fine, including the spinal tap.<eos> You do not have M.S.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> I have figured out what you do have, though, by process of elimination.<eos> It's called Charles Bonnet syndrome.<eos> What is that?<eos> In bonnet, the mind remembers that it used to see, and it misses vision, it misses seeing.

He arrived at 8:45 A.M. on an Arabian stallion.<eos> Anything you ask, Leo has his usual elaborate answer.<eos> He always answers yes, and he's almost always wrong.<eos> Ignore her, Dr. Black.<eos> She's obviously jealous.<eos> Do you really believe that, Leo?<eos> Bickman arrived on a stallion?<eos> I saw it when I got off the bus.<eos> What color was the horse?<eos> Was it... was it pink?
I know this must be upsetting seeing your work right now.<eos> But I needed you to see images that you were familiar with so you could recognize the colors.<eos> Will you put this headset on?<eos> Okay, and we are streaming.<eos> Now, do you remember what color you painted Cara's lips?<eos> Red.<eos> Good.<eos> Focus on it.<eos> That is the sound of red.<eos> Red is at the bottom of the visual spectrum, so it has the lowest frequency.
All right, let's close him up.<eos> I think we hit a vessel.<eos> Get suction.<eos> Suction.<eos> Clip.<eos> Clip.<eos> I got it.<eos> It's clear.<eos> Bleeding has stopped.<eos> The hematoma worsened slightly, but it's still very small.
I feel personally responsible.<eos> Joey and I are so grateful you're taking care of him.<eos> We trust you.<eos> Well, the result was damage to part of Joey's brain.<eos> No, his... his brain is okay.<eos> He's still Joey.<eos> No, he understands everything.<eos> Don't you, Joey?<eos> Most of your brain is fine...<eos> It's working perfectly.
Fun.<eos> You a new guy, huh?<eos> How do you like Gotham so far?<eos> Well enough.<eos> See you around.<eos> Oh, hey. Everything all right back there?<eos> It's always good to see you, Harvey.<eos> Wow. And look at you in your excellent suit.<eos> You know, I'm so happy you don't have to wear that silly uniform anymore.<eos> You told me it looked good.
Yeah, I want to show you something.<eos> - Is it Peter? - No.<eos> His status is unchanged.<eos> Still no brain activity.<eos> Have a look at this.<eos> I used your protocols and a modified compound I've been experimenting with.<eos> I substituted multiple residues at these two binding sites,<eos> Added a tetrahydrofuran carbamate here, a triazine ring here, all to reduce stearic interaction.<eos> And that's taking the virus longer to break the SODRAs down.<eos> But it still does in the end.
Why not?<eos> Things just happen.<eos> But...<eos> But there's a pattern out there, like... like us meeting.<eos> There's no pattern.<eos> Your brother killed my sister.<eos> Well, what do you want me to say?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And that day...<eos> That day messed up my entire life, and I'm guessing it did a number on your family.
What if they come back to your house?<eos> Well, if they do, they're not gonna like what they find.<eos> - I'm sorry about this. - No.<eos> I-I've been too much trouble, I'm...<eos> No, you haven't.<eos> Nothing to be sorry about, Eva.<eos> I need to have a word with this guy first, all right?<eos> You're late.<eos> Dang stray dog...<eos> I tried to catch it, but it eluded me.
Ex-husband.<eos> And yes. That is such a load of crap, Howard.<eos> FRANCIS: Gentlemen, Bob is right.<eos> This sort of cat-fighting gets out in the press, whichever one of you wins hits the ground limping.<eos> Let's keep it clean and bring some civility back to the House.<eos> Can we agree to that?<eos> I'd feel a lot better if you shook hands on it.<eos> I'm with him right now, Christina.<eos> I'm off. I'll swing by your office later.<eos> Don't. It's not ready yet.
I doubt it, but we could try.<eos> You think Tusk isn't planning his next attack even as we speak?<eos> We've been thorough, sir.<eos> He doesn't leave footprints.<eos> You want to shift tactics?<eos> The casino.<eos> We go public as soon as possible.<eos> You said that was a last resort.<eos> Seth, you need to find a way to make that happen so it doesn't link to us.<eos> If we launch that missile, it could blow us up too.
- Yeah, I got it.<eos> - What does it mean?<eos> - It's strange, it doesn't make sense.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> - "Pursue currency" would be the most literal translation.<eos> Or "pursue money."<eos> - Follow the money? - That could work.<eos> Thanks, Lynne.<eos> I like what you've done.<eos> This sofa, it's new?
- How was California?<eos> - Oh... Exhausting.<eos> Twelve events in two days.<eos> - Is this the Golden Gate?<eos> - Yes. I had an etching right there.<eos> The capitol before it was finished.<eos> Took 85 years to complete it.<eos> - How long did it take to complete the bridge?<eos> - About four years.<eos> It opened a few months after FDR's second inaugural.
Leave it with me.<eos> You all right?<eos> Hey, Booms, take over for a sec.<eos> Awesome !<eos> How's that bank balance, Miss Miles?<eos> N o, Franky. The phone was a one-off.That's it.<eos> We could make it a regular deal if you want.<eos> - Did you get rid of it?<eos> - I want that phone gone.<eos> - It's nearly flat anyway.
Big Head, there is a personal ad section on this asperger site.<eos> Holy shit, this one is looking for a "relationship that has the potential to become sexual in nature."<eos> Boy, is she on the spectrum.<eos> She can't even make eye contact with the camera.<eos> Richard, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> - Solo. - Mm-hmm.<eos> We need to talk about Pied Piper.<eos> What about it?<eos> The website's up and running,<eos> I'm just redesigning the compression. It just needs users.
Thank you.<eos> Did I get the shawl twirl right?<eos> I real... I want to get it right.<eos> Perfect.<eos> It was perfect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But let me show you something.<eos> One twirl. Okay.<eos> That way.<eos> So... this shawl has danced across the stages of the world, and now it's yours.
Lillian, we seized thousands of tons of cocaine based on Hector's intel.<eos> We brought down some real monsters crossing the border.<eos> How did you get that video?<eos> Were you surveilling the senator or Hector?<eos> Ah. Well, we knew Hector was unhappy with the Geo-9.<eos> He had made some threats.<eos> So, prophylactically, we got the NSA to monitor all comint into and out of the committee.<eos> We didn't anticipate the kidnapping.<eos> That was bold, even for Hector.<eos> You adopted a lion cub, fed it raw meat, and feigned shock when it grew up liking the taste of blood.
You broke your word to me, cabrón!<eos> That was not me.<eos> It was others, Hector.<eos> And I'm prepared to make you an offer.<eos> Killing the satellite deal is the only offer I am interested in.<eos> The satellite is going through.<eos> Then we have nothing to talk about, hermano.<eos> But I'm prepared to give you the codes.<eos> You have my attention.<eos> You'll have access to the satellite at any given time and the intel it gathers.
No, we don't need to talk.<eos> You need to step off.<eos> Or what, Johnny?<eos> You know better than to ask me that.<eos> Did he threaten you?<eos> It's just the way he says hello.<eos> Don't shoot, bro.<eos> Might need that bullet.<eos> You said this place was clear.<eos> It is.
But you seem vigorous as ever.<eos> Well, you know I have a robust appetite.<eos> Indeed.<eos> I must say, I'm very happy to see you clean shaven.<eos> As you remember.<eos> Mm.<eos> (Gasps)<eos> (Grunts)<eos> For weeks, I have imagined this moment.<eos> I rejoice that it has finally arrived.
I feel very connected to you right now.<eos> Just admit it.<eos> She is my soul mate.<eos> No!<eos> That girl is not your soul mate!<eos> As many times as Cal has been wrong, this time he just happens to be right.<eos> Kacey was born in the small town right next to Cal's.<eos> Dr. Nesbit delivered her right before he put out a fire.<eos> Just like Cal, Kacey was an only child whose parents adored her.<eos> Kacey was upbeat and positive, and, just like Cal, she followed her heart wherever it lead her.
That's a shame.<eos> He's always been unreliable. He blows with the wind.<eos> Colonel Jocelyn will be here and the search will begin.<eos> M. de Saint-Hilaire has a boat.<eos> He's leaving for Holland.<eos> A boat could pick up some passengers.<eos> It'd be easy.<eos> And they won't need the summer house.<eos> Henri-Charles wants the passage destroyed.<eos> The wood's dry. It'll burn easily.
Do... do you think we spend too much time together?<eos> We work together!<eos> Come on.<eos> And if it wasn't work...<eos> But it is.<eos> All right, it's work.<eos> Right, right, so whatever!<eos> Anyway, men are idiots, including you.<eos> So, if you'll excuse me, I have to go call Stephanie and tell her that you have herpes.<eos> The guy at the store said it welcomes good energy and peace but also possibly bees, F.Y.I.
You're gonna make an effort tomorrow, right?<eos> You know what? At the moment, I don't even want to go tomorrow.<eos> Honestly, I'd rather you not go, either, if you're gonna act like this.<eos> Wh... are you un-inviting me?<eos> You just said...<eos> No!<eos> I'm going!<eos> For Grandma June.<eos> And I'm bringing my soap dish.<eos> It was good enough for Eleanor Roosevelt.
We're doing everything we can.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> Vega's always been reckless, but this is extreme, even for her.<eos> And you planted this.<eos> Drake can be trusted.<eos> How can this leaf wipe out an entire race?<eos> It's not the leaf, Roman.<eos> It's the spores.<eos> Let me show you.<eos> When a black cyper bush grows, eventually it releases all of its spores into the air.
It's my job to invite you.<eos> - Why not come to ours?<eos> - There's a leg of lamb for you.<eos> I insist.<eos> Come.<eos> Granny had the same.<eos> I must've been 7 or 8.<eos> Granny Jeannie in Romorantin.<eos> Remember, Jean?<eos> We almost bought a big bistro mirror but it was speckled.
You're heavy.<eos> You're heavy, I said.<eos> You're heavy.<eos> That's dangerous.<eos> Why'd you do that?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Do you hurt somewhere? Hurt?<eos> My heart.<eos> The other day... that typhoon hit us hard.<eos> It brought in lots of gravel.
We'll finish it together.<eos> When your great eye looked to the heavens, what did it see?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> There is no God.<eos> Certainly not with that attitude.<eos> God gave you purpose - Not only to create art, but to become it.<eos> Why are you helping me?<eos> Your eye will now see God reflected back.<eos> It will see you.
Occam's broom.<eos> You intentionally ignored facts that refute your argument<eos> - hoping nobody'd notice. - You noticed.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I wanted to dispel your doubts once and for all.<eos> My doubts about what?<eos> Me.<eos> I want you to believe in the best of me, just as I believe in the best of you.<eos> This crime offered us both reasonable doubt.<eos> It offered us a distraction.
I take my medication. And I work very hard.<eos> And I'm proof that mental illness is treatable.<eos> I don't know if you remember me, but I met you outside of Dr. Lecter's office.<eos> I remember it.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> Well, as it turns out, you are famous.<eos> You're not exactly anonymous yourself, Margot.<eos> Did you, uh, sneak a peek inside Dr. Lecter's calendar?<eos> Yeah, it is exactly what I did.<eos> It's cold.
Come closer.<eos> I want to see you.<eos> Can you see you?<eos> Clearer and clearer.<eos> You forced me to kill you.<eos> I didn't force you to enjoy it.<eos> You made me a monument.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> The monument is not to me;<eos> it's to you.
It's about us.<eos> It's about... family.<eos> I want you to be proud of me too, Margot.<eos> You're all I have.<eos> And, uh... I'm all you have.<eos> And this little piggy went "eeeeeeeeee-eeeeeee-eeee," all the way home.<eos> - It sounds like I'm killing it.<eos> - You are killing it.<eos> Don't kill it.<eos> A theremin is an instrument that can create exquisite music without ever needing to be touched, but... it requires the rare gift of perfect pitch to play properly.
- You said--<eos> - I lied.<eos> Did you know?<eos> I was aware of Margot's goal of having a child.<eos> I was not aware you were the means to achieving it.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Nothing... or as much as you'd like to give.<eos> As much as I would like to give?<eos> I always thought men were an optional extra in childrearing, so... I'm not opposed to a male influence.<eos> As long as it's not my brother.
Music is ridiculous.<eos> And what folly, the national anthem, as a military parade.<eos> This hymn is hideous.<eos> Do you know the Ega theory of national anthems?<eos> For him, a hymn is the musical definition of the temperament of a people.<eos> The rate of the hymn reflects the moral movement of a nation.<eos> According Ega, La Marseillaise advance swords.<eos> God Save the Queen drags behind him a royal cape.<eos> And Portuguese anthem?<eos> It sways in tail-coats.
This is an undeniable reality, but we have pledged our lives to make sure that humanity does not share that fate.<eos> Now, while there is still time, we must come together and face this crisis head on.<eos> I believe it will bring out the best in us... our strength, our humanity, our faith... that we will come together in this time of uncertainty.<eos> My husband was killed for trying to warn us.<eos> In 12 hours, 320 people will be sacrificed to extend our oxygen supply unless we take action.<eos> [Pounding on door]<eos> Guard:<eos> Dr. Abigail Griffin, open this door immediately.<eos> The future doesn't belong to the chancellor or the council.<eos> It belongs to all of us.
God, I hate time zones.<eos> Does the Kremlin know?<eos> Hetty and the White House are on the phone with them.<eos> Correction.<eos> Was on the phone.<eos> The Russian president just informed us.<eos> The missile launched five minutes ago.<eos> We were too late.<eos> According to the Russian military, the missile was supposed to detonate harmlessly in the Arctic Ocean.<eos> But with the way the Chechens have altered GLONASS, it will now strike San Francisco in 31 minutes.

If the U.S. declares war on Russia, mission accomplished.<eos> Is the missile nuclear?<eos> No, but it is carrying over 900 pounds of fuel-air explosive.<eos> Thermoberic.<eos> Turns air to fire.<eos> Can't we send a command self-destruct to the missile?<eos> There isn't one.<eos> It's designed to be tamperproof.<eos> That includes radio-controlled commands.<eos> Look, the only way the missile will self-destruct is if it goes off-course

- This is...<eos> - More than four sexual references in a ten-card Rorschach test is a strong indicator for schizophrenia.<eos> That's funny.<eos> Okay, not funny.<eos> They almost look like<eos> - they could be rug patterns. - They are.<eos> It's a Shindand design.<eos> Major export of Afghanistan.<eos> I've brought home a few myself.<eos> There's only one Afghan rug store in Culver City; it's down on La Cienega.
Did I do something wrong?<eos> Carrying a concealed weapon requires a permit.<eos> It's unloaded and-and broken.<eos> I just keep it to scare people in case I'm robbed.<eos> Where were you going with the cash?<eos> The bank. It belongs to my customers.<eos> That's a lot of cash.<eos> Hawala business must be doing pretty good.<eos> ♪ We treat your money as if ♪<eos> ♪ It were ours.
Unless he's sending a message.<eos> He's gonna know we're coming.<eos> hon hasn't seen us for seven years.<eos> We've evolved.<eos> He's evolved, too.<eos> In 2007, mercenaries tried to overthrow Equatorial Guinea.<eos> The same Equatorial Guinea that lost - a diplomat this morning. Mm-hmm.<eos> Oil-rich, terrible human rights record.<eos> Unstable regime.<eos> Tuhon led the coup, but it failed.
And you are so much less irritating than spending time with Deeks in a car.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think.<eos> So, how long ago did that warehouse manager sent the text?<eos> Uh, 92 minutes and 30 seconds.<eos> Mm. You know what they say about a watched pot.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Eventually, it's got to boil.<eos> Showtime, guys.<eos> The GPS in the case of wine says it's on the move.
Get those to the FBI, LAPD and Homeland Security while you're at it.<eos> I'll tell Kensi and Deeks to meet you at the high-rise.<eos> Gentlemen?<eos> Come back in one piece.<eos> Talk to me, Eric.<eos> What do we got?<eos> The building has a closed-circuit security system.<eos> So we're going in blind?<eos> Unfortunately, yes.<eos> This building would meet earthquake codes, which means it rests on shock absorbers filled with oil.
The whole place was wired.<eos> They used a plastic-coated, multi-strand stainless steel.<eos> It's really popular with people who...<eos> like to blow other people up.<eos> Sam?<eos> RDX.<eos> Like a cheaper, more accessible C4.<eos> Well, this thing's best days are behind it.<eos> So is this right arm.<eos> Actually it's only missing a left.
Look at that, huh?<eos> You can see yourself, like a mirror.<eos> All right, you're ready for the world.<eos> Not bad.<eos> Get yourself a... haircut.<eos> Right.<eos> Thanks, boss.<eos> Punk didn't even tip me.<eos> What about the mic, Deeks?<eos> It's secure.
You can do it.<eos> Hello.<eos> Miss Peyton, I have your daughter.<eos> But you already know that, don't you?<eos> Are you alone?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're lying.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I'm in my office, and the door is locked.<eos> That's strange, because I'm looking in your office right now, and it appears to be empty.
I can't access any cameras in the garage.<eos> She's stopped.<eos> Jessica.<eos> She ditched her car.<eos> And us.<eos> Mr. Callen?<eos> What's your status?<eos> We're screwed.<eos> What about her cell phone, Eric?<eos> It's still in the parking garage.
We've been perfecting our game since high school, so...<eos> - I'm thinking about making some big life changes tonight, ladies.<eos> But [Sighs] I have no game.<eos> It's like a medical condition.<eos> I-I put myself out there with this guy, and then he turned out to be super-sketchy.<eos> Do we know her?<eos> No, I just...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just feel like I don't have the 411 on what gets you down in the groove.<eos> And I-I feel like maybe my milkshake never will bring a boy to the yard, and... may... and I'll never be able to drop it like it's hot.
We're gonna need you in the operating theater.<eos> We're doing your galvanic procedure.<eos> Ah! Will you be assisting me?<eos> No, I'll be assisting Gallinger.<eos> It's his patient.<eos> What will I be doing?<eos> Just talking him through the procedure.<eos> That's all.<eos> His pulse, Mrs. Gamble?<eos> It don't feel like it did before.
As your friend, I should be admitting you for observation right now.<eos> That's exactly what I'm afraid of.<eos> I just got back to my family, Sam.<eos> I don't want to end up in quarantine.<eos> Just give me some time to figure it out before I tell John.<eos> At the Humanichs Project we recognize that we live in a world of machines.<eos> Most of us interact with one form or another from the time we wake up until the time we go to sleep.<eos> We've outsourced many of our day-to-day activities to robots that have made our lives way more efficient, but in the process we've removed the all-important element of human connection.<eos> Deep down, we all know that robots are not really human.<eos> A Medi-Assist bot has 100% accuracy rating when administering a vaccine, but it cannot comfort a child who's afraid of the needle.

I hope you find someone to love you.<eos> I hope you find someone to love.<eos> Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to bear witness to the matrimony of these two men.<eos> This is a relationship that stands for love and loyalty.<eos> This is a relationship that stands for honesty and trust.<eos> But most importantly, this is a relationship that stands for friendship.<eos> Because before they were lovers, they were friends, and it is this seed of friendship that love was their destiny.<eos> One cannot dictate or determine the course of love.<eos> For if love finds you worthy, then love directs you.<eos> It is this sacred and holy estate which you enter into as one.
Mr. Nightingale!<eos> I fear these pirates have been shadowing us<eos> - since we left port.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because they know you're on board and wish to acquire your invention.<eos> - I'll tell them nothing.<eos> - You'll tell them everything, because they'll torture you.<eos> They'll cut the secrets from your brain as they'd hack a ring from your finger.<eos> But your device is the property of the king.<eos> I can't allow it to fall into their hands.
I have to keep Mr. Nightingale alive, or Blackbeard will have me murdered.<eos> But I can't allow myself to be murdered until I've destroyed Mr. Nightingale's scarlet logbook.<eos> I see.<eos> So you're not really a physician, then?<eos> Oh, I am that.<eos> But I grant you, it's not all that I am.<eos> Can the cipher be broken?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Eventually.<eos> But it's eminently complex.
Your prison.<eos> I've been in worse.<eos> If you provide a false translation, I'll know it, and you'll be disciplined.<eos> You may consider the point well made, Madam.<eos> So Blackbeard must keep you alive until you've decoded those pages?<eos> Indeed, he must.<eos> Because they explain the secret of how to build the chronometer.<eos> Indeed.<eos> And the chronometer can reckon longitude at sea?<eos> It can.
Don't tempt her.<eos> You're a bad man.<eos> - No, no, no, not me.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> The club's been getting busy, so... it's a luxury having one of us at home.<eos> A few more weeks of Adam's cooking, and I'm not gonna be able to chase anyone anywhere.<eos> - Nice.<eos> - Guilty as charged.<eos> Hey speaking of home, how's the new place?<eos> It's great.
Because I told him not to.<eos> I didn't know if we could trust you people.<eos> Now I guess it's a moot point.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> ...but what we do know-- just to recap-- is that 5 cult members were killed today and a sixth was captured and taken into custody.<eos> I'd say that date with my brother just saved your life.<eos> You're gonna stage this to make it look like the Reverend killed me and then split, but nobody's gonna believe that.<eos> Oh, when they dig around, I think they'll realize that the Reverend isn't quite as godly as he appeared to be.<eos> Where's my bloody knife?<eos> Sweetie, it's right there.
This way you won't have to stop along the way.<eos> They have surveillance cameras everywhere these days.<eos> Hey, hon. You like apples?<eos> They're okay.<eos> Got any candy?<eos> The apples will do just fine.<eos> Jana, tell me about Corbin.<eos> Corbin?<eos> Yeah, the original plan before Roderick found Havenport.<eos> Well, it's still there as far as I know.
It's not the same virus.<eos> What is it?<eos> Dr. Creepenstein was working on the next phase of his virus.<eos> When Nadia was sick, he was experimenting on her blood and then he figured out a way to extract werewolf venom from her blood and put it into the virus.<eos> Hey, what do you mean werewolf venom?<eos> That means it's fatal.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You don't think I would just drop this on you without a silver lining?<eos> There's an antidote.<eos> It just requires you to come meet me.
Well, obviously not.<eos> Dingdong! Invite me in.<eos> We can hear you just fine from there.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry I interrupted whatever weird ritual you two were doing, but I just want to de-passenger the great citizens of Mystic Falls using your magical traveler knife, so hand it over.<eos> That's gonna be a problem.<eos> 5 words that make want to vamp-toss my keys into your chest cavity.<eos> Little Gilbert, help me in the fight against my dark side and elaborate, please.<eos> - We can't find it.<eos> - As in you lost it?<eos> As in it's not here.
Here, take a look.<eos> In a way, burying himself in the distant past gave Frank an ability to escape the recent.<eos> While I was in the army,<eos> Frank had served in London in intelligence, overseeing spies and running covert operations.<eos> See, I think this might've been the kitchen.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Mm.<eos> I would say that's probably a hearth.<eos> Strange.<eos> I have no evidence that my ancestor visited this castle, but it was within his operational sphere, so... it's just possible that he walked these very halls.
Help me get him up.<eos> Come on.<eos> Lift.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Gunshot wound.<eos> The idiot could have said something.<eos> It's a clean exit.<eos> I think the round's gone straight through the muscle.<eos> I don't think it's serious, but he's lost a lot of blood.<eos> It'll need to be disinfected before I can dress it properly.
And that contraption...<eos> It's ingenious, I know.<eos> No more nights of nursing my sore, tired arms from all that cranking.<eos> All right.<eos> Do you remember when you were...<eos> Must have been about three or four...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> ...and you got your hand stung by a bumblebee?<eos> Do you remember?<eos> It swelled up to the size of your head.
Yes, sir.<eos> - Who has to tell the senator?<eos> Looks like a double tap to the back of the head.<eos> - Small caliber fid at close range.<eos> - .22, maybe.<eos> Execution-style.<eos> What?<eos> You think we're looking at a hit?<eos> - What, Maura?<eos> What is it?
- On the Q.T.<eos> - The Q.T.<eos> Off course I'm accepting support of all kinds.<eos> It's funny.<eos> I have something that I need to speak with you about on the...<eos> - Q.T. also.<eos> - And what's that?<eos> Does the name Eileen Brenner mean anything to you?<eos> I meet a lot of people.<eos> - Should it?
- Al, will you marry me?<eos> - Thought you'd never ask.<eos> - What can I get you, sir?<eos> - I'll have your best Irish whiskey, neat.<eos> You could order a Martini or something, Al.<eos> Irish whiskey is a little cop part, don't you think?<eos> I like the taste my whiskey.<eos> How do I look?<eos> Suit's a little tight.<eos> Ah, that's 'cause it fits.
- Mr...?<eos> - Keefer.<eos> All these people have someplace else to be.<eos> I'm sure your network can do the news without you.<eos> You're probably right, but I'd hate for my boss to find that out.<eos> Take your seat.<eos> Uh, look, you don't want leaders on the jury, right?<eos> Anyone who can take charge during deliberations.<eos> I run a news broadcast five nights a week with a staff of 60 and I bend them to my will.<eos> Plus, I'm currently the defendant in two lawsuits being brought by the same person, so even though I bought your client's bagel slicer at 3:00 A.M. and it nearly took my fingers off, there is simply no way in hell that I am finding for the plaintiff.
This is gonna go on for a while.<eos> Elliot's on his way to Boston, Terry's on maternity leave, and we'll be a couple of anchors short.<eos> We'll take long shifts and double up. - Clear.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> The explosions were 12 seconds apart and right now we've got 14 confirmed injuries, but that number is obviously not gonna hold.<eos> - Critical?<eos> - We're hearing about amputations.<eos> - Thank you. - It was a good speech before.<eos> Was it?<eos> 'Cause I didn't think it was nearly specific...
