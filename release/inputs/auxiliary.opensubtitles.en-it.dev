The little one knows karate, and the big one fights dirty.<eos> Don't say a word.<eos> I track three Chinese vessels on intercept with the Colorado.<eos> I have lost contact.<eos> Colorado, this is EWS.<eos> Please respond.<eos> Colorado--<eos> Get out. This is a secure facility.<eos> Does Julian know what you're doing?<eos> Yes, he does.
But that's not what this is.<eos> You're not done fighting, Sam, but... I'm all out of moves.<eos> So...<eos> I'm asking you as my friend...<eos> I can't do this with you here.<eos> You know I signed up 'cause I didn't know what else to do.<eos> You know that.<eos> I was just looking for something. I was looking for something, I was looking for anything... anything to believe in.<eos> I didn't know what to fight for.<eos> But I do now.
And I'm not 22 anymore.<eos> If I don't make it soon, it's not gonna happen.<eos> But think of what you're becoming.<eos> All for a couple of gold records?<eos> Will it be worth it?<eos> When I get the gold records, I'll let you know.<eos> Wow.<eos> You are not the girl I thought you were.<eos> I guess that means you don't want to go to dinner with me anymore?<eos> No. I don't.
I'm doing it for Alejandro, not you.<eos> Well, I know I owe you one, so I came to tell you, i-if you ever need anything, a favor, all you have to do is ask.<eos> There is one thing.<eos> Okay.<eos> Name it.<eos> Don't go to the party.<eos> What?<eos> Ten years, I work for Alejandro.<eos> Never once has he invited me to a party.<eos> I do so much for him, but he never...
Oh, they're hoisting another rhino onto that ship down there!<eos> That is Otto!<eos> Uh, I don't think that's quite right. What's that?<eos> No, it's-- it's not "hiccup."<eos> Do you have the hiccups, little Holmsy?<eos> Boo! Ahh!<eos> And stop! Did you see that, Viggo?<eos> He winked at me!<eos> I thought you had dropped your teeth in the Atlantic Ocean.<eos> I did, kids.
You coming back in?<eos> Yeah. In a bit.<eos> Have you had a nice trip?<eos> Yeah it's been great seeing Nash and Dillon.<eos> You too.<eos> You gonna be okay when I go home?<eos> I think I can handle it.<eos> Your dad said he would meet you at the airport.<eos> And uh that I should check and make sure you finished all of your English and Algebra homework.<eos> I did.
- I'm serious.<eos> - So am I.<eos> He was loaded, he was maudlin, he was self-pitying, he was totally abusive.<eos> What about drug use?<eos> I did not see any.<eos> But my guess... is yes.<eos> - And you didn't say anything?<eos> - I look like a drug counselor to you?<eos> Did he say anything at all about Internal Affairs?<eos> No, sir, he did not.
Now... you have a question for me.<eos> Well, all your estimates are based on a fixed value for the euro, but given the current volatility of the European market, doesn't that make all your findings completely irrelevant?<eos> Gut punch.<eos> Well, uh, that certainly is an interesting point that you raise.<eos> I think, uh, what I was trying to get at was, um...<eos> Mr. Dunbar?<eos> To be honest, Tim, I had the same question.<eos> - Oh, thank God.<eos> I heard something about an after-party.<eos> Oh, yeah, you did.
I mean, that was supposed to go in the vault. Hmm?<eos> The vault, like "seinfeld"?<eos> Not everyone has heard of that show.<eos> They have.<eos> We are an open group. We tell each other everything.<eos> We don't have any vaults.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Heck, yeah, j-bird.<eos> I got vaults.<eos> OF COURSE I DO, JULES.

I'm gonna hit the sack.<eos> Hey, we just had a guy who bailed on us.<eos> You play hold 'em?<eos> Yeah, but I should probably, uh-<eos> What's the buy-in?<eos> Jay-<eos> Say hello to, uh, Marty, Bugs-<eos> How ya doin', Jay?<eos> My ex-husband Hugo- Hi.<eos> How you doing?
Okay, but we are not giving up, all right?<eos> We're like Goldilocks.<eos> The first bar was too young, the second was- whatever that was, and the third will be just right.<eos> Mitchell.<eos> Three bears.<eos> I mean-right?<eos> Here.<eos> This one.<eos> You wanted to feel young.<eos> And I do.
I've seen all I need to see, Kate.<eos> I want to invest in your line of clothing.<eos> Really?<eos> Yes!<eos> Now tell me, what's our business plan?<eos> Well, it depends. If I had enough money, I'd put a show together for Fashion Week in New York.<eos> That way, I'd be able to... Pack your bags for New York, because I'm gonna write you a check for $50,000.<eos> What?<eos> ! Sam, did you hear that?<eos> Uh, yeah, I did.
Hey, Lyndsey.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> I'm on Walden's Jet.<eos> - I'm flying to New York City.<eos> - For what?<eos> A fashion show, maybe take in a musical.<eos> Ah. Guys' weekend.<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> Um, so anyhow, I just wanted to... make sure you still love me.<eos> Of course I do.
- I'm so sorry.<eos> You said nothing. - Okay.<eos> - Honestly, you didn't say anything.<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> You're... Besides just being so great and perfect and...<eos> All right.<eos> What is it, sweetie?<eos> Please don't tell anyone this, but... I want to be happy.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Of course you do. Everyone does.
Oh, yeah?<eos> - You want to go in?<eos> - I'm too young.<eos> Come on.<eos> Antoine, how old is she?<eos> Jeff, this is my daughter.<eos> And she's a musician.<eos> And last time I checked, this is still New Orleans, right?<eos> If they subpoena you and you did give grand jury testimony, it's up to the feds whether to call you or not when it goes to trial.<eos> If it ever does.
Dog shit?<eos> Cut!<eos> Cut! Cut!<eos> Cut!<eos> Don't worry. We'll fix it in post.<eos> Kid Ory, my ass.<eos> Hey, Davis.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Oh, wait, who brought beignets?<eos> I did.
- ( playback stops ) - Fuck this. Marvin.<eos> - What?<eos> - I hate this.<eos> Adam, don't you agree with me?<eos> I am trying to help you here.<eos> I don't want that kind of help.<eos> I want you to take all that shit off... all the reverb, all the digital decoration sweetener Auto-Tune bullshit.<eos> I don't want it to be perfect.<eos> I want my songs to sound like me.<eos> - They do.
- What?<eos> - I hate this.<eos> Adam, don't you agree with me?<eos> I am trying to help you here.<eos> I don't want that kind of help.<eos> I want you to take all that shit off... all the reverb, all the digital decoration sweetener Auto-Tune bullshit.<eos> I don't want it to be perfect.<eos> I want my songs to sound like me.<eos> - They do.<eos> - Oh, the fuck they do.

But believe you me, there is so much more that I find annoying about you that I haven't even gotten to race.<eos> Now, I'm gonna get some frozen yogurt.<eos> Would you like anything?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll have a vanilla chocolate swirl. - No.<eos> - What, no...<eos> I'll have strawberry with jimmies.<eos> Did you get that?<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?
I'm not depressed.<eos> You're depressed.<eos> You're a depressed person.<eos> You can stay as long as you want.<eos> I know.<eos> Staten Island's a big metaphor. Do you get that?<eos> All these people, they want to live in Manhattan, but they end up on this fucked-up, weird little island watching the city in the distance with this quiet, just, rage just burning in their hearts.<eos> So you're done spilling seed over Hannah?<eos> No longer experiencing the strong emotions?<eos> No, I did enough of that.
You think you enjoyed hanging out with me or my work more?<eos> Honestly, I think I probably just-- I fell in love with the idea of you.<eos> Like it'd be cool to know you--<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Fuck this!<eos> See, this is exactly why I can't hang out with anyone.<eos> Because everyone just uses me for what I represent to them. - What?<eos> - See, you don't actually like me.<eos> No, I do.<eos> No, you don't.
What do you want?<eos> I finished the dishes.<eos> Would you like me to start on the laundry?<eos> I would...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Just so you know, the Staffords went to visit Michael's family in Florida. So I'm yours for the week if you need me for cleaning or... conversation.<eos> What on earth would we have to talk about?<eos> I'll get started on the laundry.<eos> You got the original coroner's report I sent over?<eos> I did.
The DA's looking into it, Ida.<eos> Yeah, well, while you look, how about letting my client out on bail?<eos> - That's not gonna happen.<eos> - Come on.<eos> We can prove Flora Hernandez found out she was pregnant just before she was murdered.<eos> And my client wasn't the father.<eos> - Do you know who it was?<eos> But I'm betting baby daddy wasn't thrilled to be handed that cigar, and that's called motive.<eos> - Something Eddie didn't have.<eos> - Didn't he?
Yep, a year younger than Lo.<eos> My father took, you know, an old horse and a few dollars from this guy in our village, and the next thing I knew, I was meeting my husband.<eos> This old man-- he takes me into his caravan. He raped me, you know.<eos> And then he-- he holds up my bloody little girl's nightgown for everybody to see.<eos> A big cheer, a big celebration-- proof<eos> I was a 12-year-old virgin.<eos> Maybe that's why I cannot have my own baby.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mercy. If you really do not want this child, I do.<eos> I do.
It's called Fakeblock. - Great name.<eos> Right?<eos> - Yeah, well, you know, it's super low-hanging fruit.<eos> Someone's going to do it.<eos> We're just trying to be those guys, you know?<eos> And, impressed with his - own invention... - It's a fake profile that leads hackers away from your actual data.<eos> He set about making an impossible dream a reality.<eos> You mean something that keeps everything on the Internet private and protects everyone's digital rights?<eos> Yeah, I mean, think about it. Everyone has something that they want removed from the Internet.<eos> George Michael certainly did.
- What?<eos> - Yeah. - 'Cause I feel like we'll be here forever, and I have a meeting.<eos> Um, you're fired.<eos> - Well, because you don't have a high school diploma, and we have a very strict policy here that everyone has to have a high school diploma, on account of the fact that Ron never graduated.<eos> - Is this really happening?<eos> - Actually, I was thinking<eos> I wasn't even gonna have to fire you 'cause it's been on Deadline all day.<eos> How did they find out?<eos> Does it even matter anymore?<eos> Yeah, it does.
My name is Julianne Hofschraeger.<eos> You know that we're hemorrhaging business with the big guys leaving, right?<eos> You're the new Jesus Christ and I am counting on you to close like a motherfucker.<eos> But trust me, I'm not here to outshine you.<eos> 'Cause I'm the goddamn sun.<eos> I fucked my boss, told the whole company. Left my handsome, rich fiancé and got kicked out of our stunning downtown loft.<eos> You put together six months of sobriety... and I'll vanish.<eos> You're, like, the fucking morality Nazi or something.<eos> Are you taking Parkinson's drugs?<eos> Do the math.
I'm just... It's really late.<eos> I want to meet the ogress.<eos> Shh! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> I want to meet her.<eos> Doug, please. What? !<eos> What? Ogresses or ogri?<eos> What is it? Whatever.<eos> Anyways, they have very tiny ears.<eos> Did you not see Shrek?<eos> Mm-hmm. I did, too, on pay-per-view, after my really shitty date tonight.
But not for us.<eos> - Ha, ha, ha. Great. I thought so.<eos> Do you have a minute?<eos> So that's almost a belief in God.<eos> How is that almost a belief in God?<eos> I have a husband who believes in God and a daughter who might...<eos> - And what about Zach?<eos> - I don't know. But I don't.<eos> But the point is you could believe in God.<eos> But I don't.
Before or since.<eos> I used to think I knew you better than anyone.<eos> You did know me.<eos> But I am a completely different person now.<eos> Who isn't?<eos> Vince, I admit, with you back, it's all so confusing.<eos> I'm beginning to remember my old self, and I want that life back so badly.<eos> I guess the question is, do you?<eos> Want to go back in time to the way we used to be?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I do.
Wow.<eos> Claire. Someone sounds excited.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I know we were supposed to meet at the restaurant, but<eos> I thought I'd surprise you.<eos> It's a welcome surprise.<eos> A very welcome surprise.<eos> I think restaurants are overrated.<eos> I find morgues much more enticing.<eos> As do I.
You are asking me about 5-year-old figures again.<eos> If you give me a day I can probably find some examples.<eos> But I can't give you any exact figures.<eos> Does $500 per week sound like a reasonable amount?<eos> That sounds about right.<eos> It's within the right range at least.<eos> Within the right range, you say.<eos> Was there an agreement about how the ad revenue was to be divided?<eos> -I have no idea.<eos> -You don't.
I got your message.<eos> What can I do for you, Hank?<eos> Mark Cuban's upped his offer.<eos> The league's ready to move.<eos> Well, as I think you saw, Juliette is not in the mind-set to move.<eos> And it's that mind-set that's the problem in a nutshell, Nico.<eos> She disappeared after yesterday's meeting, and for all we know, she could be on another binge.<eos> Where is she, anyway?<eos> You got a problem, Donnally?<eos> We both do, Mr. Careles.
It's what you do.<eos> Nico, I am in no position... she needs someone to talk to.<eos> She hasn't answered my calls.<eos> She's frozen me out.<eos> She sent me a text. It said "Good-bye."<eos> As we enter the second half of this game, you have to ask, what has happened to the Hawks' offense?<eos> They have been completely shut down by a Washington defense that, before today, hasn't been able to stop anyone.<eos> Given how the offense has sputtered, you have to wonder if the Hawks regret not playing Terrence King.<eos> What's up, ladies?<eos> How you doing?
Uh, I'd like to think Opus and I are of the same mind on this.<eos> Well, it sounds like somebody has mastered how to be a baby.<eos> It's not me.<eos> It's her.<eos> Jill Werner is the most vapid, self-obsessed narcissist I have ever met.<eos> Well, nobody's perfect.<eos> Why are we eating syrup?<eos> Well, I didn't get the Greens. You want some on your Greens?<eos> - The Greens? - Yeah.<eos> No, dad, I don't.
Yes.<eos> No.<eos> Opening that bar is his life dream, okay?<eos> We have to tell him.<eos> Listen, Zoe, he's too invested, okay?<eos> You're right.<eos> That's why it can't come from me.<eos> Do you take Matthew by proxy to be your lawfully wedded husband? I do.<eos> Do you take Kimberly by proxy to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> I sure do.
They can't have a flawed savior, now can they?<eos> He has to be perfect clone, like you.<eos> You are the blueprint, hank.<eos> The only one...<eos> That can show them the way.<eos> Just one more time, hank. That's it.<eos> I'll start with hank's computer.<eos> These are the files that hank gave me Of all the 41 trust subsidiaries, But we didn't find anything.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe hank did.
I'm sorry.<eos> We've run out of time.<eos> Laila, put the gun down.<eos> the locusts--it's a sign.<eos> He's telling me I have no choice.<eos> Or maybe he's presenting you with one.<eos> Isn't that what god does?<eos> He tests us, right?<eos> I tried to stop it, hank.<eos> I did.
Thank you. I'm thirsty.<eos> Thank you.<eos> [Watch beeps] Oh. Hey, I gotta take off again.<eos> Catch you back later here.<eos> I just don't understand why you keep running off to places.<eos> You know how pretty you are?<eos> Do you have any idea how your hair flows? It's just... I want to disappear into it.<eos> Do I look like I'm lying? Yes.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Does it-- why?
Okay, when I... when I couldn't find you, I checked security footage. There were guys following you.<eos> In a black SUV?<eos> Yeah, those are Darius's friends.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Why?<eos> What did you think?<eos> No, it doesn't matter.<eos> I...<eos> I love you, and I don't want you to move out.<eos> Okay, I-I don't, either, Cat, but...
I'm just trying to psych us up. Oh, that's good.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> Sorry, I'm late.<eos> My aide drives like an Hawaiian.<eos> Well, uh, we won't waste a lot of your time, senator.<eos> We want your vote on my education bill.<eos> I didn't realize we were bringing our wives to the meeting.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Senator, we've had our differences, but you know that boys and girls in your state are gonna benefit from these investments in math and science.<eos> Well, of course I do.
Dale fell asleep.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> Kyle used to fall asleep all the time after sex.<eos> No.<eos> This was during sex.<eos> At some point, he just stopped moving and started snoring.<eos> Please tell me that this happens all the time.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it does.
I don't need to diminish it by pretending it's real.<eos> It's opening a door, all right, but what you don't realise is that it's opening a door... to reality.<eos> What does that even mean, Wilson?<eos> I don't know. I'm a bit drunk.<eos> Last orders.<eos> No sign of Bejan or Grant.<eos> Let's go back to mine and drink until we can't feel our legs.<eos> Who's the little bitch, then, son?<eos> Does she know you're a bag of puke?<eos> Sure does, Dad.
She's kind of doing ourjob for us, in a way.<eos> Shame we can't give her a call.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Any ideas which trustee?<eos> Nope.<eos> Did you know Miranda Roman?<eos> - No. Why?<eos> - We believe she stayed at the shelter.<eos> Um, I wouldn't know. I don't have anything to do with day-to-day operations.<eos> Who did, other than Julia?
How can I help it?<eos> Mad King Henry is safe and in comfort but what are they doing to Edward?<eos> What are they doing to him, right now, Mother, as I stand here?<eos> I need him back with me.<eos> (Sssh...sssh... I know.)<eos> "Advise me", Warwick?<eos> !<eos> Not lock me up or take away my throne, but, no, you would "advise me"?<eos> ! Edward, the council feels...<eos> No, it doesn't!
Wallet!<eos> Anyway, I've been thinking about my outfit for the christening.<eos> Oh, yeah? There's no way I'm doing that.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't know, perhaps because the Catholic church systematically abuses children and has a genocidal attitude to condom use in sub-Saharan Africa.<eos> OK, Beth, we're not going to abuse or genocide anyone.<eos> It's just religion.<eos> It doesn't mean anything.<eos> Do you know what being a godparent entails?<eos> Uh, yeah, I do, actually.
Whatever will keep your family quiet.<eos> I need to get some sleep.<eos> OK.<eos> And try not to drop her.<eos> I'm sorry, but I don't see the connection between this and becoming a better godparent.<eos> It's religious studies, isn't it?<eos> You gave up reading the bible, then?<eos> Ah, yeah, the film's always better than the book.<eos> I don't think Bride of Satan 4 has much to do with the bible.<eos> 'Course it does.
Mum, you're not dying.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I took off work to witness this thing for you.<eos> I've been on the phone with my mum, okay?<eos> She's dying. She is?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Again.<eos> Dying again.<eos> Like she should be dead.<eos> She does this every year.
Seriously?<eos> I'm gonna go get help. No, no, no!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Just open the door.<eos> If they find out that I was helping you, I'm gonna get in trouble.<eos> You said so yourself.<eos> You offered.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I told you that this was a bad idea.<eos> I did!
But what else?<eos> Cumin, a little chili powder, ginger. It's a rub.<eos> And can you tell our listeners how you came up with this delectable combination?<eos> Actually, um...<eos> I got this recipe a long time ago from this guy who works for John at the car wash...<eos> Hector Gonzales.<eos> I believe it's a variation on a Guatemalan dish.<eos> - Interesting.<eos> - Yeah. Hector started out on the line at John's first car wash. And when he opened two more, he promoted him to manager.<eos> He did a great job.
Come on, come on, come on.<eos> HEMLOCK GROVE<eos> Children of the night<eos> Hey, Tom.<eos> The latest one, was it... was it Christina?<eos> Deputies found some torn clothing and a ID... for a Jennifer Fredericks at the site.<eos> - Jenny Fredericks?<eos> - You know her?<eos> No, no.<eos> Shelley does.
That is...<eos> Chest Peckwell.<eos> What?<eos> It's not his real name.<eos> We just called him that before we knew it.<eos> O.B. resident.<eos> Jo's been mooning over the guy since he got here, and she finally grew herself a pair and asked him out.<eos> Yay, Jo.<eos> She didn't tell you about him?<eos> Yeah, she did. Okay.
So you can have what you want. You can be who you want.<eos> You can be human again.<eos> Everyone deserves a second chance right?<eos> Why would I trust you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I could give you my word, but at the end of the day you'll just have to take a leap.<eos> Didn't work.<eos> It took time for Finn's line to die off. Remember?<eos> It'll work.<eos> What if it doesn't?
Freaky.<eos> They're blue.<eos> Yeah, they're blue.<eos> The good-looking girl will get jealous that you're not hitting on her.<eos> Hey, Kim.<eos> Look like you could use a drink.<eos> Uh, yes, please. A skinny girl Martini.<eos> Not that you need it.<eos> Yeah, it's a little late for that.<eos> You don't.
She says she wasn't at hospital.<eos> Well, she's lying.<eos> Ellen?<eos> Can I come in?<eos> How you getting on?<eos> I saw you at the hospital.<eos> My mom wants me to stay out of it. Of course.<eos> Do you believe in life after death?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
That's another seven points.<eos> Times two for the combination.<eos> Um, Erica, I have an extra ticket to go see Book of Mormon next Friday.<eos> I was wondering if you'd like to come with me.<eos> Oh, um, well, thanks, but no.<eos> - Oh. - What?<eos> Tonight was nice, and you seem like a really great guy, but I'm just at that point in my life where I'm getting a little older, and I don't wanna waste time and talk myself into things I don't want.<eos> And the truth is, you're just a little too hairy for me.<eos> You know, if you still want to go to Book of Mormon as friends...<eos> I do not.
That's not funny, all right?<eos> My-my life is falling apart.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm just giving you a hard time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I loved her.<eos> I know.<eos> I did, too.
Doesn't matter which one.<eos> You ask around till you can find somebody to help you make a new ID.<eos> And you make a new life for yourself.<eos> Come on.<eos> Now, don't just take it to Tennessee and then stop.<eos> Boyd will find you, and he'll finish what he intended when I found you that night.<eos> Are you sure I can't just go with you?<eos> Look. I'm sorry it's got to be this way.<eos> I truly am.<eos> But it does.
Oh, Toby, I love it!<eos> Thank you.<eos> This has been the best Valentine's Day ever.<eos> Oh, Peter, it was fun spending the day in bed with you.<eos> It sure was, Lois.<eos> Happy Valentine's Day.<eos> Hey, Lois, remember our wedding?<eos> Yeah, I sure do.<eos> Remember the dance?<eos> Of course I do, Peter.
Why didn't you text me?<eos> I could've got it.<eos> No, you couldn't have.<eos> It's this special soup, Peruvian soup, made from llama's milk.<eos> You can only get it at this one place in Simi Valley that I completely made up.<eos> - Oh, okay, why?<eos> - I'm sorry, Dixon,<eos> I know you guys were hitting it off, but if I had to listen to one more story about her pregnant sister's delicate esophagus, I was gonna punch her in the face.<eos> Ew. Nobody seems to believe this, but I don't actually want to think about pregnancy 24-7.<eos> You don't?
She was found in possession of nanodroid explosives.<eos> This alone is enough to convict her.<eos> I understand your sentiment, Obi-Wan, but if the Council does as you suggest, it could be seen as an act of opposition to the Senate.<eos> I'm afraid we have little choice.<eos> To the Chamber of Judgment, summon Skywalker and his Padawan, and in our decision, may the Force guide us.<eos> You're not helping.<eos> I'm sorry, Snips.<eos> I just--I just don't know what to do.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I don't either.
And so were you.<eos> Excuse me, hi.<eos> Could we get some more drinks?<eos> - Same. - Sure<eos> Mrs. Corbett should've pulled her off the line after what she did to Gladys.<eos> Come on, McRae, it was an accident.<eos> The first of many.<eos> If our matron won't do something about it, I will.<eos> You got nothing on the girl.<eos> Except I do.
There's no problem, we just ignore it.<eos> Jerry, stop laughing.<eos> Those are stolen jokes!<eos> Totally dead.<eos> What am I gonna do? Oh!<eos> I just opened up a can of "whoop ass" on myself!<eos> I remember the very first Correspondents' Lunch.<eos> I rode here in a horse and buggy.<eos> No, no, no, that wasn't a joke.<eos> I actually did.
Not a real nurse.<eos> Broselow tape says says he's 30 kilos.<eos> Standard concentration of dopamine is 1,600 mics per CC. So 5 times 30 is 150 times 60 minutes in an hour is 9,000. Divide that by 1,600.<eos> Infusion rate is 5.625 CC's per hour.<eos> What?<eos> I'm really good at math.<eos> Okay, let's, uh, give him 5.6...<eos> Except we don't have any dopamine, guys.<eos> We don't have access to any non-code medications at all unless we have a nurse or a code...<eos> Yes, you do.
We are very proud of the way our people conducted themselves.<eos> And I guess we won't be hearing from the Espheni anytime soon.<eos> On the contrary. You can expect them to attack Charleston in force.<eos> Really?<eos> It seems we knocked a lot of their assets out today, destroyed most of their fuel supply.<eos> Most, but not all.<eos> We have learned that they are bringing in every surviving Mech and Beamer in this region, consolidating whatever supplies they have left and will hit you hard to prove you have not weakened them.<eos> So I advise you to keep your soldiers on the perimeter at high alert.<eos> Dad, I guess you heard about me blowing a hole in that building.<eos> Uh, yeah, I did.
I have friends coming back for me, and I'm gonna return with all of them.<eos> All right.<eos> But if you can't, don't feel bad.<eos> Sometimes no matter how much you want to help, you can't stop someone from dying.<eos> No, don't do that.<eos> Don't you want to see your daughter again?<eos> I will.<eos> I will see her. That's right.<eos> Where did you say her grandparents live?<eos> I didn't.
No more stalling.<eos> Don't-- don't try to talk.<eos> It's the life we've chosen.<eos> It's-- it's the--<eos> The scan's all clear.<eos> No hidden bombs or gas pouches.<eos> I guess Amanda knew better than to turn you into a party piñata. You okay?<eos> You zonked out during the exam.<eos> It's been a long last few days.<eos> How you doing?
- Okay then. Why don't we just get going then?<eos> I see you brought easels. Easels mean presentations.<eos> So since it seems like you have things you want to present, I cede the floor to you.<eos> Oh, I can sit now?<eos> Great.<eos> Joe: I can't find the permits folder. Do you have the permits folder?<eos> Stephanie:<eos> I put it over there.<eos> I didn't eat because she said snacks.<eos> None of us did.
That's the real reason you didn't tell me.<eos> What about ogres and destruction and danger?<eos> We can fix all that.<eos> We did it before.<eos> We can do it again.<eos> We can start over, Emma.<eos> So you've changed your mind.<eos> You wanna go now, too.<eos> Not my mind.<eos> My heart. After what I did to Cora,
I'm gonna need another apron.<eos> Uh, they're, uh, they're on the line drying.<eos> It'll be some time. Eh, fine, fine.<eos> Get to cleaning this one as well.<eos> I'll be back later.<eos> All this because he tried to steal a magic wand?<eos> No, because he tried to steal from me, The Dark One.<eos> You try that, you get skinned alive.<eos> Everyone knows that.<eos> Actually, no, they don't.
Despite our differences, we're family.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Where are Greg and Tamara?<eos> They got away.<eos> So they still have it.<eos> Still have what?<eos> Sorry about your father.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Do the folks back at the home office know anything about it?<eos> Yeah. They did.
You say he left you?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> It's one that I know well.<eos> When I was a boy, my father and I boarded a ship with plans to travel the realms.<eos> One morning, I awoke, and he was gone.<eos> Turned out he was a fugitive.<eos> He had fled in the middle of the night to avoid capture.<eos> He abandoned you?<eos> Aye.<eos> That he did.
Not a single day went past when your mother didn't regret leaving you, Baelfire.<eos> We talked about going back for you when you were old enough.<eos> Perhaps fate brought us together so that I can make good on those plans.<eos> We can live the life that Milah wanted for us,<eos> - as a family. - No!<eos> Stay back.<eos> You used me!<eos> You wanted to kill my father!<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
Oh my God!<eos> There he is.<eos> The police, we should call them. No.<eos> It'll only spook him, then God knows what.<eos> He does this, goes somewhere.<eos> Then, Mrs. Corbett, you bring him back.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know how.<eos> You're his mother.<eos> Of course you do.
No, I've just been frustrated.<eos> I mean, we have cause of death, but not enough evidence to arrest anyone. Isn't that enough?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I just thought-<eos> Look, you're clearly dying to know... what's been bothering me, soâ€œ.fine.<eos> My brother bet me that by the time I hit 29, I'd still be a loser.<eos> You're not a loser, Wendell.<eos> I know.<eos> I mean, I'm working with the best people in their fields, and they want me to work with them.<eos> Yeah. We do.
- Then he should be happy for you.<eos> - Yeah, but he's jealous.<eos> He's always wanted me to fail so he wouldn't be the loser.<eos> - How much does he owe you?<eos> - 200 bucks.<eos> But I can't ask him for it.<eos> He works as a night watchman, and he barely scrapes by.<eos> So after years of working to prove him wrong, I can't get no satisfaction.<eos> - You found something, Mr. Bray?<eos> - Yes. I did.
Human males are simple.<eos> They mask their emotions through drink, farts, and physical violence.<eos> The drink didn't take. We're all out of farts.<eos> I moved your fence to provoke you.<eos> Fight me, Marty.<eos> Give me respite to my feelings.<eos> Don't make me spit in your orange juice.<eos> You spit in my orange juice?<eos> How would I even know you did that?<eos> You didn't.
okay.<eos> I never know how long You're supposed to let a dog sniff.<eos> You're not.<eos> She's marking territory.<eos> Look sharp!<eos> Cesar, the dog whisperer.<eos> He uses that expression. It's from the north of England. It means be quick and do your business.<eos> She only did that because you're a soldier And you have a hint of an accent.<eos> I don't have an accent.<eos> Yes, you do.
OSHA doesn't monitor take-home toxins With inspectors yet.<eos> They rely on outside regulators.<eos> Frost, scroll to the end of that document.<eos> Look who was in charge of compliance.<eos> You said you didn't know what THT meant. I don't.<eos> Then I'll decode that for you.<eos> It means "take-home toxins."<eos> Where are we going with this?<eos> You said you had a development in the case.<eos> We do.
- Sound. - Yes.<eos> We can use drywall in the hall.<eos> - How much does it cost?<eos> - Less.<eos> Then drywall everywhere.<eos> - You'll only save 100 euros. - Perfect.<eos> You're making partitions, not Michelangelo sculptures.<eos> As you like.<eos> For the shutters, what color did you pick?<eos> I didn't.
An "A"-plus?<eos> Yep. "A"-plus...<eos> When an "A" just isn't enough.<eos> Just to be clear...<eos> The letter "A," followed by one of these?<eos> Yep. That's the one, in green pen and circled.<eos> It just doesn't make any sense. Well, I'm sure you'd be able to grasp it if you weren't just a regular "A" student.<eos> Hey, mom. Hey, Cash.<eos> Mr. Clark said you got an "A"-plus on your play.<eos> Uh, yeah. Yeah, I did.
Suppose he's passed out somewhere.<eos> Vanessa, you run a nice little hospital here, but let this one go.<eos> You're playing in the deep end of the pool now.<eos> I know how to keep track of a patient.<eos> Hello, this is Dr. Cole.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Jason, where are you?<eos> Will, it's Jason.<eos> Did you see Ian last night?<eos> Yeah, I did...
Yes, I know.<eos> Where's agent Moreno?<eos> Special agent Moreno is busy at the moment.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Well, maybe you can help me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I asked about you. Lieutenant Brauch speaks very highly of your work, the geiger case in particular.<eos> You've made quite a name for yourself, impressed all the right people.<eos> Well, you don't make Detective this young sitting on your hands.<eos> No, you don't.
- Because you look good in an American suit?<eos> - What?<eos> Because everybody loves talking to you because you think like the kids do?<eos> No, that's not what I think... Because I fit in just fine, but I remember where I came from... not having all of these things, it being about something bigger than just myself.<eos> I remember, too. That doesn't blind me to what's in front of my face.<eos> I know how the Americans do things, and Al Haig isn't taking over the government.<eos> You don't think they're all about lies and conspiracy like everybody else?<eos> ! Because they are!<eos> Why do you think that they're so different, that they're so pure?<eos> ! I don't.
Psychological pressure-- pictures of the kids.<eos> They didn't question you?<eos> No.<eos> They stopped?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You told them.<eos> What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You told them I considered defecting. That's why this is happening.<eos> I didn't.
And I'm...<eos> I like your shoes, by the way.<eos> They're new.<eos> Oh. Well, I like your new shoes.<eos> Earth to Clark.<eos> It's... it's just, in the past three months, um, the surveillance systems of five of the seven C.I. Agencies that we oversee have been compromised, and I-i am worried about the bureau's surveillance technology, Martha.<eos> I mean, it keeps me up at night.<eos> Do you think agent Gaad's on top of it?<eos> Well, agent Gaad thinks the new surveillance contractor is great.<eos> You don't?
Thank you.<eos> Place looks a lot smaller now.<eos> Maybe you just got bigger. Yeah.<eos> So you brought us here because...<eos> Well, if my fan-club memory serves me, the Round About is where it all began for Von Dozer.<eos> Sometimes it's good to remember where you came from in order to figure out where you're going.<eos> Oh!<eos> I cannot believe this!<eos> Is that David Blaize all grown up?<eos> Hey, Paul, how you doing?
So, then, what are you going to do?<eos> Are you going to take Cosima's bad advice, fess up to Olivier?<eos> I've got an even worse idea.<eos> How was your day, Paul?<eos> Yes, I also had a pleasant day.<eos> I went working and shopping.<eos> Pardon me. It's work.<eos> It's almost midnight.<eos> - Do you have names for me?<eos> - I do.
So, you'd go around black-bagging your subjects?<eos> That was mistaken identity. Okay?<eos> Olivier thought you were the killer, Sarah.<eos> Yes. Well, your good friend Dr. Leekie is on his way.<eos> Can I expect the same from him?<eos> Okay. You know what?<eos> You were the one who turned our killer against our creators.<eos> I mean, why the hell would you bring Helena into the mix? Oi!<eos> Ivory tower. This all happened because you got the science wrong.<eos> No, I didn't.
Frank-a-lank!<eos> Hey.<eos> Can I grab a bottle of that red?<eos> Well, slap me silly, you're back.<eos> Here you go. What the hell, Frank?<eos> Well, sorry, but I only got the one and I've known Jonah since he was a baby.<eos> Hey, I don't mean to ruffle your... very attractive feathers, it's just that I wanted this to celebrate.<eos> Oh, yeah, what are you celebrating?<eos> You having dinner with me tonight. Ho-ho...<eos> You did not just...
They're going to be here when you get back.<eos> Come on.<eos> Brick does owe me.<eos> All right!<eos> 48 hours of F-U...<eos> Wade! Come on, I was just going to spell "fun."<eos> It's like all you can think about is sex.<eos> Okay, so, Magnolia and I will be helping Shelby plan your birthday party. Oh.<eos> Because she hardly knows you, of course.<eos> Oh, no, she does.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> Like this?<eos> A little bit closer.<eos> How's this?<eos> Um... I can't find Carl's pacifiers anywhere.<eos> I think I left them on the boat along with my laptop.<eos> Well, mine's working just fine. We'll have these uploaded to photo-share by midnight.<eos> Do you think it's okay if we call and ask 'em where they keep the extra pacifiers?<eos> Do phones even work out there in the middle of the ocean?<eos> Yeah, the ship to shore does.
The next day, I closed escrow, and I got my business started, but I also bought a lifelong regret.<eos> So, now you understand what I was saying when I hired you.<eos> No girl should ever have to do anything that makes her feel uncomfortable.<eos> This fistfight has complicated everything for Kyle.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure it has, but I thought that you were gonna make a deal?<eos> Yeah, I'm trying, but prosecutors still want your husband to give up everything he knows about Vandermeyer, including Kyle's accomplice.<eos> I know this guy helped Kyle get clean.<eos> Wait a minute, h-- His accomplice helped him get clean?<eos> I assumed you knew.<eos> No, no, I-I didn't.
I'm gonna go wash my hands.<eos> Can I borrow your underwear?<eos> I'm out of ammo.<eos> What if I'm not wearing any?<eos> She's no fun.<eos> All right, guys.<eos> Girlfriend's here.<eos> Game over.<eos> I thought I taught you better.<eos> Actually, you did.
Cash, you know better than to try to buy alcohol.<eos> Mom, I was under the influence... Of a... hot girl.<eos> And I'm not gonna lie to you...<eos> It's probably gonna happen again.<eos> Reba?<eos> Go on upstairs.<eos> Great!<eos> Okay, so we're ready to get to work?<eos> About me not wanting to do this anymore.<eos> I don't.
What do you mean?<eos> The aircraft is still on the ground, and there's a tropical storm moving in.<eos> What's the delay?<eos> No idea, but I intend to find out.<eos> It's Colonel Givens.<eos> Time is up.<eos> Please. I can't jeopardize the mission.<eos> - One more minute.<eos> - I don't have it, ma'am.<eos> I really don't.
I mean, look at that.<eos> That's a picture of the night we first kissed.<eos> - Oh, so romantic.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> And we are wasting time feeling bad for the guy from Blind Melon?<eos> Exactly.<eos> What you need is a good breakup song.<eos> My wife sent me CDs full of those when I was in Afghanistan.<eos> If I had half a brain, I'd have known she was cheating on me.<eos> But I didn't. D-u-m.
Audrey Cruz didn't kill your daughter.<eos> Why do you say that? We were looking at it all wrong.<eos> She wasn't killed in the motel.<eos> She was murdered at your house.<eos> I killed Audrey Cruz for you, and I understood why you wanted her dead, but now they're gonna reopen the case.<eos> Now, we've gotta make sure that you're gonna keep it together, and that you and I, that we're good, because I got a career to think about.<eos> Do they have a new suspect?<eos> Your wife. At least that's who the FBI's got their money on.<eos> You have a different idea.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Wait, when did you...?<eos> See, I know for a fact that I exist because I am, well, me.<eos> So I can't possibly be just in your head.<eos> Therefore, the only logical explanation is that I am a magical being.<eos> What?<eos> A wonderful magical being.<eos> I've been around forever, and I will always be around forever.<eos> Okay, well, then how come when you first found the drawing, you didn't remember meeting me as a kid?<eos> Well, I don't remember not remembering that, so...<eos> Well, you didn't.
I see.<eos> You have consistently scored the highest marks in class for every written and oral exam. - However...<eos> - My surgical technique... leaves much to be desired, yes.<eos> Professor, I can't tell you how often I practice, but the moment the scalpel pierces the epidermis, well... my hands begin to tremble and no matter what I do, they...<eos> Mina...<eos> I have always found that the secret to a steady hand is a steady heart.<eos> - I-I don't understand.<eos> - You must believe in yourself, in your abilities to heal others.<eos> It is that simple.<eos> But I do.
Well... almost never.<eos> Sadly, we are on a bit of a clock.<eos> Wilson's men started looking for Veronica here three hours ago.<eos> Mm! Now...<eos> Aquino was hired to build a home for something very special, something I wanna find.<eos> So you're gonna tell me the name of his contact.<eos> One of the things I left out of my file...<eos> I kind of enjoy this sort of thing.<eos> I am so glad you said that.<eos> I do too.
Should we get going on these witness interviews?<eos> Yes, I think first we're going to go and see, um...<eos> Ike Kramer.<eos> Uh, no, I-I...<eos> Don't you hate it when you write something down on a piece of paper and then...<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> Ike Kramer.<eos> He's a, uh, trainer at, uh, one of Mr. Bishop's gymnasiums.<eos> Oh, good, so you have the address?<eos> Yes, I do.
Yeah, we know. Just, just tell us what you told them.<eos> Look, I'm not trying to hurt Mr. Bishop,<eos> I'm just trying to tell the truth.<eos> He had us in a meeting. He told us that if he caught anyone skimming, he would kill them.<eos> Those were his exact words?<eos> He would kill them?<eos> Not get rid of in the sense of fire?<eos> No, look, we all knew Christina was skimming.<eos> Bishop didn't know she was a CI.<eos> None of us did.
He paid his bill on time.<eos> In full?<eos> Down to the cent.<eos> You think he's leaving?<eos> That's the word.<eos> Just check and see if he's meeting other firms.<eos> We don't want to lose old clients while we're pursuing new ones.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> You saw, uh, Thao, Crowne Associates went bankrupt?<eos> Yeah, I did.
- You talked to Seth? - I did.<eos> And he said - that you solicited him.<eos> - I didn't go out of my way to solicit him.<eos> He was complaining about overbilling.<eos> Yeah, but you mentioned you were going out on your own.<eos> Might be going out on my own.<eos> Cary, if they find out, they'll fire you.<eos> Did you tell them?<eos> No.<eos> You didn't?
And he said - that you solicited him.<eos> - I didn't go out of my way to solicit him.<eos> He was complaining about overbilling.<eos> Yeah, but you mentioned you were going out on your own.<eos> Might be going out on my own.<eos> Cary, if they find out, they'll fire you.<eos> Did you tell them?<eos> No.<eos> You didn't?<eos> No, I didn't.
It was so close, wasn't it?<eos> The end.<eos> Our careers in ruin. - Yes.<eos> - I don't want that<eos> - to happen again.<eos> - I know.<eos> It won't.<eos> We're smarter now, we're better at it.<eos> I don't know if that matters.<eos> It does.
It does.<eos> Okay, I'll change my vote.<eos> Good.<eos> You're supposed to say, - "You don't have to."<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> But I'm glad you did.<eos> Well... Mrs. Florrick.<eos> How do you manage to look so refreshed after an all-nighter?<eos> I knew if I dug deep enough, I'd find precedents to get Judy's testimony kicked.<eos> And did you?
♪ In the desert, you can't remember your name ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain ♪<eos> ♪ La-la-la, la, la ♪ Everybody.<eos> One more time!<eos> ♪ You see, I've been through the desert... ♪<eos> No, no, no more times.<eos> No more times! The horse is dead!<eos> You really have a beautiful singing voice. (laughs)<eos> I told her she should quit her job and share her talent with the world.<eos> Oh, you did, did ya?
I had no clue...<eos> I don't... we don't understand, why this happened.<eos> ...but perhaps we're not supposed to understand.<eos> No one is forcing you to confess.<eos> And you don't confess to me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> To Christ.<eos> If I'm correct.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The same thing you do.
But it was just very difficult to be with Pete for that long.<eos> Such close quarters.<eos> With him hitting on the stewardesses.<eos> Yes, he's obnoxious.<eos> You must regret the night you spent with him.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I didn't spend a night with Pete.<eos> - What a thought.<eos> - And she still likes him.<eos> You do.
- Do it in one go!<eos> - Sit down!<eos> - You strangled her! - Pushed her down?<eos> Slapped her cheeks!<eos> Kissed her!<eos> Stripped her?<eos> Like this for blood circulation.<eos> I see.<eos> Take your pants off, too!<eos> - Not the pants! - Do it!
N-Nate's turning the boat around.<eos> He's probably going back for Jack.<eos> We have to get to him first.<eos> Let's keep this our little secret, shall we?<eos> My, uh, compliments on a lovely evening.<eos> Oh, all credit to my wife, mister...<eos> - Call me Trask.<eos> - Trask.<eos> I was hoping to ask you a few questions if you don't mind.<eos> As a matter of fact, we do.
Thank you.<eos> Oh my God!<eos> Oh no!<eos> Yay, one new Twitter follower!<eos> Okay, give me a compliment, but like, that you don't mean it, like, in a passive- aggressive way.<eos> I could see that hat on you.<eos> - You don't have a big butt.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Oh yeah, you do, you do.
Uh, you tell me.<eos> Why are you up?<eos> Probably the same reason you are:<eos> the case.<eos> There's still no helpful evidence?<eos> Well, Hodgins found a gun that's somehow supposed to be used as a knife, but it doesn't trace back to anyone.<eos> We'll go over the remains again, but so far, we have nothing of value.<eos> All we're sure of is that there was an inciting incident at the gallery that set off Symchay?<eos> But he's the only one who knows what upset him that day, and he's not alive to tell us.<eos> Maybe his friend does.
Do you think Great-granddad was eaten?<eos> Great-granddad disappeared in the ice.<eos> And he's still there.<eos> - All in one piece.<eos> - All in once piece?<eos> You know, the ice is like a giant freezer.<eos> Everything keeps.<eos> - What if the ice melts?<eos> - It doesn't melt.<eos> - But what if it does?
- Shut up, Barnum.<eos> What did they do when they had to go?<eos> - You have to take a dump now?<eos> - No, just wondering.<eos> They crapped on the spot.<eos> You thought they brought an outhouse with them?<eos> - Nansen too?<eos> - What about Nansen?<eos> - Did he crap on the spot, too?<eos> - Nansen did. Amundsen did.
I'm not pregnant.<eos> - Have you considered not having kids?<eos> I can't think of that.<eos> It would make life meaningless.<eos> Don't the two of us mean anything to you?<eos> - What are you trying to say? - Just that we can try to be happy.<eos> While we're waiting.<eos> Have you seen the newspaper clipping about Fred?<eos> I thought you threw it away.<eos> Yeah, maybe I did.
Unless you're a blond, a Bennett witch, or a doppelganger, I suggest you steer clear.<eos> Where is it, the cure?<eos> I know someone has it.<eos> Yes, someone...<eos> Katherine.<eos> Katherine?<eos> The doppelganger?<eos> Yeah. Sneaky, little bitch must've been spying on us for weeks.<eos> She killed Jeremy...<eos> Or somebody did.
It's not as confusing as it sounds.<eos> We're suing the... ooh, I like those earrings.<eos> Thanks. So...<eos> We're suing the head of the Democratic Committee for defamation.<eos> Why?<eos> He said some nasty things about Eli in a gossip column.<eos> Okay, I don't understand the connection.<eos> You know how hard it is to win in defamation.<eos> Yes, we don't want to win.<eos> You don't?
You learned to work with me.<eos> And look at you.<eos> If I wait patiently by the river, the body of my enemy will float by.<eos> Such a waste of energy.<eos> Give him the early rounds.<eos> He'll tire himself out.<eos> Go home, shower, walk back in there like you own half the place.<eos> I'll be back at dinnertime.<eos> Because you live here.<eos> No, I don't.
They'll never stop watching you, because your life isn't yours anymore. It's theirs... The family's, because they bought you.<eos> And they're gonna want what they paid for.<eos> The Kashfari skies were ablaze today, as U.S. drones bombed key military installations, a move many Americans are calling a much-needed show of strength on the part of President Fitzgerald Grant.<eos> Although Kashfari government officials have denied... 72 hours, Mr. Prime Minister...<eos> That's how much time you've got to find the hostages and deliver them to us alive.<eos> Fail to do that, and I'll order a second round of strikes.<eos> Have I made myself clear?<eos> Clock starts now.<eos> Let's see if he bites.<eos> The press certainly did.
I'm trying to recreate the Stone Age with Airfix glue and bloody BacoFoil!<eos> We're trying to.<eos> Yes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Here's to us.<eos> The posh wog! And the pushy Jewish bird!<eos> L'chaim!<eos> Cheers.<eos> We could have our own series!<eos> We do!
- Hey.<eos> How long are you going to freeze me out?<eos> I'm not freezing you out.<eos> I gotta talk to Boden.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Cruz is still in the E.R.<eos> He's telling doctors he wants to come back and finish his shift.<eos> Did you happen to notice if Cruz's bunker gear had a cape sewn into it?<eos> No, Chief.<eos> It definitely does not.
Oy. You OK?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, you sound like I feel.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I dreamed we were riding bikes through Mexico.<eos> - I can taste margaritas.<eos> - That's just the blood in your mouth, mate.<eos> Aw, shit.<eos> A uniquely South American device, based upon the cattle prod, but manufactured specifically for... - The torture of human beings.<eos> - Exactamente, Raoul. How you doing, Raoul?
Two hours from now, an FBI team will be heading into the Empire State Building, and they won't leave until they find that evidence box.<eos> We need to find it first.<eos> You told Callaway about the box?<eos> That means Pratt knows, too.<eos> Now, what matters is that she doesn't know what floor it's on.<eos> Now, I'm heading the FBI team. I can control the pace.<eos> How long will it take you to get the box?<eos> You really don't have a plan.<eos> Well, we thought we had time.<eos> We don't.
Yeah, just had a kip. You weren't bothered, were you?<eos> No, it didn't bother me.<eos> No, it didn't bother her, so I just...<eos> Get the fuck out.<eos> Bloody hell, charming, innit?<eos> God!<eos> Just hold on...<eos> I was worried about, you know, little things like a cable across something or a wobbly chair or something like that.<eos> I didn't expect them to see Kev's bollocks.<eos> None of us did.
Could you excuse us just one second?<eos> I...<eos> I am not gonna stop fucking men to start fucking women who look like men.<eos> This is a ministry, not a brothel.<eos> The volunteers who are ready are teamed with others who are ready.<eos> Thanks for being here and doing this with me.<eos> Scotty's been with us for six months of hard, devoted work trying to overcome her lesbian tendencies.<eos> You're going to help each other.<eos> It's been a long road, but I want to be right with God.<eos> As does Frank. Don't you, Frank?
- Why didn't she call me?<eos> - Well, she tried.<eos> You didn't pick up.<eos> And she failed to impress the authorities.<eos> Didn't even know your birthday.<eos> My birthday is Christmas.<eos> - How hard is that to remember?<eos> - And your mother's name.<eos> This is my fault?<eos> We did flash cards.
I did.<eos> Wait-- seriously?<eos> Sheriff Ecklie.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It feels right. Yeah.<eos> It is.<eos> Got reservations at Mastro's.<eos> You want to celebrate?<eos> Yeah. I do.
And I wanted to get home, baby. But, you know, it's 6:00 here, and they're just waking up in Tokyo.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Then Kashegawa calls and start asking for materials and, you know-- it actually was through a translator, Terry--<eos> He knows.<eos> And then I stopped by the gym to get a run in.<eos> Okay, so we're gonna go.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> So... Let me get this straight.<eos> Instead of coming home...<eos> You went to the gym. Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
The only mutants here are in these comic books.<eos> We've got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we're in a relationship.<eos> You know what I see when I look around?<eos> I see a room full of great people.<eos> So let's give ourselves a break.<eos> We are a community, and as long as we have each other, we're never truly alone.<eos> That was cool.<eos> What you said.<eos> You really think so?<eos> Yeah, I do.
What about the fender bender?<eos> I mean, if this was a revenge hit, why take the cheese?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Does that part of the floor look cleaner than the rest?<eos> Yeah, since when does someone clean a dump like this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When they've spilled a lot of blood.<eos> You're here to tell me it was the mozzarell, aren't you?<eos> You knew about that?<eos> If I did,
You know, I knew that was gonna be next.<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> Then you shouldn't have any problem telling us where you were.<eos> Same place I am every morning: at Nico's on the corner having coffee.<eos> What time was that?<eos> 5:00. and you can ask him if you don't believe me.<eos> We will.<eos> Mind if we look around?<eos> Without a warrant?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I know, but I also refuse to spend another minute hiding from the world.<eos> I need to get out of this apartment.<eos> Besides, is there any better excuse than Valentine's day?<eos> All right.<eos> See if you can change the reservation. I'll call you back in a little bit.<eos> Okay.<eos> And, Mac?<eos> You don't have to check on me every 15 minutes.<eos> I need you to know you're not going through this alone.<eos> I do.
Well... yes.<eos> And here I was thinking you were concerned about our children having sex.<eos> - Matty has condoms.<eos> - I didn't buy them. No...<eos> I did.<eos> So you put your daughter on the pill, and you bought my son condoms.<eos> You're encouraging our kids to be promiscuous.<eos> No, to be safe.<eos> Nothing good can come from teenagers having sex.<eos> Actually, I did.
Will you come with us?<eos> - Where?<eos> Why?<eos> When? - Oh.<eos> Room service.<eos> Yes, I'd like to order some food.<eos> And how many people will be dining today, Mrs. Winger?<eos> Oh, I'm not...<eos> Yeah, I'd like a turkey burger and a second turkey burger, but with no bun.<eos> My husband doesn't do carbs.
- Well, that's possible.<eos> - Can I see that?<eos> Yes.<eos> I find this date of particular interest.<eos> April 16, 1865-- two days after Lincoln was shot.<eos> Why would that be--?<eos> My great-granduncle Charles Chadwick has the resources to go over to England?<eos> - Where'd he get his funding?<eos> - Holy shit. Al, I don't know where he would get his funding.<eos> - I don't.
- And Melvin.<eos> - I'm so sorry. - This is my sister Bea.<eos> I'm embarrassed about my behavior. - Is that the monkey?<eos> - This is Monk.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - He's such a sweet monkey. - So she really freaked out.<eos> - He talks.<eos> - Yes, I talk again.<eos> Now I do.
You want what's best for Dr. Cole, right?<eos> I do.<eos> And if he were in some kind of trouble, you'd want to protect him, right?<eos> What did you find, Josh?<eos> Dr. Cole was on Ruben's flight to Jamaica.<eos> He used his credit card on the plane.<eos> I didn't know anything about the flight, I didn't book it.<eos> And he was back at work the next day.<eos> I didn't even realize he was gone.<eos> No one did.
For what?<eos> For this?<eos> Your photos and letters from Alex's apartment.<eos> You know, I keep trying to move on, but it's kind of difficult with you.<eos> I don't want you to.<eos> Catherine, the things that I said about the way that you see me, it was wrong, okay?<eos> It's my issue.<eos> I just, sometimes I wish so badly... I wasn't what I am.<eos> Catherine, I know that I can't be with someone who doesn't know everything about me.<eos> She does now.
He planned the whole thing.<eos> It's all part of this stupid book.<eos> "Ryan prayed that she was still alive.<eos> He started digging and finally found the coffin.<eos> Inside, she lay.<eos> He desperately tried to revive her, but Ryan was too late, and Agent Debra Parker was dead."<eos> He even talks about me finding this manuscript.<eos> "Hidden inside the coffin was an envelope."<eos> How would he know exactly what was gonna happen?<eos> He doesn't.
How would he know exactly what was gonna happen?<eos> He doesn't.<eos> He says that you died.<eos> Alex shot you in the woods.<eos> In this story, you're dead.<eos> So we can still change the story, right? _ What happens?<eos> Ryan, what is it?<eos> What's next?<eos> It doesn't say.<eos> Of course it does.
I'm up to 50.<eos> Who's real, who's not?<eos> We got real identities, fake, some are faceless.<eos> We don't know who is and who isn't.<eos> Hey. Where you going?<eos> I'm standing here with residents of Havenport, Maryland, where the FBI believe Joe Carroll and his cult are residing.<eos> Now while many residents have left the area, some have decided to stay.<eos> The Mayor is urging these residents to please come to the Hannan Recreation Center simply as a safety precaution.<eos> You think they're here?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Can I trust her, huh, hmm?<eos> Let me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tell me, Phil, you trust your wife, hmm?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you love your wife?<eos> Yes, I do very much.
! - I didn't know there was fine...<eos> Let me be very clear here-<eos> - I am a strong, self-sufficient woman, and I will not be nailing you, Schmidt, or Nick or Schmidt.<eos> Notice I said that twice because I don't feel it's sinking in.<eos> There will be no nails or screws or hammers in this building area generally, the whole thing.<eos> What, do you think that I want to do this?<eos> Believe me, pass.<eos> I just don't want my home turning into a denof sexual tension and lies.<eos> Now, do you want things to go back to normal or not?<eos> - Yes. - Yes, I do, but I...
Fruit of thy womb.<eos> The burmese girl-<eos> There's been a complication.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I don't know. I... It was standard in vitro procedure.<eos> We implanted the egg, everything was fine,<eos> Then she goes into cardiac arrest.<eos> We need to hold off until we know what we're dealing with.<eos> We know what we're dealing with.<eos> We don't.
Mm, those photos don't lie.<eos> I'll have to take your word for it.<eos> Sonia Brauer?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm Detective Flynn.<eos> Can I ask you a few questions?<eos> Um, yeah. Yes, of course.<eos> What is it about?<eos> Did you hear about the murder at Hotel Georgia on Wednesday?<eos> I did, on the news.
It's delicious.<eos> Yeah, it really is.<eos> Did you know that the asparagus plant, uh, dates back to ancient...<eos> Jake's taking Tammy to Vegas to get married!<eos> ...Rome.<eos> What the hell, dude?<eos> I told you, I'm not good with secrets.<eos> Baby, you want to get married?<eos> Uh, no, no, no, he doesn't.<eos> Yes, he does.
Not if you share.<eos> Then we're cool.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How was work?<eos> I need a drink. Oh.<eos> Here. Have at it.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> So... What kind of trouble are we getting into tonight?<eos> Oh, you like trouble.<eos> Who doesn't?
I'm sorry. I just need a minute.<eos> Of course. Take your time.<eos> Leah Dewhurst, 52 years old, no permanent address.<eos> She was arrested on shoplifting and drug charges a few times, but... nothing violent.<eos> Anything in there about her being a former Rockette or a placekicker for the Giants?<eos> That's right. Laugh it up.<eos> Mock my trauma.<eos> She was Albertson's girlfriend, and she had no idea that he had died until I told her.<eos> You believe her?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Shit, it's super fungus all up in here.<eos> My feet be itching ever since I got here.<eos> Itching all the livelong day.<eos> Um, hello?<eos> Itchy feet not the only thing you gotta worry about, right?<eos> Tell 'em, Chapman.<eos> Tell them what?<eos> Tell 'em what happens when you drop a bar of soap in prison.<eos> You know, I don't really think that that stereotype applies here.<eos> Oh, yes, it does.
Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was just mad at you for always shitting on me.<eos> I only sent Tricia to detox because I thought they would start an investigation.<eos> To put an end to all of this.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> You were right to not trust me.<eos> Nicky, I trust you more than anyone.<eos> I always have.<eos> I do now more than ever. Now?
I did not know that.<eos> Nobody does.<eos> That's the thing.<eos> She gets no ink.<eos> Cher could change her toothpaste and the gays have a whole Rose parade.<eos> How about a Rose parade for Charo, gays?<eos> James?<eos> I hope I never have a child, because I'll hate to tell my son that the day he was born was the second-best day of my life.<eos> Do you need script pages?<eos> I do not.
That you stand with the President.<eos> I mean, there's not a ton of ambiguity with that one.<eos> Well, who knew that being sexually assaulted wouldn't be the worst thing to happen in my day, huh?<eos> That's something for the memoirs.<eos> I am never going back there.<eos> "Danteeksi"?<eos> I'm sorry. Sorry I ever set foot in that fucking fish-eating, indie film fucking hellhole.<eos> Come on. Get over it.<eos> I told everybody I was a scrotum.<eos> Yeah, you did, didn't you?
[Chuckles] Yeah?<eos> You don't think so?<eos> Okay, sure.<eos> Just between you and me, I'm planning on getting me a little piece of that.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Got a ping on the truck.<eos> How?<eos> A foot patrol radioed it in, he spotted a similar vehicle driving downtown.<eos> Tell me we got a plate.<eos> We did.
Hey. Spade, rake, trowel, big space.<eos> And that'd be a good place for garden shears, right?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, we have a warrant.<eos> Right here. These are beautiful flowers.<eos> That's the Fuchsia Magellanica Aurea?<eos> You know your tropicals.<eos> That one, I do, yeah.
I don't even remember what it stands for.<eos> I caught most of the Reeves stuff from the bullpen, then Bell filled me in on the rest.<eos> Look, I know you thought it was all connected and that finding Natasha's killer was gonna help explain what happened to Gerald Lydon, but it didn't work out that way.<eos> But we do have a murderer in custody, and you got around a fake DNA sample.<eos> Strange name.<eos> Did you know there's no one called Lincoln Dunwoody in the whole of New York?<eos> At first, I thought Natasha Kademan's paramour was using a fake name for their affair.<eos> But when you separate the two names, treat them as two surnames rather than one nonexistent person, you get a very interesting result.<eos> This Lincoln family has a long history of generous philanthropy.<eos> So, too, does this Dunwoody family.

Look, man, that second trial hit you a lot harder than that first one.<eos> I don't know whether it was just more intense or what.<eos> It felt the same... Till the next day.<eos> So, we're gonna sit tight, keep an eye out until you, uh, get better.<eos> It's from Charlie.<eos> "In the neighborhood, found you guys a case""<eos> Found us a case?<eos> "In the neighborhood"?<eos> How the hell's she know where we are? Uh...<eos> Well, she doesn't.
- Space needle.<eos> ...still talking about the space needle...<eos> Portland could become a suburb of Seattle.<eos> - This word disturbs me.<eos> - Seattle.<eos> They're making a mockery of us here..<eos> Seattle.<eos> We don't like Seattle.<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> - No, we don't.
Well, the-the politics of undercover work can be very complicated.<eos> We just wanted a vacation.<eos> Florida.<eos> Nothing big.<eos> You know, South Beach for a couple weeks.<eos> But even if we had the money, he couldn't take the time when he was working cases.<eos> And now-<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He deserved a good life.<eos> We both did.
I've never.<eos> She was alive for most of it, you know?<eos> She was alive.<eos> "We were walking through the park, "listening to music on our iPod.<eos> "We did not notice the blood on our shoes until we got home.<eos> "Because we'd not been paying much attention to where we'd been walking, "and because our walk had taken us through... "areas of deeper undergrowth and high grasses.<eos> "When we first saw the blood "we presumed we had stepped in the remains of an animal."<eos> -A squirrel, for example?<eos> Did you know the grey squirrels are killing all the red squirrels?<eos> I did, yes.
Unfortunately, your credit card statements tell a different story.<eos> They show payments to a number of websites, which have been revealed to distribute this... this kind of material.<eos> The credit cards are lying.<eos> Right.<eos> I have to tell you, Mr. Foyle, already this is a huge challenge.<eos> We're going to have to work on your presentation style.<eos> What you see is what you get.<eos> Yes, well, that's part of the problem, isn't it?<eos> -Does he have to be here?<eos> -Yes, he does.
If we don't have this DNA, then what do we have?<eos> A problem.<eos> Spaghetti carbonara and an Arctic roll for afters.<eos> Miss Morris, that's a matter for defence counsel.<eos> All I want to ask you about is the search of your storage unit, not the defence alibi, such as it is.<eos> -Please, stick to the matter at hand.<eos> -My Lord!<eos> Get on with it, Mr. Mayfield.<eos> Miss Morris, you maintain a contract with this storage facility?<eos> I do, yes.
You're kidding? But either way, you can't have an Impreza. That's the key issue here.<eos> You may as well just get rid of the countryside.<eos> All right, all right, Hammond.<eos> That's incredible. I thought it was all about the ban on fox hunting.<eos> It is a good question, though. What are yobbos going to drive?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, if you are a yobbo and you have a suggestion, write it down on a note, attach it to brick and throw it through our window at 201, Wood Lane, London, W, wherever we are, 12.<eos> Hammond.<eos> What? You like a Camaro, don't you?<eos> Yes, I do.
I won't blame the tools.<eos> But I will blame the French.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it was the French's fault.<eos> Those roadworks, the contraflow, went on for nearly 100km, and that is what cost me the race.<eos> Yes, yes. Well, enough about your embarrassing and very public failure.<eos> The thing is, what about the car?<eos> The car. Looks great, tons of character, goes like a train...<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> No, it didn't.
Just let me go, please.<eos> My magic is a little bit rusty, and I was never as talented as you, which is why you're gonna be the one to cast the spell.<eos> Take this. Uh...<eos> I'm gonna cast a magic spell with a scented candle?<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> Okay, take a deep breath.<eos> Repeat after me.<eos> Mysticum pictura devorare nos.<eos> I don't speak that.<eos> Yes, you do, Freya, yes, you do,
Big middle finger to the Bureau.<eos> Odin Rossi's mark.<eos> Anyone who says they've seen the guy is lying.<eos> The guy is a ghost.<eos> Charlie, you got a supplier without a face.<eos> Mikey, you got a guy who needs heroin.<eos> You want Bello to reach out.<eos> Odin Rossi.<eos> I don't have a connect to him.<eos> - Paul does.
But I am old enough to run a bar.<eos> Have you made it to Iron Heights?<eos> To visit the woman who dropped a city on 500 innocent people?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Thea...<eos> That's not what mom did.<eos> Right.<eos> She had no choice.<eos> But guess what?<eos> She did.
Guys have been all over you since we walked in And not one guy has hit on me.<eos> I think maybe I just need someplace That's a little more sophisticated like an art gallery.<eos> Come on, the night's young.<eos> Give it another chance.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Oh, hi.<eos> Is anybody sitting here?<eos> - No, it's all yours.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> How you doing tonight?
Wizard Of Oz?<eos> That's the one.<eos> "There's no place like home."<eos> You said it.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Lucy.<eos> Hi, Lucy.<eos> I'm Dwight.<eos> You know my friend Eve.<eos> I do.
- Could we go into the house, just go through a few routine questions?<eos> No prob, Rob.<eos> You're very, very welcome.<eos> I was looking for a hair grip.<eos> - Can't help you there.<eos> - That's all right.<eos> Mr. Felwood?<eos> Do you...do you believe that Lucy's death was an accident?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
I should have told you.<eos> When we left here, we didn't mention her to anyone.<eos> I never told your mother and then it was too late to tell you.<eos> Never too late.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - She died...here.<eos> She fell asleep in the hay barn... ..and it caught fire.<eos> Luke's tooth fairy is her?<eos> Tooth fairies don't exist.<eos> - But Lucy does.
- Yes, sir.<eos> You gonna be all right for a minute, Bonnie Parker?<eos> Sure. Where you going?<eos> Well, music's calling, I'm just answering the bell.<eos> I don't know if I can remember a night that can hold e candle to this.<eos> It's almost like it's meant to be.<eos> Like you and me.<eos> You can't talk about meant to be when we haven't even kissed yet.<eos> I didn't say I wanted to kiss you.<eos> Yeah, you did.
We won't.<eos> '.. UK Border Agency is described as a troubled organisation which will take years to turn round.<eos> People who have abused their position in this country to commit offences and who are...'<eos> Can we not listen to the news?<eos> You know I love you, Beth.<eos> I know you say it.<eos> Since you've been caught out.<eos> Did Danny know about you and Becca?<eos> No.<eos> No, he didn't.
What should I do?<eos> What's there to contemplate?<eos> You've already decided to go on the date.<eos> But... I want to defeat him with my own hands.<eos> Oh?<eos> You don't want Aiko to disdain us?<eos> I don't want her to dislike Panty-man.<eos> Because I am Panty-man!<eos> But I want to go on the date!<eos> I do...
I can't, I can't.<eos> I'm...<eos> Richard! It's my birthday.<eos> I get what I want!<eos> You get what you want anyway!<eos> Oh, kitten.<eos> Watch and learn.<eos> That's better.<eos> Don't you just want to sit down for a bit?<eos> No, I don't!
You'd think they'd tire.<eos> Are you going to be like this all night?<eos> Just drifting off. No.<eos> I was just thinking of that restaurant in Rome, Alfredo's? Uh-huh.<eos> Remember at the height of Le Scandale.<eos> We were holed up in that little flat, half the world's press on our doorstep.<eos> Cameras everywhere. And the Vatican telling us we were morally reprehensible.<eos> Then one day, you said,<eos> "Sod it, let's go and have some fettucine at Alfredo's!"<eos> Sure did.
Okay, back to me.<eos> The brothers knew that one of them wouldn't make it through the night, but who would it be?<eos> The cute little one?<eos> Or the larger, ungrateful one?<eos> You burned my paper texts.<eos> Here's the thing, dude.<eos> There are two kinds of people in this world.<eos> The kind who blow off everyone the minute they get a boyfriend or girlfriend, and the cool kind.<eos> I guess I didn't realize you'd even miss me.<eos> Well, I do.
Debbie, your problem is not about making purses and money.<eos> You wanna feel like you contribute to this family, but you do, more than you can possibly imagine.<eos> Really?<eos> Jackie.<eos> You want a career, and not because you won't explode on earth<eos> - but because you're good at it.<eos> - I am.<eos> Besides, you're gonna need the money because Larry...<eos> - wants a daughter.<eos> - I do?

Deeks, say something.<eos> Are you there?<eos> Deeks?<eos> Uh... yeah, I can... hear you.<eos> What are you wearing?<eos> That's not funny.<eos> It's like a gulag water park in here.<eos> Oh please, how many times have I had to go undercover with a low-cut blouse and a high-cut skirt?<eos> Both of which are more than I'm wearing right now.<eos> How you doing?
I've been trying to find a way to tell you this.<eos> I think you just did.<eos> - Hi. - Hi.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Sure.<eos> - I'll see you guys later.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I know that this seems crazy, but we really do love each other.<eos> But, Nikki, you're about to go off to Peru and have this amazing experience... an experience that could change your life... and I really think that you should trust that if you're meant to be, you'll find your way back to each other.<eos> But we already did.
She probably believed it when she said it.<eos> I guess one of us should go get her.<eos> Maybe we should both go.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - She's sleeping.<eos> - Can we see her?<eos> - No no, I don't think she wants to see anybody right now.<eos> She needs to be home.<eos> I need to take care of her.<eos> No, you don't, neither of you.
No harm done.<eos> Wait, if you weren't calling about the ashtray, then why'd you want to see me?<eos> Follow me.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Yep, that night, I ducked back down into the gallery and bought it.<eos> Shelly didn't stop you?<eos> Shelly was off with some archduke she met at the party.<eos> No, I just... well,<eos> I liked what you said about how you just liked it.<eos> I still do.
Keep them. Now, the most important news of the week.<eos> As you may have noticed, modern cars now have been given electronic handbrakes, rather than a lever.<eos> This is a problem, because you can't do a handbrake turn with an electronic button.<eos> And this is bad news, because handbrake turns are an essential part of male development, because as we all know, the handbrake lever is connected directly to a girl's sexual appetite!<eos> It is.<eos> When you're 17, it is.<eos> You're smiling and you know it is.<eos> You see it in the animal kingdom.<eos> A peacock has his feathers. The young man has his handbrake.<eos> Exactly. They do the same job.
Mama, knock it off.<eos> Let the poor guy bowl.<eos> Oh, stop.<eos> It's all in good fun.<eos> Hey, you should put that toupee on that bowling ball.<eos> It would look a lot more natural. Ooh-hoo. Whoo-hoo!<eos> All you need now is a strike to win this thing and get us into the finals against the Tornados.<eos> I've been hitting on the weak side.<eos> I don't know what I'm doing wrong.<eos> I do.
You're a fearless woman.<eos> Mama, I was scared to death when we made the move out here.<eos> But with you by my side, I knew I could do it.<eos> You're not scared of anything.<eos> Well, except parrots.<eos> Well, except parrots.<eos> I mean, they should not be able to talk, Reba.<eos> They are an abomination.<eos> Mama, you said that I didn't understand.<eos> Well, I do.
That concert took place on Friday 3rd September, the same weekend your car was in for its annual service.<eos> The car was returned from a garage in Mayfair on the Monday morning. Where, according to you, it has been parked outside your mews ever since.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Right.<eos> So how do you explain the difference in mileage between the total written down in the log book after its service and its current total, a distance of 120-odd miles, roughly that of a round trip from London to Oxford?<eos> If you transported your husband in the car, there will be evidence a spot of blood on the carpet, in the crack between the seat and the back rest.<eos> Mrs. Coke Norris, you've killed two people, all for some delusional fantasy of a romance with someone who...<eos> finds your attentions oppressive.<eos> Ian loved me.<eos> He did.
My Aunt Flo.<eos> If you've no work, Jakes, some will be found for you.<eos> Sir.<eos> Don't let them get a rise.<eos> - It's nothing.<eos> - Insubordination's what it is. By proxy.<eos> You're my bagman.<eos> I know what's going round the canteen.<eos> Job should have gone to a Detective Sergeant.<eos> Well, it didn't.
A man called Malleson.<eos> Percy Malleson?<eos> Fuselage assembly?<eos> I was casting an eye over the payroll.<eos> You were?<eos> Yes, my interests do extend beyond the realm of Horse and Hound.<eos> Since when?<eos> Well, I've never heard of him, I'm afraid.<eos> It's impossible to know all their names.<eos> Harry did.
If you'd asked me, I'd never have...<eos> - You like it?<eos> - I like the work.<eos> To be honest, I'm not sure that I fit in.<eos> No.<eos> You were never like the rest.<eos> Well, I wanted to be.<eos> Tried to be, I think.<eos> When?<eos> I did.
- I'll get security.<eos> - Go ahead, Larry.<eos> It's Larry, right?<eos> Before you have security set their tasers to stun, let me just say that in this box my colleague is holding is dirt.<eos> All the dirt we spent the past week digging up on every single one of you.<eos> Dirty dirt. Filthy dirt.<eos> Some of it is illegal, and some of it's just downright disgusting.<eos> I'm talking "no amount of Lysol's gonna clean that corporate jet" disgusting.<eos> You know what he's talking about, right?<eos> - Actually, I don't.
- Still hearing "parent."<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Scooch in. What?<eos> Oh, oh, no, could we not...<eos> Smile.<eos> And... tweet.<eos> Hey.<eos> Becca's at a doctor appointment, so I wanted to talk to you about the parent-teacher conference.<eos> Why does it matter where Becca is?<eos> It doesn't.
OK, right, take care.<eos> See you again soon.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> OK, all right...<eos> Go!<eos> Eziz, do we have to go through this every time?<eos> Yes, we do.
I didn't want to kill anyone and I didn't want to be killed.<eos> I saw the men of this village go off to fight.<eos> I saw the courage it took for them to offer themselves up to suffering.<eos> None had the courage to reject suffering apart from you.<eos> What happened to Joe Middleton?<eos> Shot.<eos> At dawn.<eos> She doesn't love you.<eos> She loved my brother.<eos> She still does.
Yeah.<eos> I'm just-<eos> - I'm really happy for Bailey.<eos> No, you're in pain.<eos> You've been standing all day. Here.<eos> Sit down.<eos> You know, I really-<eos> - I don't--<eos> I don't want to keep saying yes and then not following through with it, okay?<eos> I-I really don't.
Callie, I asked for an ortho consult, and they sent me to you.<eos> Weren't you supposed to leave hours ago?<eos> I was, but then... baked Alaska.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Well, hey, look at it this way.<eos> Now you have time to spice up your speech for next year.<eos> And I still need an ortho consult in O.R. three when you're done.<eos> Spice... spice up?<eos> No, I didn't say that.<eos> Uh... you did, though.
Your TED speech.<eos> Sit.<eos> What?<eos> How?<eos> How?<eos> I made a call.<eos> We set up a video stream to the conference.<eos> You're going on live. Oh!<eos> I don't have my notes. Oh, yes.<eos> Yes. Yes, you do.
And...<eos> I've had a pretty bad year.<eos> I was almost killed in a car wreck.<eos> Then I... nearly lost my wife in an accident that claimed the life of my best friend and the father of my child.<eos> And... some other stuff.<eos> I'm an orthopedic surgeon by trade and I work with cartilage, so I've spent a lot of time thinking about what holds us together when things fall apart.<eos> I'm so sorry I haven't been to visit you more today.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Do you... do you believe that God plans for two people to be together?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Take me to her!<eos> It's just not that simple, Amelia.<eos> There's danger out there.<eos> There are people who want to do harm to you.<eos> You poor thing, caught up in this mess and all because of your gift.<eos> Stop pretending like you care about me!<eos> I know it's hard to understand, but I do.<eos> We all care about you.<eos> No, you don't!<eos> My mom does.
Now, now, Lemon and Wade are filling out the final paperwork right now.<eos> The Rammer Jammer will be open in a couple days.<eos> Wade Kinsella and Lemon Breeland owning a business together?<eos> Better get used to living on muffins.<eos> Wade and Lemon are BlueBellians, and we will support them.<eos> But, you know, maybe we should all practice cooking our own breakfast, just in case.<eos> Man, we are going to be huge.<eos> I cannot believe that this is actually happening.<eos> And I agree: huge. And who cares that everybody thinks we're going to crash and burn, right?<eos> They do?
Yeah, I-I told her my fears, and they just went away.<eos> Y-You know, I don't know what's going on with you and Shelby, but... but just talk to her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> The food is still disgusting, so I guess that means that you knocked it out of the park.<eos> Heard you gave quite a performance tonight.<eos> Don't reckon you'll be running off to make it on Broadway any time soon.<eos> That's for sure.<eos> You kissed George Tucker?<eos> I did.
But for killing Jimmy Steele.<eos> Hands behind your back.<eos> I was in the swamp... shrimping.<eos> Did anyone see you? Mm-hmm.<eos> The moon.<eos> And some gators.<eos> Okay, then how'd your fingerprints end up on this bottle of Graydon's in Jimmy's R.V.?<eos> Same bottle that somebody spiked with shrimp, knowing that he'd, uh, throw a shot back at midnight after finishing work on his hog, sho' nuff.<eos> You got me.<eos> Well, I do, Landon, on camera.
You filled your dad in on what happened with Barry Silver?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You fill him in on everything?<eos> What are you getting at, Katherine?<eos> I just went to the Savoy to ask about Violet's charges.<eos> I showed a photo of you in the lobby, and a couple on their honeymoon recognized you.<eos> Not only did they see you there last night, they had a picture of you.<eos> Dixon... you need to start telling us the truth because you're making it real hard for me to keep you out of prison.<eos> - Why did you lie?<eos> - I didn't.
Unbelievable.<eos> Weren't you just here?<eos> We have an afternoon session, too.<eos> We've got yoga and then we've got therapy, and...<eos> Not too late to join.<eos> Uh, I'm kind of in the middle of handling a major crisis here, if you haven't noticed.<eos> Oh, I noticed.<eos> You're early.<eos> Yeah, well, Dominic says on time is late.<eos> Yes, he does.
Marshall and his lame roll-out plan. I swear...<eos> Juliette. I know.<eos> Serenity to accept the things that I cannot change.<eos> Got three sold-out shows in the city. Your mom's getting healthy. You got a lot to be thankful for.<eos> I'm zen.<eos> I am positive, I'm focused.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> What's that? - A grapefruit.<eos> - I have grapefruit?<eos> Yeah. You do now.
Your mother was an incredible woman, but she wasn't easy on the men in her life.<eos> Your mother and I were together.<eos> You were the musician?<eos> I think I've gotta sit down.<eos> Look...<eos> Is that why you helped me? No, no, no, no.<eos> That was 'cause of your talent.<eos> You need to hear this.<eos> He loved your mother.<eos> We both did.
- Quick question.<eos> Um, our new couch... where did you guys purchase it?<eos> Couch Hut?<eos> Couch Nook?<eos> Uh, Couch Pouch?<eos> Somewhere in the couch district, I think.<eos> You stole Rob Lowe's couch.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> No, we didn't.
Uh, actually, my foundation does need a medical consultant.<eos> Sir, you came in about something else?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Mr. Rob Lowe.<eos> He claims you purloined his precious Italian sofa.<eos> Now, I'm sure you boys are aware they do have security cameras in the 'Bu.<eos> No, sir, we thought he was throwing it out.<eos> Actually, he did.
I don't take any chances with the people I protect.<eos> That's why they send me, an old lady, halfway around the world to do this.<eos> Now, you've been brilliant, a hero. And your reward is waiting.<eos> If you have any last thought to run to California please understand that the FBI will follow you to the ends of the earth.<eos> We put evidence in your apartment linking you to the murder of the FBI agent who was bleeding in the trunk of the car your people disposed of.<eos> Trace amounts of bloody fibers from his suit recovered in the safe house.<eos> When the trail stops at your doorstep we won't have to worry about them following it any further and getting to Philip and Elizabeth.<eos> It's your final act of service.<eos> You guys don't mess around, do you?<eos> No, we don't.
Good job.<eos> Okay.<eos> Watch your fingers.<eos> Here. Let me help you with that.<eos> Ready?<eos> Right on the money.<eos> Axl!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What? I thought you needed help.<eos> But whatever if you don't.
Are you sure it was a man?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And what did that person do?<eos> He carried the body off the boat... .. and laid it on the beach.<eos> Then he got back on the boat and went off.<eos> Which direction? West.<eos> And did you recognise the person that laid Danny's body on the beach?<eos> Susan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Fine, Mike, have it your way.<eos> Oh, Sue's right here.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Tell her. Tell her what you just told me.<eos> Tell me what?<eos> Well, apparently, your father thinks that I'm being unreasonable, and that you should have your party, and it doesn't seem to matter what I say.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yep.<eos> He said a girl's Sweet 16 is just too important to take away.<eos> - He did? - Mm-hmm.
One of the... the gears is missing.<eos> Uh, the main one, the-the key.<eos> - Where does it go?<eos> Right here.<eos> Won't work without it.<eos> If you're planning on saving the world, you're gonna need it.<eos> Look, I-I know this sounds crazy, but I know about the 36-- My son is one of them, and I think that your father is, too.<eos> I think he invented this machine so he could find the others, communicate with them somehow.<eos> Uh... okay, I'm sorry, but... y-you-you really believe that there are 36 people who can save the world?<eos> I didn't at first.
Proof that your office redacted and then refused to publish.<eos> Yeah, that is interesting, Sue Ellen.<eos> It's very interesting.<eos> But you know what I think is even more interesting than that?<eos> Is why Ken would bring this to you when he knows that if he were to do that, he'd find himself in some serious trouble of his own.<eos> I gave him my word I'd protect him.<eos> Well, that's very nice of you.<eos> It was completely delusional, but it was very nice.<eos> Now, you know damn well that if you do anything with this report... Anything at all... There'll be nothing stopping me from taking Ken down.<eos> I do.
I'll find out what's going on.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I'm sorry to be asking you this, because I'm sure it's ridiculous... But you really are just putting Daisy in for tonight, right?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Okay.<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Because, Ana's the reason the diva exists.<eos> She got The New York Times to notice the show, so are you sure she needs a night off?<eos> Yeah, she does.
- Okay.<eos> - So is that it?<eos> She just... she wins?<eos> A couple of dancers' accusations go away quick, all right?<eos> Proof sticks.<eos> Just pray she's terrible.<eos> And if Jerry hates her, I can tell Daisy it's not up to me.<eos> And what happens if she's good?<eos> I have no choice.<eos> Yeah, Derek, you do.
looks like you've got company.<eos> Annabeth, I...<eos> No... need to explain.<eos> Enjoy your dinner.<eos> Hi.<eos> You brought me a picnic?<eos> Well, I figured you'd be hungry, so I... brought you your favorite...<eos> Okay, uh, Ruby, what's going on here?<eos> I mean, are you... did you come back here to try to win me back?<eos> I didn't. Honestly.
And then he invested all the money in minerals.<eos> Shut up.<eos> I am so into minerals!<eos> God, now I have more questions.<eos> This place is amazing.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - What?<eos> - Danny!<eos> Do you have a dandruff problem, Danny?<eos> Yes, I do.
Shut up.<eos> I am so into minerals!<eos> God, now I have more questions.<eos> This place is amazing.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - What?<eos> - Danny!<eos> Do you have a dandruff problem, Danny?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Sometimes, I do.
Listen...<eos> Detective Chief Inspector John Luther.<eos> All I want is what you want.<eos> To have these people locked up so they can't do any more harm to anyone else.<eos> Now, look me in the eye and tell me you disagree with that.<eos> Not the motive, maybe. But I seriously dispute the means.<eos> What, you've never been tempted?<eos> To administer a bit of personal justice?<eos> I don't have the right to do that.<eos> Nobody does.
And I'm not orange down there.<eos> You're not orange there?<eos> People ask me do I dye my top, but I don't. So do you know why it's orange?<eos> Was it disappointing to be orange?<eos> I don't know why it's red, but I dig it, I like it.<eos> I don't need a comment, but I like it.<eos> I'm fine with an orange beard.<eos> Erm, now, I believe it was Michael Fassbender, a former guest here, who suggested we should contact you to get you on cos he said you'd love it.<eos> I would love it, yeah.<eos> And did you?
We like it, because it's really the dralon.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Because we know you like dralon because you're from Birmingham.<eos> And we know that you like the peacock and cheetah blend which gives an African and yet Birmingham flavour.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I've put it in my car and we know it fits.<eos> We know it fits, and mine.<eos> It fits in both our cars.<eos> Does it?<eos> Yes, it does.
Yes.<eos> Precisely into your car?<eos> It's snug.<eos> Snug.<eos> Anyway, Hammond.<eos> There are plenty of people here who can help you.<eos> Good. Let's pop it in the back of my car.<eos> OK, now, maybe I could...<eos> I think he's started to dye his hair.<eos> Do you?
I'm sorry.<eos> She passed away last year, and... and she left it to me... you.<eos> She left it to you, so I'm just gonna give that to you.<eos> I don't want the bracelet.<eos> I want to destroy your life the way that you destroyed mine.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I admit I posted Wendy's photos to the website.<eos> So what?<eos> Do you have the ability to delete them?<eos> I do.
Please, open the case.<eos> If we 'd wanted to kill you, we would have.<eos> You are looking at a bio-prosthesis.<eos> Tissue grown from Michael's own DNA drastically reduces the risk of limb rejection.<eos> Nice.<eos> So, what do you want?<eos> Consider this a gift.<eos> A way of mending the relationship between our two organizations.<eos> I didn't know we had a relationship.<eos> We do now.
You can't force me.<eos> Oh, yes, I can.<eos> I'll lock you in this room and when he's arrived I'll tear off your clothes and hold you down, if that's what it takes.<eos> You can't stop me from speaking to her ladyship.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> That I cannot do.<eos> But if you want a reference... or another job during your natural lifetime, you'll hold your tongue.<eos> This is yours, I think.<eos> But even with the book, how did you know she wasn't pregnant?<eos> I didn't.
- There's a job opening up? - Yeah.<eos> Rick from sales is moving to our Columbus office.<eos> Well, I want it.<eos> No, I need somebody with experience.<eos> This is about our night in the tent.<eos> - I can assure you it is not.<eos> - But I've been here for months.<eos> My temp position's ending, and I'm ready.<eos> I would love to keep you around, but Uncle Matt's not gonna let me hire someone who doesn't have a proven track record.<eos> Which all those people out there do, okay?
- Fucking parasites.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I gotta use the can.<eos> - Well, let's get the nurse.<eos> I don't like the one that's on duty. She's fat.<eos> Roll that thing behind me, will you?<eos> He said if you don't stop drinking, you're gonna die.<eos> As in dead, you know, like, no longer living?<eos> When did you start to care?<eos> Not sure that I do.
If I hadn't introduced him to the douchebags, he would've never met Carlson.<eos> You don't think he just would've found another way to Carlson?<eos> But he didn't.<eos> Why should he take you seriously?<eos> Better yet... why should I?<eos> Because I'm about to make you mountains of cash.<eos> Give me a little smile, you know, pretend that you're enjoying yourself.<eos> Why don't we just do bunny ears and say "cheese"?<eos> Why don't we just take this goddamn fucking picture?<eos> Everyone, do bunny ears.
I'll answer. I'll answer, Jack.<eos> Tom, when I'm elected, I fully intend to reopen that case.<eos> And if judicial impropriety is proven, I will take every appropriate measure to secure a presidential pardon for David Clarke.<eos> Uh... Next question, please.<eos> I can't believe that you dragged David Clarke into the conversation one week before the election.<eos> Well, I was double tapped with a rogue question.<eos> I gave the only answer I knew would stop their next salvo.<eos> "Their"?<eos> I thought you believed that Kenny Ryan - was behind the stunt.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
How do I look?<eos> Exactly like your father did when we got married.<eos> Except handsome and skinny.<eos> Come on, Colleen, the ceremony's about to start.<eos> Let's go to our "hot mothers of the grooms" seats and scope out which cater waiters we're gonna schtup.<eos> Uh, I'm-I'm so sorry, but I-I'm gonna be walking Bryan down the aisle.<eos> Why didn't anyone tell me?<eos> I would've worn something more revealing had I known I'd be part of the processional.<eos> You got to put the fresh produce at the front of the grocery store, if you know what I mean.<eos> I do.
You getting a henna tattoo? Do I look like a 13-year-old girl?<eos> (laughter) David called me, said he wanted his fiancé to have the wedding of his dreams, and that my being here would mean so much to you, Bryan.<eos> It does. It's amazing.<eos> Mm, no, it's half-assed.<eos> What? I don't have my collar on.<eos> Look, I once told you to fight for change, but I can't ask you to do something that I'm not prepared to do myself.<eos> So... (sighs):<eos> God help me... here we go. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the joining together of these two souls.<eos> Bryan, do you take this man to be your partner in life, in love, committed to one another's joy and sustenance from this day forth, so long as you both shall live?<eos> I do.
Your text about your grandmother being sick...<eos> I got so flustered at the lie of a text you sent that I just ran out with only my car keys in hand. So I don't have a dime on me right now.<eos> I know that I'm hungry... and the car's hungry too. What do we do? I'm sorry.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> If you say you're sorry one more time, I think I really might get angry.<eos> Okay... shall we take care of our problem?<eos> You're so cute!<eos> So cute, so cute!<eos> - Do you girls have boyfriends?<eos> - No, we don't.
Well, no, money's no object.<eos> I got it.<eos> Penny, the Drake is the best place to get married in Chicago.<eos> I mean, Oprah and Stedman have had it reserved for 17 years.<eos> Okay, slow down.<eos> Pete and I are very happy with the wedding that we have planned.<eos> Speaking of Pete, I called him and I invited him on a fishing trip.<eos> - Oh. - Seems like a future father-in-law kind of thing to do, you know?<eos> Do you think it's too soon to ask him to call me "dad"?<eos> Yeah, Roy. I do.
I've never seen you bring anything to a party.<eos> Except a ziplock bag to steal the shrimp.<eos> Whose side are you on?<eos> Yours, of course.<eos> Listen, I know you're upset, but I'm sure you two lovebirds will kiss and make up.<eos> No, not happening.<eos> He does not want me back, and I'm not going back.<eos> You're not? No.<eos> I have my self-respect.<eos> I do.
The youngest Starfleet Captain in Starfleet history.<eos> 32.<eos> But close enough.<eos> My mistake.<eos> Captain, part of my job is to assess the psychological condition of all onboard--<eos> Even alien life forms like Apollo-- and make recommendations.<eos> And...<eos> I'll bet you have one.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
The others are going to bed.<eos> What were you saying to Mrs Hughes?<eos> Just that Lord Gillingham's asked himself for the night again.<eos> He can't stay away. Yes.<eos> It's a bit of a tangle.<eos> Do you think she's sweet on him?<eos> They're sweet on each other, but it's not as simple as that, is it?<eos> Then there's Mr Blake.<eos> I thought she didn't like him.<eos> She didn't.
Is that the end of the lesson?<eos> Dr. Langham.<eos> Can I help you? No.<eos> No.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I-I was just, uh...<eos> Listening to our exam room.<eos> There's some money trading hands about what's going on in there.<eos> - I don't know if you knew that.<eos> - I didn't.
I need to talk about grocery money.<eos> Behold!<eos> I bring the lost sheep back to the 99.<eos> All right, as you know, we don't have a river to dunk you in, but we cleaned out the muck sink.<eos> And yeah, you might just wanna take off your shirt.<eos> Okay!<eos> Nope, see, I can't do this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I really want us to get along, I do, but I can't pretend to believe in something I don't.<eos> And I don't.
Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, how dreadful!<eos> Poor Clive.<eos> At least he didn't suffer.<eos> Oh, he did.
It's sort of...<eos> Hello, I'm Ash.<eos> This is how I walk.<eos> I'm sure we can fix it, darling.<eos> Maybe with leg braces.<eos> Now, tell us all about this film.<eos> Well, it's about this guy -<eos> And is your speech impediment part of your character or are you going to be speaking properly?<eos> I didn't realise I had a speech impediment.<eos> Oh. Well, you do.
Oh, I didn't do my lashes tonight.<eos> But I did put on eyeliner.<eos> Hey, do you guys wanna do Jagerbombs? Whoa!<eos> Listen, Rob. I...<eos> I know what that is.<eos> But I feel like Tom probably doesn't.<eos> Maybe you should just explain it to him.<eos> I know what Jagerbombs are. Why?<eos> Don't you? What?<eos> Of course I do.
Watch the car!<eos> Deep ball, center field.<eos> Oh, Mays on the warning track. It's going, it's going...<eos> Ah-ha-hoo!<eos> Mays makes the catch, Giants win the pennant.<eos> Who's Mays?<eos> Who's Mays?<eos> Just a kid I went to middle school with.<eos> All right, does your dad work here?<eos> No, my uncle. How ya doing?
Come home from school, go out play with my friends until it was time for dinner.<eos> Now everything's a supervised playdate.<eos> Kids can't be kids.<eos> And who can blame the parents, not with all the... molesters and abductors and predators out there.<eos> It's a different world.<eos> Bad guys used to be in prisons and psychiatric hospitals.<eos> And now they're on the streets.<eos> Max, Gary.<eos> Gary, Max.<eos> How ya doing?
I said I was sorry.<eos> But this isn't worth the paper it's printed on.<eos> - Why's that?<eos> - Executive privilege.<eos> I'm immune from having to testify.<eos> That applies to politicians.<eos> As well as District Attorneys and their top deputies.<eos> I'm sorry, Colleen.<eos> I wish that I knew some way out of this.<eos> You do.
Oh, these are good.<eos> How good?<eos> Smoking-gun good.<eos> Look. "When I get Gingold out of the way, I'll be able to assign you wherever I want."<eos> But these are never gonna come in unless Hewett testifies.<eos> Unauthenticated hearsay. - Yeah.<eos> Illegally obtained.<eos> - Right.<eos> And Hewett's got the same immunity that Gingold does.<eos> Unless he doesn't.
Test my skills.<eos> See if you remain unconvinced.<eos> Don't mind if I do.<eos> Okay...<eos> All right. So the nugget goes in the cup like this.<eos> And then we move them around like this until...<eos> I can't tell which one it's in.<eos> Then you continue doing that, but then to do this, don't you need to have a gold nugget?<eos> I believe I saw your move there, friend.<eos> You did, did you?
There's nothing wrong. I--<eos> I've been feeling kinda weird since you've been back.<eos> Yeah, you've been acting kind of weird.<eos> What's up with that?<eos> It's just... When you were in L.A., I had time to think...<eos> About you. About us.<eos> Hmm. Okay.<eos> And?<eos> Well, I mean, did you think about me at all?<eos> Of course I did.
Yeah, I figured.<eos> Been hiding that box for nine years.<eos> I thought you were the only one that knew of its existence.<eos> But after the gunfire ended, the box was missing, and this was in its place.<eos> "Drop the case. You have until tonight""<eos> What case?<eos> I'm investigating a security leak inside CBI.<eos> The leak will turn the Tupperware over to authorities if I don't back off.<eos> You know what'll happen if they unseal that box.<eos> I do.

It was chilly. I forgot my coat.<eos> What can you tell us about the abduction itself?<eos> It all happened so quickly.<eos> That's ok.<eos> Take your time.<eos> A man came up to us. I think...<eos> I think he had a leash in his hand.<eos> Did he have a dog?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he did.
What was his name?<eos> Roger Whitcomb.<eos> There's no listings for him anymore for him in the area.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Garcia, there's a name I need you to check out.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?<eos> Because I...<eos> Do you know what real pain is?<eos> That... hollow ache, that gaping hole that comes from senseless tragedy.<eos> No, you don't.
All right, well, let's go look at the other car.<eos> Hey, JJ, wait a minute.<eos> What?<eos> The car didn't lock.<eos> It beeped.<eos> Yeah, it beeped.<eos> It's not making that locking sound.<eos> He's hacking the cars.<eos> That's how he's getting in.<eos> How we doing, baby girl?
Alex...!<eos> You knew that when we got engaged.<eos> Alex, they offered me the position at Harvard.<eos> They did?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Decent hours, better pay.<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> I told them that I would only consider it if they gave you a position in the Linguistics Department.<eos> And they said okay.<eos> - They did?
We're asking for you to cooperate with a federal investigation.<eos> You-You're presuming that the three different car companies represented in this room track our drivers via their GPS.<eos> That's a bold presumption.<eos> Actually, it's not bold, and we're presuming nothing.<eos> When customers access their GPS for the first time, they go to a terms and conditions screen.<eos> They scroll to the bottom, they click the box that says, "Agree," so they can start using it.<eos> They don't realize they've just agreed to allowing their car to communicate its entire driving history with your corporate headquarters.<eos> Research purposes only, of course.<eos> The only reason these people agree to share this information with you is because they don't take the time to read the fine print.<eos> But I do.
Cover me.<eos> Steve!<eos> We got to go.<eos> Now.<eos> Let's go. Let's go!<eos> Look at that, something's going down.<eos> We got it.<eos> Eyes on the package.<eos> Good luck.<eos> How you doing?
The only fixed points in my life.<eos> What's on your mental menu?<eos> - Her hormone treatments.<eos> - Is that what it's boiled down to?<eos> Yes, actually.<eos> Her mood swings.<eos> I never know which version I'll encounter.<eos> This happens to be necessary, Thomas!<eos> - It's not like I have a choice!<eos> - Yes, you do.
Malin?<eos> I want her to be observed.<eos> I want you to keep an eye on her!<eos> -Heil Hitler!<eos> -Heil, hell.<eos> Juanita, this is Leon.<eos> Leon, this is... daddy.<eos> You know what?<eos> I know you think it's scary to meet new people.<eos> So do I
I work for these guys!<eos> Maybe I'm desperate.<eos> Did you ever think of that?<eos> Blake, I wouldn't ask if I wasn't.<eos> Yes, you would.<eos> You take advantage.<eos> It's what you've always done.<eos> And every time, I get sucked into thinking, "maybe it's different.<eos> Maybe she just wants to see me this time."<eos> I do.

You... come on, Don, you know he wasn't. I...<eos> I'm trying to do something good.<eos> Why would I want a promotion that way?<eos> Damn, kiddo, you-you got a long way to go.<eos> A long way to go. Come on.<eos> Hey, Don.<eos> Don...<eos> Can I get... another?<eos> Please?<eos> How you doing?
Not in a fat way... In a grownup way.<eos> Oh, it's so good to see you.<eos> Yeah, it's good to see you, too, Mrs. Desai.<eos> Well, well, two days back, and you've certainly had your share of female visitors, sweetheart.<eos> Visitors?<eos> As in, um, plural?<eos> As in... as in two.<eos> Lacey ended up staying the night here.<eos> Oh.<eos> Wow. You guys didn't...?
I hope you didn't catch too much grief for that little speech.<eos> You stood up for me. I was just returning the favor.<eos> Look, Regina texted me, before she, um...<eos> You mean, after we left the party?<eos> She wanted me to come back.<eos> And when I said no, she...<eos> She insinuated that she knew why I killed my aunt.<eos> I should have told you before, but I was afraid that you'd assume I killed her, just like everybody else. Jo! Please, please.<eos> Why did you kill her?<eos> - I didn't. - Not Regina.
You'd be pushed to call this home.<eos> Not if you're the devil.<eos> I need the name of all of the kids that went through the home during the time Helen Jenkins ran it.<eos> The children, staff, anyone connected with the place.<eos> I want to know who they were and where are they now.<eos> We're already working on it, sir.<eos> Dr Haydn Blake's on his way in.<eos> Helen Jenkins was his cleaner for three years.<eos> I'll send someone down to talk to him.<eos> No. You do this one yourself, Tom.
If anyone's to blame for his death, it's me.<eos> To Robert.<eos> Are you feeling all right?<eos> I know tonight was just another Ted Kord fund-raiser, but you were surprisingly quiet.<eos> Moira, there's something I need to talk to you about.<eos> Robert, if this is what I think it is, I don't want to know her name. I don't--<eos> No, it's about Malcolm.<eos> He wants to level the Glades.<eos> And how does Malcolm propose to evacuate an entire section of the city?<eos> He doesn't.
The only thing you have to stop me from going out that door is an arrow.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where's he going?<eos> So how did our Robin Hood do?<eos> As expected?<eos> So back to the drawing board we go.<eos> Yao Fei!<eos> Ba!<eos> How did you escape?<eos> I didn't.
Oliver Queen is alive.<eos> Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish-- to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city.<eos> To do this, I must become someone else.<eos> I must become something else.<eos> Previously, on Arrow...<eos> Rescuing your father and stopping Fyers is not going to be some walk in the park.<eos> - Yao Fei!<eos> - Ba!<eos> How did you escape?<eos> I didn't.
Looking at you, and it's--<eos> Just say what you have to say and go, ok?<eos> Ever since I've been back, we've been doing this dance. We come together, and then I pull away.<eos> Something pulls me away.<eos> But I think... finally... that something might be over.<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> That... you know me better than anyone.<eos> And that you... are more important to me than anyone.<eos> I just hope I didn't wait too long to say it.<eos> You didn't.
We did a sweep of suspected Taliban in the area where the shot came from.<eos> Rounded up eight known hostiles.<eos> That is, until this guy tried to escape.<eos> Khalid Al-Hatan.<eos> He's been ducking us for a while now, but not anymore.<eos> He dead?<eos> Affirmative.<eos> Civilian contractors we work with...<eos> I believe you spoke with Virgil, their supervisor?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Martens tell you it was us?<eos> Would it matter?<eos> Covering their asses, as usual.<eos> See, we get a little more wiggle room to operate than our friends in the military, so, naturally, there's some low-grade resentment.<eos> You mean Captain Martens?<eos> Well, if he can avoid explaining anything that even smells like it wasn't by the book, we're the fall guys.<eos> And killing an unarmed Taliban suspect is something you're saying he'd rather not own up to?<eos> Would you?<eos> The sniper-- where'd you find him?<eos> We didn't.
Forget about it!<eos> Why's the all-blue one pretty?<eos> I can do that too.<eos> You can now, but you hadn't thought of it before, so you didn't know how.<eos> Think I don't know why that bed is in the studio?<eos> For Gabriella and for Michelle!<eos> You're making a scene over a model who helps me make lamps?<eos> She helps you naked?<eos> Who told her about Michelle? Who told her about Michelle?<eos> - Did you?
I didn't realize we could make a $22 profit on nachos.<eos> Guys' Night is genius. Right?<eos> Hey, uh, look. Uh... I think you're great, I just, uh...<eos> Smokin' in the boys' room I can't keep running to get cheese every time somebody orders nachos.<eos> - I love how worked up you get over cheese.<eos> - Get down there. Run.<eos> [CHUCKLES]<eos> Who do I have to do around here to get a bucket of nachos?<eos> - Right here!<eos> How you doing?
What's wrong with you?<eos> I ate four faerie girls.<eos> I am so fucked up.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Come on.<eos> I feel like I'm losing my mind.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you believe in the devil?<eos> No.<eos> But my mom sure did.
Yo, that was awesome in there, by the way.<eos> What would the Deslauriers do to break up a fight?<eos> Would they sing Kumbaya?<eos> No, Brendan thinks Kumbaya is a negro spiritual - that's been co-opted by white camping culture.<eos> - Ugh. Listen, doc, doc,<eos> I'm gonna join the practice.<eos> What? I'm with you guys again, only because of the fight.<eos> 'Cause this guy said I was his brother.<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> Oh, no, no, you did.
Neither crawling nor begging.<eos> Just retrieving the last of my things.<eos> Oh, and you just happen to be retrieving it all the exact moment I always come in to work?<eos> I've never seen you in the office before noon.<eos> What time is it?<eos> - 8:00.<eos> - O'clock?<eos> Anyway, listen. I've thought about it. I'm willing to take you back.<eos> I mean, who even remembers why you left in the first place?<eos> I do.
She's a nutcase.<eos> Yeah, a nutcase with blood on her shoes.<eos> Your shoes and this shoe print that we found at the murder scene... they match.<eos> Match, match, three on a match.<eos> And that's bad luck, you know.<eos> Want to talk about bad luck?<eos> You stepped in a dead woman's blood.<eos> I remember you.<eos> You do? From Walter's trial.<eos> I do.
-What did you say to him?<eos> -I told him to leave Izzy alone.<eos> And?<eos> And...<eos> I didn't tell her.<eos> I didn't want to upset her.<eos> -Did you kill Gideon Frane?<eos> -I wish.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
This Tiffany lapel pin-- Claudia's husband said it was hers.<eos> Edward, your record indicates you've been living off your sticky fingers for a while now, am I right?<eos> You know, I got a lot of friends like you, stealing for bare essentials... sleeping in rooms with no heat, under paper-thin blankets, and bitter as hell at folks like the Drexlers for what they take for granted every day.<eos> Makes sense you want some for yourself, man.<eos> Absolutely not the case here.<eos> Did she catch you lifting this pin?<eos> Did she threaten to turn you in?<eos> Is that what happened?<eos> The key to my sobriety is reliance on a power greater than myself, you know what I mean?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I don't think he dead yet.<eos> Come on.<eos> It needs more pepper. No.<eos> I made what you like;<eos> you'll eat it the way I make it.<eos> Now, have a seat.<eos> I think it needs more pepper.<eos> Daddy, can I ask you a question? Sure.<eos> - Do you believe in angels?<eos> - Well, course I do.
Surely there are other ways for a woman to establish herself?<eos> She should take some initiative.<eos> Build a history of credit.<eos> Maybe a car loan?<eos> I take the streetcar.<eos> Here's what you're going to do, Miss McRae.<eos> Buy Victory Bonds and wait till the war ends. Don't give up.<eos> You're a pretty girl, you'll see.<eos> Dreams do come true.<eos> Mine did.
Pretty impressive, Aaron.<eos> Well, other kids played sports.<eos> Of course, I have no idea what I'm building.<eos> The capsule is first-generation nanotech.<eos> It kept Danny alive.<eos> Fixed his lung tissue.<eos> You can reprogram it to do almost anything...<eos> Stitch bone, heal skin...<eos> Like fix my leg, if it works.<eos> And if it doesn't?
Of course.<eos> What if you had lied to her about having money?<eos> Would it be okay for her to walk out on you?<eos> That's different.<eos> A woman shouldn't want to marry a man just because he's rich.<eos> And a man shouldn't want to marry a woman just because she can have his baby...<eos> - If you don't mind me saying.<eos> - No, not at all.<eos> I like that you have strong opinions.<eos> So many young people don't.
It's me.<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Can't use this on him.<eos> The Springfield.<eos> No cartridges.<eos> Well, this isn't right.<eos> Your pistol.<eos> I don't have a pistol.<eos> Yes, you do.
Where can I find a better voice-activated search machine?<eos> Oh, I can't please any woman.<eos> Milhouse, I'm not sure why you left me in the forest, so I made cookies.<eos> But I didn't know what kind you liked, so I made seven kinds.<eos> I've become my mother.<eos> Well, common sense never goes out of style.<eos> That was too easy.<eos> Lisa!<eos> Did you see Marlon Brando in "Mutiny on the Bounty"?<eos> No, nobody did.
I'm going with you.<eos> From now on, I'm in this all the way.<eos> Bobby told you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We need to keep this quiet.<eos> If anyone asks about Caitlin, make up some story.<eos> Tommy's seen the videos.<eos> Okay, but he doesn't need to know that Nelson is alive.<eos> Well, why keep it a secret if the bikers already know?<eos> But maybe they don't.
Doing okay?<eos> I guess.<eos> I really screwed things up this time, didn't I?<eos> Well... you certainly screwed everything you could.<eos> I mean, I had such a good thing going-- first with Tammy and then Ashley--- and now I'm all alone.<eos> That's because you're a Harper.<eos> It's what we do.<eos> We take something good and turn it into nothing.<eos> I don't like being a Harper.<eos> Nobody does, son.
You okay?<eos> Vincent and I went to Evan's apartment.<eos> We were looking for his journals.<eos> That must have been hard.<eos> I still can't believe he's gone.<eos> He had this photo of us from my birthday.<eos> Doesn't get any easier, does it?<eos> Losing people?<eos> No.<eos> Never does.
Why here?<eos> In the middle of nowhere?<eos> And who went to all the trouble to move her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> So, what are you gonna do?<eos> You can't just leave her here. If Muirfield cared enough to move her out here, and I move her back... it's just gonna put my family on their radar.<eos> It's not worth the risk.<eos> Besides, there's a cracked headstone I've been going to for a decade.<eos> So, you don't want to know what happened to her?<eos> No, of course I do.
Try it.<eos> I have no more pain to be felt.<eos> There may yet be joy, however.<eos> Look, whatever it takes, darling, till my blood be spilt, I will find what it takes to make you smile again.<eos> Only allow it.<eos> Allow me the opportunity, this opportunity.<eos> Joy is passing.<eos> Vengeance, however... that is a pursuit for which I'd see blood spilt.<eos> You say there are men of vicious and murderous intent who wish to reclaim this gem?<eos> I do.
Hands behind your head.<eos> Hands behind the back of your head!<eos> Dean.<eos> Dean, what the fuck are you doing here?<eos> Are you alright luv?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Leyton's starting to wake.<eos> Did you not go to bed?<eos> Sometimes I remember.<eos> Who done it to you?
There's all the facilities in there.<eos> Got the moisturizers, the lotions.<eos> - Run a bath if you want, mate.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Was I too loud earlier?<eos> What, having intercourse with Glenn?<eos> No, earlier.<eos> You didn't hear me on my typewriter?<eos> - Workin' away?<eos> - No, I didn't, no.
I was always afraid to let her go.<eos> You sure you want to be here?<eos> I want to pay my respects.<eos> The school said they'd let me come back.<eos> They accepted your offer to supervise me.<eos> I'm very happy to hear that.<eos> You know, I was thinking about maybe starting a kind of support group on campus.<eos> So, you know, survivors know that they're not alone.<eos> You think that's a good idea?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You know, these days, they encode the shipping destination.<eos> "Koval Ridge Supply Store."<eos> Well, it's not much, but if you live out here, it's your one and only stop shop.<eos> And it's the only civilization a girl could find for miles.<eos> Good a place as any to meet a guy.<eos> What? I've done worse.<eos> I'm getting a serious feeling of déjà vu here.<eos> Yup.<eos> Guess now we know where Tommy Barnes got his gear.<eos> Yeah, and maybe where our killer did, too.
Lovely.<eos> I just hate unnecessary adornment.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Did I hurt you?<eos> No.<eos> Suddenly, I'm not in the mood.<eos> Did I do something wrong?<eos> Maybe another night.<eos> But you said you liked what you saw.<eos> Oh, I do.
Are you kidding?<eos> She's over the moon.<eos> The paramedics are here. She's gonna go with them when they go to the hospital.<eos> I'm so glad.<eos> You know, he would've died if it wasn't for you.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> The antiserum saved his life.<eos> No, you and Brennan gave him the time he needed until it got here.<eos> You and Brennan saved him, babe.<eos> You did.
I owe you, Mickey.<eos> I stole half a million for you.<eos> Pissed off a lot of people.<eos> I know.<eos> I did what had to be done.<eos> Mick, things have changed.<eos> All right.<eos> You like this guy?<eos> He's good to you?<eos> Yes, I do.
I love those guys, but they're idiots.<eos> - They are idiots.<eos> - They are so dumb.<eos> To their credit, they don't go around randomly grabbing each other's boobs.<eos> - That we know of.<eos> - Randomly?<eos> Oh, no way.<eos> You put it out there, Jess.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yes, you do.
She doesn't know about sexy stuff.<eos> She couldn't even figure out what we do with the bowling ball.<eos> Sophie, you should've seen what was in here.<eos> I mean, he had this anatomically correct real doll he named Alexis.<eos> Yeah, well, she's very pretty.<eos> He had a sex swing.<eos> Ooh, a sex swing.<eos> What are you gonna tell me now?<eos> That he had a water bed?<eos> I did.
I wasn't lying to you.<eos> I was... lying to Annie.<eos> You know, I've been... trying to pretend that there is nothing between you and Annie.<eos> But I saw the way you looked at each other at the theater,<eos> I read her book, and I can't hide from the truth.<eos> Neither should you.<eos> The truth is, it doesn't matter what's between us.<eos> Because... I end up hurting her every time we try.<eos> That's the guy I am, and Annie knows it.<eos> No, she doesn't.
But you're here.<eos> If you're going to keep talking, Amanda, just kill me now.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Or ever.<eos> You can't kill me.<eos> You don't want to.<eos> You've had so many chances.<eos> As have you. And you couldn't pull the trigger.<eos> I didn't want to kill anyone.<eos> I never did.
- Going with elephant!<eos> Shit!<eos> - What city in Belgium is known as the center for diamond sales?<eos> - Antwerp.<eos> Antwerp.<eos> Antwerp.<eos> Well, that is it for "Brain Burst."<eos> It's all tied up. - And team Billy wins.<eos> - But I knew it was Antwerp.<eos> I did.
Which leads us to our suspect, Darryl Orton.<eos> State records list him as a tortured soul.<eos> Born into poverty, third of nine children to Glenda Jean Orton.<eos> Put up for adoption.<eos> And the case worker said that he was told his whole life that he was a total waste of space.<eos> Which leads to feelings of worthlessness and despair.<eos> He thinks he doesn't deserve to be here.<eos> As a result, he lives a life without fear.<eos> Death doesn't scare this guy.<eos> Not much does.
We didn't want to unduly alarm anyone if it wasn't a certainty.<eos> It's not your choice. This isn't your personal fiefdom.<eos> What you do affects us.<eos> And did you know?<eos> Your husband is appointing her.<eos> - Did you know?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Diane, you need to be stepping back right now.<eos> How are we supposed to know whether you're doing for what's good for the court - or for us?<eos> - You don't.
Like the prang that wasn't a prang. It was a crash.<eos> With Aidan in the front seat and no seatbelt.<eos> It was an accident. He was fine.<eos> It was an accident that happened because she was over the limit.<eos> She'd been out the night before, she'd had a few drinks.<eos> What, so she was still drunk the morning after?<eos> -Come on, lan.<eos> -What do you want me to say?<eos> OK, Isla had her problems, we had our problems.<eos> What couple doesn't?
Look, I know what you're going through.<eos> After all you've done, you're afraid to face the guilt you'll feel if you turned your emotions back on.<eos> The only way we can help you is to make the alternative hurt even worse.<eos> Oh, we have to keep talking.<eos> If we don't keep talking, then I won't be able to stop myself from listening in.<eos> And I can't stand to hear Elena in pain.<eos> - What do you want to talk about?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - I ordered you a cap and gown.<eos> - You did?
Wow!<eos> I like to sit back there sometimes. It's a great place to gather my thoughts and just-<eos> I don't know. Be in the now.<eos> I meditate every day.<eos> Yippee-ki-yay!<eos> What are the odds?<eos> Yeah. You know, this is probably not gonna help my negotiating power, but I kinda can't believe how perfect this house is.<eos> And how much is little Otis gonna enjoy this doggie door?<eos> How do you... know my dog's name?<eos> - I don't.
Trust me, I tried. I could never find out.<eos> How does he find the ones who steal from him?<eos> He knows somehow.<eos> He... he's connected to the earth in a way I-I still don't understand.<eos> Come on, you've been living in the mountains for years. You must have learned something.<eos> Yeah!<eos> I learned that I could stay there till hell freezes over, wouldn't make a difference.<eos> Markus, now he killed your wife.<eos> Don't you want to do something about that?<eos> Of course I do.
You live with him. Surely you know he'd never sleep in it, then make it.<eos> Yeah, I guess I'll try calling him.<eos> You must be learning a great deal from him.<eos> I am.<eos> How else would you put up with him?<eos> Uh, I don't "put up" with him. We get along, basically.<eos> He's a friend.<eos> Sherlock doesn't have friends.<eos> Yesterday I would've told you he doesn't have a brother.<eos> But he does.
But with advances in 3-D printing, it makes it possible for anyone with the right specs to build one in the comfort of their own home.<eos> They only need one piece of metal to make it work: a nail to act as the firing pin.<eos> Now, Pendry couldn't very well melt a nail, could he? So he hid it in plain sight.<eos> He used it to re-hang one of the masks in the living room before the police arrived.<eos> That's why it was hanging lower than the others-- He did the work in a hurry.<eos> When I examined that nail today, I noticed that the tip was slightly charred.<eos> Carbon scoring from where it struck the bullet.<eos> I was right.<eos> I always knew it, you see? I always knew.<eos> I just didn't...
- I was getting...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I was getting a subpoena to retest the hair.<eos> - Someone already retested it in the prosecutor's office six years ago.<eos> Right, for an appeal.<eos> No, not in the office in Indiana, the one here in Chicago.<eos> Someone tested it here.<eos> Why?<eos> - Your dad knows Barry Scheck?<eos> - Yeah, he did.
Thank you.<eos> Good work.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Were you the one who called the DEA?<eos> Now, what would make you think that?<eos> It was a smart move.<eos> Have some?<eos> Will?<eos> I need to tell you something.<eos> No, you don't, Alicia.
She is the love of my life. Why would I kill her?<eos> You tell me.<eos> There is no reason in the world, sir.<eos> No reason.<eos> Okay, Cody. Fair enough.<eos> I know when a man is telling me the truth.<eos> Do you have any guns?<eos> Do I have any guns?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Y-yeah, yeah, I-I do.
Very happy.<eos> You get a receipt?<eos> You know, it wasn't that kind of transaction.<eos> Uh-huh. Go on.<eos> Look, I pay my debts. I heard he vanished,<eos> I thought he went somewhere like Brazil or something so he didn't have to share the money with the old lady.<eos> Now you're telling me he's dead.<eos> I gotta assume the loopy bitch did it. Or that wacko son.<eos> Have you met those two?<eos> Oh, you did?
Where is this going?<eos> At first, I... I wasn't sure about Mills, right?<eos> Was he too young?<eos> Was I just rebounding?<eos> Did we move too fast?<eos> But then I realized, damn it, he's good to me.<eos> Be happy.<eos> So you love him 'cause you choose to?<eos> No.<eos> Because I do.
What is it with y'all counting my drinks?<eos> Is this not a party?<eos> Jeez.<eos> Brother, that is the one.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Come on. We got it.<eos> So? How'd it feel? It feel good?<eos> Uh... yeah. Great, I guess.<eos> If you got more like that one...<eos> You do, right?
Yeah. It was kind of a love song vibe, right?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I'm not interested in love songs.<eos> Country music staple, isn't it?<eos> It's hard to write about things you don't believe in.<eos> You don't believe in love?<eos> Well, let's put it this way... pretty much everybody that has told me they loved me in my life has lied.<eos> I don't know if it was me or... they just weren't capable of it.<eos> I... the point is, I'm pretty damn sure it doesn't exist.<eos> It does.
But isn't an earl old-hat to a Londoner?<eos> Not when the Earl is the King's uncle.<eos> We can't have agitators on the loose around members of the Royal Family.<eos> And by agitator, you mean Marco Moretti?<eos> I'm afraid his time has run out.<eos> Come to my office first thing.<eos> If your fascist friend is going to lead us to bigger fish, we need to reel them in and make some arrests.<eos> Marco is not a lost cause.<eos> If I had a little more time...<eos> You don't.
Are you home?<eos> Front room.<eos> Oh my goodness...<eos> You made it home safe and sound and in one piece...<eos> Oh... Hello, old girl.<eos> Stay there.<eos> Bloody hell...<eos> It's okay, I got you.<eos> I wanted you to see.<eos> I did.
But it's true.<eos> It's probably a little bit true.<eos> Well, that's not reason enough to stay.<eos> We have everything we need. There's no point playing Henry's game anymore.<eos> Hey, please...<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Okay, let's go home.<eos> So, you're leaving my town without even a friendly goodbye?<eos> What, you didn't get our edible arrangements thank you basket?<eos> No, I didn't.
I'll take a rum.<eos> Goes down quicker.<eos> What happened to your shoulder?<eos> What, this?<eos> Shaving accident.<eos> You should see the other guy.<eos> There was another guy?<eos> You know, we really got off on the wrong foot earlier.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Oh, sure I do.
I need help getting an exhumation order.<eos> Who you want to dig up?<eos> My father.<eos> He died when I was 12, and I grew up thinking that he killed himself.<eos> Now you're not so sure?<eos> Recently, I got ahold of his suicide note.<eos> And the lab ran a test, found a partial print.<eos> Wasn't his.<eos> And you think he was murdered.<eos> Yes, I do.
Well, that was really fun.<eos> I don't know what to say here.<eos> - I got an idea.<eos> Stay right here, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Let me do something.<eos> Stay right here.<eos> We need some dessert.<eos> That's too much.<eos> Nah, definitely not doing that.
Nikita.<eos> You can't stop me from saving them.<eos> Not why I'm here.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I can save them.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> You need to go.<eos> I'm not letting you die here alone.<eos> I'm not the one who dies.<eos> Everyone around me does.
You bought 40 burner cell phones to make 40 untraceable dinner reservations.<eos> - You have the facial hair you have. - Eh! Okay, I get it!<eos> I get it.<eos> Leave the goatee out of it.<eos> - It's hard to leave it out.<eos> - Really hard.<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe two impulsive people can work in a relationship.<eos> Hey, it works for Ice and Coco T.<eos> Sure as hell does.
Hey, Magnolia.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Hey, whoa now.<eos> Now stop! Stop!<eos> Just, would you tell me what's wrong?<eos> It's the stupid school.<eos> They said I can't go to prom if I have one tiny nose piercing.<eos> So what?<eos> You don't have a...<eos> Oh, Lord, you do.
Yeah!<eos> Cock-a-doodle-doo!<eos> Oh, my God, you guys look so nice.<eos> Thanks inviting me to join you. I hope I am not a third wheel.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, not at all.<eos> Although nothing says<eos> "smooth rid"" like a fourth wheel.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We found you a date.<eos> Well, Max did. What?
For good reason.<eos> I know that.<eos> We decided to get married so fast and under duress.<eos> Yeah, and maybe even under sedation. Kidding.<eos> No.<eos> And I had just gotten scared and run away, and you got scared that I got scared.<eos> And I think that the problem is neither one of us know where we stand with each other.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Except we love each other.<eos> Yes, we do.
I'd probably be right where you are, buddy.<eos> 752, 752, 752... 752...<eos> Kimmie, I'm home!<eos> - Aw...<eos> Hey!<eos> Aw...<eos> Hey there, little guy.<eos> Do you have your daddy's eyes?<eos> I think you do have your daddy's eyes.<eos> "Yes, I do.
752, 752, 752... 752...<eos> Kimmie, I'm home!<eos> - Aw...<eos> Hey!<eos> Aw...<eos> Hey there, little guy.<eos> Do you have your daddy's eyes?<eos> I think you do have your daddy's eyes.<eos> "Yes, I do.<eos> Yes, I do."
You're like Yoda.<eos> A wrinkled little thing, childlike but old and wise!<eos> Everybody loves Yoda!<eos> And when Yoda says, "Knowledge have I,"<eos> people don't go, "Shut your stupid useless little head "or I'll kick you over, you Scouse little fucker!"<eos> They say, "Thank you, Yoda, you wise thing."<eos> Do you see?<eos> Yeah. If you take one of my classes and you look at what I'm doing and you pull apart my exercises and you go, "Oh, does any of this work?<eos> "Does any of it achieve anything?" I'd say, "No.<eos> "But it does."
Yeah, sure. Is there a problem?<eos> No, not... not at all.<eos> I just thought it would be nice if we could talk.<eos> Okay. What time?<eos> - Around 8:00?<eos> - All right.<eos> 8:00. I'll see you then.<eos> Great.<eos> I will see you then.<eos> You doing something with Juliette?
Speaking of which, uh, Kyle... came to the Rub last night.<eos> Oh, no, he didn't.<eos> Oh, yes, he did.<eos> And he said that if he gets this job, I should quit mine.<eos> Oh, no, he didn't.<eos> Mm-hmm. Well, one way to stop your two worlds from colliding is to get rid of one.<eos> Yeah, except that world feeds my kids.<eos> Yeah, but if Kyle moves back home...<eos> He'll be living with a lying whore.<eos> Oh, no, you did not.
Oh, no, he didn't.<eos> Oh, yes, he did.<eos> And he said that if he gets this job, I should quit mine.<eos> Oh, no, he didn't.<eos> Mm-hmm. Well, one way to stop your two worlds from colliding is to get rid of one.<eos> Yeah, except that world feeds my kids.<eos> Yeah, but if Kyle moves back home...<eos> He'll be living with a lying whore.<eos> Oh, no, you did not.<eos> Oh, yes, I just did.
We're going fast. Yeah, I'm ready.<eos> You sure you're ready?<eos> I'm ready!<eos> I don't think you're ready.<eos> Take it off!<eos> I'm ready.<eos> ♪ Hey, I'm calling out to... ♪ Okay, I don't get it.<eos> I thought we were going to see a baseball game.<eos> Did you get the date wrong?<eos> No, he didn't, Lace.
Guards!<eos> Guards!<eos> It is a friend, Your Holiness.<eos> Who means you no harm.<eos> Leave us!<eos> How did you get past the guards?<eos> They know me well enough by now.<eos> My Lord Gonzaga had business in Rome. I know.<eos> He requested an audience.<eos> As do I.
To separate a mother from her child...<eos> I am careful of myself and my family.<eos> Your sister marries Naples.<eos> What don't you marry France?<eos> You hold the fate of Rome in your hands.<eos> My Lord Gonzaga.<eos> Please join us.<eos> - My lord had business in Rome.<eos> - He requested an audience.<eos> - As do I.
Do you have advice on anything other than presentation?<eos> But presentation is everything.<eos> This king desires more than Naples.<eos> He has an equal fondness for Milan.<eos> - But I didn't say that.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you said black.<eos> Has your heart ever been sick, Micheletto?<eos> There are some who would doubt I even have a heart, my lady.<eos> Well, unfortunately, I do.
Wow, it seems like old times, talking bout the Juergens.<eos> Well, it's not old times.<eos> I'm married now.<eos> I heard that Ben and Amy got into the same school in New York.<eos> So?<eos> Amy can go to school in New York if that's what she wants to do.<eos> What?<eos> Where will you be?<eos> I don't know, but we'll figure it out.<eos> We really do, Adrian.
Yeah, and you know, every day Chloe asks me about you, and I tell her you're fantastic.<eos> Why is Chloe asking about me?<eos> I think maybe she feels a little guilty that maybe this happened because of her, so she just wants to know that you're okay.<eos> Does she know I'm staying over here?<eos> Everyone knows you're here.<eos> Everyone knows you've been staying here since you got home from the hospital.<eos> I didn't realize.<eos> I don't really want people knowing where I am.<eos> - Why's that?<eos> - I just don't.
I succumbed.<eos> I didn't know what I was doing.<eos> I beg your forgiveness.<eos> Will he stop working with children? - Forever?<eos> - We'll be vigilant.<eos> You made that promise to Denis Pourveur's father.<eos> And you didn't keep it.<eos> Nothing happened between Denis and me.<eos> Do you swear in front of the cross?<eos> Of course you do.
- Ethan, it's too early to decide you're not good at math.<eos> You can get good at math.<eos> You're going to need math.<eos> For what?<eos> For thinking!<eos> And for getting through high school and college.<eos> I have no plans to go to college.<eos> Well, I do.<eos> And frankly, that's kind of horrifying, that I stayed here to be with you and you don't even want to try to be good at math.<eos> No. I don't. No interest whatsoever.
Are you kidding?<eos> She just had a baby.<eos> - No!<eos> - Do not have sex in high school.<eos> I'm just going to say it. Do not have sex in high school. It's a mistake.<eos> Not using condoms is a mistake.<eos> My whole goal for high school is to use a condom.<eos> Wait until you're in college.<eos> You didn't.<eos> No. I didn't.
- Walter actually signed this?<eos> - Either that, or it's a hell of a forgery.<eos> - Will this hold up in court?<eos> - Unless family challenges it.<eos> Well, that's not gonna happen.<eos> Walter didn't have any.<eos> Kind of meaningless now.<eos> The bank just took possession of the condo.<eos> Yeah, but Inna didn't know that.<eos> Or maybe she did.
We've been struggling a bit without Mrs Bute.<eos> And will Mrs Levinson's arrival make things simpler, do you think?<eos> As a matter of fact, I'd value your opinion.<eos> Her Ladyship has asked me to organise a treat for the staff after the ball as a thank you.<eos> Well, that's very kind.<eos> They've started opening the new Science Museum in South Kensington, even though it's not finished, and I can't decide between that and a visit to the Crystal Palace on its new site at Sydenham Hill.<eos> I see.<eos> And this is a fun day as a thank you, is it?<eos> Yes. I think it's very generous.<eos> So do I.
What sort of book?<eos> I can only tell you that on the train it was far more interesting than me.<eos> Your father's paying a lot of attention to my mother.<eos> You think we ought to tell him she only has an income for life?<eos> You are funny!<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> The English upper classes never talk about money.<eos> We don't like to.<eos> But you don't mind thinking about it.<eos> Or at least, your father doesn't.
He should have had the sense to keep out of it.<eos> But surely, if they know these men, they can question them and find out what happened.<eos> You'd think so.<eos> Oh, my dear.<eos> I can be normal most of the time for weeks on end but then I think I might never see him again and...<eos> I know.<eos> But that's not the point.<eos> If Michael is dead, if I do inherit, then I have to give at least half to the baby.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> No, I don't.
Ilona.<eos> They burned her alive, as they did my Adalind.<eos> And if you die this day, they will never face justice for these and all the other vile crimes they have committed in the Lord's name.<eos> No man can change that.<eos> True.<eos> But you are far greater than any mortal man.<eos> Though I possess the means, I lack the power, the presence, and the ruthlessness to wield it to any effect.<eos> Only you and I together, can destroy them.<eos> You say you have means.<eos> I do.
Just got off the phone with Portia.<eos> She said she and the kids are doing fine, except for Coby woke her up at the crack of dawn.<eos> What'd I come in here for?<eos> Coffee.<eos> I need coffee.<eos> Can you get me some, too, Daddy?<eos> Adilyn Braelyn Charlaine Danika, you ain't even two weeks old yet, so, no, I'm not gonna get you some coffee.<eos> Hey, are you gonna go with me today to the mortuary?<eos> If you want me there, I'm there.<eos> - I do.
Raging Bitch.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> You might have to special order it.<eos> Well, what you've done for this country's special.<eos> You have no idea what I did for this country.<eos> Well, why don't you tell me?<eos> Just talk to me.<eos> What do you want, cuz?<eos> I want you to come back to us.<eos> - We all do.
At least somebody is.<eos> Rum.<eos> That's like pirate tequila.<eos> And we're all working to keep the group in this house and maintain our dignity.<eos> It's below the label, so I'm just gonna chug it.<eos> Lacey, come on, come on.<eos> You got here late. You called Hoffler a douche nozzle.<eos> Wait, you don't believe me?<eos> - Lacey".<eos> - You don't, do you?
Well, hey, thanks to you, he's got no funding.<eos> Makes it kind of hard to disappear broke.<eos> I should have known that Orli was here for Bodnar.<eos> I'm sure she wants him dead as badly as I do.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> It's her job, but he was your father.<eos> It's not just her job.<eos> Orli was the reason my parents split up.<eos> I did not say anything, because I did not think it mattered.<eos> Did it?
You know what, I have a translation app on my phone.<eos> I got it when we were planning to honeymoon in Europe.<eos> Never got to go.<eos> Let's see if it has "Afrikans."<eos> Kaans.<eos> Afri-kaans.<eos> See if it has Afri-kaans.<eos> Ah!<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> It does.
It's over.<eos> Two seconds ago.<eos> Door.<eos> You can keep the photo of your boyfriend.<eos> So.<eos> Over.<eos> Ten seconds ago.<eos> Tonight, the fire department responded to a three-alarm blaze after an explosion...<eos> Gibbs, we may have a problem...<eos> We do.
Adam?<eos> Now you're asking the questions.<eos> That was merely a statement with the possibility of a question mark at the end.<eos> I went to Israel to bury my father.<eos> It was a moment of weakness.<eos> I felt alone.<eos> You need to talk to Legal.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> My Hebrew must not be as good as I thought, because I could've sworn that when I dropped you off at the airport, I told you you were not alone.<eos> Yes, you did.
Make these deadbeats pay.<eos> Just like you did at the I.R.S.<eos> What do you suppose happened with Special Agent Carter?<eos> No idea.<eos> You know, if he got popped last night, he's probably getting released in a couple of hours.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no. You just heard Edgar.<eos> We need paying clients.<eos> Michelle, no one deserves to lose their career over one mistake.<eos> - We did.
What?<eos> No. Just keep your eyes open when you're at the supermarket or the laundromat or the library.<eos> You've never been to any of those places, have you?<eos> Next time, only one of us wears the blindfold.<eos> Yeah, that was just a lot of groping' and hopin'.<eos> All right, good night.<eos> - Whoa, what are you doing?<eos> - I'm going to sleep.<eos> No,no,no,no,no.<eos> We don't do sleep.
I know what I'm doing, okay?<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You're used to dealing with Rosewood's finest.<eos> They can't find their nightsticks with both hands.<eos> She and that other Detective are the real deal.<eos> Believe me, I know the difference.<eos> I will do whatever it takes to protect my mother.<eos> I don't care what she did.<eos> Hanna, we don't know what she did, okay?<eos> None of us do.
No matter what happens... It won't touch you.<eos> Mom, I know you were here... In Rosewood the night that Wilden was killed.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I was kind of hoping that you would deny it one more time.<eos> When something like that happens, you look back.<eos> You take apart every conversation...<eos> "Did I do something wrong?<eos> Did I miss a warning sign?"<eos> You talked to her on the day she died.<eos> Yes. Yes, I did.
Well, just because you can't have filet mignon doesn't mean that you have to settle for fast food.<eos> For your information, Julie is not a compromise.<eos> She's a smart, elegant woman.<eos> Sam!<eos> My breasts are getting cold.<eos> I have to go. No!<eos> You need to stop.<eos> What do you care who I sleep with?<eos> Well, I...<eos> I don't.
I'm not convinced that this picture is enough to derail Conrad's campaign.<eos> Time's running out. I gotta do something.<eos> I have a suggestion, but it comes with its own set of risks.<eos> What are we talking about?<eos> How brave are you, Jack?<eos> I always did love this ring.<eos> Well, we thought about keeping it a secret, but with all the press surrounding the family right now...<eos> Ugh. Don't talk to me about overexposure.<eos> You saw the video of me and my friend Regina?<eos> Yes, I did.
Why don't we ever throw anything away? Damn it.<eos> I already bragged to her that I got her something great, and now I'm just gonna end up running to the drugstore at the last minute to get her some crappy gift like I always do.<eos> Okay. Well, after that, can we swing by Brickstone and get her the thing she really wants?<eos> - You know what she really wants?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Nope.<eos> Nope.<eos> Nope.<eos> Damn it, Brick, you said you knew what she wanted.<eos> Well, yes, at one point I did.
Do you wanna go over it with him again? He was there.<eos> I don't know what he did or what he saw.<eos> But my gut--we don't have his whole story. Oh, your gut. Good lord.<eos> Rollins, problem?<eos> No, Sergeant.<eos> I remember when I was in Fallujah. Everything felt like it came with a side order of sand.<eos> You were there?<eos> Interrogations after 9/11.<eos> So... you know.<eos> Well, not half of what you do.
It's Nolan.<eos> You oughta know what to do.<eos> When did you first conceive the Carrion program?<eos> Was it during one of your 38 documented prison visits with David Clarke?<eos> Look, the better question to ask is who unleashed Carrion, and why.<eos> And the person to answer that would be one Edith Lee.<eos> Better known in terror-for-pay cyber circles as the Falcon.<eos> The Falcon, as you call her, denied involvement.<eos> - Said it was all you.<eos> - Of course she did.
What are you doing here?<eos> Where's Ems?<eos> She's at Grayson Global with Daniel to ascertain when the servers are gonna come back online.<eos> - I'll be ready when they are. - Don't bother.<eos> It's time to accept the consequences for what I've set in motion.<eos> Not if we can figure out who's really responsible for all this.<eos> If I can I.D. Takeda's killer, then...<eos> Maybe we can take the spotlight off you.<eos> That man didn't kill Takeda, Nolan.<eos> I did.
I have to show them something that I keep in the attic...<eos> In the attic?<eos> Yes, in the attic...they have to see...it's important...<eos> it's important for me too...<eos> For God's sake... what are you talking about?<eos> Those screams in the night... you hear them too... and do not pretend you don't... you do hear them too...<eos> There are beasts in the woods and beasts scream sometimes...<eos> There are beasts in the woods and beasts scream sometimes... the past is the passed...and never comes back...<eos> It does come back!<eos> It always does...
If you hurt yourself during a crash, we have liability issues.<eos> But if you get shot, we're off the hook 'cause you signed a release.<eos> So until this chase is over... and the way this guy is driving, that shouldn't take too long... I want you to slump down in your seat...<eos> Clear!<eos> We got him!<eos> See?<eos> Easy as that.<eos> Get out of the car!<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it now!
Mrs. Vega, L.A.P.D.<eos> Are you all right, ma'am?<eos> "Abogado" means that... I know, buzz.<eos> He wants an attorney.<eos> It wasn't the car owner's blood.<eos> So who did he kill?<eos> Agent Morris, thank you for coming so quickly. Well, I shouldn't have.<eos> In case you didn't know, print matches can be faxed to my office.<eos> I send them to the Mexican consulate, and within three hours, you'd have this guy's record. If he has one.<eos> He does.
Your father.<eos> Is it true? You said it was a engangsaffære!<eos> You lied to me.<eos> - I'll talk about Ahsha.<eos> - We do not dig the night again.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I smashed the only good thing in my life.<eos> - How håndterer I Ahsha?<eos> - Start from scratch.<eos> Did your coach no about Devils and Devil Girls?
Just in and out, in and out, okay? Little, tiny breaths.<eos> It's gonna be fine. Steve's got us.<eos> Wanda wenderson?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> That's us. Come with me.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You look like Michael Jackson's son, blanket.<eos> I know. You're doing good!<eos> Doing good!
You can stay here, or you can move in with your Dad.<eos> It's your choice.<eos> Just let us know what you decide.<eos> Well, don't stay up too long. 'Cause it's late, ok?<eos> - Ok.<eos> - All right, love.<eos> You're back.<eos> That was some fight, man.<eos> You heard that?<eos> We all did.
I see some of us are still wanting for inspiration.<eos> Tell you what, why don't you and Wyatt come see me after school today and we can see if we can get those juices flowing.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> You're incorrigible.<eos> Look it up.<eos> Every single one of you should know what that means.<eos> Ok, turn to page 45.<eos> So, we gonna talk about the elephant in the car or what?<eos> You wanted Brandon to have a choice.<eos> He does.
TV's not really my thing.<eos> Besides, I got to meet up with a friend.<eos> I promised I'd help her rehearse a poem for the first round of the Slam tomorrow.<eos> The second round's supposed to be a big to-do.<eos> But, thanks for a fun time.<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> - See you later.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> It's like he didn't even know it was a date.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
You do want to go home, don't you?<eos> Yeah, yeah, it's just... ..I never thought I'd be able to, you know.<eos> I sort of made a... life out here now.<eos> I've met someone.<eos> I've just not thought about it for so long.<eos> I've also got a life out here.<eos> Quite like it.<eos> So, what are you saying?<eos> You saying you don't want to go home?<eos> Yeah. Course we do.
You know what?<eos> You make such a good point.<eos> You make such a good point.<eos> (CLEARS THROAT) Uh... Just to be clear, Roger, you're not asking for anything and I'm not agreeing to anything.<eos> Okay.<eos> Obviously, I can't say anything explicitly.<eos> Neither can you.<eos> You understand that?<eos> Will, do I understand?<eos> Yes, you do, sir.
The unfriendly kind.<eos> Yeah, oh, Danny, I just want to let you know, uh, one of your anecdotes may have accidentally made its way into a Veep speech via me.<eos> And I'd really appreciate it if you could let this one slide.<eos> Selina's a plagiarist?<eos> That's perfect.<eos> You just handed me a silver bullet.<eos> And as you know, I'm a good shot.<eos> I might back away, though, from calling her a liar.<eos> After all, you didn't really meet anyone named Juanita who said that.<eos> No, I did.
Do we know what she's wearing yet?<eos> Can we find out?<eos> We are gonna go in there in just a moment.<eos> - They're expecting a puff piece.<eos> - Right.<eos> There's the bluff puff which we're gonna start out with.<eos> You're her friend. You went to high school together.<eos> You guys like each other.<eos> Then we switch right over to rough puff.<eos> Nobody does rough puff like you.
Movin'... movin' on.<eos> Oh, God, she could not have been less interested in you.<eos> Yeah, I was here.<eos> Boy, did we have a good laugh about that one.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, you know, I didn't wanna have to tell you this, but if she's so out of my league, then why did she just hit on me?<eos> That's a good one.<eos> No, she did, right there at the elevator.<eos> Said that she's always wanted some of this, and, you know what?<eos> Still does.
It's coming.<eos> I've got the baby.<eos> There you go.<eos> Oh, you did it.<eos> Monroe, will you grab the blanket? - Blanket.<eos> - Right there.<eos> Oh, here, here, here.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> We have a daughter.<eos> Yes, we do.
If I thought that it would be something really silly.<eos> Really silly indeed.<eos> May I sit here with you?<eos> Lost your husband?<eos> He didn't come today.<eos> I'm happy to finally being alone with you.<eos> I want you so bad.<eos> I know.<eos> No you don't.<eos> - Yes I do.
We don't do boiled beef and carrots any more.<eos> Come on.<eos> No one can say that his cause isn't just. At least, everybody I speak to thinks so.<eos> He kills people - real people in the real world, not in some... cyber, pretend world of yours.<eos> Churchill killed real people.<eos> 25,000 at Dresden and he still tops the charts of the most popular Britons.<eos> We admire people who act, and TT acts.<eos> Let's face it.<eos> He made those bastards cough up millions.<eos> They didn't.
Uh... Sorry about that.<eos> Deputy Branch Connally.<eos> Welcome to Absaroka.<eos> Glad you guys are here.<eos> I need to speak with the sheriff.<eos> Just us deputies.<eos> Walt's up on that mountain.<eos> Well, call him.<eos> Hard to believe, I know, but he doesn't have a cellphone.<eos> Actually, he does.
Previously on Twisted...<eos> It's not like I lie around wishing I could hang with you and your lame superficial friends anyway.<eos> I don't blame you for anything.<eos> Then why did you call me a bad mother?<eos> You're not gonna blend in here. You might as well accept that.<eos> I joined the soccer team.<eos> Why did you move that picture?<eos> I'm trying to start over. What chance do I have if my own mom doesn't believe me?<eos> I do.
It's like stepping back in time.<eos> Cameras. I don't see any cameras.<eos> Stolen?<eos> Idris Williams. 69 years old. Lives alone.<eos> No wife. No children.<eos> What's the latest on the car?<eos> Regularly taxed and serviced until six years ago.<eos> Hasn't been driven since.<eos> So how does he get about?<eos> He doesn't.
We need to talk to him.<eos> You'll have to dig him up first.<eos> Old Vaughan's been dead 30 years.<eos> It was an odd thing, you know.<eos> When he died there were three or four of us in the running to take over.<eos> Old Caradog Williams, Idris's father, had over 300 acres up there.<eos> Dairy herd, sheep, it was quite an operation.<eos> He'd have been one hell of a client.<eos> I take it you didn't get the call?<eos> Nobody did.
No, no, there were children at Talygroes.<eos> There were notches cut into the doorframe.<eos> Find out what happened to them.<eos> Caradog Williams?<eos> I thought perhaps you knew him, sir?<eos> Now why would you think that?<eos> Never met the man.<eos> What about his son, Idris Williams?<eos> Did you know him?<eos> No-one did.
No. No. Just to the next valley.<eos> How did he get on with everyone?<eos> Really well.<eos> He didn't get into any arguments?<eos> Fights?<eos> Make any enemies?<eos> Wasn't the type.<eos> What about you?<eos> Did you like him?<eos> Yes. We all did.
'Cause the next time Kiera points a gun at your head I won't stand in her way.<eos> Alright.<eos> - And I didn't betray him.<eos> - I know, I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I'm sure you'll be able to make him feel better.<eos> It's not his fault that he needs me more than you do right now.<eos> I don't know if that's true.<eos> You have your father's strength.<eos> You always did.
Oh, we'll take what we can get.<eos> What about the girl, she talking?<eos> It's gonna take some time.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> If anyone can get her to lead us to Pelant, it's our shrink.<eos> You hear that, Sweetie bird?<eos> You're the man.<eos> Don't blow it.<eos> Listen, I hate to cut short a meeting with my sixth- and eighth-favorite people, but I got a date with my first favorite.<eos> Damn right you do.
All right.<eos> What would I tell him, Ray?<eos> Conor hitting that kid in the back of the head?<eos> - The way we fucked up our kids?<eos> - We didn't fuck up our kids.<eos> How you hate your father?<eos> The way we have to hide out in Calabasas?<eos> The way you fuck?<eos> - I thought you liked the way I fuck.<eos> - I do.
- Hey, Kepner. Died!<eos> - You...<eos> - Stop.<eos> - Kepner, what is your problem? Hey!<eos> Kepner, take a walk.<eos> Take a walk!<eos> Okay.<eos> He looks like her.<eos> Did you see him?<eos> Uh, no. I didn't.
You almost died. You...<eos> "I lost Mark. You almost died."<eos> You weren't on the freaking plane!<eos> The warrior wounds? Stick out your leg, and I will go grab a bone saw, and let's even the score!<eos> It always comes back to the leg.<eos> I trusted you, more than anything, more than anyone... in my life.<eos> And you decided to cut it off.<eos> To save your life!<eos> You didn't lose anything!<eos> I did!
And have you, uh, seen Dr. Hunt?<eos> No, no.<eos> What's up?<eos> Nothing. I...<eos> I'd...<eos> Would you tell him thanks, though?<eos> I had him keep April out of surgeries all day.<eos> This was kind of my only shot at this.<eos> Didn't wanna miss it.<eos> No, no, you didn't.
You tell my friends these last words!<eos> I am to hang, and you are my brothers, and I happily die for you, for my country.<eos> And I am not sorry and I am not afraid.<eos> It's better this be my fate than fall on bended knee to the Union!<eos> I'm not gonna lie to ya, Kevin, and you can do what you like to me.<eos> You can shoot me through the head or the heart.<eos> Don't tempt me.<eos> But I loved Ellen.<eos> Maybe not as much as you, maybe in a different way,<eos> but I did.

Just give it a minute, and then... go in and talk to him, I guess.<eos> I don't know who Mike is anymore.<eos> Not when he drinks.<eos> Everything that's gone wrong with us started when he started drinking.<eos> It's why we had to leave L.A. It's why he doesn't have a career.<eos> He's just...<eos> I don't know. Not the man I married.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - How you doing?
Freeport college, is it?<eos> I noticed your t-shirt this morning in the town square.<eos> I assume you two are dating. Yeah.<eos> Is that against the law?<eos> Depends on what you do on your date.<eos> I just got one question for you, trent.<eos> Are you okay with whitey culver getting fired For a crime he had nothing to do with?<eos> I don't know that he had nothing to do with it.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> You both do.
- Everyone live up to your expectations?<eos> - Pretty much. And now I totally get why you're a little gun-shy about the whole wedding thing.<eos> Okay, folks, let's do this.<eos> So I'd like to call on Emma's two amazing godfathers.<eos> - Ready to go, dude.<eos> - We're on it. - Her one incredible godmother.<eos> - That's me.<eos> Her two one-of-a-kind grandparents.<eos> - Aww, we love you.<eos> - Aww, yes, we do.
I was just kidding.<eos> No, I... I know, sweetheart.<eos> It's just... Dating is hard.<eos> At my age... And in my condition, if that's the right word for it? I'm still in love with your mom.<eos> I mean, she was the love of my life.<eos> I don't...<eos> It's been nine years.<eos> Life goes on, right?<eos> That's what my shrink said.<eos> Yeah, he did.

And you didn't follow her?<eos> You just let her go?<eos> I can't run in heels.<eos> Okay, what time was that? So, Santiago and Charley are telling the truth?<eos> So far.<eos> I mean, here's Ariel leaving Club Kismet on her own.<eos> We got surveillance from the street.<eos> That's her, just after midnight.<eos> I mean, easy prey. She doesn't know where she is.<eos> But we do.
You know what she said to me?<eos> "Why don't you find a real crime to solve, McGruff?"<eos> And you wonder where he gets it from.<eos> Well, you don't have to worry about protecting your yard anymore.<eos> Apparently, Jenna's thinking about installing a home security system.<eos> Bite your tongue! A home security system to a dog is like the cotton gin to a slave. It's an insult.<eos> It says you're easily replaceable.<eos> You know why they call us "watch dogs," Ryan?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> No one does.
JIM: I'm taking some time off from work...<eos> Well, my other work because we needed it.<eos> It's great.<eos> The phone's been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.<eos> But that doesn't matter.<eos> This does.
Congratulations.<eos> Good job.<eos> We did it, we did it.<eos> I love you. Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I will now perform my final kata forms.<eos> You're going to watch me, right? Yes, I will.<eos> (CLEARS T HRO AT)<eos> Sensei, you're not watching. Yeah, I'm watching.<eos> Just do it.
What did your sister want with me?<eos> Why did Marcel kill her?<eos> I see you brought friends.<eos> - They're not with me.<eos> - They're with Marcel, that's all that matters.<eos> He killed my sister because she broke the rules.<eos> So I talk to you in front of him I'm next.<eos> - Are you two gentlemen following me?<eos> - Marcel said we are your guides.<eos> - Oh, he did, did he?

Don't tell me you're not coming.<eos> Denise has been home with Christian all week.<eos> So bring him. Traci's bringing Leo.<eos> Christian is allergic to bees and trees and pollen and grass and...<eos> This is the last chance for us all to get together<eos> - before you go to Timmins. - Well, I...<eos> look, I'm so sorry. Look, you guys can still use my truck, though.<eos> (Whispers) Thank you.<eos> It's okay. We don't need it.<eos> - No, we really do.
1977.<eos> Cronenberg.<eos> There's a screening in the park tomorrow, and I was wondering if you'd like to go with me.<eos> I need to be really clear about something.<eos> 'Cause a lot of what you're saying, I'm not gonna lie, - is...<eos> - Yes, I just... I asked you out.<eos> What about Frank?<eos> I don't think it's his kind of movie.<eos> Doesn't... worry you anymore?<eos> No, it does.
- Celery?<eos> - Celery. - That's a great name.<eos> (Radio chatter) Gail seems upset.<eos> Do you actually believe that Friday the 13th is bad luck?<eos> You know, how high-rise buildings never have a 13th floor, and a house is harder to sell if it's 13 on the street?<eos> The whole 13 thing seems kind of weird.<eos> Yeah, it is really weird.<eos> What's wrong with Gail?<eos> I was hoping you'd get that I don't wanna talk about it.<eos> I did.
Can't wait.<eos> I've always wanted to hang out in a hot pink bedroom.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Because... looks good on you. Yeah.<eos> Pink is your color.<eos> You sure you want to do this?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.

Only way to live, bro.<eos> Yeah.<eos> (Radio chatter) - So how long have you and Nick been doing it?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> 'Cause I'm guessing, like, three or four weeks.<eos> I mean, that's when I noticed the difference, because you have this, like, this, like, glow.<eos> And Nick... he just... he looks, I don't know.<eos> Like more... like, accomplished.<eos> I don't have a glow.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
You should go inside.<eos> You'll get eaten alive out here.<eos> You know mosquitos ignore me.<eos> In those shorts?<eos> Did you find a bottle?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Cheers.<eos> I loved camp.<eos> I never went.<eos> Yes, you did.
Maybe I know where it is.<eos> I'm just looking for some place to hide my presents I bought y'all.<eos> My, that TV's in here good!<eos> Who's she?<eos> Is that little Bobby?<eos> My, you have grown up big!<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - That's Grandma Ida.<eos> We don't have a grandma.<eos> You do now.
You and I both know-"<eos> - Did you want us?<eos> - Yes. Get everyone.<eos> No, wait.<eos> Just listen. I've got it.<eos> Great.<eos> Remember this work?<eos> I've never seen it before.<eos> Well, it says it all.<eos> It really does.
Right.<eos> I'm not the woman who is going to stay here waiting for you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> No, it's not good.<eos> I can't say these things.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Listen, honey.<eos> "We are like strings who are woven together." I don't understand a thing.<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - No, I don't.
- Let's order then.<eos> You pay, because you are a writer of westsellers!<eos> I'll get a cappuccino.<eos> Good morning.<eos> The final results just arrived.<eos> Who won?<eos> Andrea Splendore, 32 years old, is the new mayor of Rome!<eos> We are now waiting for his victory speech.<eos> - I didn't write the speech!<eos> - You didn't!
Would you guys mind taking it?<eos> Yo, Kate.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's up?<eos> Yeah, what's going on?<eos> Look, there's something that I have to tell you guys, but there's someone else that I have to tell first.<eos> Castle.<eos> It's me.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Well, left of field I know, but if he comes back, we arrest him.<eos> Seriously, I don't give a toss about him coming back.<eos> What scares me shitless is him not coming back. Him realising we found his house and then disappearing... forever.<eos> You have to head back?<eos> Not yet, but in an hour or so, maybe.<eos> You don't seem like the sort of woman who has to have a meal ready for her husband.<eos> I so loved to cook for him, I just can't remember the last time he ate the meals that came out of the oven.<eos> Oh, he works late?<eos> He works late, he works early. He works too much.<eos> What does he do?
What would you tell your son if you could speak to him right now?<eos> I would tell him that we love him and miss him.<eos> I would tell him that no matter what happens, we are proud of him, and we know that the Lord knows where he is and what he needs.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Nikolai!<eos> Thank you.<eos> You want a beer?<eos> No.<eos> I bet you do.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You don't wanna get stepped on.<eos> It's a small shop.<eos> I look at you and you know what I see?<eos> A couple of skinny white boys playing gangster, saying they wanna open a blind pig.<eos> But Poppa T here also tells me you operate outta Greektown.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - So you're rolling with the good graces of Mr. Skelos.<eos> Hey, sweetheart, look how beautiful.<eos> You have yourself kids?<eos> My wife does.
Kono?<eos> Get away from her!<eos> Thank you for finding these.<eos> Where did you get those?<eos> She asked you a question, Michael.<eos> Your girlfriend tried to burn me.<eos> - And you let her.<eos> - You started this, Michael, when you stole her gun to kill the man that put you in jail.<eos> He had to go.<eos> And so does she.
Hello, Brownall Job Centre, how can I help you?<eos> Erm... well I'd like to make an appointment with you.<eos> Can you hold the line, please?<eos> There's no mobile phones in the job centre.<eos> The interview was going all right, but then, the woman who was asking all the questions, she wasn't a woman anymore. She was Phillip Schofield.<eos> And we weren't in an office, we were in a squat in Nuneaton where I used to live.<eos> My thinking is now that it was probably a dream.<eos> So, my answer to your question would be no, I haven't had any job interviews. Unless you count dreams.<eos> Do you count dreams?<eos> We don't, no.
You haven't got any nail varnish remover, have you, Chlo?<eos> No, not on me.<eos> Why?<eos> Brain of Britain here's put magic marker on the whiteboard.<eos> I've got some.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> I was upset.<eos> Not as upset as Trish'd be if she saw that!<eos> I thought you liked working here?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I do.
- Think so.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Mary Bigsby drives a blue minivan.<eos> I got the tags right here.<eos> We'll find it.<eos> Your mother is staying with Cailin.<eos> - Do you think that's okay?<eos> - Do I think it's okay that my mother is babysitting a grown adult?<eos> - No, I do not.
I was so wasted, I didn't even really remember hitting that girl until a week later.<eos> But you did remember once you'd come down off the drugs?<eos> In Waukegan, Illinois.<eos> You seem pretty certain of that.<eos> I went to the Public Library there, you know, to go through the newspapers to...<eos> See if it had been reported.<eos> But...<eos> I didn't find anything, so...<eos> I convinced myself that I'd imagined it.<eos> Well, maybe you did.
Who was the deal with?<eos> He didn't say.<eos> He really loved me.<eos> Even after we exchanged photos.<eos> Ashley, did Kurt ever say he had any enemies?<eos> Anybody who wanted to hurt him?<eos> Oh, I know someone who wanted to hurt him.<eos> My psycho ex-husband.<eos> Well, I guess Ashley didn't tell you about how I found out about them.<eos> No, she didn't.
No!<eos> No.<eos> Liam!<eos> Liam!<eos> Start!<eos> Start!<eos> We want you to be honest.<eos> About what?<eos> You wanted this.<eos> No, I didn't.
They don't even know who you are.<eos> You what? What happened to bigger things ahead?<eos> Well, we'll see.<eos> No, we won't.<eos> I quit.<eos> Wrong answer, darling.<eos> It's possible.<eos> Um... Grace has some news she would like to share with everybody.<eos> -No, I don't.<eos> -Sure you do.
If Max knew, he'd stop you, or he'd call Kate.<eos> Is that why you made that whole speech about letting him do the lecture...<eos> To soften him up and trick him into leaving?<eos> The speech was true.<eos> The... cantaloupe part was complete bullshit.<eos> I understand you're looking for detective koepfer?<eos> People are gonna die if I don't speak to him right away.<eos> How about we talk somewhere more private?<eos> How do you know detective koepfer?<eos> I don't.
Pain au chocolat?<eos> Troy.<eos> Doctor.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> The phones are down at the entire agency?<eos> Yes.<eos> How does that happen?<eos> Someone can't just snip a few wires.<eos> Don't we have firewalls or whatever?<eos> We do.
I was surprised to hear from you again.<eos> Last time, you... you know, took off so fast.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, this is awkward.<eos> I don't have anymore money, if that's what you mean.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, God, no.<eos> I was thinking about you on your birthday... wishing I was there.<eos> Wondering if you even got to have a Quinceanera.<eos> I did, yeah.
If you're into Brandon, then go for it.<eos> - Be happy. - I can't.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Maybe I don't.<eos> I don't know you that well, partly because you don't make it easy to.<eos> But one thing I'm pretty sure of is that putting your heart out there scares you a lot more than getting caught breaking the rules.<eos> If being here, in this situation, isn't proof enough that you've got to seize the day, then I don't what is.<eos> - Where's Wyatt?<eos> - He had to go.<eos> She did great.
You told I.A. that...<eos> That I was unconscious or in shock or something.<eos> I didn't want to contradict you in case - you said something in your statement...<eos> - Whoa, hold on, wait.<eos> So, you thought I might be lying?<eos> He dropped the gun, Mike. Before you shot him.<eos> You sure?<eos> Mike, listen, you heard gunshots, you were amped on adrenaline and I was lying on the ground.<eos> Of course you thought that he still had the gun.<eos> - But he didn't.
Becca can suck my big fat--<eos> Woody.<eos> Woody Loveridge would be perfect for Kristy.<eos> Let me see your pin.<eos> Ooh, crafty.<eos> Why aren't you wearing it? I want to see it on.<eos> I'm not putting it on, and I'm not going to the dance.<eos> - Did you break up?<eos> - No! - Matty doesn't want to go.<eos> - No. I don't.
Listen, um, your father told me that he asked you to live with him half the time.<eos> Is it okay?<eos> I mean, he seems to want me to.<eos> But if you don't want me to, I totally get it.<eos> I mean, I don't want you to be alone.<eos> Oh, sweetie.<eos> It's okay.<eos> He's your father.<eos> It's just I miss him sometimes.<eos> Of course you do.
Just chill the fuck out for now, okay?<eos> - Michele, could you...<eos> - I will leave you boys to it.<eos> Okay.<eos> We all know that Anders did an unforgiveable thing.<eos> - Gee, nice opening, Mike.<eos> - You would do well to shut it right now.<eos> We all get that.<eos> - Even Anders gets that in his own way.<eos> - Like fuck he does.
I hope you can fly, Odin!<eos> Hey Mike, can Odin fly?<eos> No Axl, you can't!<eos> It'd be a good time to step in now.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Bragi, shut these dickheads up.<eos> - My powers only work on one.<eos> - Okay... who thinks I can fly?<eos> - Axl, you can't!<eos> - No, no, no, none of you do.
Did we ever go on a picnic together?<eos> No.<eos> You must think I'm deeply strange.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'll see myself out.<eos> Bringing back happy childhood memories?<eos> Not really.<eos> In fact, it's kind of like that whole part of my life is a big blank.<eos> Well, yeah, you were very young when we left.<eos> So, how you doing?
No way would Mike ever try and shaft me out of being Odin.<eos> A brother does not plot against his own brother, Zeb.<eos> You've never heard of Cain and Abel?<eos> This isn't flying a kite, man.<eos> Mike wants your throne.<eos> He wants to replace you as Allfather.<eos> Mike.<eos> He wants me to come to his place.<eos> Did Ty say what this urgent family meeting is about?<eos> - No, he did not.
The Volm plan to move their weapon out of the complex this afternoon.<eos> Project Orange gets under way tomorrow morning at dawn.<eos> What's our target?<eos> We won't know until we go.<eos> "We" won't know, or you're not telling me?<eos> It's standard military procedure.<eos> You evaluate your target options till the last minute. And then you go with the best one.<eos> We've got all our eggs in this basket, Dan.<eos> What if this weapon doesn't work?<eos> Or what if it does?

- Right now.<eos> - I did not ask for that assessment, sheriff.<eos> I think we've got...<eos> What are you looking at me for?<eos> - You're always looking at me.<eos> - Did you go to Leavenworth and rub blankets on that sickly kid?<eos> All right, I went to Leavenworth and rubbed blankets on a kid.<eos> - I knew it!<eos> - What are you...?<eos> Oh, don't...
You do realize that only makes me more curious.<eos> So... is it big?<eos> You know I can't talk about it.<eos> Doesn't mean I can't guess.<eos> It must be big. You had to cancel our weekend together.<eos> Must be local, because you're still here.<eos> I bet I can figure this out.<eos> Well, that doesn't mean that you should.<eos> Come on. Don't you miss working together?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm a fruitarian.<eos> Course you are.<eos> It's all that I eat.<eos> Original diet of mankind.<eos> Nutrition as God intended.<eos> You know, Pi, don't, uh, take this the wrong way, but... how long do you plan on staying at casa de Castle?<eos> You know, I'm actually in a little bit of a bind.<eos> See, I live in Amsterdam, but I, uh... kinda lost my passport.<eos> But, hey, you don't wanna hear about my troubles. You got your own, right?<eos> I do now.
Hey, you should grab yours and do the same.<eos> Come on, Laycee.<eos> ♪ Wow.<eos> Y'all, I have had so much fun tonight.<eos> I really have.<eos> But I have to say... (Audience member whistles) - (Woman in audience) We love you!<eos> - It's hard being so close to where Rayna's fighting for her life. And it's even harder to not be able to tell her that I'm praying for her.<eos> So I wanna do something about that.<eos> And if any of you feel the way that I do... (Cheers and whistles) You're welcome to join me over at the hospital.<eos> - (Man) Yeah, we do!
Big breath. Breathe away.<eos> Breathe away. - Okay, here we go.<eos> - You're doing great.<eos> - Just hang on. You're doing fine. - That's it.<eos> Just keep breathing. - There you go. Just fine.<eos> - Doing fantastic. - Just keep breathing.<eos> There you go. There you go. That's it.<eos> Breath, breath, breath.<eos> Doing great. Doing great.
You know, the kind where there's absolutely no proof?<eos> I've known you some time, Ms. Swan.<eos> And sadly, despite everything you've been through, you're still just that... bail bondsperson, looking for evidence.<eos> Well, dearie, that's not gonna work in Neverland.<eos> I'll do whatever it takes.<eos> Well, you just need someone to tell you what that is.<eos> Sorry, dearie.<eos> Our foe is too fearsome for hand-holding.<eos> Neverland is a place where imagination runs wild.<eos> And sadly... Yours doesn't.
It's our way out.<eos> What... what are you doing?<eos> - Getting a running start.<eos> - For what? Everyone knows pixie dust is for flying.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> The dust doesn't work.<eos> That's because you have to believe.<eos> I definitely do not believe.<eos> That's okay...<eos> Because I do.
[ Knife thudding ] It's a great movie.<eos> - She died slowly of cancer.<eos> - It's a great movie!<eos> She died a painful death of cancer!<eos> She married someone her mother didn't love, by the way!<eos> Jackie: Okay.<eos> So, I know that I can be a little possessive when it comes to Reggie Jackson, so I'm going to think this out logically.<eos> I mean, do I wish that he forewent dating altogether and stayed with me forever?<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - Yes, I do.
There it is.<eos> - That's for me.<eos> - Yep. It is.<eos> Hello.<eos> Um... who the hell is this?<eos> Reggie: This is my...<eos> - Soul mate.<eos> - Soul mate.<eos> Did you just say this is your "soul mate"?<eos> He did.
Is her cat okay?<eos> Where were you yesterday?<eos> I was at my trailer.<eos> We're searching that trailer right now.<eos> Well, I don't know why.<eos> 'Cause we're looking for a girl.<eos> Mexican.<eos> Crossed the border, then disappeared.<eos> You know a girl like that?<eos> No, I do not.
I can't confirm that.<eos> I don't know what conversation you expect to have... if you won't acknowledge the fucking obvious.<eos> The CIA gave you that story to set me up.<eos> - For what?<eos> - The big lie.<eos> Despite what they said, Nicholas Brody is not responsible... for the explosion at Langley.<eos> - You can prove this?<eos> - Yeah, that's why I'm here.<eos> Did Saul Berenson know when he testified before the Senate?<eos> Of course he did.
"CIA Officer Linked to Langley Bomber. "<eos> The case officer in question, she's been diagnosed as bipolar.<eos> It's Carrie.<eos> She called a reporter.<eos> Apparently, she thinks it's important they "hear her side of the story. "<eos> The CIA gave you that story to set me up.<eos> For what?<eos> Nicholas Brody is not responsible for the explosion at Langley.<eos> Did Saul Berenson know when he testified?<eos> Of course he did.
Somebody took them.<eos> I couldn't stop him.<eos> I need my passport for travel.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> I can't get another one.<eos> Just get better now.<eos> I will try to find out who took your things.<eos> Why are you trying to help me?<eos> You know Carrie Mathison.<eos> So do I.
- That was a long time ago.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We were so young.<eos> I was so worried about you when it all went to hell... about getting you out.<eos> Yeah. No, I was worried about you.<eos> Leaving you behind.<eos> I said I didn't care about your friend from Mumbai, but I do.<eos> I said I didn't have any claim on you.<eos> - Saul-<eos> - But I do.
Wait.<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> - You said you'd tell me the truth.<eos> - And you told me I was incapable.<eos> You might be right.<eos> But if you wanna talk to someone you can trust... who was there... you should know that the man who built the bomb and moved the SUV... he didn't die in the explosion like they say.<eos> As far as I know, he's still in this country.<eos> Where?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Who does?
You know what he asked me?<eos> Who moved the bomb?<eos> If it was Brody.<eos> Now why would he ask me that?<eos> That implies that there's a difference of opinion on that subject.<eos> You should know that the man who built the bomb and moved the SUV... he didn't die in the explosion like they say.<eos> As far as I know, he's still in this country.<eos> - Where?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Who does?
This was two years ago.<eos> Hardly fits the profile.<eos> Any munitions training? Experience with explosives?<eos> No.<eos> All right. Add him to the list anyway.<eos> Which begs the question... are we even sure that the guy who made the bomb moved Brody's car?<eos> - Depends.<eos> - On what?<eos> On whether or not you believe Javadi.<eos> - Which you do.
- Carrie?<eos> - Yeah. How'd you know?<eos> The tone of your voice.<eos> You don't talk to anyone else like that.<eos> I wasn't aware.<eos> Are you ready to eat?<eos> Should I open a bottle of wine?<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Listen, I gotta go away for a few days.<eos> - You do? - Yeah.
Ask him.<eos> What was he doing in Caracas?<eos> You didn't even know he was there, did you?<eos> I got another message from Carrie.<eos> Is she calming down at all?<eos> No, the opposite.<eos> Senator Lockhart just paid her a visit.<eos> Somehow, he knows about Caracas.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> Well, he does.

There is another option.<eos> What?<eos> Ibogaine.<eos> It's a drug based on a Nigerian plant.<eos> It dramatically accelerates the withdrawal process and kills the addiction.<eos> The side effects are brutal, which is why it's outlawed here.<eos> Nausea, vomiting, some hallucinations.<eos> Violent, mind-bending hallucinations.<eos> Does it work?<eos> It does.
_<eos> In your famous videotape, you said,<eos> "I love my country."<eos> Which I meant.<eos> And yet America declares you an enemy of the state.<eos> There's a wide gulf between what America says it is and what it actually is.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> The most recent insult.<eos> Does this explain your actions on December 12?<eos> It does.
An initial flight plan has them diverting north at Torbat Heydariyeh.<eos> Skirting the grid, it's all desert.<eos> Making their way directly down this ridgeline to Carrie's coordinates.<eos> Total flying time from the base?<eos> Approximately 210 minutes.<eos> And the Chinooks?<eos> I assume they're staying on the Afghan side to provide support?<eos> In case the Black Hawks get into trouble, and/or the SEALS have to fight their way out of Iran.<eos> I don't like the sound of that.<eos> Neither does JSOC.
Check out Casanova! So, overall we got below 75% and we're now the lowest in the area, so, thanks, guys!<eos> You pillock!<eos> Go on, everyone.<eos> Off you go, please.<eos> Let's go then.<eos> I need to eat before 7:30 or I get gas.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> You said you were cooking supper for anyone praised in the report.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, so I did.
It does.<eos> It does to him.<eos> Maybe Gina knew what her father was into..<eos> - Not now, Sonya.<eos> - Marco's right.<eos> If you press her now, you're not gonna get anything.<eos> Burgers, chili, onions... heartburn...<eos> Come on, my treat. We don't have time to eat, Hank.<eos> Yes, we do, Sonya.<eos> Yes, we do.
What are you doing?<eos> Don't move.<eos> Don't push me away.<eos> You're shaking.<eos> You can't show them you're scared.<eos> He threatened me here at French court.<eos> He wanted me to know that they tried to poison me at the convent.<eos> He's heard things about my reluctance to marry you.<eos> Then they're aware. That I don't have your country's protection here.<eos> You do.

How about we go get a drink?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Tell me what you liked about it.<eos> Uh, what I liked about it.<eos> Okay, well, the beginning just... it started the whole thing off.<eos> And then the middle took us from the beginning right to the end.<eos> Which stayed true to its name because there was nothing after that.<eos> So I think we should go get that drink now.<eos> - You didn't read it.<eos> - No, I did, I did.
- Boyfriend?<eos> - Zamir Kraji, or something.<eos> - Albanian maybe?<eos> - Some kind of thick accent.<eos> Sure, maybe.<eos> Well, it's probably...<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> Zamir Kraji, it's the police!<eos> Oh, hey, Teddy, did you hear somebody cry for help in there?<eos> Yes, I did!
All of us, boss.<eos> Nobody went home.<eos> Good, put 'em on.<eos> Everybody there?<eos> - Yup.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Teddy, tell me about Zamir's investments.<eos> 383 separate cash deposits, totaling...<eos> Other direction.<eos> How did the investments do?
Uh, I'm really sorry.<eos> Yeah, I shouldn't have said all that stuff and...<eos> No, look, don't worry about it.<eos> You were actually absolutely right about those two, you know? Here.<eos> Oh, my God, are you okay?<eos> That was my bad.<eos> I don't know why I called for it. - Yeah.<eos> - Uh, you really want to get back<eos> With Sara, right? I know that look.<eos> I do, yeah, even after everything.
Are you kidding me?<eos> Somehow I always let you talk me out of it.<eos> We're getting married, and I-I need to know that you love me for me, and not some guy you want me to be.<eos> It is like you have been brainwashed by these idiots that you've only known for two months.<eos> These "idiots" seem to get me more than you do.<eos> Just so you know, the acoustics are very good in here.<eos> You are being ridiculous.<eos> Do you really want to throw your life away?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
He sent me a text that he was at a friend's house and he would be home late.<eos> So?<eos> So he never came home at all.<eos> - Oh, geez.<eos> - And I was worried, you know, because I made dinner and everything.<eos> I mean, it's not like him to just disappear like this.<eos> Denise, did you call that number... the one he texted?<eos> No.<eos> I'm afraid and I don't want to know.<eos> Probably because you already do.
Mwah! - You guys have fun at the aquarium.<eos> - We will.<eos> - Thank you for taking him, Janey.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Bye!<eos> - Bye, mom.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - You really liked Karsten, huh?<eos> He didn't seem like a bad guy.<eos> Well, the really rich ones never do.
What's that about?<eos> I am home because I didn't have a choice, and I wanted something better for Danny.<eos> I am coaching because nobody wanted these kids.<eos> And I know how that feels.<eos> People... people are gonna call you weird and creepy, and foreign and gay... feminine, and...<eos> Hey, don't forget fat.<eos> That kid laying' there, that kid is fat.<eos> Really?<eos> So wouldn't it be great if just one time, you could take all of the insults, and all of the bullying, and you could just shove it right up their butts?<eos> Uh, I do.
But...<eos> I'm in.<eos> But...<eos> - You're not.<eos> - But...<eos> Evan, the plan is to let Milos think he's coming here to be part of a clinical trial, land at JFK, and get arrested.<eos> That's it.<eos> We deviate from that, we start taking risks.<eos> But if you really want to do something...<eos> - I do.
I can't wait till Ethan comes back so we can tell him.<eos> You ready to call your husband now, Mrs. Masters?<eos> Soon.<eos> In a little while.<eos> You put my name on the study.<eos> You earned it.<eos> No one believes in the work.<eos> Scully, maybe.<eos> No one else.<eos> I do.
We have no physical proof.<eos> The FBI, they have to have a sample of the real Graham's DNA, right?<eos> Sure.<eos> All personnel are required to provide one.<eos> Then we have them compare it to what's on file, to the impostor's DNA.<eos> I don't think the double is going to cooperate.<eos> So we don't give him a choice.<eos> The FBI has to take a DNA sample while they're doing an autopsy.<eos> You want to kill the Deputy Director of the FBI?<eos> Amanda already did that.
Yeah.<eos> There.<eos> Not this time.<eos> Think the pigs made them sick?<eos> Or we made the pigs sick.<eos> I think we should stay away from Judy a while.<eos> - Just in case. - Okay.<eos> - I don't like it, but--<eos> - We have to protect her.<eos> Yes, we do.
Who the hell are you?<eos> Agent Crawford, FBI.<eos> You guys know I don't talk to field agents.<eos> Get your boss on the phone.<eos> I'm not here for you.<eos> I'm here for your dad.<eos> What do you want with his dad?<eos> Go back to sleep, Milhouse.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> I didn't. But I do now.
Oh, you're so right.<eos> - No she's not. - Yeah, she is.<eos> I mean when they were the bad boys, we liked them so much better.<eos> And when I was the good girl, I liked me better.<eos> This is so screwed up.<eos> I cannot seem to figure out a way to get out of it.<eos> You just have to tell him that you don't want to get married.<eos> What?<eos> I want to get married.<eos> - No, you don't. - Neither do you.
Try to get him out of his funk, get him to release whatever he's got to the publisher so this thing doesn't get really ugly.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay?<eos> You can go now.<eos> Oh.<eos> What y'all watching?<eos> Homeboy in the bathtub with that catfish?<eos> Oh, T.K., you don't want to see this.<eos> Yes, I -- a sex tape?<eos> Yes, I do!
You tell me.<eos> I can't help you if you won't let me in.<eos> Mommy, Daddy, can I have chocolate chips in my pancakes?<eos> No, not for breakfast.<eos> Yes, you c...<eos> Your mom is right. Not for breakfast.<eos> Now go sit at the table.<eos> Daddy's famous pancakes are ready.<eos> You don't have famous pancakes. Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, I do now.
Good.<eos> Use it.<eos> I need something from you first.<eos> And what would that be?<eos> My coffee.<eos> Hello, aaron.<eos> Your sister, uh, made a living selling lies.<eos> You were ostracized for serving the truth.<eos> You must have appreciated the irony.<eos> Ironically enough, I didn't.
Uh, I hate to interrupt.<eos> I think, Byron, I know what you want to hear.<eos> And it has nothing to do with the shooting days or the cast... because you've had a long and fruitful, creative relationship together.<eos> I think, and correct me if I'm wrong... that when you say you want a reason... you want to know why we would push you like this.<eos> It would help.<eos> Well, the truth is that I don't think Ted wants to say.<eos> 'Cause it's, well... it's a little bit personal.<eos> In fact, it's very personal.<eos> I'm not sure I know what you mean.<eos> Yes, you do.
Buddy, I told your mom that we were gonna clean up this mess.<eos> Do I have to?<eos> Oh, I'm afraid so.<eos> Okay. Hey, Dad.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Is it okay if the team sleeps over tomorrow after the game?<eos> The whole team?<eos> That's a lot of kids.<eos> I know, but nobody else can do it, and I told them that my dad was back, and they want you to show us some plays.<eos> Oh, you did, did you?
You're not smiling, and you're not asking for a drink.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> It's bad, Georgia.<eos> It's real bad.<eos> The client list is gone.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did I hear you right? Uh-huh.<eos> I thought you took it out of The Rub... I did.<eos> I did, and I put it in the one place where no one was gonna find it.<eos> But someone did.
Taste.<eos> Alright.<eos> That's good.<eos> It's awful, isn't it?<eos> Am I under oath? See?<eos> I'm a terrible cook!<eos> I should just stick to the courtroom.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I happen to think you are amazing in the kitchen.<eos> Mm-hmm. Yeah, I do.
Yes, it's your Adele-like words, but it's his boy-band packaging.<eos> He took your over-share and turned it into a panty-peeler with a surprisingly good bridge.<eos> You make it look so easy.<eos> Well, you know, it's all about treating the instrument like an extension of your body.<eos> Right.<eos> - Yeah, I'll show you, here.<eos> So what are...<eos> It looks good.<eos> You don't think they've done it, do you? Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Look at that.<eos> And that's just from one.<eos> Hang on. Don't come in.<eos> Danielle's expressing.<eos> It's me, Janette.<eos> Staff briefing when you've finished your milking.<eos> Can't she do that in the toilet?<eos> Would you make your tea in the toilet?<eos> Sorry, Trish.<eos> Nearly done.
- Hey.<eos> - Any word from the lab?<eos> - Yep. They confirmed that there was enough salivary DNA on the victim's shirt for testing.<eos> They are comparing it with Matthew's profile right now.<eos> That's great news.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So... I guess now we... we just wait.<eos> You really like working here, don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, just like you did.
Your Honor, courts get involved in matters of the heart every day... divorce and annulment, pre-and post-nuptial agreements, child custody, alimony, palimony.<eos> This case is no different.<eos> California Civil Code section 43.5 prohibits lawsuits for breach of promise to marry.<eos> It was enacted in 1939, and it's still on the books today.<eos> He's right.<eos> Honestly, miss Bingum, you're pushing a boulder uphill.<eos> Section 43.5 is only on the books because no one has been brave enough to challenge it, but laws of the heart are constantly evolving.<eos> Which side of history do you want to be on?<eos> You really want a trial?<eos> We do.
Yeah, what happened in Rue Eville, when Dalton went into that house?<eos> I was shot.<eos> In the shoulder.<eos> You think I engineered that?<eos> I could have died.<eos> And for what?<eos> For this?<eos> You are treating me like a fucking traitor again.<eos> But you didn't die, though, did you?<eos> One of my people did,
Yo, Ty.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Vámonos.<eos> Ty.<eos> Ty!<eos> There should be a town a few miles south.<eos> Lost a whole night.<eos> My sister, everybody else-- they're probably dead.<eos> Well, it helps to keep moving.<eos> No, it doesn't.
When the others find out, they won't want you there.<eos> And if they don't make it back, if everybody dies of this thing and it's just the two of us, with Judith and Carl-- with my children...<eos> I won't have you there.<eos> Rick, it's me.<eos> No one else has to know.<eos> I thought you were done making decisions for everyone.<eos> I'm making this decision for me.<eos> I could have pretended that everything was gonna be fine.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> I did something.
You find out who did this and you bring 'em to me. You understand? You bring 'em to me!<eos> We'll find out who--<eos> - I need to say it again?<eos> - No.<eos> No. I know what you're feeling.<eos> I've been there.<eos> You saw me there. It's dangerous.<eos> - Karen didn't deserve this. - No.<eos> David didn't deserve it.<eos> - Nobody does.
When we get past this thing... it's not gonna be like how it was, is it?<eos> No.<eos> Was that denial?<eos> Not seeing things for how they were?<eos> No.<eos> You just caught a break.<eos> You needed some time.<eos> You got some.<eos> You got lucky.<eos> We all did.
Finished, miss.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> Very nice, dear.<eos> Oh, I don't believe you've quite finished, Adeline.<eos> 'Margaret?<eos> Do you believe in ghosts?<eos> You asked me that before.<eos> Your answer was evasive, as I recall.<eos> Well, let's just say I'm beginning to.<eos> Anyway, Hester didn't.
I told her we're not for sale.<eos> Right.<eos> It's nice to be wanted, but they're not Starbucks, and we're not Seattle's best coffee.<eos> Or Diedrich's coffee.<eos> Or coffee people.<eos> - Or Tazo.<eos> - Okay, we get it, honey.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You get it.<eos> I did.
OK, well, you were telling us you were embarrassed by his behaviour.<eos> You feel betrayed that he hasn't introduced you to your parents. Just...<eos> let's just let someone else have a turn, shall we, mate?<eos> What about him over there?<eos> He looks like he's got issues, don't he?<eos> You... you were saying that at times you're ashamed of him, that he makes you feel ashamed.<eos> Just fucking move on!<eos> For fuck's sake, man!<eos> (CHUCKLES) It melted all over the seats.<eos> Sorry? What did?
- Uh, come in.<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> I, uh, made some pan dulce.<eos> I used to love this stuff when I was pregnant.<eos> Oh, that's so sweet.<eos> Molly's really gonna love that.<eos> And I made a lot.<eos> So... So...<eos> - Do you want some?<eos> Do you?
Which, by the way, isn't much. We checked your finances.<eos> In between Ethan and all your canceled gigs, you're pretty much broke.<eos> And why would Ethan care that much about what I was doing?<eos> Maybe he didn't like your banjo playing.<eos> Or maybe... and my money's on this one... He didn't like that you were sleeping with his wife.<eos> What?<eos> That's crazy.<eos> - Did she tell you that.<eos> - No.<eos> The bandages in your tent did.
Well, you probably needed it after last night.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I shouldn't have barged in on you like that.<eos> Thanks for not throwing me out on my ass.<eos> Do me a favor?<eos> Don't tell Kate.<eos> I won't.<eos> Maybe you should.<eos> So, who won the game, anyway?<eos> We did.
Wade, Carter Covington is the first truly eligible bachelor I have met in a really long time.<eos> Do you know what you're asking me to give up?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Hey, have you seen Lavon?<eos> I'm thinking he didn't realize that chapter seven is an alternate reality.<eos> Try over by the crawfish table.<eos> But don't eat the crab cakes.<eos> They're fried in peanut oil.<eos> I always like to meet any woman's family I plan to date just to make sure they approve of me.<eos> Oh, we do.
You know, you shouldn't drink alone.<eos> People will judge.<eos> You're a good friend, Lemon.<eos> Your, uh, gentleman caller take off?<eos> Frankly, I think my father is taking it worse than I am.<eos> It's Carter's loss.<eos> "Of the Birmingham Covingtons."<eos> I mean, come on.<eos> George, we need to talk.<eos> Yes, of course we do.
Well, I do.<eos> And besides, I don't think a snob would run that amazing establishment that I met you at yesterday.<eos> I mean, the Rammer Jammer.<eos> But, hey, you know what I really did like about that place?<eos> The jukebox.<eos> The way the music was organized.<eos> It wasn't by, like, song title or singer or genre.<eos> It was like someone organized it by... emotion.<eos> That was me.<eos> I did that last week.
I want babies, Zoe, with Lavon, big... football- playing babies.<eos> I know.<eos> I want that for you, too, a whole team of 'em.<eos> I really don't want to have to hurt Joel, so, Zoe, can you please take him home?<eos> Maybe AnnaBeth and I can salvage what's left of this crazy night.<eos> Actually, uh, my head is feeling like it's busting open, so I'm going to have Zoe ta me home, too.<eos> - Um... we'll talk tomorrow.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You lost him.<eos> - Damn right I did!
♪ You may like your Crickett, Elodie or AB ♪<eos> ♪ But Lemon Breeland is the one for me. ♪<eos> Well, that was, um... Unique.<eos> And despite being a little off-key, it was... It was very sweet.<eos> - You are very sweet.<eos> - So you'll take me back?<eos> Meatball... you were there for me in a... moment in time where I really needed someone.<eos> But some moments in time are just meant to be that, just a... a fleeting memory for us to cling to.<eos> - But I don't want anybody else.<eos> - Of course you do.
No.<eos> Yeah, that's...<eos> Anything?<eos> More looks of confusion.<eos> Can't say I blame them.<eos> This whole thing seems a bit off, right?<eos> Why you say that?<eos> Billy works with a Muhammad in this town?<eos> I thought you quit.<eos> I did.
- Okay, well, now it all makes sense.<eos> - What makes sense?<eos> Oh, you batting those camel lashes at Brendan.<eos> Smiling, laughing at everything he says...<eos> - It's called being nice.<eos> - It's called flirting.<eos> I don't think Brendan confused interest with flirtation.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what I'm not confused about.<eos> The fact that all weekend you've conveniently failed to mention that you're gay!<eos> No, you didn't.
We're gonna have to continue this later.<eos> First Hanna, now Emily.<eos> Don't say it like that.<eos> Like what?<eos> Like one of us is next.<eos> Tell me about Shana.<eos> There's not that much to tell, really.<eos> I saw her in that town, and then she jumped in Jenna's car and she drove away.<eos> We tried to follow, but we lost her.<eos> No, you didn't.
And I know that Mona confessed to a lot of that, but is there anybody else who still wants to hurt you?<eos> Is history repeating itself?<eos> You guys took a long time to speak up, and if this is happening again... it was an accident.<eos> Some speed freak lost control and used my front porch as a bumper.<eos> Where is this college?<eos> Maryland.<eos> She isn't answering my calls.<eos> She's really ragged right now.<eos> She thought her mom was gonna get bail.<eos> We all did.
Yeah, thank you.<eos> He did say something odd.<eos> What?<eos> He said, "it's hard to focus on the game when your own teammates are playing against you."<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I'm guessing some of his teammates think he's an easy target.<eos> What is it with your family?<eos> First you, now your brother.<eos> You didn't tell him that I said that I was scared, did you?<eos> No, I didn't, but...
The hair, the walk... it was her.<eos> I started running after her. I practically tackled that poor girl.<eos> So it wasn't Ali?<eos> I lose a piece of her every day.<eos> That's why I did the room.<eos> If it were up to Ken, he'd just lock that bedroom door and throw away the key.<eos> You think you know somebody so well, but then... Something that you both counted on changes, and... You find out who they really are.<eos> Just wish it hadn't taken me 24 years to learn that.<eos> I don't expect you to understand.<eos> No, I do.
Okay.<eos> You do know how to get out of here, don't you?<eos> I mean, you got in, you came through a door.<eos> I got a little lost.<eos> Can't we just get out the way you came in?<eos> Not a good idea.<eos> Well, I came this way.<eos> You always dress like prom night on the Titanic?<eos> What kind of business did you say your Uncle was in?<eos> I didn't.
Like a sit-in or a... or a hunger strike.<eos> Yeah, I'm no good at hunger strikes.<eos> I get really light-headed around 4:00 if I don't have a snack.<eos> What we must do is to stop feeling sorry for ourselves.<eos> There's work to do, and right now, those responsible have the upper hand.<eos> Secretary Jarvis and those who have fallen are counting on us.<eos> Gibbs, you're here.<eos> Unless I'm seeing things.<eos> You guys got work to do?<eos> Yes, we do, Jethro.
How dare you make that accusation.<eos> Somebody's trying to wipe out my team!<eos> They tried to kill me, too!<eos> Tom, tell me right now... who's their next target?<eos> It's Ziva David.<eos> Eli knew too much;<eos> they think she does, too.<eos> I just sent a secure e-mail to Mossad in case Ziva shows up there.<eos> How do we know the terror cell isn't monitoring everything we send?<eos> We don't.
I finished without even playing in it.<eos> One of my teammates got caught smoking, so the school refused to let us participate.<eos> The story is that a scout had come and if I had gone, turning pro wouldn't have been a dream.<eos> The dream ended up being just a dream.<eos> I see.<eos> What about you?<eos> When you were little, what did you want to be?<eos> Me?<eos> I wanted to be a Mom.<eos> I did, but...
Let me buy you a drink.<eos> It'll be like old times.<eos> Why are you suddenly being so nice to me now?<eos> - I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - Yes, you do. I only came by to give you these.<eos> - Now you're giving me my car back?<eos> - DCU doesn't need it anymore.<eos> Because it got burned in an operation?<eos> - What, you don't want it back?<eos> - No, I do.
I'm not familiar with the program.<eos> I don't really keep up with the sporting world anymore.<eos> Hey. You got five minutes?<eos> I can give you a Guy Young VIP tour.<eos> - Actually, I gotta...<eos> - He's dropping off your rental car, Mr. Guy Young.<eos> What do you... what are you... Why?<eos> Uh, well, actually, kind of more or less the CEO of like a rental car corporation.<eos> Don't you have some paperwork for him to sign?<eos> Uh, yes, Miss Pleasant, I do.
Full house, kings over 2s.<eos> Whoo! Sorry, boys.<eos> Same time next week?<eos> Not a bad showing for a first timer.<eos> Cash you out?<eos> I'm looking for a little information.<eos> Think you can help me out?<eos> I can be a very good tipper.<eos> Does the name Jose Alvarado mean anything to you?<eos> Yeah, it does.
I was trying to sneak out and watch the action when Valerie jock-blocked the exit.<eos> Nothing to see here!<eos> Let's just put on some music and roll out the snacks.<eos> It's a fucking party, people, so let's party!<eos> So I grabbed a seat just in time to see the aftermath.<eos> I'm so sorry, Collin.<eos> I can't deal.<eos> Matty hit Collin, then Jenna apologized to Collin, which infers that she's sided with him, which further infers the obvious fact that Jenna and Matty are done.<eos> But Matty didn't hit Collin.<eos> - Then who did?
And a new outfit.<eos> Mm. Where'd you get that?<eos> - The clotheshorse came by.<eos> - Of course it did.<eos> Our biggest problem is we don't know where Cyrus is.<eos> He could be trapped somewhere, or... or captured.<eos> Look, is there any chance of a coffee horse coming by?<eos> - I can't really think until...<eos> - But then I realized we don't need to know where he is.<eos> - Oh, we don't?

Father...<eos> Father...<eos> Father...<eos> Why didn't you shoot him?<eos> Tell me.<eos> I... I saw the monster...<eos> Monster?<eos> Do you see it?<eos> Do you see it now?<eos> Do you?
Ham.<eos> Classic.<eos> So?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's exciting.<eos> I like to live on the edge.<eos> You okay, Karen?<eos> You seem down.<eos> Oh, please. Like you actually care.<eos> Of course I do.
Not really.<eos> Who knows?<eos> I mean, someone must've given it to her, somebody with access to it.<eos> Could it have been dad?<eos> No.<eos> He would never do that.<eos> It meant too much to him.<eos> Besides he didn't have it.<eos> Really?<eos> Who did?
Look, sometimes you have to create your own reality.<eos> When people see my movie, all these things, these pranks?<eos> It's gonna make people sympathize with him.<eos> Isn't that what you want?<eos> - I want you to leave.<eos> - Jo, it was just a stunt.<eos> Please.<eos> I had fun tonight.<eos> I think we have a lot of potential.<eos> We did.
People see you as a very skilful performer, who changes from time to time from one thing to another.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I gilt from one thing to another, a lot.<eos> "Glit"?<eos> It's like "flit", but it's the '70s version.<eos> One letter later.<eos> To be on Dick Cavett meant you had arrived.<eos> And what's fascinating about that is he's not really playing by the Dick Cavett rules, if there are any, in the sense that one watches it and it's like,<eos> "Do you want the whole of America to think you're a complete nutcase?"<eos> "Out of your mind on cocaine?" And he clearly did.
We can't really go now, can we?<eos> Well, no, I didn't mean that.<eos> Yeah, it's cool.<eos> It's funky.<eos> Do people still say funky?<eos> Ironically, maybe.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My dad says it all the time.<eos> That's not good.<eos> How you doing?
I'm so sorry, but we are out of the New Zealand Sancerre.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You just recommended it.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> If you don't have it, don't recommend it 'cause we were all excited about it.<eos> I'm so sorry, sir.<eos> I can bring the $70 bottle that the lady chose originally.<eos> Perfect.<eos> - Have you got that one?<eos> - Yes, we do.
Yeah, well, you could show a lot of the young actors that you don't need to whore yourself out for money if you're, you know, happy to live in an outhouse.<eos> It's a guesthouse.<eos> - Oh, no, what did I say?<eos> - You said outhouse.<eos> No.<eos> ( laughs ) - That's wrong.<eos> - You're right, it's very wrong.<eos> Because you don't even have a toilet.<eos> - No, I have a toilet.<eos> - Oh, it does.
Also found a key to your house.<eos> You know Justin and his girlfriend - were stealing your pills?<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> That's not...<eos> that's not true, okay?<eos> One time she suggested that we go through the medicine cabinet for pills...<eos> I said no.<eos> Then how did the pills get in Tanya's pocket?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, one of you does.
Means it's time for me to go.<eos> There you go.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Are you looking for anything in particular?<eos> Yes, I was told you might have some photos by John Bowman?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Barbeque-flavored pork rinds.<eos> It's like we're sharing the same brain.<eos> I have a stash in the garage.<eos> Zander, what are you doing here?<eos> I just text you and you said you were busy.<eos> I am.<eos> I'm working with my boy Ryder on our graphic novel.<eos> So you're choosing to spend time with my dorky little brother instead of me?<eos> You better have a very good explanation for that.<eos> And I do.
And, uh, I was wondering if I could still get my slot.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, I mean that makes total sense.<eos> Is there a waiting list or...<eos> That long, really? Okay.<eos> Could you put me on there anyway?<eos> You want help?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hope you got good feedback after the meeting.<eos> I did.
It's not my fault.<eos> What, so you're just okay with blowing up somebody's engagement, or stealing a credit card or blackmailing a senator?<eos> You took the money out of that wallet.<eos> It was like 40 bucks!<eos> It's different!<eos> And we both decided to send that text to Coto.<eos> The only difference between you and me is I don't lie to myself about who I am or what I'm willing to do to fight for what is right.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> You talk to him?<eos> Yes, I did.
And it wasn't that rich prick.<eos> The judge. It, it wasn't him.<eos> So why didn't you come forward?<eos> Because I was glad.<eos> I thought, good.<eos> After the way she hurt me, she deserved it.<eos> Then when I... stopped being so angry and that man was arrested, I was sorry.<eos> I knew I owed her the truth.<eos> I'm sorry, I still don't understand why you didn't go to the police.<eos> I did. What?
Harvey, fancy meeting you here.<eos> Cameron, you keep showing up unannounced, and I'm not sure why.<eos> I can meet you anytime, anywhere, because I'm not afraid of you.<eos> Well, you should be.<eos> I've got five witnesses who place the Colonel that your client bribed at the scene of those murders.<eos> You want evidence? Here it is.<eos> See you in court.<eos> We can schedule it for anytime, anywhere.<eos> You still don't want my help?<eos> No, I don't.
You what?<eos> He fired our client, so I struck back.<eos> And you didn't think to run that by me?<eos> No, I didn't think you'd say no.<eos> I'd say no because I'm not an idiot. Idiot?<eos> We need this man to help us.<eos> You just made him a permanent enemy. Me?<eos> We did this together.<eos> - Don't put this on me. - You're putting it on me.<eos> Because you goddamn did it!
You got the results back already?<eos> No, but trust me, hundred.<eos> You know who else thinks you're a dick?<eos> That math test.<eos> Well, that's fine, because I just made it my bitch. Up top, mother flecker!<eos> Whoa, you're gonna leave me hanging?<eos> Like you're gonna leave me hanging?<eos> You got into Harvard, dickhead.<eos> They accepted my transfer?<eos> Yeah, they did.
Excuse me, I did not cheat.<eos> I just double-checked my answers with somebody else's before writing them down.<eos> So you didn't cheat?<eos> But it does sound like you... what's the right word?<eos> ... cheated.<eos> Okay, but there's only one test that I really need to pass.<eos> How much of this crap can I sell?<eos> And I think I'm gonna do okay because in case you haven't noticed,<eos> I'm superhot. You still have to know your products.<eos> I do.
I told you ... if he doesn't eat exactly at 7:00, then he's not gonna eat at all.<eos> There he is.<eos> Will you give him his breakfast?<eos> - What? Why me?<eos> - I'm wearing my pyjamas, Jane.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> But it's powdered eggs and burnt toast and freezer hash browns.<eos> - You eat it, then.<eos> - I don't like prison food.<eos> I didn't either.
I rebooted it, put it all back together again.<eos> That's good.<eos> Well, it was my Tardis that blew it up in the first place,<eos> I felt a degree of responsibility.<eos> But the scar tissue remains.<eos> A structural weakness in the whole universe.<eos> And someone's trying to get through it from outside our universe, from somewhere else.<eos> Of course, of course!<eos> Makes sense.<eos> - It does?
- Anyway...<eos> - All right.<eos> Nothing on the march in New York on Saturday.<eos> A friend of mine in the newsroom's gonna lose it.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> - Tequila!<eos> Whoo! What does that do for you, shouting "tequila"?<eos> - How does that enhance the experience?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Until you do...
Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> - Hello, Katia? - I can't- - I can't hear.<eos> Something with the computer.<eos> Katia, hello--<eos> Creepy stalker guy.<eos> d I ain't no quitter d d I'm in for a pound d d Ain't nobody d d Gonna hold me down d d Hustlin' in the Motor City d d Hustlin', just tryin' to get down d<eos> We out of trash bags, Maya? Had some in the office.<eos> What do we do now?
You're back.<eos> I read the HR report.<eos> There's honestly nothing to ask about. It was upsetting.<eos> I don't want to minimize it, but...<eos> - Were you sent to a doctor?<eos> - By HR.<eos> - A psychiatrist?<eos> - Yeah, and I'm fine.<eos> The doctor prescribed Paxil, but I don't take it.<eos> - You don't?
How could he do such a thing? Then... Shots.<eos> Go! Go!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Am I never to get that man out of my life?<eos> My love... I'm sorry.<eos> Go back inside and look after your sister.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> George Pratt, sir - coachman at the King's Arms. Yes, of course.<eos> Did you hear shots fired in the woods?<eos> I did, sir. Two of them.
George, you are a grumpy, ornery son of a bitch, but I just want to say thanks for all the advice you've given me over the past couple years.<eos> Not a lot of guys would have done that, and I really appreciate it.<eos> Is that good?<eos> Yeah, that's great.<eos> So, New York, huh? How's that going? Yes.<eos> It's going. It goes...<eos> Real fast.<eos> I don't know how you do that.<eos> Too many people for me. Yeah, it's good, though.<eos> What kind of, like, law do you do specifically?
No, I know that.<eos> - Well, we all survived, didn't we?<eos> - Well, I nearly didn't.<eos> - It's a nice cup of tea, Bax.<eos> - Thanks, mate. - To us.<eos> - To us.<eos> - And we never got caught.<eos> - Well, he did...<eos> What?<eos> He did.
I owe it to...<eos> - Why'd you keep saying that?<eos> - I deserted you at the airport, didn't I?<eos> Listen! You all deserted me.<eos> If you ask me, alright? You're the one who wants to get back. But for some reason you won't own up to it.<eos> So you keep using me as an excuse.<eos> - Just leave it, eh. - What?<eos> Leave it.<eos> I know, you don't really want me here.<eos> - No one does.
Fuck.<eos> Why can't anything in my life just go right, just for once?<eos> - Hey, come here.<eos> - Fuck off, please.<eos> What the...<eos> What's that all about?<eos> They can't be looking for us. Can they?<eos> Of course they can.<eos> I thought nobody knows where we are.<eos> Your french bird does.
The meth is high grade, very pure.<eos> Well, which is not good for us.<eos> The A.U.S.A. is gonna argue that, as a chemistry professor, you would know how to create a pure version.<eos> Jane, hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Um, Professor...<eos> I don't... I'm sorry.<eos> I don't even know how to tell you this.<eos> Melody Lanthum doesn't exist.<eos> Well, of course she does.
Why?<eos> Why do I have to do that?<eos> You kind of sound like a princess right now.<eos> Okay. Low blow.<eos> Do not play the "just 'cause I live in Mission Hills I'm a princess" card.<eos> Well then, prove me wrong.<eos> What is this?<eos> Some sort of military mind game?<eos> I don't have the Kennish gene for athletics, okay?<eos> I just don't.
According to flight records, he left Boston on Wednesday morning and flew into SeaTac airport, where he rented a car and headed north.<eos> He was driving along Old Clifton Road when his tire blew out, causing him to control of the vehicle and skid off the road."<eos> "Mr. Miller attempted to remove the flat tire..." sustaining several lacerations in the process.<eos> Ultimately, he did manage to take off the tire...<eos> But unfortunately, the spare was damaged and unusable."<eos> "As if things couldn't get any worse for Mr. Miller, any hopes of calling for a taxi or roadside assistance were dashed by a dead cell phone battery."<eos> "And so, he sat on the side of the road. Frustration turned to despair, and, by this point, he had all but given up until a man named Lucas West offered him a ride."<eos> "The kindness of a stranger was the lone bright spot in his otherwise horrible day."<eos> Then, Mr. West dropped him off here, and... and you know the rest. No.<eos> Troy, we don't.
- Holly.<eos> - Hi, Paul.<eos> Good news. I got off work early.<eos> So, despite a few hiccups, we're finally alone together.<eos> Kiss me. Holly, we need to talk.<eos> Who wants to see my boobs?<eos> Holly, I'm no love guru, but when you find your girlfriend straddling a fourth-story ledge to avoid you, some might consider that a red flag.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, no, I'm so sorry about tonight, but I have such a good reason.<eos> You always do.
Just let whatever floats through your mind come out unfiltered, and you focus on the question.<eos> How did you become the CIA's ace?<eos> Just tell him.<eos> Stop it. Stop it.<eos> Stop - come on.<eos> What's the harm in giving credit where credit is due?<eos> Stop it!<eos> It's in the past!<eos> This doesn't matter!<eos> Oh, yes, it does.
You love her.<eos> Yes.<eos> Did you want Charles to sell Stella?<eos> Please answer the question.<eos> No. I didn't want him to sell Stella.<eos> But Charles placed the ad anyway. And so when Stella went into heat, you opened the gate to the backyard and let Billy in.<eos> - Isn't that right?<eos> - Objection!<eos> Conjecture. It's true.<eos> I did.
Good.<eos> Let's keep it going, next time for a paying client, hmm?<eos> We did do good work.<eos> I guess that's something.<eos> I guess it is.<eos> Are you looking for something else?<eos> I...<eos> What is it, Jane?<eos> I just wish that you would forgive me.<eos> Of course you do.
Come on, James, put some effort in.<eos> This is so catastrophically uncomfortable as a way to travel.<eos> 'The £65-a-day hire car and the £700,000 boat hunkered down 'and pressed on.'<eos> Tarmac, white lines.<eos> - We have covered 36 miles.<eos> - 36? - Course is 310.<eos> 'Imagining that I was well in the lead, I pulled over to call James.'<eos> - James May.<eos> - Yes, hello?<eos> - What speed you doing?
That's all right.<eos> I... I was scared in the park, too.<eos> See?<eos> Well, doesn't matter who took the beanbag to the face, all right?<eos> It works the same for our case, right?<eos> Now I'm the one with brain damage.<eos> Well, you were halfway there already.<eos> How many other firms care about anything other than getting your business?<eos> You don't care about my business?<eos> Yes, we do.
Do you really think John would be in the auction?<eos> I can persuade him.<eos> But I don't want him to know that I know what we're doing. Trust me.<eos> He won't know a thing.<eos> So much for not playing games.<eos> The day Stan left...<eos> How did that make you feel?<eos> Abandoned.<eos> Alone.<eos> I still do, to some extent.
Go ahead.<eos> Hit me right in my face.<eos> - Why don't you do it?<eos> - Look at me.<eos> Talk to me. Talk to me.<eos> Why did you take her?<eos> (Miljan) He told me to.<eos> - Who?<eos> Who told you--<eos> - He did.
Well, if she's serious about this jamming business, that means we're never gonna get a signal out.<eos> What about using a fire?<eos> What do you mean, using a fire?<eos> We have a fire.<eos> No, like... a big one.<eos> You know, like, think back to, like, history class when you were a kid.<eos> I-I remember learning about these.<eos> You can do a signal fire.<eos> And you can see 'em for miles.<eos> Like, the Plains Indians did it all the time.
Guys, I'm just thinking about the-- the grim situation that we're facing right now, and I think, uh, whoever took the rifle should own up right now.<eos> I never found it.<eos> I didn't find it, either.<eos> I didn't even have the bullets.<eos> I did.<eos> Sneaky girl.<eos> You had the bullets?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You took the bullets from my bed?<eos> Yes, I did.
I really can't talk right now, mom.<eos> I'm getting shampoo in my mouth. All right.<eos> See you at dinner.<eos> As Hanna and Caleb grew closer,<eos> Aria was having a difficult time denying her feelings for Ezra Fitz.<eos> But the mysterious "A" knew all about their forbidden love.<eos> Who's "A"?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How many of your friends did you tell?<eos> I didn't.
Five witnesses who can place Evans at Dagby's apartment the night he died.<eos> And what do they have to say?<eos> It was 8:00 in the evening.<eos> I'd forgotten my knitting at Clayton's.<eos> Every now and then, I sit on a pair of Pauline's needles.<eos> She leaves them at my place all the time.<eos> The needles and her phone.<eos> So, I usually do a little knit 1, purl 2, until she comes back to get them.<eos> Well, I mean, I like knitting, too.<eos> Who doesn't?
It looks as if you're beginning to like the deal-making process, lieutenant.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is it you wanted to talk to me about?<eos> Uh, one more day.<eos> Captain, if you don't mind. Just one more day.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's that?<eos> Is this a... a gift?<eos> Kris, why did you buy me a gift?<eos> I didn't.
No, actually, no, I've got pills, we'll neck them, we'll go clubbing?<eos> - There's no need.<eos> - You'd love that, yeah?<eos> A bit of clubbing.<eos> And what are you doing now?<eos> What's it look like?<eos> Come on just sit down.<eos> What do you want, Mia?<eos> - All I said...<eos> - Just don't.
They can't be fired if the safety's on or if the clip is out.<eos> Here.<eos> Hold it.<eos> I will hold it this one time. Just to say that I...<eos> Oh, my God. I killed his bird.<eos> Oops.<eos> Must have been one left in the chamber.<eos> Why does that always happen?<eos> Are the robbers back?<eos> Uh, yeah, they did a drive-by.
Whatever I want, OK, whatever I feel...<eos> I have a lot of discipline, OK?<eos> I have rules.<eos> I would never do something that would hurt you or upset you.<eos> I would never do something to make you feel bad, OK?<eos> I would never ask you to do something you didn't want.<eos> I'll take you home.<eos> I don't want to go there.<eos> Why?<eos> I just don't.
So, do you think there's some sort of massive town event this weekend?<eos> Possibly.<eos> Maybe one involving...<eos> Fall.<eos> Good call.<eos> God, do you remember that crazy dance you, me and Lacey used to do at the evening formal?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We used to kinda have fun at this thing, huh?<eos> Yeah, we did.
Yeah, maybe I will.<eos> You know, you don't have to distract me all afternoon.<eos> It's just a stupid barbecue.<eos> I can handle it. [Phone chirps]<eos> Actually, you're distracting me.<eos> "Dexter" is still calling and texting me<eos> - a billion times a day.<eos> - Oh. Wow, yeah, he's hot.<eos> And you like him.<eos> I do not.
Friendship.<eos> Love.<eos> Alcoholism.<eos> Freeze frames.<eos> These delightful and somewhat scary words describe my favorite TV genre, the After...<eos> Special.<eos> ASS for short.<eos> I was addicted to them.<eos> Uh, you might want to explain that, unless you brought a time machine.<eos> I did not.
How funny you think it was for poor Carol Ann, a skater on her way to Olympic gold who woke up one day and couldn't fit her fat elephant feet into her size 6 skates?<eos> Not funny at all.<eos> Even though every ASS had a different message, they had the same six steps to get you there.<eos> Number one, establish the problem of the main character, the troubled teen.<eos> Can I play her?<eos> Only if we end up doing porn star runaway or eating disorder.<eos> Speaking of slutty, how did Jenna get out of this?<eos> Can't talk about it.<eos> Let's just say it involved a sex injury.<eos> Of course it did.
- Mm-hmm. What does that even mean?<eos> Look, I know how to win.<eos> I've done it every year without your list.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> How about I come over tonight and we make posters?<eos> Yes, we'll promote your platform in puff paint.<eos> Shit!<eos> I hope I have enough puff paint.<eos> Who am I kidding?<eos> Of course I do.
I guess when you don't have kids to put through school, you find stupid ways to spend your money.<eos> Do you regret that?<eos> Not having kids? Yeah.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was great.<eos> I guess your kids are all grown-up now? Oh, yes, they are.<eos> It doesn't matter how old they get, they're still my babies.<eos> I guess you heard about me and Dan, huh?<eos> I did.
Well, uh, good luck to you.<eos> You make a cute couple.<eos> We're not a cute couple.<eos> I mean, heh, we're not a couple so we can't be a cute one, although we would be if we were. Which we're not.<eos> [CHUCKLING]<eos> I mean, it's not that we don't like each other, we just don't "like" like each other.<eos> It's not likely.<eos> Right, Fred?<eos> Or do we?<eos> We don't, right? Do we?
It's completely connected. Edgar can work his magic.<eos> Abracadabra.<eos> Is my nose bleeding?<eos> You're fine.<eos> That's all I get?<eos> You smack yourself in the face doing a basic tackle and cover, you don't get sympathy from me.<eos> I was hiding back there too long.<eos> My legs cramped up. - Always an excuse.<eos> - Well, look. The important thing is you realized Ernesto would see through the bag trick and that we improvised a new plan, and it worked.<eos> It did work.
I've been there for years.<eos> And, um...<eos> If you don't do this... You're gonna spend the rest of your life knowing that the blood of every person this man hurt is on your hands.<eos> Just think about it.<eos> All right.<eos> Carlos, tell your cop friend I want a deal, in writing-- protection for me and my family.<eos> I'll make it happen.<eos> When a plan goes wrong in the field, the job is rarely abandoned entirely.<eos> The goals of the mission don't change.<eos> The methods do.
I was-- I was trying to save you. Ii...<eos> And I thank you for that.<eos> But I'm gonna have to live with that for the rest of my life and wonder if it was all worth it.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too, Fi.<eos> You're traveling a path with Michael.<eos> You always have.<eos> I can't go down it with you.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
Because Joe Geddes hit you.<eos> That's not why.<eos> He's a liar.<eos> You know, I'm not gonna kill you, Damon.<eos> I hope never to kill you,<eos> Because there'll be no need.<eos> You will never speak your secrets.<eos> We all protect what we love.<eos> You'll suffer to keep these babies safe.<eos> Like your father did for you.
That's all he did.<eos> In the morning, he made the runs to the auto supply warehouses, and then in the garage till after midnight, just trying to get the cars done.<eos> - Sounds tough.<eos> - He had a dream about getting out of this place, this crappy neighborhood.<eos> He could have done it, too.<eos> I bet he could.<eos> What about you, Francisco?<eos> You have the same dream?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Sure I do.
About AIDS.<eos> And about having a good time.<eos> So we just gonna put a pin in that for now.<eos> - Peace, bitches.<eos> - Bye, Dontel.<eos> You fucking loser. All of you.<eos> And that's why we're here.<eos> To show Dontel that he's a fucking loser.<eos> Because losers always forget.<eos> Hell yeah, they do.
She never mentioned the first one.<eos> Wait, so Wendell was right?<eos> Noelle did defraud him?<eos> - Which makes us, who are her lawyers...<eos> - Equally duped.<eos> - There's more.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> You know her sister, Rayann?<eos> Yeah, the one that's not returning our phone calls?<eos> Well, a neighbor did...
- The firewall. - Yep. The judge is never gonna let us bring anything from Wendell's civil case against Noelle.<eos> It's prejudicial.<eos> Nelson will nail it.<eos> We can't bring it in, but that doesn't mean the prosecution can't.<eos> We get them to knock down the firewall.<eos> Easier than knocking down this wall.<eos> Hey.<eos> Huh? Tag, you're it.<eos> Thanks for bringing over dessert.<eos> I didn't.
You want me to post this?<eos> This would expose Parker's affair with Coto.<eos> Daphne: I got her okay.<eos> You're sure about this?<eos> I could leave your name out of it.<eos> No.<eos> You're not a citizen.<eos> They'll revoke your visa and you'll be deported.<eos> I'm not gonna let you take a fall for me when I'm the one who got us into this mess.<eos> We both did it.
I put him in jail 12 years ago.<eos> He's innocent.<eos> Cameron buried the evidence.<eos> Emmanuel Mariga. 20 years ago, at the University of Cape Town, on the rugby team.<eos> You know who else played rugby? HARVEY:<eos> Stephen Huntley.<eos> Stephen was the one who ordered those killings.<eos> I'm so sorry, Harvey.<eos> DONNA: Tell me he looks worse.<eos> (GROANING) He does.
ESU should be here any minute.<eos> I don't know.<eos> So, that song contest you won on the radio.<eos> What was the winning tune?<eos> You want to talk about that now?<eos> Yeah, why not?<eos> Uh, "Truly Madly Deeply" by Savage Garden.<eos> Hmm, don't know it.<eos> What?<eos> Yes, you do.
It appeared that they were mad and wanted to come at us.<eos> Go. Go. Go.<eos> _.<eos> What are those things?<eos> - What... what the hell are they?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> The first thing she does is put the light against the screen. [Creatures snarling]<eos> So I had to take a hold of her again and get her to move back away.<eos> But I wanted to look at them.<eos> Shelley, don't.
Oh, that's a funny one.<eos> Her hippy parents.<eos> Never took any interest in her or the kids.<eos> Is that Italy?<eos> She wanted to see if the Pope really existed.<eos> Here's a better one.<eos> Come on. Let's put it with the possibles.<eos> Lucy went to sleep.<eos> That's right, sweetheart.<eos> She did.
No, that's not fair.<eos> This is a close-knit community.<eos> Yeah, like it was when my dad died.<eos> Oh, David.<eos> That was a bad affair.<eos> Yeah, too right it was.<eos> But things are different now.<eos> Do you honestly believe that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You keep leaving that rather important part out.<eos> How did you sleep last night, Mr. Durant?<eos> Those goose-down mattresses, they cost a fortune.<eos> What?<eos> You sell cattle to Bohannon, lend me money to build our town.<eos> You build a hotel on the best lot in Cheyenne and charge me full fare to rent a room.<eos> Now, if I didn't know better, I might think you were playing both ends against the middle, Mrs. Palmer.<eos> Thank you, Abigail.<eos> Often, your interests align with mine.<eos> Occasionally, they don't.
Lauryn Lone Elk?<eos> I'm Lauryn.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Mrs. Lone Elk, can you take a break?<eos> You have five minutes. Not a moment more.<eos> I'm very sorry to tell you there was an explosion on the reservation today.<eos> And your husband, Ethan... he was killed.<eos> Can we not do this here?<eos> [Walt] Did your husband tell you he was goin' to his brother's?<eos> He never does.
Why don't you wait on me and I'm gonna come, like, take you to whatever hotel you're at?<eos> You don't need to be out here by yourself.<eos> You're gonna, like, get hurt.<eos> There's a bunch of crazy people out here.<eos> Apparently, your grandpa's one of them.<eos> Bye, Cinnamon.<eos> I got to go.<eos> No.<eos> And I'm not Cinnamon!<eos> - How you doing?
I gotta go make this right.<eos> You can't make it right. She's hurting.<eos> She's embarrassed. She just needs some space.<eos> I can't. I can't.<eos> Just... the idea of her sitting there at home, all...<eos> I'm gonna go over there right now,<eos> - and I want you to come with me.<eos> - Danny, I don't think...<eos> Don't you want her to forgive you?<eos> - Of course I do. - Okay.
If that doesn't suit you, I may decide you've outlived your usefulness.<eos> Hey, they were obviously just here.<eos> Fan out, find them, and bring me some heads.<eos> I'd rather you didn't.<eos> What the hell are you doing out here?<eos> I've come to suggest you seek other hunting grounds.<eos> Suggestion noted.<eos> Well, Diego, it would be such a shame to have to rearrange that pretty face.<eos> What the hell you care about wolves?<eos> Generally, I don't.
Mike, just stop right there.<eos> We didn't risk our necks saving you just to leave you behind.<eos> The CIA is gonna want to know what the hell went down back there, and we need your help to sort it out.<eos> Now, you with us?<eos> Mike, are you in?<eos> All right, good.<eos> We should get going.<eos> It's a long-ass walk into town.<eos> In the field, there's nothing harder than when you let your team down.<eos> Apologies and regrets do no good.
You all know I'm right.<eos> Don't walk away. You know I'm right.<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> I'm right.<eos> You see?<eos> I am right.<eos> You know I'm right!<eos> You know I am right!<eos> You do!
You don't make me a nickel and you cause headaches for the divisions that do, but you make me... You make me so proud.<eos> God, guy comes in here, cooks an interview, and this ends up with... 'Cause he's unemployable he gets a $5 million settlement and the three of you leave?<eos> Oh, I don't think so.<eos> And McMac.<eos> That's a name that's really starting to grow on me.<eos> She doesn't have to go.<eos> Nobody's ever heard of her.<eos> But she's gonna do the honorable thing.<eos> And what's expected of me, huh?<eos> Not to do the honorable thing?
- World Cup?<eos> - What are you, from Brazil?<eos> - Brooklyn.<eos> 2003, Gaddafi announced Libya would voluntarily eliminate all materials, equipment and programs, but they've still got 'em.<eos> - How about us?<eos> - The US?<eos> - Yeah. - Do we still have chemical weapons?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We do?
I wanted a change.<eos> I'm not crazy about it either. The stylist kind of talked me into it.<eos> - Maybe I'll get used to it.<eos> - There wasn't a stylist.<eos> You cut it yourself.<eos> You cut off your hair and dyed it a different color.<eos> Lisa told me.<eos> How would Lisa know?<eos> How did you not tell her what happened in Africa?<eos> - Did you?
You're not.<eos> This is Denise, Pam, and Connor.<eos> We went to school together.<eos> This is Charlie Skinner. - He's the president of ACN.<eos> - Any predictions?<eos> Their phones were taken at the door.<eos> Obama's gonna take Virginia and we've been looking hard at some precincts in Ohio and Florida.<eos> - Got a minute?<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - How you doing?
Principal Sylvester told us the candles have to go.<eos> She said she got a call from the fire marshal.<eos> You cannot let her do this.<eos> Um, he's the janitor.<eos> New Santana Lopez is right, Old Santana Lopez.<eos> Under the tyrannical jackboot of Sylvester regime, I am powerless, and I am too overcome with Finn Hudson-related grief to fight back.<eos> Okay, this is... this is insane.<eos> Well, Donna, one of us farted, and I'm about 60% sure it wasn't me.<eos> You have no right to take down that memorial.<eos> Well, as a matter of fact, I do, Sandbags.
- Stay there, better take a look .<eos> - Of course .<eos> Once I have a leg amputee to a little girl named Natasha .<eos> Tell me that not only had a shoulder injury.<eos> No, she had fallen into a lathe.<eos> He was eight years old.<eos> - Li again.<eos> She is not dead .<eos> - Then cut the other three legs.<eos> How many legs did the poor ?
I need you to cooperate with me. How many hostages do you have?<eos> More than enough to end your career if they die.<eos> Set the timer for 43 minutes, and get me Rudy Lom.<eos> Hello?<eos> Are you there?<eos> Right here, Paige.<eos> Is anyone coming?<eos> You just hang tight. We're gonna be with you real soon.<eos> Did you hear the phone call?<eos> Yeah, I did.
The water was so cold, it was like thousands of needles stinging every part of my body.<eos> And then my dad jumped in, and he grabbed me and started dragging me back to shore.<eos> Are you trying to put her to sleep?<eos> And even though we were still in a lot of danger, I felt safe.<eos> I felt like... everything was gonna be okay, because I wasn't alone.<eos> Paige... you're not alone.<eos> I'm with you.<eos> Everything is gonna be okay.<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Yeah, but he's not mentioned by name, and it's no proof of the crimes he's accused of committing, so we're not going to get much hard evidence from there, I'm afraid.<eos> Then we need to find Ben Omari.<eos> He can confirm that<eos> Idaris is his former commander and legitimize this video.<eos> So, the only guy who can pin this on Idaris is the one wanted for attacking him.<eos> Have you heard from him?<eos> Still no reply to the job interview.<eos> I'm not surprised.<eos> I could try telling him he's hired?<eos> All right, so when we do ID Idaris, then what?
But I need to hear it from you.<eos> He told me that it was the only way to protect him from his enemies.<eos> He told me I had to kill Dr. Bruckmann.<eos> Surveillance said Idaris just left his house, went to Julia's, spoke to the grandmother, now he's headed west on Dundas.<eos> He's gonna make a run for it.<eos> Probably headed to the airport.<eos> My bet, the credit union.<eos> If he's gonna rabbit, he'll need money.<eos> Les get there.<eos> - How we doing?
You guys ever read the Warren Commission?<eos> We'll call you, Jerry.<eos> Handwritten letters are better.<eos> I don't do phones.<eos> Hey. Hey, how you doing?<eos> Hi.<eos> This, this is a little monkey that belonged to my daughter.<eos> She, uh, outgrew it, so I thought maybe she would like it.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Huh? Yeah, of course you do.
I do.<eos> But there are some things I cann't ignore.<eos> You know what would help?<eos> You got any juicy Longmire secrets, now would be the time to spill 'em.<eos> Where did you get those eyes?<eos> My dad and my ex-boyfriend are in the middle of a nasty campaign fight.<eos> - And recently I found out that my mother...<eos> - Your mother what?<eos> - I know what happened in Denver.<eos> - No you don't.
It's our fault.<eos> We're supposed to take care of them.<eos> We forget to and start thinking about ourselves.<eos> We go out and have a good day...<eos> Thinking about our own happiness instead of theirs.<eos> The world decides to even things out.<eos> Kellen Dawes?<eos> Yes?<eos> You mind putting the gun down, showing me your hands?<eos> I do.
You're in Nashville.<eos> Now you gotta say, "y'all."<eos> Y'all.<eos> Unfortunately, it seems the public hasn't been as welcoming of your latest effort.<eos> Your album's been sliding on iTunes, and your single hasn't made it to number one.<eos> The tweens are not showing up on this one.<eos> Her audience is growing up with her.<eos> I'm moving toward a... New, more mature sound.<eos> You know, the bubblegum and glitter just aren't things I care about anymore.<eos> Well, I do.
- Well, we kinda are.<eos> And I think it's confusing to the girls.<eos> - I think it's confusing to us.<eos> - Yeah, but, look, you're still recovering. I mean, you can't do all this on your own.<eos> Tandy could come stay, help us out.<eos> I know...<eos> I know that we're not getting back together.<eos> I mean, I-I don't even really want that. But... I miss our family.<eos> I really... Really miss our family. And... and I just find it hard to believe that you don't.<eos> Oh, I do.
And I think it's confusing to the girls.<eos> - I think it's confusing to us.<eos> - Yeah, but, look, you're still recovering. I mean, you can't do all this on your own.<eos> Tandy could come stay, help us out.<eos> I know...<eos> I know that we're not getting back together.<eos> I mean, I-I don't even really want that. But... I miss our family.<eos> I really... Really miss our family. And... and I just find it hard to believe that you don't.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> Of course I do.
You're pregnant.<eos> You're hormonal.<eos> I... I forgive you.<eos> I'm sorry that my dating Owen hurts you.<eos> But I need to see where this is going.<eos> I owe it to myself and the baby.<eos> Stacy... I almost married the guy.<eos> You're my best friend.<eos> Don't you see what this is doing to me?<eos> I do.
I'd just come back from France.<eos> I'd gained 10 pounds as an au pair.<eos> - Here you're skinny.<eos> - That was before I left.<eos> - I soon lost weight again.<eos> - Why an au pair?<eos> I wanted to study French...<eos> I also wanted to study Russian.<eos> - But then I became a teacher.<eos> - For how long did you do Russian?
- She was really stupid.<eos> - And then it's okay?<eos> Right...<eos> But I was ill at the time.<eos> You know that.<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> I have five lessons tomorrow, and I can't sleep.<eos> - What do I do?<eos> - Can't you take a sleeping pill?<eos> I did.
I find it takes years of business meetings to learn the kinds of things that a few martinis can bring about in one meal.<eos> We can talk about cyber-security, or whatever else might really be on your mind.<eos> I'll have my office set it up.<eos> You know, I thought I could handle this.<eos> But seeing the two of them together, it takes everything I have not to scream right now.<eos> Let's walk it off.<eos> They say when you're pregnant, the hormones change the way you feel, but I think it's simpler than that.<eos> I think they help you understand what's important and what isn't.<eos> I hope she knew how I felt about her.<eos> She did.
- Why are there broken glasses?<eos> This?<eos> Oh, don't mind that. The diva is a bit... broken.<eos> Let me just go check on Tangerine for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you follow Tangerine?<eos> Do you follow her on Twitter, I mean?<eos> Are you on lnstagram?<eos> Please tell me you have a Facebook account.<eos> I do.
Are you sure you're okay?<eos> Yeah. I'm fine.<eos> I've just got a lot on my mind.<eos> Stuff at home is very complicated.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I can't talk about it.<eos> SAMANTHA: So, it's about your wife?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe you need to just be honest with her and tell her you don't love her anymore.<eos> But I do.
And if I have to, I can do it again.<eos> - Joe...<eos> - Mel, shh shh.<eos> Look, if I don't come back, just promise me one thing.<eos> Anything.<eos> When that kitchen timer beeps, you take the chicken out, okay?<eos> But you make sure the juices run clear because... No one will get food poisoning from a Joe Longo chicken.<eos> Going to prison for a crime I didn't commit was rough.<eos> But the worst part was knowing that my best friend betrayed me.<eos> He did the crime, but I did the time.
We...<eos> We were on the yacht to rekindle our relationship.<eos> So you thought one romantic dinner on a yacht would fix your problems?<eos> No, but...<eos> we had to start somewhere.<eos> Look me in the eye and tell me you loved him.<eos> Tell me you didn't wanna tear his face off.<eos> Do I look angry to you?<eos> I loved Jeremy.<eos> I still do.
And Wayne didn't know that he led me to you.<eos> But maybe you should've tried to ask him these questions a little harder.<eos> Boss.<eos> You're not gonna believe this.<eos> This guy's got a bunch of cryptic numbers on his phone.<eos> Orders to keep you away from a predetermined target.<eos> All from dummy numbers with the same 305 area code.<eos> What part won't I believe?<eos> Okay.<eos> The part that I don't.
You all know I'm right. Don't walk away.<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> I'm right.<eos> You see?<eos> I am right.<eos> You know I'm right!<eos> You know I am right!<eos> You do!
J.W. Lynch was one of the Founding Fathers of Ponca City.<eos> The man that had owned my property, J.W. Lynch, was a very rich and powerful man.<eos> He was actually the Mayor.<eos> He looked kind of mean in his pictures. He was not smiling.<eos> He was quite a tough customer.<eos> It was his way or the highway.<eos> You didn't sway from J.W. Lynch's way.<eos> That's the kind of man he was.<eos> - Did he have any children?<eos> - Yes, he did.
Well, what do you think?<eos> Quite the chanteuse.<eos> We have nothing like that back home.<eos> And where is home, Helen?<eos> Evansville, Indiana.<eos> Ever heard of it?<eos> I can't say I have.<eos> We'll have to visit for our anniversary.<eos> Roy tells me that you're thinking of merging with Piggly Wiggly.<eos> Oh, he does, does he?
Is that how you talk to your sheriff boyfriend?<eos> He had nothin' to do with this.<eos> He seems a little old for ya, Vic.<eos> What's that about...<eos> daddy issues?<eos> What do you want from me, Ed?<eos> I want you to feel the consequence of your actions.<eos> Isn't it enough that I had to leave town, leave my family, the only home that I have ever known?<eos> You don't think that I've felt those consequences?<eos> No, I don't.
Previously on "Nashville"...<eos> You got us plane tickets to the Caribbean?<eos> If you say "yes", I'll buy the tickets.<eos> They're meeting with every single artist on the label this week.<eos> I feel like I am looking at the future of Edgehill.<eos> Bubblegum and glitter just aren't things I care about anymore.<eos> Well, I do.
I'm just gonna apply a topical anesthetic.<eos> I think we should keep you overnight for observation, just in case.<eos> Mmm. Hey, are you busy?<eos> I need some help.<eos> Is there a spell we can do to make Dash forgive Killian for sleeping with his fiancée?<eos> - You slept with Killian?<eos> - No, no.<eos> His other fiancée.<eos> - Dash has another fiancée?<eos> - He did, a long time ago.
I appreciate the whole mysterious vibe thing.<eos> I'm sure it works on some guys.<eos> I just don't have the time to figure you out right now.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm busy.<eos> Okay, wait, wait, wait. Sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What you said was right.<eos> I did...
You help him remove a tree stump?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> I'm betting you sold him some C-4.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I have to check my records.<eos> What'd you say his name was?<eos> I didn't.
Lisbon called.<eos> They're not coming back into the office tonight. Okay.<eos> You can probably go, too.<eos> There's nobody else here. Sure.<eos> Did you change?<eos> What, this old thing?<eos> Wait.<eos> What's this?<eos> It looks like a hotel room key.<eos> You didn't, did you?
I would describe him as the lone Ranger.<eos> A force for good, a force for fairness and generally has a psychic.<eos> Susan and I are cut off from our own planets.<eos> Hearts knell was the wise old gent.<eos> He was a soldier and he was a Doctor.<eos> Nice to see you so well again.<eos> Told everybody with what was what and how to do it.<eos> Regeneration is such a clever idea. It's a part that 12 different actors will and have played.<eos> This has never been done before and we had no idea if it was ever going to be accepted.<eos> Patrick Truouton did our job.
He must be inside.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> What do we got?<eos> He escaped with the painting.<eos> Damn it.<eos> All right, Baker, report in.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Honey!<eos> I didn't expect you.<eos> How you doing, Sarah, Rachel?
Nice hat.<eos> You went to Brooklyn Residential High.<eos> What sport did you play?<eos> All state in wrestling. Are we done?<eos> Mm, not quite, but you can get on with your day now, Mr. Jacoby.<eos> Oh, you know that vault that was in Kaplan Security, the one with the $2 million cash in it?<eos> It's all gone now.<eos> But you knew that.<eos> Or you didn't know that.<eos> Well, now you do.
Figure skating coach to the stars.<eos> Nikolai.<eos> There is just one little problem.<eos> What's that?<eos> You don't seem to exist.<eos> Now, how can you be famous if you don't exist?<eos> Peter "Neevens" doesn't exist.<eos> But...<eos> Peter Nevins...<eos> N-E-V-I-N-S... he does.
TO STUDY. [chuckles]<eos> CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING TO DRINK?<eos> - I'D LOVE A BEER.<eos> - ALL RIGHT, COMING RIGHT UP.<eos> - SO, HOLLY, AS A WAY OF THANKING YOU FOR HELPING ME, I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU,<eos> SOMETHING I THINK YOU'RE REALLY GONNA LIKE.<eos> - OH, GOD.<eos> YOU UNZIPPED A SCARF.<eos> - I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.<eos> - OH, I DO.
And what's wrong with the guys that I go out with?<eos> Nothing, I guess, if you like guys with advanced degrees in bore-ology.<eos> (Scoffs) Oh, okay.<eos> Well, since you obviously know me so well, what kinda guy should I be going out with?<eos> Okay, off the top of my head, I'm thinking a guy... Handsome, funny, good taste in music, who maybe takes an interest in your life.<eos> Hey, great concert tonight.<eos> How's work going by the way?<eos> You really think I could do better?<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
So much for your break from Emily Thorne.<eos> Good night.<eos> I can't believe you're still going through with this.<eos> Jack.<eos> What are you...<eos> You're planning on taking them down at your wedding.<eos> I don't want you to be there.<eos> I deserve to be there.<eos> I want to be there when they get what's coming to them.<eos> No, you don't.
- You are holding back.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> - You are.<eos> - Belle. What is it you're not saying?<eos> I'm a coward.<eos> I'm just like my father.<eos> You feel better now, Don't you?<eos> You know why I'm here.<eos> You always saw the good in me.<eos> I still do.
No.<eos> Um, I mean...<eos> Yes.<eos> I mean no.<eos> I'm pressuring you.<eos> That's unfair.<eos> How about this?<eos> Tomorrow morning, I'll wait for you.<eos> If you show up, I'll be filled with joy.<eos> If you don't, well...
What were you doing out there?<eos> The boat that I was on, and we got caught in the storm.<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> I--Robert Queen.<eos> Robert Queen.<eos> It was his boat, and--and-- they're rich and he'll pay whatever you want.<eos> Please, please!<eos> Please, no!<eos> Please, please!<eos> Please, don't! No!
Dr. Anthony Ivo.<eos> Sara.<eos> Nice to meet you, Sara.<eos> Why do you keep those people down there in those cells?<eos> It's my work.<eos> I need them.<eos> I'm going to save the human race, Sara.<eos> Maybe you can help me.<eos> I noticed you didn't have a drink at dinner.<eos> I didn't.
Yeah. How can I help you?<eos> Well, she texted me early this morning and said she was going to see a lawyer.<eos> I remembered your name.<eos> Okay.<eos> She's not answering her phone.<eos> She's not at work.<eos> The police said I can't file a missing-persons report for 48 hours.<eos> I was hoping you might know something.<eos> I... I'm so sorry.<eos> I... I don't.
- Yeah, I thought so.<eos> At first.<eos> But really I wanted to fight evil.<eos> Which is funny, because I wasn't raised to believe in evil.<eos> And you sure as hell aren't trained to believe in it as a psychiatrist.<eos> We don't even use that word.<eos> But I have looked it in the eye.<eos> Cancer doesn't know what the hell it's doing.<eos> It just eats you.<eos> People do.
She has a new Christmas album.<eos> Well, that kitchen's not going to clean itself.<eos> Uncle Jason said that she was your first love.<eos> Who?<eos> Nikki.<eos> We went to high school together.<eos> Uncle Jason said you still love her.<eos> Well, your Uncle Jason is a man-child who knows nothing about love.<eos> So, you loved her.<eos> I did.
Yeah.<eos> You have a good night.<eos> Um-<eos> - I have to know something.<eos> Why did you leave?<eos> What are you talking about? When I got signed, you came out for the celebration, everyone was having a good time, you just disappeared.<eos> I'm surprised you even noticed I was gone.<eos> Chris, I didn't intentionally ignore you.<eos> I thought you supported me.<eos> Well, I did.
'Cause I'll sound like a crazy person!<eos> You know how every year we watch that movie Love Actually, and that really hot guy says that Christmas is a time for truth?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, if you can't tell someone you love them at Christmas, when can you?<eos> Oh, good, you brought clothes.<eos> Dad's wardrobe is hideous. Yeah, you got that right.<eos> Every suit that he owns is stained and double-breasted.<eos> Hey, man. Thanks for bringing some clothes.<eos> Apparently, my daughter thinks my wardrobe is embarrassing.<eos> Yeah, no, we all do. Really?
I'm not talking about new clients. I'm talking about new revenue from clients we already have.<eos> Well, that's operating in complete bad faith.<eos> Now, what clients are you talking about.<eos> First, I got you something.<eos> Okay, Katrina, you know what?<eos> I really don't have time for sentimental--<eos> The trademark came through ten minutes ago.<eos> I... Don't know what to say.<eos> Say you forgive me for letting you lose control of Nigel.<eos> I do.
You're missing the point.<eos> I am trying to figure out which school is best for me in a vacuum. No.<eos> You're missing the point.<eos> You're trying to figure out what school is best for you as though I didn't exist. But I do.<eos> Rachel, I'm not saying that you have to go to Columbia.<eos> We're adults.<eos> We're together.<eos> At some point, you're gonna have to factor that in, too.<eos> She go for it?<eos> No, she didn't.
But that isn't a side deal. That's an incentive.<eos> What it is, is a conflict of interest.<eos> That is not true.<eos> If anything, it made Harvey work harder for Ava.<eos> Whatever gets you through the night.<eos> The truth is, Edward Darby doesn't make that deal unless you have leverage.<eos> You knew Darby couldn't lose because Stephen Huntley's murders would be discovered.<eos> Isn't that correct? No, it isn't.<eos> So, prior to her trial starting, you didn't know that Stephen Huntley orchestrated those murders?<eos> No, I didn't.
Scottie, all this is, is Tanner trying to get us to fight among ourselves.<eos> Well, he's doing a damn good job of it.<eos> You think he didn't say some things in there that got to me, too?<eos> Well, I'm not bringing them up because right now, we need to stick together.<eos> Sticking together means telling the truth.<eos> So, tell me.<eos> Whose idea was it to cut that deal, yours or Jessica's? It was hers.<eos> And I didn't wanna go behind your back just like you didn't wanna go behind Darby's.<eos> But I did because, in the end, I knew I didn't have a choice.<eos> And neither do you.
While I was upstairs trying to score points with my dad's new girlfriend... I discovered that someone else was scoring... in my room.<eos> Dorrit!<eos> - Have you seen this before?<eos> - No. Maybe it's yours.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> You're not having any sex.<eos> The question is, are you?<eos> Uh, yeah. Duh.<eos> What did you think? Well, I thought maybe you were, but I didn't know.<eos> Now I do.
It's still got to be up there.<eos> Now we know where the box is.<eos> Audrey, the big guy, he's gone.<eos> Literally, the cell's empty.<eos> He's gone after that box.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I can't believe you actually tased me.<eos> Is anyone else seeing this?<eos> I'm being arrested, and for once I really didn't do anything.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Okay, come on, guys.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Shotgun.<eos> Shotgun.<eos> Well, I thought you'd wanna finish our conversation. Just didn't think we'd have an audience.<eos> I didn't come here to talk.<eos> No.<eos> You don't wanna shoot me.<eos> Hey, pal.<eos> She really does.
It was horrible.<eos> Horrible.<eos> Can you describe who killed the man that attacked you?<eos> Just try to tell us what you saw.<eos> El Cucuy.<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't get that.<eos> El Cucuy.<eos> Is that a name?<eos> Do you know this El Cucuy?<eos> We all do.
What?<eos> William...<eos> He's gone.<eos> - I'm telling you, I feel fine.<eos> - That's impossible.<eos> No, the doctor -- He can't explain it either.<eos> He says that all my internal stitches from the surgery are gone. It's like I was never injured at all.<eos> But if you're healed, does that mean...<eos> William is, too.<eos> Stan, how you doing?
You keep telling him that.<eos> Do you believe in the afterlife, Audrey?<eos> I think so.<eos> We have had ghosts here before in Haven.<eos> That's Haven.<eos> I'm talking about something more universal.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> So you don't believe?<eos> No, I do.
Do you believe in the afterlife, Audrey?<eos> I think so.<eos> We have had ghosts here before in Haven.<eos> That's Haven.<eos> I'm talking about something more universal.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> So you don't believe?<eos> No, I do.<eos> I really, really do.
Here we go. Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Uh... Let's get somethin' to eat.<eos> Okay, kiddo.<eos> Camera is rolling.<eos> Strut your stuff.<eos> Pops, get a close-up of my Z. Cavaricci's.<eos> I wanna remember this outfit for the rest of my life.<eos> Unfortunately, I still do.
That mob would do anything to see us go down.<eos> Why are his wrists taped?<eos> Injury.<eos> Unusual to have both taped, though, and there's bruising to the back of the head.<eos> He copped a blow at training yesterday, sir. From Barlow.<eos> What about the soles of his feet?<eos> What about them?<eos> Well, you should take a closer look. It's strange.<eos> You have your brief to get on with, Miss Fisher, and I have mine.<eos> Amazing what football does to a man.
And it can go away just like that.<eos> I saw Lou at the office, and then I called him a few times on the phone.<eos> And you were angry.<eos> No. Not angry.<eos> No, no, I just...<eos> I wanted to, you know, fix things.<eos> Is that what you did, T.J.?<eos> Did you fix things? Did you go to see your Uncle Lou?<eos> Yes.<eos> I-I did.
We could get a bite first. I have Janey coming over to babysit.<eos> Honey, I know my work craziness may be hard for you to understand.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> So why is this so important to you, Sara?<eos> It's just a concert.<eos> And besides, we hate classical music.<eos> Lou was gonna testify to the feds. You threatened him the night he died.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Elaine, who got it from Connie.<eos> Of course she did.
She just got all turned around by this family.<eos> And my brother is innocent.<eos> He's gonna get eaten alive in jail.<eos> So with Connie gone, they're both free.<eos> Two birds, one stone, Jack.<eos> You really are a Karsten after all.<eos> Until the day I die.<eos> Do you ever think about how things could have been different?<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Yeah, I do sometimes.
But if you don't leave my friend alone, I'm going to sleep with your dad and destroy your parents' marriage.<eos> It would never work.<eos> My dad loves my mom.<eos> ( laughs ) Sometimes daddies want a new mommy.<eos> A younger mommy, a hotter mommy.<eos> And then they have new kids.<eos> Cuter kids, hotter kids, and they start calling you, "What's her name?"<eos> And Christmas becomes a buffet of lies and half-truths while Daddy tries to force a smile and remember why he even wanted you in the first place.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I always hate to see you go, Dee-dawg.<eos> Can't thank you enough for this one, man.<eos> Sonny, we'll see you around.<eos> You can bet on that, boys.<eos> Take it easy, man.<eos> Hey, h-how did you know Timmy asking his mom to leave was gonna work?<eos> I didn't.<eos> Total hail Mary.<eos> You just got lucky?<eos> Kind of like you did with this place.
I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> I would like to introduce my new plaintiff...<eos> Isaac Yordy, Jakob Yordy's son.<eos> Your Honor, this man has no standing.<eos> He's not a member of the amish community.<eos> He's been shunned.<eos> My sister is dying, Your Honor.<eos> I'm asking the court to recognize me even if my father won't.<eos> Young man, I wish I could, but you don't qualify as a plaintiff.<eos> Well, actually he does.
Sorry.<eos> Please call me so I can explain that.<eos> I was having a bad day and I took it out on you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Your math teacher called.<eos> Laura, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Is it just because you want a pair of shoes?<eos> It's not because of the damn shoes!<eos> -I can't understand...<eos> -You never did!
- Yes I know.<eos> - You two have a nice apartment.<eos> - Yes, but it's mine.<eos> Yes I know.<eos> But I thought you are living together ...<eos> - Where do you live?<eos> - I still live in Växjö.<eos> Jacob was born there.<eos> - But perhaps you knew that.<eos> - No, I did not.
But if this is how you wanna play it, little man, guess I'll have to take you down right now.<eos> You both can go easy or it can be hard.<eos> They should've killed you, you stupid...<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> Put it down!<eos> Sit down!<eos> Now we gotta figure this out. Figure this out?<eos> You just killed him.<eos> No.<eos> You did.
OK, erm, now is not a good time, Junior. Amber'll make you a nice cup of tea in a minute. Typical.<eos> He never offers me a lolly.<eos> I've got to steal them when he's asleep.<eos> Maybe if you were nicer to him.<eos> I am nice.<eos> Just not as nice as you.<eos> I mean, you're the complete package, Amber.<eos> Your hair, your legs, the cute way you stick your tongue out when you're thinking.<eos> You're just saying that, you don't really like that face.<eos> No, I do.
Mmm, she sounds fun.<eos> She shouldn't be afraid to speak her mind, you know?<eos> I mean, she should have a sensitive side, but still be a hard-ass. Oh!<eos> Sit up straight, honey.<eos> And I want her to take care of me.<eos> Cook, pick up my stuff, make me hot pockets. Mm.<eos> By the way, thank you for the hot pocket.<eos> All right, and I'm on the case for my sweet, handsome, delicious boy.<eos> You know you just described mom. What?<eos> I did n... oh, my God!
I'm sorry, Vic, I'm sorry.<eos> She's got this sick power over me.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> She can't do that! We had sex!<eos> That's weird, Frank.<eos> I don't know why I didn't get your text.<eos> I heard things no man should hear. GIL:<eos> We all did.
Sounds awful.<eos> Is it serious?<eos> It's hereditary.<eos> They expected it to be much worse, but they say my body's strong.<eos> I keep fighting it off.<eos> Is that what your mother had?<eos> Yeah, that's what she died from.<eos> So you have no other family at all?<eos> Mm, nope.<eos> Well, you do now.
Answer three correctly, and you get to step down and join the team.<eos> Easy enough, right?<eos> If you get them wrong, you drink and you lose an item of clothing.<eos> If you fall off your podium, you drink and undress.<eos> If you make some sissy little face, you drink and undress.<eos> If you talk, you drink and undress.<eos> I...<eos> I... don't drink.<eos> You don't drink?<eos> Well, you do now, sister.
With who?<eos> Charlotte Hawthorn.<eos> She came to you?<eos> No.<eos> Seems as though a jealous student has taken issue with preferential treatment.<eos> Well, it's a serious charge, and I have to investigate.<eos> Of course.<eos> These young girls and their overactive imaginations.<eos> I... never said your accuser was a girl.<eos> No, I did.
Why do you guys care?<eos> Move on to one of your other cases.<eos> I don't know. We were getting interested.<eos> Well, then find a more recent terrorist connection.<eos> Okay, here we are.<eos> We're back together.<eos> What do you have, Bobby?<eos> Bobby?<eos> Bobby, I intend to move this suit forward, unless you guys got something.<eos> We do, Your Honor.
I'm going in.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you got?<eos> What do you got? Hang on, hang on. There.<eos> I just want to be home.<eos> Animals.<eos> The crowd is loving it.<eos> It's the bottom of the 8th inning, and so far...<eos> Whose turn is it to wash the dishes?<eos> I did them last time.
Along the lines of the traditional Sandman.<eos> But there's others.<eos> Less friendly.<eos> Vengeful types.<eos> Does this mean anything to you?<eos> It's from an 18th century Mohawk story about a dream demon.<eos> Ro'kenhrontyes.<eos> You know him?<eos> The creature in your nightmare, did he have black hollow eye sockets?<eos> Yeah, he did.
Lieutenant!<eos> Crane?<eos> Crane?<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> The imagination... It is, uh, it's a powerful thing, Jenny.<eos> What you actually saw was-was likely an animal or a hunter.<eos> What we saw was a demon!<eos> Tell him.<eos> Did you see this monster, Abbie?<eos> Yes, she did.
I'm so sorry, could you repeat that?<eos> Do you know Mr. Baek Sung-chul?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Mr. Baek Sung-chul.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> Who is this?<eos> How do you know him?<eos> So you do?
No!<eos> We are done with this game.<eos> I will let you know if and when we need more guns.<eos> Until then, hands off my club.<eos> Aye.<eos> Hands off.<eos> You just ripped off a very old scab, Jackie.<eos> - Did he call you here?<eos> - No.<eos> But why didn't you?
Will you just get your equipmunk checked?<eos> Don't start equipmunk stuff.<eos> Jenny, don't do that.<eos> Equipmunk wrong.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> Equipmunk dirty!<eos> Stop it. Equipmunk make my downstairs hurty.<eos> She's saying I gave her an STD.<eos> I mean, I couldn't possibly give her something if I don't have it, right?<eos> Well, maybe you did.
You're an inspiration.<eos> And you're an obstruction.<eos> The force could use more bodies like yours.<eos> Here's my card.<eos> Let me slide my fingers into that warm little pocket of yours.<eos> Help a blameless child...<eos> Witness number one, please.<eos> They even shot the owl.<eos> Why would a bank have an owl?<eos> All banks do.
He's a comedian.<eos> Tell us a joke, funny man.<eos> What's the difference between a King Edward and your mother?<eos> Surprise me.<eos> One's a potato. The other's a whore.<eos> He's going to over-cock.<eos> Jack knows what he's doing.<eos> That's your mother on What's My Line.<eos> Hope you like the taste of fists, funny man.<eos> Not as much as she does.
Want you to meet our new friend Jacques, Katya.<eos> Hello Jacques.<eos> It's pronounced "Jack".<eos> I think you should extend Mr Coppaire the usual hospitality.<eos> Yes, darling.<eos> I don't need second-hand goods.<eos> Oi.<eos> Mr Macratty doesn't like having his generosity slung back in his face.<eos> And I don't like it rammed down my throat.<eos> No, but Katya does.
I owe you.<eos> The Pacers are in preseason, the Colts are in San Francisco,<eos> Brick just read our TV manual, and it turns out we got picture-in-picture.<eos> You know, I appreciate it, but I got to go.<eos> It's really hot in here.<eos> Yep-- turns out Mike wasn't as fine as he thought with Axl being gone.<eos> - Still here, dad.<eos> - Oh. Sorry.<eos> Hey, you want to watch the game?<eos> No, I do not.
So, the way I see it, her leg's busted anyway. We serve her up.<eos> It could buy us some time.<eos> Screw you, Neil.<eos> Busted leg?<eos> Try a sprained ankle, okay?<eos> Nobody's serving anybody up!<eos> We are under the gallows, all of us.<eos> Give it honor.<eos> It might save the rest of our necks, unless you have a better plan.<eos> Maybe I do.
"I don't care.<eos> I'm gonna go get a tongue piercing."<eos> It's still so wrong.<eos> And I want to apologize to you, because, um, you know, I should have told you that I was messing everything up. That's all right ...<eos> just, in the future, let's not keep things from each other, okay?<eos> That's what my ex-wives are for.<eos> Oh, Kate, it turns out I didn't hurt my uterus at all.<eos> That's because you don't have a uterus.<eos> - Remember, buddy?<eos> Girls do.
How are you feeling?<eos> A bit calmer now.<eos> It seems we have a lot to discuss after you're discharged.<eos> We can discuss it now, or we can just talk about something else.<eos> It's entirely up to you.<eos> Joining Hankmed was a very difficult adjustment for me.<eos> But you made it so much easier with your kindness and your compassion.<eos> In retrospect, I believe that's when my feelings began.<eos> I just never found the strength to tell you.<eos> Yeah, you did.
I don't work. Neither does he.<eos> It's working out well.<eos> I live in your house.<eos> You're bored out of your minds.<eos> Yeah, they've got all this pent-up surgical energy and now everything's a competition.<eos> - It is not.<eos> - And he's winning.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - He is not winning. He couldn't even get Zola to put her shoes on tonight.<eos> I did that.
I want you to kiss me.<eos> Look at this.<eos> They got a picture of a damned rabbit hopping through a meadow.<eos> Sunshine and daisies and friggin' bunny rabbits.<eos> Could be worse.<eos> You could die in that bed... in this room.<eos> This hospital could be the last place you see.<eos> You don't want to die here.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
What are you going to do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What should I do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> I wish I can just stay here and hide myself.<eos> As long as there's something to eat, until you get the surgery...<eos> That was a close call.<eos> I have to give this back to you.<eos> We did the pinky promise.
What?<eos> So you won't go?<eos> All right.<eos> She's gonna stay. Hug her 'cause you guys get to go in.<eos> No, no.<eos> Hey, wait, come here, come here, come here...<eos> You guys trying to buy tickets?<eos> You have tickets?<eos> You have any?<eos> - Yeah, we did.
If you guys can do the dishes, then she'll get him back into fighting shape.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Hey, excuse me.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Weren't you here before with Benny Severide?<eos> Uh, yeah, I was.<eos> Why?<eos> Ii just wanted to know if you were aware that he has a wife and kids.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
Now you understand why it's best I give her some space.<eos> Always the martyr.<eos> Hold on, you don't know the whole story.<eos> And I never do.<eos> It's like I didn't know the story of my 21-year-old sister.<eos> Yeah, I talked to her.<eos> 21 years old, which is exactly how long ago you left me and mom to fend for ourselves.<eos> Tell me this.<eos> Do you even know who her mom is?<eos> Of course I do.
What's the catapult for?<eos> If you catch the head, you get a free dinner.<eos> Make it a good one!<eos> That was a beauty!<eos> Still barbaric as ever.<eos> Hail the Queen!<eos> We have to save Will.<eos> You have an idea?<eos> 'Cause this is looking bleak. Off with his head!<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
She is staying home to spend time with her girls.<eos> And I'm fully supportive of that, and not just because I get to headline on my own again.<eos> The publicity stills from the photo shoot are gorgeous.<eos> You are gonna knock them dead at Luke Wheeler's benefit concert tomorrow night.<eos> And we're gonna make sure you sound as fabulous as you look.<eos> Well, I'm not even performing, am I?<eos> No, but we're having all of our up-and-coming artists walk the press line.<eos> Let's start with an easy question.<eos> When did you first know you wanted to be a singer?<eos> Uh... I didn't.
Billy pulled a knife on me.<eos> I was just trying to stop him.<eos> I didn't mean to.<eos> But then when the cops came, Warren lied.<eos> He said I pulled the knife on them, and they just took him at his word.<eos> Which is why you hate cops.<eos> But I didn't kill Angelo.<eos> I didn't.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> I do, Emma.
And for one second, maybe if you could just step out of your snotty world view... (Slap)<eos> (Exhales deeply) I don't care about these people.<eos> I'm taking the jet.<eos> You can find your own way home.<eos> - Juliette!<eos> - Hey.<eos> It is so great to see you again. Thank you so much for coming.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> She told you, didn't she?<eos> She did.
Tell me.<eos> My guess... it was so he could keep Flynn alive while he fully removed his liver.<eos> Like Prometheus.<eos> He's telling us that this is our fault.<eos> But it's not.<eos> We were trying to piss him off.<eos> Well, we succeeded, and we got Flynn killed.<eos> We did not kill Hayes Flynn; Pelant did.<eos> Now, the only thing we can do is try to catch Pelant, using the evidence in front of us.<eos> MONTENEGRO: Well, what if we don't?
Uh, a last minute thing came up.<eos> His secretary called to say he had a golf trip to Pebble Beach.<eos> You're alone, huh?<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> Did you know that today is Walt's birthday?<eos> Everyone is celebrating, without me.<eos> You noticed I'm not there either.<eos> Bet you regret kissing me.<eos> You kissed me.<eos> And yes, I do.
I wanna see what this is.<eos> I guess the question is, do you?<eos> I do.<eos> Uh... Don't worry. I-I just brushed my teeth.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> - Hey, you.<eos> How was your weekend, huh?<eos> Do you have something you need to tell me?<eos> Well, I guess you heard about my interview.<eos> I sure did.
You want us to continue investigating, report everything to you, but you're not going to tell us why you're here?<eos> It's need-to-know.<eos> We'll be setting up in the conference room.<eos> We'll need any preliminary reports and all of Reynolds' personal electronics-- phones, iPads, computers.<eos> Thank you for your cooperation.<eos> We'll use the victim's phone and computer data to reconstruct what he was up to in his last 24 hours.<eos> And by the way, D.C. made it clear that they want us to send it to them.<eos> Why do they want the data?<eos> They didn't say.<eos> They rarely do.
I am sharing her passion. Maybe this is what my mother gave me.<eos> Your daddy taught you pretty good.<eos> Hey.<eos> You okay?<eos> You know... that's a good tune.<eos> You know, if you're not careful, all your old mistakes can just roll up on you.<eos> I taught my kid to play guitar, too.<eos> It's like you said.<eos> I wish I'd had stuck with it.<eos> Well, your kid probably does, too.
We'll figure it out, bud.<eos> And with this targeted bus-and-billboard campaign, we project increased growth in public awareness for Windy City over the next five years.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Well, it's certainly along the lines of what we hope to do, you know, sales-wise.<eos> I guess we were hoping for something a little more...<eos> Penis... exciting.<eos> We want to edge up our brand a little bit.<eos> Well, what's exciting is reliable sales growth.<eos> You know, what's edgy is, uh, increased market share.<eos> Lauren, what do you...
The devil takes such cozy forms.<eos> God, she sounds like the worst.<eos> Yeah, I can't wait to see you either... buddy. I'll pick one up on the way back.<eos> No gluten, no cheese.<eos> Who wants those things junking up our pizza?<eos> The worst.<eos> So what are you doing tonight?<eos> Uh, I, uh, have a date with, uh, this girl.<eos> - Girl have a name?<eos> - They usually do.
And besides, you guys don't even know her.<eos> How can you hate someone you don't even know?<eos> Don't know Hitler, don't like him.<eos> All right, can we get back to work? Yes.<eos> As soon as you agree to break up with her before she makes you layer your polos again.<eos> It was not a good look.<eos> - Tell me, son...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> What do you really feel about Nancy putting you in this cardigan? Do you like it?<eos> Well, I don't...
Hi, Dr. Breeland.<eos> Oh, Brick.<eos> Wow, I haven't seen you in ages, and may I say you-you look wonderful.<eos> - It's all yoga. - Oh.<eos> It changed my life.<eos> And I finally got rid of that ridiculous mole.<eos> Oh, I never noticed.<eos> Uh, what can I do to help you?<eos> Well, Lemon and I ran into each other yesterday, and she told me I was due for some booster shots. She said to come in this morning.<eos> Oh, she did, did she?
And now I'm off the team 'cause I wouldn't stop seeing you.<eos> That is four months of training just gone!<eos> That is endless hours of strategizing just gone!<eos> That is Bluebell's chance to win this whole thing... what is it, you guessed it... yeah, gone!<eos> You quit the race because of me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, what was I supposed to do?<eos> - You like me.<eos> - No! I mean, I do, yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
- I don't know.<eos> Bachelor party.<eos> Vegas.<eos> NFL buddies.<eos> Vegas.<eos> - Ladies.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Did you know that you have the coolest girlfriend?<eos> It's true.<eos> He does.
You know when she does that quiet angry thing - and you wish she'd just yell?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah, she did that.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Anyway.<eos> - Get out.<eos> Yeah, the cuff doesn't come off till your uncle wants it to come off.<eos> The material is a titanium blend, essentially unbreakable, impervious to powers.<eos> If we knew the alloy, we could circumvent it.<eos> We don't.
It... it looked good.<eos> Good?<eos> That's it?<eos> Didn't you love the color ochre I picked?<eos> Sure.<eos> Sure? It's awesomely autumnal.<eos> I guess.<eos> Just say it.<eos> You obviously don't like the float.<eos> No, I do.
Even when you mentioned me, it was in comparison to him.<eos> I... I remember one line you wrote about how we weren't gonna see each other for a whole week...<eos> "it's nice to finally miss someone new."<eos> Very poetic.<eos> But you were still referencing him.<eos> It... it was always really about him.<eos> But isn't that what people do?<eos> Compare their new relationships to their past ones?<eos> I guess, but you're supposed to feel like the new relationship you're in is better.<eos> You obviously don't.
I know.<eos> But it can wait a day or two.<eos> I just don't want you to make a decision you're gonna regret.<eos> Me either.<eos> Do you want me to take you home?<eos> Can we just drive for a little?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Hey, West.<eos> You got those pages coach gave us for the flex offense?<eos> Yeah, sure do.
Wow!<eos> Look at you, Bennet.<eos> Working it.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> It was Walt. He was amazing.<eos> What happened to peacocks are beneath you?<eos> I guess I just got angry.<eos> When Larissa was so surprised to see you here, it made me realize they don't appreciate you.<eos> And I realized... I don't either.<eos> Of course you do.
- Can I just have a look?<eos> - No.<eos> - Please?<eos> - No.<eos> Patience.<eos> - Patience?<eos> I don't have any.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> No, I never have had it.<eos> You do.
Oh, my God!<eos> - Retreat, retreat, get back.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> We need to get more toilet paper. Oh, my God.<eos> Get more eggs.<eos> Are there more eggs?<eos> Guys, there's Mitchell.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I don't want him to see me.<eos> I don't.
- Seriously, like, I can't even deal.<eos> - I actually wanna kill myself right now. - Tell me everything.<eos> Um, OK, so I'm at the Kelton gates saying goodbye to Mitchell, and I farted.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> That's hec. - Yeah.<eos> - Fully loud?<eos> - Yeah, like, right in front of him.<eos> - Yeah, he totally heard it.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Do the sound.

♪ I'm going down to the river of Jordan ♪<eos> ♪ Oh, yes<eos> ♪ I'm going down to the river of Jordan ♪ ♪ One of these days, hallelujah ♪<eos> ♪ I'm going down to the river of Jordan... ♪<eos> Thought we was going to Philly.<eos> We are.<eos> Like I said.<eos> Missed the turnoff back there.<eos> That right?<eos> Doing some work on that road.
So Graham himself could easily have snuck back home.<eos> There's no evidence that he knew about Abigail's history as a poisoner.<eos> The very topic I plan to discuss when I confront him tomorrow.<eos> Isn't tomorrow Titus Delancey's memorial service?<eos> Precisely.<eos> You heard what you just said, right?<eos> You're planning to harass a teenage boy while he's mourning his father?<eos> If he's the poisoner, he won't really be mourning, will he?<eos> You know, the police think Abigail is their best suspect?<eos> I do.
Well, we haven't told the kids about the separation yet. She's just... keeping up appearances.<eos> You should know, Captain, I usually cheer the end of any marriage.<eos> As an institution, I think it's outlasted its usefulness by quite a large... margin. - Huh.<eos> And yet I've come to appreciate the premise of partnership.<eos> It's far more intricate than I had previously imagined.<eos> The very smallest gesture can speak volumes.<eos> You're telling me not to give up?<eos> I'm telling you, you should never have entered into the charade that is wedded matrimony.<eos> You had a partner.<eos> Perhaps you still do.
Two murders, three crimes.<eos> So they found the same print at the scene of a liquor store robbery?<eos> Someone stole all the Strawdog wine in the place.<eos> Well, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> Newell, or El Mecanico, or whatever you want to call him, he works for a billion-dollar business.<eos> He's got to be paid well, so I doubt he drinks cheap wine.<eos> And if he does, he can pay for it himself.<eos> Which is how I arrived at my theory:<eos> Newell committed the massacres wearing someone else's fingerprints.<eos> But he didn't do the robbery.
Look at that.<eos> Look at that.<eos> What? The saw...<eos> Fire. Nothing's happening.<eos> All right.<eos> Conversation. Conversation.<eos> Oh.<eos> How much money do you make annually?<eos> Dr. L. Hi.<eos> How you doing?
So I only applied to colleges in New York.<eos> - Oh, do you go to NYADA, too?<eos> - No. NYU. Oh.<eos> I... didn't get in to NYADA. - Yeah? - But it's cool.<eos> I mean, I'm doing things all over the city, and one of the things on my artist's bucket list is to be in an indie band.<eos> So, if...<eos> Starchild's too much for you...<eos> I can be whoever you want.<eos> (chuckles) I just wanted to make an impression.<eos> You did.
Ichabod!<eos> You fight for your life!<eos> You fight for the both of us!<eos> I need to get them back to the colony.<eos> I think that the springwater there could be what heals them.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Water is used in many religions as a way to purify.<eos> Roanoke seems to be some sort of holy place.<eos> So you think they need to baptized in it or something?<eos> I do.
No, no!<eos> This isn't true.<eos> He's not dead. He's not dead.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Fin, we got one in progress.<eos> What do we got here, Willie?<eos> You use this gun to rape anyone else?<eos> I didn't rape nobody.<eos> They wanted it.<eos> Yeah. You do too.
Damn it.<eos> It's technically not my money.<eos> Even still. It's just...<eos> It's not what this is about.<eos> You're a good woman, Christy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And Bonnie?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I think you know where we stand.<eos> I do.
- Do I know how to make a fire?<eos> You gotta admit, though, cabin in the woods, rainy night.<eos> - It's kind of romantic.<eos> - Yes, yes, it is.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hi, Marjorie?<eos> It's Christy.<eos> So, listen, I think god wants me to get laid.<eos> - It's too bad we don't have any marshmallows.<eos> - Oh, but we do.
Or we were not able to see it.<eos> Maybe she found out.<eos> Who would have told her?<eos> What if she thought that we were acting differently because of it.<eos> We had some problems, perhaps she thought she was to blame.<eos> We didn't have any problems.<eos> We had rows, like everyone.<eos> You told me you were glad that at least she wouldn't take after me at all.<eos> She didn't hear that.<eos> Maybe she did.
We don't wanna hurt you.<eos> We just need you to deliver a message to Henry.<eos> Why should I help you?<eos> Because you had a home and a family once and you stopped believing you could get back to them.<eos> Now we're here. We can help...<eos> not just Henry, all of you.<eos> We can get you home.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> I'm here because I don't want to go home.<eos> None of us do.
When and where?<eos> Excellent.<eos> I'll be at the Fremont Park fountain in half an hour.<eos> No. Don't know it.<eos> Central bus station.<eos> North entrance.<eos> Nah, there's too many people.<eos> There's too many cops.<eos> You know Alexandria cemetery?<eos> Of course I do.
- Right.<eos> I got them anywhere from in China, but, mind you, I'm more of a Susan Boyle.<eos> The name's Goldfinger.<eos> James Goldfinger.<eos> Dinner will be served shortly.<eos> It's a traditional English dinner.<eos> It's traditional shepherd's pie, as is our mutual British tradition.<eos> Why don't you say "tradition" one more time?<eos> You remind me of my ex.<eos> 'Course he does.
Right.<eos> Nothing serious I hope?<eos> It's probably cos he's missing a hand.<eos> Look.<eos> Yeah, I still only have the one hand you see, Packy.<eos> Ah, so you do.<eos> I met a fella once who only had the one eye,<eos> Thomas... something.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> No. No, I don't.
I guess time got away from me, you know?<eos> Look, Sweets, I know you feel responsible for those two guys that Pelant killed.<eos> Wow.<eos> Who's the shrink now?<eos> It wasn't your fault.<eos> This isn't about Pelant, okay?<eos> I like helping these kids.<eos> I'm making a difference.<eos> You really like it here? Yeah.<eos> I really do.
Just do that with him.<eos> Okay, Peter? Peter, look at me.<eos> Peter, I believe in you.<eos> You can do this.<eos> - Here's someone I hate.<eos> - Yes! - I hate Becca's fiancé.<eos> - Great, that's perfect.<eos> - He's a kindergarten teacher.<eos> - Yes. Who teaches kindergarten?<eos> And he does it in the inner city, no less.
- Think Lovely Thoughts Original air date November 17, 2013<eos> How is she?<eos> I fear she's getting worse, Henry.<eos> But if I save magic...<eos> She'll live?<eos> Yes.<eos> But more than that, Henry.<eos> If you save magic, you'll save us all.<eos> But to do it, you have to truly believe.<eos> I do.
Help!<eos> You're an... an adult.<eos> My name's Emma.<eos> I'm looking for my son.<eos> - Wendy?<eos> - Do I know you?<eos> It's Baelfire.<eos> - You two know each other?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we do.
That's because it's made in the flowers that grow on the highest of the branches.<eos> Where they're closest to the stars.<eos> The flowers bloom at night, soak in the starlight.<eos> That's how the pixie dust gets its magic.<eos> I haven't felt this excited in years, since I was a boy about to climb one of those trees in my dreams.<eos> Come on, Rumple.<eos> It'll be fun.<eos> Hey... you wanna fly, you can't be afraid of heights.<eos> But I don't want to fly.<eos> You do.
It just feels right, you know?<eos> I'm on my lunch, so I can't stay long. Oh, no...<eos> Is Patrick inside?<eos> He's gone out.<eos> And now I have to go away... ..also.<eos> A good old-fashioned girlie night out.<eos> We've never had the chance to bond!<eos> I want us to bond.<eos> I want that.<eos> I do, I really do.
To be honest, we don't, really. You don't?<eos> The majority of the time, we don't.<eos> Ach, Conor!<eos> How's it going?<eos> Jimmy, are you well?<eos> No complaints.<eos> How's the mammy and daddy?<eos> They're keeping well.<eos> Tell me this, did they get the mouse in the end?<eos> Yeah. They did, aye.
- Like a hospital patient's<eos> - bedside locker?<eos> - Ach, relax, Bronagh.<eos> He couldn't have ate them anyway, he had a tube down his throat.<eos> I was doing him a favour.<eos> Aye, you're nothing but a martyr.<eos> Ach, I say we sack this and do a runner.<eos> Yeah, let's go.<eos> Holy fuck, - did you see that?<eos> - Yep, yes, I did.
I... I'm too busy, you know?<eos> Not... caring.<eos> - You...<eos> - You remember me!<eos> You were with the guy from the bus.<eos> - He saved my life.<eos> - I can help you look for Wikileaks.<eos> He's more like little running faeces.<eos> You... What did you say your friend's name was, again?<eos> I didn't.
The use of a generic skull is gonna result in far too many hits.<eos> You don't have many friends, do you?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> None, really. Hmm.<eos> That's a shocker.<eos> This is a waste of time.<eos> Wow, look at that. One match.<eos> Who knew?<eos> I suppose you think your little ding taught me a lesson.<eos> Did it?
It is a part of our past we are not proud of.<eos> My work is for the victims.<eos> I understand.<eos> I only wish you had the technology we enjoy at the Jeffersonian instead of this.<eos> We might not have machines to do our work for us, like you, but we are proud of what we can accomplish here.<eos> I assure you, I have done extraordinary work without the benefit of technology.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Thank you so much for showing us your lovely place here, Doc.<eos> See, we have a windsurfing appointment we have to get to.<eos> No, we don't. We do now.
He worked with our guys on a Joint Task Force against the cartels in the late '90s, and busted some corrupt local judges in 2006.<eos> Since then, he's gone head-to-head against corruption in Buenos Aires.<eos> He's squeaky clean. All right, so he's one of the good guys.<eos> On paper.<eos> But police corruption has been a problem in Buenos Aires.<eos> The cops either need the support of the community or their fellow officers, which this guy has neither.<eos> So I wouldn't be surprised if his sense of loyalty is colored...<eos> Look, look, unless you have something solid on this guy, all right, I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt, you know?<eos> And don't touch my bobblehead.<eos> I didn't.
Oh, there you are!<eos> And only two hours late!<eos> Oh, it's okay, though.<eos> I can always get the next bus.<eos> It's fine. Yeah, it's fine that I spend my days taking care of other people's kids while my own kids are raised by my bitch mother.<eos> That's a super sad fake story, but we're not the only late ones.<eos> What about those girls' parents?<eos> Actually, those are yogirls. What?<eos> !<eos> Yep, they did a lot of growing today.
Miles?<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> It would help if you called me "Stu Redman."<eos> Bastard.<eos> "Redman."<eos> You tried to kill me.<eos> I could have you executed on the spot.<eos> War is hell.<eos> But you got bigger problems right now.<eos> We both do.
We just didn't want to go to jail.<eos> Shut up, Linda!<eos> You make me understand. Why'd you have to kill him?<eos> Matt called a few weeks ago.<eos> He wanted to know who had access to his transcripts.<eos> He suspected that his reports had been compromised.<eos> It was only a matter of time until he traced that back to us.<eos> I'm... sorry.<eos> I'm... so sorry.<eos> You done here?
- Mute.<eos> - That's why I use...<eos> [Beep] I can't watch that commercial anymore.<eos> Who's that happy about being 40 and wearing a diaper?<eos> Well, I'm guessing - this is the last commercial break, right?<eos> - And then it's over.<eos> [Sighs] I'm really gonna miss that cold, awkward elephant.<eos> You see, for me, it's really all about the duckling.<eos> I used to hate soft and Fluffy, but now I just want to squeeze his little face and tell him I love him.<eos> Yes, I do.
Quick, quick!<eos> -Riley, hurry up!<eos> -Come on, come on! -Mansell!<eos> -I've got a signal, sir -<eos> -They're going to get...<eos> -Hurry up!<eos> If they get their hands on you, they'll kill you!<eos> So what happened to the last guy?<eos> Do you really wanna know?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I really do.
Wow, thanks.<eos> That's some great advice, Lil.<eos> I knew I could count on you.<eos> He's gotten very respectful with his fake listening.<eos> Anyway, Lily,<eos> I told Marshall this already, but... don't worry about not sending a thank you note for the coffeemaker.<eos> It's cool.<eos> Uh, we did send a thank you note for the coffeemaker.<eos> Uh... no, you didn't.<eos> Uh... yes, we did.
Maltese Falcon, right?<eos> You know it.<eos> A kindred spirit.<eos> He played Sam Spade, a private eye everybody was lying to.<eos> You've been lying for 14 years.<eos> You brought this little girl home, just like you did Darcy Blaine.<eos> You know it, and I know it.<eos> You don't know anything.<eos> You sure as hell don't know me.<eos> You never did.
JENNY: Yeah, 'cause you're good at...<eos> Enough!<eos> If your familial ties meant so little to you, you'd spend far less effort baiting her into a fight just to stoke your misguided pride.<eos> And you... Do make some effort not to be such an easy target.<eos> Now drop your weapons, both of you.<eos> Nice to see you again, British Guy.<eos> My name is Ichabod Crane.<eos> How long was Sheriff Corbin in your life?<eos> What, he didn't tell you?<eos> No, he did not.
Can you hear me?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Nick, it's us, man!<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Don't do it, Nick!<eos> He's doing it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Do you think we killed him?<eos> We didn't.
There he is!<eos> Let him back down. Now!<eos> Call 911!<eos> I said call 911!<eos> C'est moi aussi.<eos> I would have regretted shooting you, my friend.<eos> Unless, of course, it was you who set us up, Sebastian.<eos> It was the Verrat that tried to kill us.<eos> Who knew you were there?<eos> I didn't.
Should I add a "whoo-hoo" or is that too bitchy?<eos> Look who I called.<eos> Hey, Jess.<eos> Shut your face.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, looks like you could use a new drink.<eos> Barkeep, can I please get a Shirley Temple with a finger of coconut rum and a lemon squeeze?<eos> I call it a Temple Grandin because it makes friendly and compassionate.<eos> I have a boyfriend.<eos> No, she... No, she doesn't.

Where is she?<eos> Where's the woman who gave me life and nothing more? Stop.<eos> I've been waiting for you, and we need to talk.<eos> Busy.<eos> I gotta call mom. Um, no.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> Leave me alone, or so help me God...<eos> Why'd you have to purple my nurple?<eos> This doesn't involve you.<eos> Of course it does!
Okay, that's inappropriate, all right? I don't know why we have to come out here.<eos> But why?<eos> So Chloe, how much do you know about your fiancée?<eos> Oh, my goodness, Dr. Lahiri.<eos> Wow.<eos> Yes!<eos> No!<eos> So Danny probably told you I was crazy, right?<eos> I would never say that.<eos> Yes, he did.
I have asthma.<eos> Back off!<eos> "Riddle me this.<eos> "Arrah, Arrah, and gather round,<eos> "the work of this hero is legion-bound.<eos> "He multiplies N by the number of He, and in this room the thing you'll see."<eos> Good riddle, huh?<eos> Yeah. So when you guys plan fun activities, does my name even... come up, or...?<eos> I invited you to my murder mystery party.<eos> No, you didn't.
Find me that damn witch so she can finish that spell!<eos> No way.<eos> Can't a witch rest in peace?<eos> It's a flesh wound.<eos> Get up.<eos> You're not done yet.<eos> Ohh!<eos> Amara.<eos> I loved you.<eos> I still do...
Locked herself out of the house again.<eos> I could go for some pizza.<eos> What about you?<eos> Um, sure, but what about your mum?<eos> She'll work it out.<eos> Do they have Hawaiian?<eos> I got your text.<eos> I meant what I said.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't believe you.<eos> And you do now?
I meant to every day last week.<eos> - Mm-hm. - I did!<eos> Monday it rained, Tuesday I was running late,<eos> Wednesday and Thursday I was wearing heels and Friday I thought I had my period.<eos> Oh, the non-cycling time of the cycle.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I have split classes on Monday and I can ride there and then ride home for lunch.<eos> You don't have to, babe. You don't have to.<eos> It's just that I bought it for you 'cause you said you missed having a bike and...<eos> - I did and I do!
You not only brought him here, you sent him packing, which means you are one hot shit witch.<eos> Power like yours does not go unnoticed.<eos> Which means you've got a bull's-eye on your back, kiddo, and our biggest enemy is locked, loaded, and looking at you.<eos> Marie Laveau.<eos> My mother.<eos> But she's on our side.<eos> Fiona Goode has been on the same side her whole life: her own.<eos> Now, I don't know if you are the next Supreme, nobody does, but if she jumps to that conclusion, right or wrong, she will slit your throat just like she did to Madison.<eos> Nobody knows who killed Madison, not even Madison.<eos> She doesn't, but I do.
Did you ever get a look back at who was shooting?<eos> No, the door was closed.<eos> I knew if I didn't do anything, I'd be next, so I went to the window and opened it.<eos> And that's when you climbed down.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I just started running.<eos> Did you ever look back?<eos> No.<eos> So you didn't see the shooter. No.<eos> But Haley did.
- Copy that.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> Why am I not being released?<eos> You're not going anywhere, you son of a bitch.<eos> When I stepped into the garage, I saw a man.<eos> He was walking towards a parked car, carrying a gun.<eos> And then what?<eos> I saw the man shoot Dr. Fuller three times.<eos> And without any doubt, can you see the man who pulled the trigger in the courtroom today?<eos> Yes, I do.
But I think he knew your father.<eos> Owed him a debt.<eos> "I owe him my life."<eos> "Tell him the debt was paid."<eos> Back in the 1970's, I helped refugees start over in USA-- new lives, new names--<eos> Schrieber was one of many.<eos> He said he owed his life to a Russian soldier, an officer who helped him escape.<eos> I believe they stayed in contact even after Schrieber became Reinhardt and moved to America.<eos> Schrieber agreed to keep track of you... until your father could come back for you and your sister.<eos> Only he never did.
- Yeah, well, I'm starving.<eos> Hi, could you connect me with room service, please?<eos> Oh, Adam, don't use food to cover up your feelings.<eos> Shut up.<eos> - Hello, Christy.<eos> - Oh, hi.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - We do?<eos> - Yes, we do.
Well, don't think of it as lying.<eos> Think of it as... providing motivation.<eos> Motivation for what?<eos> Doing what needs to be done, for all of us.<eos> And I need to control that belief.<eos> What do you need him to believe in?<eos> Me.<eos> Now back to your cage.<eos> You really believe Belle can succeed?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm actually not feeling so hot.<eos> Ward, cover the back door.<eos> Nobody comes in or out.<eos> What if this weapon overloaded the brain past the threshold of its electrical capacity, causing it to discharge, like an E.M.P.?<eos> You're assuming we're dealing with an external source.<eos> I'm saying it was something from inside him.<eos> Something's happening ... the satellite's picking up another reading.<eos> It's coming from the firehouse.<eos> That humming noise ... you hear that?<eos> No. I don't.
That I could do.<eos> What I can't do is protect you guys from stuff I can't even see... or understand.<eos> So, what do we do?<eos> We wait... - ...and get ready.<eos> - Ready for what?<eos> For whatever it is we're called upon to do.<eos> Coulson, nice to see you're not dead.<eos> Did you get our analysis of the virus?<eos> We did, and S.H.I.E.L.D. has no record of anything like it.<eos> No one does.
Yes.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I- yes, director, I know that this is not the first time.<eos> Yes, sir, I do value my job, very much.<eos> Look, I will be on the next train. Mm-hmm.<eos> I'll be back tonight. Ok.<eos> Thank-<eos> Well, my boss found out I don't have food poisoning.<eos> I need to get back to Central City if I still want to be employed.<eos> Which I do.
I set you free, Moira.<eos> Your life belongs to me.<eos> I am through being afraid of you.<eos> You think you can stop me?<eos> Even the Vigilante couldn't kill me.<eos> No, he couldn't.<eos> But I know someone who can.<eos> Ra's al Ghul.<eos> How do you know that name?<eos> Well, I didn't.
Sample's still being scanned.<eos> Shouldn't be too much longer.<eos> You're really worried about him, huh?<eos> He takes crazy chances.<eos> Even when he's not hallucinating about beautiful island girls.<eos> The other night, I asked you if you liked Oliver.<eos> I told you.<eos> I don't.<eos> I remember.<eos> But if you did...
I guess so- - I mean, that is a big pile of naked.<eos> Oh... oh, man.<eos> Now Heidi's with the guy that looks like James Franco.<eos> Wait, that is James Franco!<eos> That guy is in everything!<eos> Wait a second, who am I with now?<eos> Oh, now you're with Sarah.<eos> Turned her back-- wah!<eos> Oh... that is some Game of Thrones stuff there.<eos> Yeah, but we didn't, uh...?
I have a system!<eos> Thanks, poopie.<eos> - Yeah, we need to talk.<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> Look, you've become a really special member of the Gimbels family.<eos> Technically, your mom is allowed to use your discount, but...<eos> - In my heart, it just feels wrong.<eos> - I get that. You get that if you don't get rid of her, I will fire you?<eos> I didn't get that.<eos> But now I do.
Hetty, I've confirmed the rest.<eos> All the girls Cindy hacked, their VIP parents have been hacked, too.<eos> This means privileged dignitary correspondence, corporate strategies, unpublished scientific research.<eos> Not to mention CIA and FBI communications.<eos> The Molina Cartel may be just a small part of this.<eos> Nell's right.<eos> I mean, whoever is behind this has access to everything.<eos> The hacker's profiting ten different ways.<eos> We have no idea where this is gonna end.<eos> Oh, yes, we do, Mr. Callen.
Drop it!<eos> Turn around.<eos> Put your hands on your head.<eos> Thanks for the help, guys.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Christmas tree.<eos> Grinch.<eos> Huh, the elves have been busy.<eos> You see that Christmas tree?<eos> Yeah, we did.
Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?<eos> How about we ask those kids who play Star Trek?<eos> Screw those guys.<eos> I'm not playing with dorks.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Got any extra of that?<eos> Gets a little boring around here.<eos> Enjoy the boredom while you can.<eos> So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday?<eos> I did.
No.<eos> She's gonna be okay.<eos> I hope you're right.<eos> Can I get you anything else?<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, dad?<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> I got nothing to offer her.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
And we are gonna need to take you down to the O.R. to clean the parasites out of that wound.<eos> No! No! Take me home!<eos> Mom.<eos> - Take me home! - No, no, no. Mom.<eos> Mom. Mom. We-we can give you a sedative to ease the anxiety.<eos> No needles!<eos> No needles!<eos> Just go away!<eos> Just leave me alone!<eos> Don't!
This is beautiful.<eos> Heart disease looks better when it's wrapped in a tropical, floral pattern.<eos> Oh, my God, this is hopeless.<eos> We've been searching for hours. Glenn could be dead by now.<eos> I know, and if you guys are really hungry, I suppose I could eat.<eos> Come on, we can't give up.<eos> Someone's got to have seen Quagmire.<eos> Or if not him, at least Sonja.<eos> Excuse me, did you just say "Sonja"?<eos> Yes! I did!
Is this "Freaky Friday"?<eos> Is there a 10-year-old nerd out there pretending to be a 40-year-old diaper salesman?<eos> Hello, Weavers!<eos> Ooh, hey, guys.<eos> I think I have actually made the wine purse. Oh.<eos> Okay, "Shark Tank," here I... Oh.<eos> Oh! Darn it!<eos> It's official.<eos> I'm an idiot, and my idea does not work. Yes, you are.<eos> Yes, it does.

You know, for the record, I, uh, I only broke one of these.<eos> It was an ugly chair.<eos> You're better off without it.<eos> So I guess you were right all along.<eos> It was easier for me to focus on my physical pain than the breakup.<eos> I need to move on.<eos> So you admit it.<eos> I do know what I'm doing.<eos> To be honest with you, I never know exactly what you're doing, Katherine.<eos> Well, Stefan, sometimes... I don't either.
Forgive me, Kangchi.<eos> No, Taeso.<eos> Don't.<eos> No, please...<eos> No!<eos> Kangchi!<eos> Miss?<eos> You hear that?<eos> Hear...?<eos> No, I didn't.
But, what can we do?<eos> Jo Gwan Woong must already be dead.<eos> Step outside for a moment.<eos> Have you been well overnight?<eos> What's the problem?<eos> That's what I'm here to ask of you.<eos> Why were your people found dead in my living quarters?<eos> - Did you dare kill my people?<eos> - Did you dare... try to take my life?<eos> What if I did?
Her son is right next to her.<eos> Please.<eos> What, you can see him?<eos> Her son is dead.<eos> Oh, thank you!<eos> That woman thinks that her child is alive and looking for him like this...<eos> Eonnie, should I go and tell her?<eos> How do you tell a mom that her son is dead?<eos> If she hears that, she'll probably faint.<eos> Don't do it.
They won't, because you'll have all these awesome professors and counselors and new friends that'll have your back.<eos> And all your old friends will have your back, too. Like me.<eos> Are you really my friend?<eos> Always.<eos> At first, I was just hurt and angry and embarrassed, because he turned out to be exactly what everyone said he was.<eos> And then, I was, like, "Okay, fine, it's over."<eos> But then, he's putting flowers in my locker, and then, he's singing "My Life" in Glee Club, like he's the victim. Mm.<eos> It's just all so schizo.<eos> And the worst part is, I still miss him.<eos> Oh, of course you do.
Dan Filch.<eos> Ohio State Gaming Commission.<eos> We're trying to contact Brian. Tell him the good news.<eos> - He won the lottery?<eos> - $50,000.<eos> - Really?<eos> And you're looking for him?<eos> Don't you guys wanna keep the money?<eos> But we have to at least try and contact the winners before the ticket expires.<eos> Your brother's does in six days.
No wonder she keeps screaming in there.<eos> You keep sending in The Cavalry, you're bound to get a reaction like that.<eos> Don't call her that.<eos> Why not?<eos> No normal person can shoot 100 Bahraini...<eos> That's not how it went down.<eos> Whatever, 20.<eos> I don't...<eos> She didn't have a gun.<eos> None of us did.
This isn't a game at all.<eos> No luck.<eos> According to the bank, Mr. Stevens did pay with a check, but it was a cashier's check, so there's no way to trace it.<eos> Hiding his identity, following our victim just before she died.<eos> This has gotta be our killer.<eos> Okay.<eos> I finally tracked down that cab that our victim got into... the one with the "wicked" banner ad on top.<eos> So first, I had to call the theater where "wicked" was playing. They directed me to a P.R firm who then sent me to an ad agency that sells space on the top of cabs, and five cabs...<eos> - Did you talk to the cabbie or not?<eos> - Yes. Yes, I did.
Gracie, after tonight, your life will never be the same.<eos> Where does that voice even come from?<eos> My voice coach.<eos> Look!<eos> It's your music teacher, Mr. Jackie.<eos> Isn't that exciting?<eos> No.<eos> Jonah, your music teacher is on TV.<eos> - I don't like Mr. Jackie.<eos> - Of course you do.
Okay.<eos> Oh, my goodness, we are back with America's greatest leader...<eos> Annabel Porter and her new favorite artisan, local woodworker Ron Swanson.<eos> Hello.<eos> I discovered Ron's chairs a few months ago, and what I absolutely love about a Swanson is you can really use it for anything.<eos> Yes, mostly you use it for sitting.<eos> Make it a rustic accent piece in your solarium.<eos> Even better, use it as a focal point in your yoga tent.<eos> Put it by a table and eat a meal.<eos> We don't do meals in my home.
I don't play games, but clearly, you do.<eos> Uh, the second Voulez backdrop should go here.<eos> And I want lights here, here, and over the bar.<eos> - Nothing fluorescent.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Listen, I don't know how things are done in France, but you do have an assistant to handle this stuff.<eos> - Uh, clear this wall, please.<eos> - I'll get on that.<eos> Only I know what my father likes...<eos> And more importantly, what he does not.
And I'm supposed to write this off as a pheromone thing?<eos> And it's not even the kiss that upsets me.<eos> It's-it's that we keep making excuses for you.<eos> Whether it's Tori.<eos> Or-or the accumulation of this list.<eos> Or you don't remember me.<eos> My father... and-and he is my father, he-he's looking out for me.<eos> He reminded me that at some point enough's enough.<eos> Vincent, when does this all end?<eos> It doesn't.
That's right, Russ Bradley Morrison.<eos> You know you like what you see.<eos> Inthemiddleages,orchids were considered an aphrodisiac, but the only thing turning me on in this room are the curves of your pantsuit.<eos> Kiss me like you did at the Indian Heritage Museum.<eos> Behind the Potawatomi lodge?<eos> Mm. Oh, my god!<eos> Wh... what's going on?<eos> - You know him!<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> No. I don't.
We'll do it in the bathroom.<eos> Seriously? Oh, yeah.<eos> Beats the hell out of the Kiss Cam.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> How did the acting class go?<eos> I didn't go.<eos> Liar!<eos> I talked to my friend, and he said you didn't go, so admit it!<eos> I just did.
It's smoking hot.<eos> I'm in the market myself. Between vehicles right now.<eos> Terrible gas mileage, but that's what James Bond drives.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Oh, we're investigating a Marine.<eos> Staff Sergeant Justin Dunne.<eos> How do you know him?<eos> I don't.
Oh, okay.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> - You just say good - Bye.<eos> No peeking, all right?<eos> Ryan, what is this?<eos> I'm stressed out. Don't look!<eos> Are you looking?<eos> Okay, I'm not.<eos> I didn't.
Do me a favor-- Don't tell Daniel.<eos> I'm embarrassed enough as it is.<eos> You shouldn't be.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We want that to be here.<eos> Yeah, that should work.<eos> Mr. Grayson.<eos> I wasn't expecting you.<eos> I didn't think I'd get to read pages so soon.<eos> Sadly, you don't.
Something has upset you?<eos> I appreciate your concern, sir. But it is not my position to trouble you with my grievances against my employer.<eos> It was petty of me to behave in this way.<eos> - If I may.<eos> - Moray.<eos> What has he done to disturb you?<eos> I've served that man for some years with loyalty and dedication. Beyond the call of duty.<eos> Do I not deserve the reward of my employer's trust?<eos> I don't know why it matters so much to me to be trusted, sir.<eos> But it does.
It creates a bad impression if staff are hopping about from counter to counter.<eos> I want you to see it through with the watches.<eos> If I were to plead with you, sir?<eos> For what reason?<eos> Give me a sound reason and I will give it some consideration.<eos> Very well, Mr Dudley, sir.<eos> Come in.<eos> I want you to tell him.<eos> I want you to tell Torn Weston that Lord Glendenning intended this watch to be left to Katherine's husband. She's kept this from him.<eos> You still doing the watches, then?
She's not my girlfriend.<eos> She running rings round you again?<eos> She's not like that.<eos> What is she like?<eos> She does blow hot and cold.<eos> Oh, you don't want that. Life's too short.<eos> We're just mates.<eos> She uses you.<eos> She doesn't use me.<eos> She damn well does!
1969.<eos> He loved up here, me dad.<eos> It was a right farce.<eos> We thought it would be like powder, but it wasn't, it was more like grit, granules, and it got everywhere.<eos> We just couldn't get rid of it.<eos> We hadn't thought it through.<eos> Well, she hadn't, me mother.<eos> And we hadn't got permission.<eos> Well, we didn't know you needed it.<eos> Perhaps you didn't then.

OK. Right. Right.<eos> So, please, can you explain why, Saturday afternoon, you're on the phone saying,<eos> "I think I might be a little bit in love with you, Gillian," and then, the same night, you're here, in bed with Judith apparently, who you claim to hate.<eos> She told you. Caroline. She...<eos> Yes! Well, isn't it obvious?<eos> Not to me!<eos> I'm floundering.<eos> What?<eos> You won't speak to me, she's decided she's a dyke, the boys think I'm ridiculous.<eos> Oh, no. They don't.
I didn't tell Caroline.<eos> Cos of...<eos> Cos of that what you said last time I saw you... about me mother.<eos> And then you don't speak to me for two weeks, hardly.<eos> And I have to rely on Caroline, this woman who... let's be honest, I hardly know.<eos> Having the courtesy to pick up the phone to me to know you're not...<eos> back in hospital, or worse.<eos> We came up wi' t'plan before we ever even had that conversation about your mum.<eos> We just didn't want a fuss, love.<eos> Your dad didn't, and neither did I.
Oh, yeah.<eos> I shan't tell them about that time you fell down that man-hole in the snow when you'd been on the razzle.<eos> It should've been better lit. Then that time you nearly choked to death laughing when he snapped all the tendons in his ankle falling off that jetty in Porta Pollenca.<eos> That was comical.<eos> Or that time you drove t'wrong way round Bull Green roundabout in Halifax when you came back from t'Continent.<eos> That were quite exciting!<eos> And then that Christmas when you let all his tyres down, when you both got drunk together on barley wine and he called you a rancid old bag.<eos> Oh, I don't think he ever knew that was me.<eos> Oh!<eos> He did.
Sean, I know you're not the mole, but why didn't you tell me you and Andrew were sleeping together?<eos> We hooked up one time.<eos> I brought some papers to his hotel.<eos> Gorgeous room, mini bar, and no female to say, "won't this ruin the friendship?"<eos> But you never keep secrets from me.<eos> You always tell me everything.<eos> I know, but I was afraid you'd think I'd only slept with him to get the promotion.<eos> And then you'd have a lower opinion of me.<eos> I wouldn't have thought that. But, if you didn't tell me, maybe it's because a part of you thought that.<eos> Maybe a part of you still does.
Bite your pretty tongue. I didn't stop at the first rejection.<eos> I did what you guys did. I profiled the guy.<eos> Scotty is a ladies' man. Gets a lot of names and numbers, gotta keep track of them all.<eos> What's a player to do, playa?<eos> He gave her a nickname.<eos> Baby girl's already taken.<eos> But Bunny wasn't.<eos> Tell me you got a number.<eos> Of course I did.<eos> Now so do you.
Hell of a golfer too. Which is amazing, considering his personal challenges.<eos> There he is.<eos> - That guy?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm raising funds here, Mike. Every celebrity helps.<eos> So it's 1961, and jazz musicians are celebrities again?<eos> Hey, jazz is the only pure American art form.<eos> Now go over there and say hello.<eos> Hey, Chaz.<eos> How you doing?
Well, his heart's as strong as a locomotive.<eos> And his lungs are healthy, clearly.<eos> Well, what about a blood test?<eos> Or a chest X-ray?<eos> Is he a smoker? What?<eos> !<eos> Look, it's obvious what the problem is.<eos> He's a crying baby.<eos> I paid for this?<eos> Actually, your insurance did.
Do you have a picture of this kid as a child? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Show that to him.<eos> Call him by his real name and ask about his mother.<eos> You'd be surprised how effective that can be.<eos> Do you recognize this boy?<eos> His name is Rory Brooks.<eos> Do you remember that name?<eos> Do you remember your mother calling you that name?<eos> I don't have a mother.<eos> Sure, you do.
But that doesn't mean we can't find another one... an unexpected one.<eos> I choose hope.<eos> I can believe.<eos> This mobile hung above your crib.<eos> Um, it was supposed to hang over your crib.<eos> I like the unicorns.<eos> Giving you up when the curse hit was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. - I know.<eos> - Every time I look at you,<eos> I wonder what would've happened if I hadn't had to.<eos> I do the same thing with Henry.
You needn't worry.<eos> As long as I'm alive, that boy will never see the light of day.<eos> There.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And you're welcome.<eos> So... what now?<eos> Well, that's a question I haven't had to ask myself.<eos> I didn't think I had a future.<eos> But you do.
I defeated myself.<eos> Wait!<eos> Come and get me!<eos> Snow!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Now I know what Frederick felt like.<eos> I thought I'd lost you forever.<eos> How did you do it?<eos> How did you... Defeat her?<eos> I didn't.
I was just thinking how lucky I am, to have you protecting me here.<eos> Oh, Henry.<eos> When all this is over, I promise, I'm finally going to be the mother you always wanted me to be.<eos> I love you.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why this was so easy.<eos> I'm sorry we didn't find a way to defeat Regina. That's okay.<eos> No.<eos> No, it's not. I know how much you needed this, even if you didn't know why.<eos> I did.
I love you.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why this was so easy.<eos> I'm sorry we didn't find a way to defeat Regina. That's okay.<eos> No.<eos> No, it's not. I know how much you needed this, even if you didn't know why.<eos> I did.<eos> What?<eos> When you asked me why I wanted to turn her to stone, I said I didn't know why.<eos> But I did.
Professor of the month, actually.<eos> I get all the frozen yogurt I want from YouGoGurt.<eos> How's Alicia doing?<eos> - You haven't spoken to her recently?<eos> - I haven't, no.<eos> Why?<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> I-I think so.<eos> - So, do you know Dr. DeLaney?<eos> - I do, yeah. Why?
- I do, yeah. Why?<eos> - This is pretty good.<eos> - You want another?<eos> - 'Cause I got, like, a lot.<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> So, the cops suspected, uh, Dr. DeLaney was sleeping with Dani? Yeah.<eos> I mean, I heard that, too.<eos> DeLaney was going through a divorce at the time, and, um, there were rumors of the...<eos> Oh, uh, you don't want to hear rumors.<eos> - I do.
Supplies?<eos> I got a feeling we're not talking about the standard office variety.<eos> No.<eos> Flash bangs, vests, gas masks, you name it.<eos> Let's go to my office. We can file a report.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We can't do that.<eos> Whoever took them used my clearance information.<eos> My buddy gave me the heads up, but I've only got twelve hours to find the person responsible before the military finds out what's missing.<eos> And if they do...
Well, you tell Luke's father that your mother said that your soul could kick his soul's ass!<eos> Never mind.<eos> I'll just get one at the library.<eos> Well, you know, I do mind.<eos> Luke's dad is forcing his religion on you, which is completely unacceptable.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause... that's my job.<eos> But you didn't do it.<eos> We don't have a religion.<eos> Sure we do!
Joel.<eos> I mean, you can't call me about this, or text me have a discussion-- You were at work.<eos> And I'm telling you now.<eos> So you went and had our conversation with Miss Mikindoe without me.<eos> I ran into her and can we talk about the real issue, here?<eos> Our son is being yanked out of his class in the middle of the school year and we need to figure out how to talk to him about it.<eos> No.<eos> We are not doing that.<eos> I don't think we have a choice.<eos> Yes, we do, Julia.
Yeah, the San Juan capistrano.<eos> You know the swallows fly there every year?<eos> I did know that.<eos> Grandma and grandpa took me down there when I was a kid.<eos> Pretty cool.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Mommy?<eos> - Yeah? If Victor goes back to fourth grade, will he had to do another missions report?<eos> No.<eos> No, he did that.
- You did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So it's all gonna work out.<eos> Um, how do you feel?<eos> Do you feel...<eos> Do you feel okay about it all?<eos> Yeah, yeah. I feel great.<eos> Just gonna get the right one.<eos> 'Cause you know-- you know it's not that I didn't love it very much.<eos> I did.
Gloria, can you please get it?<eos> You two be nice to each other and figure it out.<eos> Oh, hey, Chuck.<eos> I didn't think you'd be working tonight.<eos> Hey. What are you doing here?<eos> Oh, this is my grandfather's house.<eos> There's a pool.<eos> Do you swim?<eos> You look like you swim.<eos> I do.
She might be more open-minded than you think.<eos> Well, you're a cute little Chinese thing.<eos> Actually, Gram, she's, uh, from Vietnam, and her name's Lily.<eos> Dad, how long do we have to stay down here? "Dad"?<eos> Okay, well, I guess there's no way around this.<eos> Ac-- actually, ma'am she's my kin.<eos> So, you got a Chinese wife, Bud?<eos> No, I-I-I went to Vietnam, and I did myself some adopting, and now I'm raising her all by my lonesome.<eos> Well, I never thought I'd live long enough to see that.<eos> None of us did.
Grandpa!<eos> Grandpa, you wanna see the picture I just drew?<eos> I know you.<eos> You were at the Art Fair.<eos> Your name is Jane.<eos> Uh... No, I'm sorry, sweetie, I think you're mistaking me for someone else.<eos> No.<eos> You asked me to draw a picture of my family.<eos> You thought my dad's badge was his heart, remember?<eos> No. I don't.
- Well, I'm sorry that...<eos> - This McAllister is such a lowlife.<eos> All he does is mop up after Karsten's mess.<eos> His hands are so dirty, it's only a matter of time before he ends up behind bars, a real scumbag.<eos> Well I'm tired, Drew.<eos> I'm heading to bed.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you wanted to hear about the case.<eos> I did. I do... I'm just exhausted.<eos> Hey, you ever find your phone?<eos> No, I didn't.
You know, there were times when I wondered what I was doing in Atlantis.<eos> I almost didn't stay.<eos> It's been lonely.<eos> How could you be lonely?<eos> I didn't know. I'm sorry.<eos> Don't be, it's in the past.<eos> I feel like at last I might have found a home.<eos> Thank you, Hercules.<eos> Well, not thank you, but you know what I mean.<eos> Yes, I do.
What does she have that you don't?<eos> I hit someone at school. I asked her not to tell you that.<eos> What?<eos> Who did you hit?<eos> Is he richer than us?<eos> You don't want to know why I hit him?<eos> Should that come first?<eos> Father must know already.<eos> He called me.<eos> Of course he does.
Our lives are pitiful.<eos> I'm heading out.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Come with me.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> - Why didn't you answer your phone?<eos> - Can't you see that I'm working?<eos> You went to Young Do's hotel?<eos> Rachel!<eos> You did?
Bit of a bully.<eos> Alex made the mistake of trying to take Nina's cupcake, and she shoved it in his face.<eos> So Nina was a tough one?<eos> She still is.<eos> According to the doctors, she should have been dead months ago.<eos> She's a fighter.<eos> You did a wonderful job raising her, Burton.<eos> I would have liked to have been a part of it.<eos> But I'm glad she had you.<eos> She still does.
Never lost faith that you could pull it off.<eos> See you when you get back.<eos> Looks like Aunt Leslie has the flu.<eos> So, we won't be taking that trip, after all.<eos> - Really? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> But I'll make it up to you with some ice cream.<eos> Come on.<eos> Then we'll go to the park, and then to the library!<eos> They've been up there all day.<eos> - So, did you...
When exactly did you first learn that Mr. Braga was your husband, Arthur Campbell's son?<eos> June 9th in Arthur's hotel suite.<eos> That's when he told me he had a son named Teo.<eos> According to a mission report dated June the 12th, a CIA black Ops team raided the A.L.C. stronghold where Mr. Braga was located.<eos> At that time, did you give operative Walker approval to use extraordinary measures against him?<eos> Did you sanction Annie Walker and a CIA black Ops team to torture Teo Braga with full knowledge that he was your husband's son?<eos> Yes or no, Mrs. Campbell?<eos> Yes.<eos> And did your husband know that you gave these orders?<eos> No, he didn't.

You must watch that a lot.<eos> Did you watch it with your daddy last night? Yeah.<eos> He fell asleep.<eos> He was tired.<eos> Well, after your dad went to sleep, did you happen to see or hear anything outside?<eos> I saw the Christmas tree lights go off downtown.<eos> Well, you know, you got to stay up pretty late.<eos> Do you think maybe you happened to see anything else?<eos> I saw a reindeer.<eos> I did, too, right outside there.
That guy can land on my full moon.<eos> Or is it the thoughtful, well-groomed type like this gentleman?<eos> That's my type...<eos> I guess.<eos> Jungle trap!<eos> Jungle trap!<eos> A jungle trap!<eos> No, anybody who picked this gentleman has to put $5 in the gay jar.<eos> - Pay up.<eos> - Ohh. - She did. Her.
Survival of the fittest.<eos> No, not him.<eos> Him.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Oh, hello.<eos> Cover me, ladies.<eos> I'm going in. Crk!<eos> I'll lay down that cover, over.<eos> - Crk, let's do this.<eos> - How you doing?
It'll only go from the receiver to the TV.<eos> He can't use it for anything else.<eos> (sighs) This was his greatest invention, a snowboard with wheels on it.<eos> For sidewalks.<eos> Hi-ya. Okay, you got rid of Jeff's stuff.<eos> First step done.<eos> Next step, get you new man.<eos> I appreciate that, Mah Mah, but it's just not that easy.<eos> Oh, it not easy?<eos> 'Cause it already done.
Mike, you have an apartment number for our victim?<eos> I think it's that one.<eos> And how do you know that, Detective Beck?<eos> Because that's where Brenda's husband is standing.<eos> Never good to find an FBI agent at your crime scene.<eos> When the LAPD searched Keller's fingerprints on AFIS, we were notified.<eos> Why would the FBI be notified unless our victim was involved in an FBI investigation?<eos> - He was.<eos> And did you say "victim"?<eos> - He did.
But, uh, you know, just keep coming back, okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll do that.<eos> Sorry I didn't make your meeting tonight.<eos> - I went to G.A.<eos> - I get it, babe.<eos> You were missed.<eos> Um, do you remember how it came up with Lena that I worked at SVU?<eos> I don't, no.
I don't think he's here, Your Majesty.<eos> I don't think anyone's here, darling.<eos> Not Jafar, not the guards, and more importantly, the genie.<eos> Now this has got me quite curious.<eos> If only someone could tell me where they went.<eos> I may be Jafar's prisoner, but I'm not yours.<eos> You will get no answers from me.<eos> Oh, now, no need to be rude.<eos> We don't even know one another.<eos> Yes, now we do.
- That's not the point!<eos> You and I are friends.<eos> If she doesn't like me...<eos> It's because of the kiss. That?<eos> That was nothing!<eos> So, you had a crush on me for, like, two seconds.<eos> And why would you ever tell her that you kissed me?<eos> Well, I said there was a kiss, that lips met lips.<eos> Whose lips lunged first, I cannot say.<eos> But you did.
I don't know.<eos> Call him. Maybe he just went around the corner to take a leak or something.<eos> Maybe he's still close by.<eos> Hoffman.<eos> We missed our chance.<eos> Now what?<eos> Ah, Ellen, I was just about to come to your office.<eos> I thought I'd save you a trip.<eos> Did you get a chance to analyze that sample I gave you?<eos> I, I did.
In fact, the only person who doesn't think it's proper is Vod!<eos> You don't know what goes on between two people in private.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> I translated it all.<eos> I know more about your relationship than you do.<eos> You don't even know him.<eos> Oh, my God, can you hear yourself?<eos> I'm sorry. I'm not a UN interpreter, I'm your friend.<eos> And as your friend, I'm telling you, you don't love Javier.<eos> You never did.
That you're Tan's mother.<eos> Tan is so good looking.<eos> He's tall and has a refreshing personality.<eos> You must know Tan well.<eos> Just...<eos> My Eun Sang talks about Tan everyday.<eos> Is it because I've heard so much? I feel like I've seen him.<eos> Should I say, if I had a daughter, I would want for him to be my son-in-law.<eos> You have a daughter, don't you?<eos> Of course, I do.
Us girls were talking and we figured that since all of us obviously want to play the Virgin Mary in the nativity scene, we should all audition together.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Okay.<eos> I was just trying to be nice.<eos> I have a very low tolerance for nice.<eos> I may seem really cool and loving for a week or two, but then my body rejects it like a virus and I move back into my natural state of cruel, selfish insensitivity.<eos> The fact is, that between lady-man and his junk flapping around on stage, you probably passing out at some point during the audition, and the basic truth that there is no way they're going to let a Chinese girl play Mary.<eos> I think Tina's Korean.<eos> I would get that part hands down if I wanted it.<eos> But I don't.
- That's it.<eos> - Yep.<eos> Thanks, Will.<eos> Shocker.<eos> The virgin Marley gets to play the Virgin Mary.<eos> Aren't you worried about typecasting?<eos> What's with the snark?<eos> I asked you to audition, and you said...<eos> I didn't want it.<eos> You obviously do.
- Santa Claus?<eos> Santa Claus?<eos> Also otherwise known as Marine Captain Louis Boggs.<eos> Guy's played Santa Claus at military base parties for years.<eos> Recently returned from a special operation in the Congo.<eos> The Congo?<eos> And he's the only person who's been to every military holiday party in the last few weeks.<eos> Which means he's come in contact with nearly every kid at every party.<eos> What we don't know is how he came in contact with Grunfeld.<eos> Yes, we do.
Darren Stevens asked me out and I turned him down because he is mean and has terrible halitosis.<eos> So instead of just letting it lie, he told the entire basketball team I had an orgy with him and his brother.<eos> Why would he spread a rumor about having sex - with his brother? - Right?<eos> - And I'm the one that looks bad?<eos> - Screw him.<eos> But that's what I'm trying to avoid.<eos> Not literally.<eos> Bad joke... like my life.<eos> I don't have any friends to vouch for me.<eos> Well, now you do.
- Oh, these. - Yeah.<eos> I-I was out by the water when... an elderly R-Rastafarian hang glider... he-he crash onto a beached squid, which squirted ink when I ran in to help.<eos> You really expect me to believe that?<eos> Story checks out.<eos> Sorry, Claude.<eos> De rien.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> We were bonding.<eos> I can't think of anything I did wrong!<eos> Okay, I did a few things wrong.
Lieutenant? Is that our paperwork?<eos> Thank you, Buzz.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Yeah. Eric Riley preyed on the girls in his class.<eos> In school, he was a regular Prince Charming.<eos> Then he'd get them alone and drug them with Ambien.<eos> Six times he took advantage of girls like that.<eos> Did you have any interactions with Mr. Riley after his parole?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
Father... you never treated me like a daughter.<eos> You treated me like an obligation, like a part of your life you had no choice but to tolerate.<eos> Like that creaky stuff in the hall that you never could fix.<eos> You just walked by it every day, wondering why it wouldn't stop making the noise, wishing it would just... go away.<eos> How do you intend to make that up to me?<eos> Alice... put yourself in my shoes.<eos> The things you were saying, they... they were impossible to believe.<eos> Impossible for you to believe.<eos> - I believe you now. -<eos> - Of course you do.
My parents know that I got pregnant.<eos> Boyd shouldn't have run out on his responsibilities.<eos> I mean, now is not the time to ship out on a fishing boat for three months.<eos> Well, he's been talking about that for a long time.<eos> I know.<eos> He has no idea how hard the work's gonna be.<eos> Well, I don't blame him...<eos> Mr. Norton, and I certainly don't blame you.<eos> I appreciate that, Morgan.<eos> Really, I do.
Killing the President?<eos> It didn't start there.<eos> - I don't care where it started.<eos> - I made a deal.<eos> Kill a bad man to save a good woman.<eos> Right or wrong, I was willing to live with it.<eos> And what about me?<eos> Did you ever wonder if I would be okay with that?<eos> I want to live.<eos> I do.
Are you communicating with the machine?<eos> I understand why you want to quit, Harold. But now is not the time.<eos> She wants us to work together.<eos> I knew you were holding out on me.<eos> Must you do that?<eos> So we have another number.<eos> - I haven't decided.<eos> - Decided?<eos> I didn't think you got to decide.<eos> Actually, I do.
What does that mean?<eos> Oh, we are happy for you.<eos> And, um, this is your comment from two days ago?<eos> "Zayeed is a terrorist "trained in Pakistan and sent to America undercover.<eos> Lotion my feet."?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's me.<eos> And how did you know this about Zayeed?<eos> How did I know it?<eos> I didn't.
No, the offer fell through once people learned of our... relationship.<eos> Mary, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry that my... my past has come back.<eos> But know that it is in the past.<eos> What I feel for Olivia now is a sense of responsibility.<eos> She would've known what she was entering into.<eos> We've been engaged since you were a child.<eos> Obviously you couldn't offer marriage.<eos> Which is... n... not to say that I don't understand why you want to help her.<eos> Of... of course, I do.
Where did you get the necklace?<eos> Is it true?<eos> Are you having an affair with the king?<eos> It's not an affair; it's more.<eos> He's in Paris breaking off with Diane.<eos> And what of his wife?<eos> Their marriage is nothing more than a political alliance... she doesn't care.<eos> So says the man who's trying to bed you.<eos> Since when do you care about the queen?<eos> I don't.
Is it true we have a son?<eos> I would have told you when you first awoke but we've had fleeting moments of precious time.<eos> We made a covenant when we married.<eos> You owe me the truth.<eos> His name.<eos> Jeremy.<eos> Our son's name was Jeremy.<eos> After your grandfather.<eos> I did not know I was with child when I buried you in that cave.<eos> Fortunately, neither did my coven.
Yeah, Vic got bit by a snake.<eos> I broke up with Jules.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, we get along really well.<eos> But she's older, more experienced.<eos> And I just don't know if I trust it.<eos> How do I know she's not gonna break my heart?<eos> You don't.<eos> But you never do.
Really together, in a way that I never was with Elaine and you never were with Drew.<eos> And whatever comes, whatever challenges, we'll face them together.<eos> Well, that's what I want.<eos> I hope we can do that.<eos> We can.<eos> I promise...that I will never shut you out again.<eos> And I will never hide anything or have any secrets.<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Who was the top joint school athletics sprinter?<eos> Wasn't I the winner?<eos> You've gone too far.<eos> How about cookery and needlework?<eos> What happened?<eos> Didn't Father say, everyone is half good and half bad. I just lost my footing and fell into the wrong path.<eos> You should look it up in the dictionary: There are no half measures for good or bad.<eos> Class Monitor Lui is forever a monitor.<eos> Of course. So, what happened?<eos> Who did that?
Can you go get it for me?<eos> I will get it, but are you okay?<eos> Do you think I'm weird too?<eos> That's what you think, huh.<eos> Why does everyone in this school assume what others think?<eos> You were all raised wrong.<eos> None of you know how to even apologize.<eos> I will call you when I find it.<eos> - You have my number?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
It's getting colder everyday, and I know that you have no place to go.<eos> Didn't you think that it'd be difficult for me to see your mom?<eos> Would I stay warm at night after kicking you out? Or would I comfortably eat the food your mom makes me?<eos> Were you testing me for that or what?<eos> Look how bad your skin got.<eos> You know that Tan left home right? - I'm sorry.<eos> - It wasn't your fault.<eos> Anyway, where is he right now?<eos> Did he come to see you?<eos> He did, didn't he!
I see.<eos> Uh, did you, uh, witness the Lockhart-Gardner retainer agreement?<eos> Come on, Your Honor.<eos> This isn't about our retainer agreement.<eos> This is about a will.<eos> Is that an objection?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Objection.<eos> Uh, Counselor, do you have a counterargument?<eos> Yes, I do.
Nothing further, Your Honor.<eos> Just a few questions.<eos> Mr. Hayden, one thing.<eos> What do they have?<eos> Something from the weekend we were out there with Ashbaugh.<eos> What did your husband have written over his desk?<eos> What?<eos> Your husband had a motto written over his desk.<eos> Do you recall what this motto said?<eos> And if so, did your husband...
That was the resort.<eos> It turns out our cabin's still available.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really.<eos> Now if Holly's gonna bail, why shouldn't we?<eos> Stuart wants to know where the pepper mi... what's goin' on?<eos> Nothing's going on.<eos> You want out of here, don't you?<eos> - What makes you think that?<eos> - Because I do too.
Uh, like the tension has moved out of your back and into my pants.<eos> I'm sure this is wildly inappropriate, but I'm very attracted to you.<eos> Well, I'm-I'm flattered.<eos> Uh-uh, it's just that...<eos> I'm dating your ex-husband.<eos> Boy, that was a weird thing to hear yourself say.<eos> I understand.<eos> Let me know if you change your mind.<eos> You do realize your hand is still on my ass.<eos> I do.
It's like... roses.<eos> Do you really want a marriage where you have this paranoia that Robin's hiding around every corner, planning to get you back with some crazy new prank?<eos> You're absolutely right.<eos> Thank you, Lily.<eos> that was me, over here.<eos> He wasn't listening.<eos> If you guys are saying what I think you're saying...<eos> Probably not. Go on.<eos> ...then that must mean...<eos> No, it doesn't.
Foaming eyes. Monsieur, you have received a message.<eos> "Dinner is ruined.<eos> If I am dead when you get here, know I died defending it."<eos> Uh-oh, sounds like the missus is angry.<eos> Yeah, you know what? They should save their drama for the soaps they watch.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Amen! You're a monster.<eos> Guys, Gordon and I have to go use the restroom.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yeah, you do. Yeah, I do.
The things they can do nowadays.<eos> I've got you an especially big one because you're going to do my toenails.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I've got Laura on mine.<eos> What've you got?<eos> Lovely.<eos> Lee!<eos> Oh, no! Not you two!<eos> We heard you were back. Yes.<eos> They did a bit on Crimewatch.
Help yourself to whisky.<eos> Have you seen those Dyson ones?<eos> We're going to get one in our new house.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Have some whisky.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> It's my wedding day. Have a drink with me.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I know you didn't drink last night.<eos> Yes, I did.
Please don't haunt us.<eos> Now, let's hit the road and get some freaking cheese steaks!<eos> Max, please take that down.<eos> It's so embarrassing.<eos> Nobody here knows anything about me.<eos> They didn't know me either, chicken.<eos> Hey, who you callin' chicken? Me.<eos> That was Antonia's nickname for me.<eos> - You know who I am?<eos> - Of course I do.
- So.<eos> - So.<eos> The study.<eos> Well, now with Jordan gone, I can confide in you that I think to write this story, I'm going to need to experience your methodology firsthand.<eos> So you want to be hooked up to the machine?<eos> Because that is firsthand.<eos> And feel free to use your second hand if needed.<eos> When I did a story on Tibetan monks, I spent a month in a monastery.<eos> When I did a story on kayaking, I went down the Colorado River.<eos> When I did a story on gang violence in South Central LA,
They abandoned us.<eos> Yeah, they did.<eos> We had lousy parents, we became lousy parents, and now we have lousy kids. - Froyo?<eos> - Always.<eos> Hidden Hills mall parking lot.<eos> You done cleaning up the Weavers' flood?<eos> No, we just realized there was someplace more important that we needed to be.<eos> We're so sorry, Jackie.<eos> It's just that when you have the world's most capable daughter, it's easy to forget that she needs you, too.<eos> Well, she does.
Well, it's been three minutes. Looks like Liz isn't gonna show.<eos> I guess we should call it a night.<eos> Wait.<eos> It's okay if Liz doesn't come.<eos> You know what's crazy?<eos> My place is only two blocks from here.<eos> Maybe we should go there and make love.<eos> What?<eos> You know you want to.<eos> No, I don't.
Wait.<eos> It's okay if Liz doesn't come.<eos> You know what's crazy?<eos> My place is only two blocks from here.<eos> Maybe we should go there and make love.<eos> What?<eos> You know you want to.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I think you do.<eos> I really don't.
What about the tickets to Pechanga?<eos> And the limo.<eos> I don't gamble.<eos> - You couldn't pay me to go to Pechanga.<eos> - I'll go to Pechanga.<eos> Alright, fine.<eos> They'll just go to waste. I'm out $300.<eos> Nobody cares about that.<eos> Checking in.<eos> How you doing?
What indeed? !<eos> Hey, Lao Zing!<eos> Can a brother get another eggnog over here?<eos> Everybody get eggnog but me?<eos> So, listen, last week when I was giving myself an examination, I found a lump. But it turns out it was a butterscotch<eos> But it made me realize that I had to start thinking about who is inheriting what.<eos> Lake house, lake house, lake house.<eos> Nathan, I'm thinking that Janice should have my mother's ruby ring.<eos> Hey, I have fingers.<eos> And so does Adam, sweetheart.
According to what you wrote, you deserve a medal.<eos> You kids studied together and taught other kids.<eos> Look up at me.<eos> Jin-woo.<eos> Yes.<eos> Do we look like bad guys?<eos> No, sir.<eos> What do you believe in, Jin-woo?<eos> Believe? I don't...<eos> - I don't...
Well, hump me with your PowerPoint.<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> I will.<eos> I will hump you with my PowerPoint.<eos> 'You have no new messages.<eos> 'Press one to return to the menu.'<eos> Should we?<eos> Er, yeah.<eos> I mean, I want to. Do I?<eos> No, I do!
Hey.<eos> Glad you came.<eos> Are you comfortable?<eos> What?<eos> Are you comfortable?<eos> No!<eos> Hold on tight.<eos> Hey, there she is!<eos> Where do we land?<eos> We don't!
Yes?<eos> It seems like you don't know my class policies because you've been absent a lot.<eos> When you write essays in my class, you cannot copy-and-paste or mashing up things, ever.<eos> But you did them all.<eos> Noona, even a ghost won't know this.<eos> We copied and put it together from so many different sources.<eos> It's done by an expert.<eos> He won't know. He will never find out.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I didn't do that.
I will bite you back!<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> You sandbagged me.<eos> He chairs the Psychology Department.<eos> Good for him.<eos> Well, I just thought he'd be a bit more qualified to... to deal with your circumstance. What's my circumstance?<eos> He was my grandson.<eos> I lost him, too.<eos> None of us know how to help you.<eos> Well, neither do I.
- Egg and..<eos> - Bacon.<eos> Oh, it was gammon!<eos> Can I just say, I think Goredale are awful.<eos> Yeah, they are bastards.<eos> That's why I've washed my hands of them.<eos> You know what I say?<eos> I always say, "What doth it profit a man if he gain the whole world yet lose his soul?"<eos> And people seem to like that.<eos> They really do.
We like it, because it's really the dralon.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Because we know you like dralon because you're from Birmingham.<eos> And we know that you like the peacock and cheetah blend which gives an African and yet Birmingham flavour.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I've put it in my car and we know it fits.<eos> We know it fits, and mine.<eos> It fits in both our cars.<eos> Does it?<eos> Yes, it does.
Yes.<eos> Precisely into your car?<eos> It's snug.<eos> Snug.<eos> Anyway, Hammond.<eos> There are plenty of people here who can help you.<eos> Good. Let's pop it in the back of my car.<eos> OK, now, maybe I could...<eos> I think he's started to dye his hair.<eos> Do you?
I only wish it was under better circumstances.<eos> I want to offer my sincere condolences to the White family on behalf of ZephCo.<eos> Mr. Scat, it doesn't seem like the death of an innocent teenager has affected you.<eos> If you're asking me to acknowledge the fact that through this ad campaign people will literally kill themselves to get their hands on what I'm selling... then yes.<eos> Look, as far as I'm concerned, this is one of the most successful ad campaigns of all time.<eos> It will certainly go down in history as one of the most daring.<eos> I know who Damien White is-- or who he was.<eos> Because I fell in love with the dream too.<eos> But I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after an enigma.<eos> And neither did Damien.
I can't be a part of this.<eos> Then what can you be a part of?<eos> No!<eos> Zod!<eos> No! No!<eos> [SHACKLES CLANKING]<eos> [GRUNTING]<eos> Your father acquitted himself with honor, Kal.<eos> You killed him?<eos> I did.
You get what you wanted?<eos> I might get erased tomorrow.<eos> What do you think I'm gonna do?<eos> You're freaking her out, if you haven't noticed.<eos> I'm not from a time of sensitivities and emotionalism.<eos> And yes, in my day, I bought my love by the hour.<eos> But I do know that what you're doing is not helping.<eos> It's called haunting, hoss. You're causing her pain.<eos> Why do you think we're here?<eos> Why we do what we do?
I'm in therapy now and on imipramine for depression.<eos> I'm just curious. How do you think the killer felt?<eos> They liked it.<eos> Happy.<eos> It was a thrill kill.<eos> How about you, Jason?<eos> Did you know the three boys?<eos> No, sir.<eos> - Do you believe in God?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Are you sure you want to do that, boss?<eos> I mean, we have got a lot on our plate right now.<eos> We got that big insurance fraud case.<eos> This just isn't the best time to be working for a 'cause.<eos> You know how I feel about these death penalty cases.<eos> It's the least I can do.<eos> I know, but this crime is unthinkable.<eos> What if they did it?<eos> Have you thought of that?<eos> And what if they didn't?
Absolutely yes, I do.<eos> You don't dress like that when you...<eos> - Pam, what are you holding?<eos> - Oh, this? Um, this is part of Stevie's Boy Scout uniform. I got it back yesterday, and I've been wearing it on my head, like that.<eos> Did he like scouting?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> He loved it.<eos> He loved it. He did.<eos> He'd be so excited when he'd be having a day that he'd go to Boy Scout meetings.<eos> Yeah, he did.
You're with us now!<eos> I'll come home soon, Dad.<eos> I promise.<eos> Come on, MK, we gotta go.<eos> You think he's okay?<eos> Yeah, he'll be fine, their heads are like rocks.<eos> Smart rocks.<eos> That's a whole lot of ugly.<eos> It smells like something died in here.<eos> Something did.
-I need you to pull over, so we can talk about this.<eos> No, god damn it, tell me now. What is happening?<eos> - Is my sister in danger?<eos> - Mommy?<eos> Where are we'?<eos> I love you, John.<eos> I do.<eos> They knew my wife and kid's name.<eos> What if they know about Jason?<eos> - They don't.
He ran a security check on me. Well...<eos> Yeah, when you sail on a boat fit for a Bond villain, sometimes you need to play the part.<eos> I think it's time you both get the fuck off my boat. What do you say?<eos> You know, Jordan, I'll tell you something. Most of the Wall Street jackasses that I bust, they're to the manor born.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Their fathers are douchebags, just like their fathers before them.<eos> But you...<eos> You, Jordan, you got this way all on your own.<eos> Did I?
Thank you. thank you.<eos> I knew you cooked it.<eos> I was just, uh...<eos> Oh, shut up.<eos> So, Luke, you find a girlfriend yet?<eos> That's not funny, Brad.<eos> He's been home all day.<eos> I found a girl.<eos> What?<eos> You did?
I knew you cooked it.<eos> I was just, uh...<eos> Oh, shut up.<eos> So, Luke, you find a girlfriend yet?<eos> That's not funny, Brad.<eos> He's been home all day.<eos> I found a girl.<eos> What?<eos> You did?<eos> He did?
I'm sorry it took so long for me to catch up.<eos> I just got stuck.<eos> Pat.<eos> I wrote that a week ago.<eos> - You wrote that a week ago?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> You let me lie to you for a week?<eos> I was trying to be romantic.<eos> You love me?<eos> Yeah, I do.
What did I ask you?<eos> - What did I ask you?<eos> - Calm yourself.<eos> I've been let down.<eos> I'm finishing this before we come over.<eos> I told you how important it was.<eos> We're all sitting there at home waiting for you and now we've had to take a bloody cab.<eos> What's that got to do with me?<eos> I told you I wanted you to take us.<eos> - No, you didn't.
Sometimes you find a flower you can help to bloom.<eos> - Maybe you're one of those flowers.<eos> - Yeah, poison ivy.<eos> What made you come in?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> To see how it felt, I suppose.<eos> And how does it feel?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> # If you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world<eos> # And if you did
No.<eos> Report to the new Quartermaster for your documentation.<eos> He hasn't set up shop yet, but Tanner will put you two together.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Thank you.<eos> 007.<eos> You are ready for this?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I didn't know Bond passed the tests.<eos> He didn't.
- No.<eos> Chinese poker.<eos> I haven't been doing very good lately. Oh, come on.<eos> You're just having a little moment. A slump.<eos> It's called a slump and it's not getting any better.<eos> And it doesn't help to have a wife who's a jinx.<eos> I deal with it as best I can.<eos> Oh, this is good, this is good.<eos> We need this field goal.<eos> Hughes did very good in the first half.

Sweetheart.<eos> We'll help you look for Sparky but when we get back, I think we need to have a little talk.<eos> Understood?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, let's go find your dog.<eos> Sparky!<eos> Sparky, are you in there?<eos> Mom, Dad!<eos> I'm going to check the school and the park.<eos> You guys do the town square, okay?
And why is it kind of hard?<eos> What are you two homos doing?<eos> Just rasslin'.<eos> All right.<eos> 'Cause you're looking at an all-state fucking wrestling champion, and I got the winner. Okay.<eos> Well, he won.<eos> No, I didn't. Yeah, you did.<eos> You won.<eos> What?<eos> No, I didn't.
Maybe he could help us.<eos> He can't help us, Daryl.<eos> He's helping them.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means he's helping them.<eos> You saw him, he just stood there and watched.<eos> What else was he supposed to do?<eos> Our dad made a choice.<eos> And Daryl's dad's got to make one, too.<eos> We all do.
- Your Majesty.<eos> - I am king!<eos> Bernstorff... you are relieved of your duties.<eos> And I declare... I declare the entire Council dissolved!<eos> On my order government of all of the country's affairs is taken over by a cabinet consisting of me and Johann Friedrich Struensee.<eos> Goodbye, pissants.<eos> - I did it. I did it!<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Did you see me, Struensee?<eos> - Yes, I did.
You think we just pray or what?<eos> They've studied and we talk about everything.<eos> By the way, Murad has been in Pakistan with Osama Bin Laden.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> - What about these pajamas?<eos> I get respect.<eos> You think the cops bother me anymore?<eos> They don't.<eos> - Does it pay?<eos> No, it doesn't.
Oh, boy.<eos> It's the fucking Wild West, you know?<eos> - Is it?<eos> - Come on.<eos> Single guys like us, I mean, we gotta grab this thing, you know?<eos> Because it is a different world now.<eos> It's a different world.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - We gotta... You know?<eos> No, I don't. I don't...
- Is it?<eos> - Come on.<eos> Single guys like us, I mean, we gotta grab this thing, you know?<eos> Because it is a different world now.<eos> It's a different world.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - We gotta... You know?<eos> No, I don't. I don't...<eos> - I don't...<eos> - You don't?
I've found the power key, so let's just go.<eos> Hurmh ?<eos> The time machine!<eos> Aarrgh... Hey, I didn't take that.<eos> Now, we'll never get home.<eos> Jules, it'll be okay.<eos> Don't!<eos> This is all your fault.<eos> I miss mom, but you don't.<eos> Do you, Ernie?
Seven years I've waited hoping that you wouldn't come back.<eos> Every year, I took a holiday. I went to Florence's cafe on the banks of the Arno.<eos> Every fine evening, I'll sit there and ordered a Fernet Branca.<eos> I had this fantasy..<eos> that I would look across the tables ... and I'll see you there With a wife maybe a couple of kids.<eos> You won't say anything to me, nor me to you.<eos> But we both know that you made it, that you were happy.<eos> I never wanted you to come back to Gotham.<eos> I always know that there was nothing else here for you except pain and tragedy and I wanted something more for you than that.<eos> I still do.
Cusimano.<eos> Hey, Dad. Here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hello.<eos> Billy Cusimano?<eos> My name's Ben Shepard, from the Albany Sun Times.<eos> I wanted to ask you a few questions about the Sharon Solarz arrest.<eos> You can, but why would I comment about that?<eos> Well, you know her, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.
- Travis.<eos> - Went to Rekall for his bachelor party.<eos> Wanted to be king of Mars or some shit.<eos> I'd like to go to Mars.<eos> Got himself lobotomized.<eos> Any available biometric tech, please report to the...<eos> - You believe those stories? -...central office...<eos> - About Rekall?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You work on the production line.<eos> In activation, yeah.<eos> I understand you live in The Colony.<eos> Yeah, I make the commute like everyone else.<eos> Sorry, who are you? If you don't mind my asking.<eos> - I'm with the Cohaagen administration.<eos> - I see.<eos> Given these politically charged times, there is a heightened concern regarding the, shall we say, loyalty of our workers.<eos> - Yeah, but I don't work for you.<eos> - But you do.
- Which is why it would mean nothing if we were to kill her.<eos> It's you who has to choose reality.<eos> You shoot her, Doug, and I promise you, you will gasp awake and find me sitting in the room beside you.<eos> The real me.<eos> - No.<eos> - Your old pal, Harry.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Turn, and you'll see your beautiful, loving wife.<eos> She wants you back, Doug.<eos> We both do.
The previous revision, allowing for two Victors from the same district, has been revoked.<eos> Only one Victor may be crowned.<eos> Good luck.<eos> And may the odds be ever in your favor.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> One of us should go home.<eos> One of us has to die.<eos> They have to have their Victor.<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
Dreams, dreams Of when we had just started things Dreams of me and you<eos> Nice.<eos> It seems, it seems That I can't shake those memories I wonder if you feel the same way too<eos> Girl, I do
-How do you know that?<eos> -Beth.<eos> Yeah, we go to a lot of baby showers.<eos> I put a lot of babies in the ladies.<eos> -How's Celeste?<eos> -Who?<eos> -Celeste. -She's all right.<eos> I'm kind of fine-tuning her cannabis levels right now, but she's okay.<eos> -She doesn't smoke weed.<eos> -She does now.
I feel really good, actually.<eos> So shut up, then.<eos> -What are we doing now?<eos> -Don't try to control everything.<eos> You need to let go.<eos> In yoga, we call it vairagya.<eos> Don't with the yoga.<eos> -Yo. -What's up.<eos> -What's going on?<eos> -How you doing?
And now I'm gonna be alone like you.<eos> Okay, you don't know what you're saying right now. lt's okay.<eos> Are you crying about sports?<eos> Just reminds me of someone.<eos> is this about a girl?<eos> -l'm not gay.<eos> -No, I know. I meant a boy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you miss him?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I don't fucking believe this!<eos> You straight up lied to me!<eos> Kyle, listen to me.<eos> You were never even coming, were you?<eos> Yes!<eos> Of course I was coming!<eos> I was coming.<eos> You don't give a fuck about me!<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Of course I do!
I spent two years deconstructing dozens of ancient languages... to their roots.<eos> I'm confident... I can communicate with them... provided your thesis is correct.<eos> "Provided it's correct." That's good.<eos> That's why they call it a thesis, doctor.<eos> What are you smiling about?<eos> Mr. Ravel, Mr. Chance, take her down.<eos> - Roger that.<eos> - Yes, captain.<eos> Descent trajectory mapped.<eos> How we doing?
I want to apologize.<eos> I think I showed you these when you first came to visit me, Daisy.<eos> But you probably don't remember.<eos> I remember.<eos> Aren't they beautiful?<eos> Can you see from over there?<eos> The highest waterfall in the world.<eos> That's on this stamp.<eos> I really don't think you can see from way over there, Daisy.<eos> I really don't.
Consumer's spending down.<eos> That's right.<eos> Besides, the Bank of China left the interest rates unchanged.<eos> This happened today?<eos> This happened tonight in Shanghai, I called the source at Shenzhen.<eos> While running?<eos> While flinging my body down Maddison Avenue, to get here on time.<eos> The yuan can't go any higher.<eos> That's true, that's right.<eos> Except it just did.
- Okay, I'm here.<eos> At the end of the day, it'll...?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - How much have you had? - Not enough to fancy you.<eos> Well, then, keep drinking.<eos> Blow.<eos> That's it, is it?<eos> You think, I think, I fancy you.<eos> No more for you.<eos> Well, I do.
Look's good.<eos> So, you guys on vacation?<eos> No.<eos> No, it's, uh nothing like that.<eos> You two ready to order?<eos> I'm too nervous to eat.<eos> I'll have a piece of apple pie and coffee.<eos> You got it.<eos> I still think about you.<eos> All the time, I do.
- No.<eos> He took it, he took it himself. - No.<eos> You poisoned him.<eos> No, he needs some water.<eos> - Move, move.<eos> - No, no, you poisoned him.<eos> - He needs some water.<eos> - You poisoned him, you poisoned him. Take it easy. Take it easy.<eos> I didn't poison him.<eos> I didn't do anything.
What happened in that room?<eos> - That's not what happened.<eos> - I saw it with my own eyes.<eos> Running out of jokes, are we?<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> I saw it with my own eyes.<eos> There's something that we need to do.<eos> - Thanks, Charlie.<eos> - Hey, buddy.<eos> How you doing?
Not bad, right?<eos> You might have put a dent in his golf swing, that's about it.<eos> I mean this one just pissed him off. He'll return fire and killed you.<eos> Verbo!<eos> Yeah, but you just got two.<eos> It's a good two but two out of how many?<eos> I'm just saying I got three out of five.<eos> Or did it ever occured to you that all my rounds went to the same 2 holes.<eos> Yeah, I don't think so.<eos> Not done.
Matt, I know this has been hard, but it's the way the system works.<eos> Look, I'll talk to Whitford about Paris, but I can't promise anything.<eos> Look, I've got to go.<eos> Don't worry, I'm looking after you, okay?<eos> Yeah, I know, I know, I know.<eos> This is not a negotiation.<eos> It's 10 million.<eos> You'll get the file, and if the money is not in the account by 3:00 PM, I'll take it to another buyer.<eos> How do we know that you won't do that anyway?<eos> You don't.
Do you want me to take one from you?<eos> You don't know what they'll do to me!<eos> I'd be more worried about what we'll do to you, man!<eos> Jesus Christ, morris!<eos> Just give this cock-nosed point break motherfucking wannabe the bag!<eos> Shut the fuck up! Yeah!<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> I don't have the key.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I do.
And I'm asking for some service.<eos> You'll get your pork sausage, Porky!<eos> Beat it!<eos> Lauren, listen, we're just too different, okay?<eos> Yes, we are different.<eos> But I think that's a good thing.<eos> What you need is status.<eos> You need titles.<eos> - I don't care about...<eos> - No, I don't.
I didn't always mind that we weren't proper siblings.<eos> Team A wins!<eos> Go to the changing rooms.<eos> Everyone ready?<eos> quick!<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> I can't find my lunch coupons.<eos> I think.<eos> Has anyone seen any lunch coupons anywhere?<eos> I did!
I can't find my lunch coupons.<eos> I think.<eos> Has anyone seen any lunch coupons anywhere?<eos> I did!<eos> They were on the bench.<eos> Next to Jung.<eos> What a coincidence.<eos> Next to Jung.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I didn't.
Has anyone seen any lunch coupons anywhere?<eos> I did!<eos> They were on the bench.<eos> Next to Jung.<eos> What a coincidence.<eos> Next to Jung.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Arnaud saw them just next to you.<eos> I didn't.
Hey, peace, man.<eos> Totally.<eos> Yeah.<eos> As you were, soldier.<eos> Sir, yes, sir!<eos> Yo, Norman.<eos> You playing hooky?<eos> No, no, I'm just late for school.<eos> Sorry, I got to go.<eos> How you doing?
Totally.<eos> Yeah.<eos> As you were, soldier.<eos> Sir, yes, sir!<eos> Yo, Norman.<eos> You playing hooky?<eos> No, no, I'm just late for school.<eos> Sorry, I got to go.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Hey, how you doing?
Better start talking, buddy.<eos> I didn't really think he was serious about going up to the old graveyard on his own.<eos> That's so Norman!<eos> Oh, man, that place is bad news.<eos> It's like a total slasher-movie vibe.<eos> Why did he go up there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe we should go look for him.<eos> I told you he was trouble.<eos> Sorry, but I did.
Yeah, it does.<eos> It doesn't work.<eos> The name has to have a "ski" at the end of it and you just put "brewski" at the end of "Martina Navratilova," so...<eos> I just thought we were saying funny names.<eos> No, it has to have a "ski" at the end of it.<eos> Otherwise, where's the challenge?<eos> If there's no "ski" at the end of the root word then we would just be idiots saying nonsense.<eos> Hey.<eos> They found the missing hikers.<eos> They did?
I could tell.<eos> There wasn't nothing behind those eyes.<eos> Like a damn barracuda.<eos> What about the guy with her?<eos> Did he say anything?<eos> - That depends. You Michael Westen? - Yeah.<eos> He said to tell you, "Helicopter tour."<eos> She was closing in...<eos> Did I mention her eyes? Yeah.<eos> Like a barracuda. You did.
- Now you're gonna dog my playlist.<eos> - It's shrilly.<eos> If by "shrilly," you mean angelic, then I agree with you.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Look who's here.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Excuse me. - Whatever you're selling, I don't want any.<eos> You Butch McCall?<eos> How you doing? Ben Wexler.
They came here to kill Elsa.<eos> Lookin' to kill Elsa?<eos> Tommy?<eos> Look at me.<eos> What happened to Joanne that was a tragic isolated incident.<eos> The wrong place, at the wrong time.<eos> This isn't the same.<eos> I mean... why would kids were lookin' to kill a baby?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But he did...
Tommy?<eos> Look at me.<eos> What happened to Joanne that was a tragic isolated incident.<eos> The wrong place, at the wrong time.<eos> This isn't the same.<eos> I mean... why would kids were lookin' to kill a baby?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But he did...<eos> He said they come lookin' for her.<eos> Who did?
They all lived within a five mile radius.<eos> What's the nearest hospital to here?<eos> Where are we?<eos> Right here.<eos> St. Cornelius, right there.<eos> St. Cornelius, good job!<eos> Mei Ling Hom.<eos> Number 452.<eos> Who'd you say she was?<eos> I didn't.
This is the true story of one of those families.<eos> ...true story...<eos> Not again.<eos> Did you... Did you set the alarm before we left?<eos> Yeah, it was the last thing I did.<eos> No, I was the last one to leave.<eos> I was the last one to leave and I'm sure I didn't set it.<eos> No, darling.<eos> I was the last one out.<eos> And I did.
That's the year we met!<eos> Yes!<eos> - On the set.<eos> - Yes!<eos> Gotta get back.<eos> We hadn't written to each other, hadn't called... Apart from the septic epistle.<eos> How did the reunion go?<eos> I didn't quite know what to expect.<eos> I didn't know...<eos> I just didn't.
He... helped them.<eos> - He tried.<eos> - He was a freaking saint.<eos> I'm just tired talking about it.<eos> I know I bring it up all the time. I'm sorry.<eos> - Ta-da!<eos> - Oh, dear Lord.<eos> You know you love it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't...
We drive really, really carefully.<eos> Okay, Spidey, I don't know if you know about super-spy missions, but the key here is the element of surprise.<eos> We must be very, very, very stealthy.<eos> There's Lara's place right up there.<eos> We had a lot of good times in that apartment.<eos> I mean, not like that.<eos> Well, like that, just not because of that.<eos> Special.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> Do you?
I mean, maybe sometimes April knows something.<eos> Everything we worked for last night is ruined.<eos> Maybe you could do an explaining rap, too.<eos> Wren?<eos> I'm E.O. wilson and I'm a scientist I study ants and stuff if you get the gist<eos> I'm about as cool as a guy can get<eos> Think Jason Bourne with a butterfly net<eos> Praying mantis Praying mantis<eos> The turtle, the turtle<eos> Don't do that
- I don't know.<eos> Now get this chunk of ice seaworthy by sundown... or I will keelhaul the lot of you!<eos> So what do you think?<eos> Two words, anger management.<eos> I'm talking about the current.<eos> Diego's right.<eos> We found the way home.<eos> Yeah, that's great.<eos> Too bad we don't have a ship.<eos> Sure we do.
What if he comes back?<eos> Who?<eos> The boogeyman.<eos> -How's it going?<eos> -What's up?<eos> You look good.<eos> Rubén told me you're reformed.<eos> They're looking for you.<eos> Did he tell you that?<eos> Yeah, he did.
- Yeah, I'll be there in a second.<eos> I got some of that Harlan Diehl footage on a flash drive for you.<eos> I forgot.<eos> Oh nice.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Hey, Quinn, do you, um... do you think you could put a word in for me - down at the station?<eos> - The station?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You don't want to work there, man.<eos> - Oh yeah yeah, I do.
No, no, no, there's been a mistake.<eos> There's been a mistake.<eos> This is my mother's car.<eos> Okay?<eos> And she lent it to me to go visit my father.<eos> So it's not stolen.<eos> Right.<eos> That's wrong.<eos> I thought your father died?<eos> No, he did.
Ralph!<eos> Uh, Eugenia.<eos> You got a minute for the Bousche?<eos> It's Imogene.<eos> Listen, I've been meaning to talk to you because I'm worried.<eos> You shouldn't be mad at your mother.<eos> And what exactly qualifies you to say that to me, considering I've known you for what, 40 hours?<eos> Because she's been through a very hard time.<eos> - And she loves you.<eos> - No. Of course she does.
- No. Of course she does.<eos> That's why she had me arrested for stealing her car and lied to me about my father.<eos> Sometimes information needs to be kept classified.<eos> Okay, look, no offense, but this is really between me and my family.<eos> I am part of your family now.<eos> Now, I may look a little young for the gig, but in the samurai tradition, when a man loves a woman, he automatically becomes a spiritual guardian for her offspring.<eos> So, what, you're a samurai now, too?<eos> Oh, I've been a samurai for 25 years. You didn't know that?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't. 25, wow.
There is no way I thought it would be like this.<eos> Go and help Iselin.<eos> Get her hair away from her pussy!<eos> - Is it ok?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Why did I take ten sips, then?<eos> I'll save your number if I get hungry for loser-cock, Torgrim.<eos> - Go and kiss her!<eos> Do you dare to?<eos> - Do it yourself!
- What's up, man?<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah. I'm-I'm Andrew.<eos> Okay. I'm Steve. - Steve Montgomery.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> Matt and I were just hanging out... and we found this cool little...<eos> - this thing. - Wait.<eos> You're with Matt?<eos> - You might want to get it on tape.<eos> - No, I just... I don't really...
No, you've got more chance in raising your mum.<eos> You want me to talk filthy dirty to you?<eos> No.<eos> Look, I'm done, that's it.<eos> Well, that's just great.<eos> Jenna, baby.<eos> No, I'm not a baby.<eos> I want a baby.<eos> Shame you don't.<eos> I do.
- Counsel?<eos> - Chaos, my friends.<eos> Anarchy.<eos> The very wardrobe he so disrespectfully wears in this courtroom is emblematic of the point.<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Sustained.<eos> When I was a kid, I believed in Batman and Superman.<eos> - Mr. Gold....<eos> - You know what?<eos> I still do.
- Are you happy doing this?<eos> - I'm extremely happy.<eos> Good.<eos> Grant Stone's gonna get the interim appointment as the DA.<eos> You're kidding?<eos> Grant Stone?<eos> - You're a great trial lawyer.<eos> - I'm the senior deputy.<eos> And everyone in the office thinks you're an asshole.<eos> So do the judges.
How are they related to a detective's murder?<eos> Please take a look.<eos> Notice the woman with the Minister.<eos> The nightclub hostess from the sunken car!<eos> She acted as the go-between for all of them.<eos> Get it together, guys.<eos> If this leaks, it's the administration's necks.<eos> Everything will all go down the drain!<eos> No more surprises.<eos> Do something about the Sanno.
Name ring a bell?<eos> How could you forget, Mr. Ishihara?<eos> You were an executive in his family.<eos> What are you implying?<eos> calling me a traitor?<eos> Easy, sir.<eos> Back off!<eos> You said Otomo was dead.<eos> Let me go!<eos> No, I didn't.
So when he says,<eos> Levi Cohen, Beverly Hills?<eos> You hand them the bags I take it from there.<eos> Yes?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> The eagle has landed.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> Your family loves you, man.<eos> They do.
- Yes, sir. - Take one.<eos> Spin that. - I don't know where Feldman is.<eos> I swear to God, I'm not that stupid.<eos> - Lay off the croissants, Howe.<eos> - Please, please.<eos> Come on!<eos> - I'm going to shoot your weewee.<eos> - Please, I swear to God.<eos> - Where's Feldman?<eos> - Please, I don't...
- I'm sorry.<eos> - How could you do that?<eos> Bitch!<eos> Do something to her.<eos> Don't.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Please, don't.<eos> Please...<eos> Please, don't.
Ben's been carrying everything since our dad died.<eos> I mean, he had to leave college just to take care of me.<eos> What about your mom?<eos> Maybe she could help out.<eos> Well... You know, I mean... If you can find her, let me know.<eos> Look, I want to take care of Ben.<eos> I do. But this is about my future, too.<eos> Straight A's aren't enough anymore.<eos> Not if you need a full ride.<eos> Which I do.
What're you talking about?<eos> This. Us.<eos> Sneaking around for the past three months.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> You've forbidden me from telling a soul.<eos> I mean, we don't speak at school.<eos> I like you, Billy.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just do.
Well, you didn't.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Really, I'm sorry.<eos> You know how teenage boys can be.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I actually wanted to discuss Jane and her internship.<eos> What internship?<eos> The one you authorized her to take by signing this permission form.<eos> She does a better Ben Quimby than I do.
Thermoelectric heat meters, radiation monitors, everything in the Scientific Paranormal Research Center /ab is in place to test Simon Silver, who this morning may have just canceled a number of his public appearances.<eos> This just isn't fair.<eos> We've been waiting in line for two days.<eos> Eating and sleeping here.<eos> Who's standing up for our rights?<eos> It wasn't just a show, for me.<eos> For me it was more important.<eos> And now--<eos> I don't care.<eos> Hell, I really don't.
Tom told me you'd be here.<eos> You should be doing this, not me.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Where is Tom?<eos> He's not home and he's not answering his phone.<eos> Did something happen to him?<eos> Is that SPCR?<eos> Telepathy booths.<eos> I've been watching the same images. - If you want my opinion...<eos> - Ben, I don't.
It's a codename for building the atomic bomb.<eos> And Los Alamos is the secret place where the scientists worked when they were developing it.<eos> Bitsy works as a guide at the museum.<eos> She knows everything about this place.<eos> So, we're in a secret place, where nobody can find us?<eos> Well, it's not that much of a secret anymore.<eos> Wow, look at this house!<eos> When we brought this house, we expected to raise a family here.<eos> - Didn't we, Walter?<eos> - We did.
Really? What is your kind of music?<eos> I like happy music that you can dance to.<eos> Yeah, but when you listen to a song where somebody's singing about something depressing,<eos> - don't you relate to it?<eos> - No.<eos> It makes you feel the same as they...<eos> It makes you feel you're a part of the human race.<eos> I don't feel like that.<eos> I like Lady Gaga.<eos> Oh, God, of course you do.
You're on the computer too much as it is.<eos> You need to get outside more, do some playing outside.<eos> Yeah, you could build things.<eos> You could build a fort outside. - What?<eos> - Yeah, build a fort.<eos> Play with your friends and have...<eos> Make a fort?<eos> Outside?<eos> And do what?<eos> Do what in the fort?
Let me give you a hug.<eos> Fantastic, congratulations.<eos> It's wonderful. I'm so happy for you.<eos> This is too adult for you.<eos> Let's go outside.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Well, I guess we're stuck together then forever then, right?<eos> Weren't we always?<eos> You didn't even want a baby.<eos> Of course I do.
Maybe.<eos> Well, you should probably get back, huh?<eos> If you're worried your friends are gonna leave....<eos> You asked for my opinion.<eos> No, I was just gonna say you could catch a ride home with me.<eos> Well....<eos> Yeah, those whores won't leave without me.<eos> They're probably hooking up with somebody.<eos> I would have to go and unhook them, and I don't feel like doing that.<eos> -Then don't. -All right.
You spilled it.<eos> You....<eos> I don't even know.<eos> What was the question again?<eos> Can I go to the movies, or are we gonna punish me for being responsible?<eos> Really?<eos> You may go.<eos> Good.<eos> It was a good talk.<eos> How you doing?
- Nope.<eos> I'll take a water.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Boxes.<eos> - Was planning on Virginia.<eos> Looks like I'm not going anymore.<eos> What?<eos> You waiting on me to say something?<eos> - I told you not to take the toll.<eos> - Yeah, you did.
Well, as far as I know... there's nothing wrong with Trattman's hearing or his nose or anything.<eos> No, nothing I've heard about, anyways.<eos> So where do we go from here?<eos> What do you think?<eos> It could have been Trattman.<eos> He coulda decided to do it again. No one'd ever think he's dumb enough to do it twice.<eos> But I know Markie. He's not that dumb.<eos> So I figured some other smart guys knew he did it before.<eos> For now, it don't matter.<eos> It doesn't?
Johnny Amato.<eos> Tomorrow night, where's he gonna be?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Frank.<eos> You got to keep in mind what I told you.<eos> Your friends are worried about you.<eos> It's your friends that want to see you get a second chance... you know what I mean?<eos> And it's your friends that wanna know where Squirrel's gonna be.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't know who the fuck you are.<eos> Very few guys do.
- Okay, we don't have to get serious...<eos> - No, serious it was good.<eos> I like serious.<eos> - You do?<eos> - With you, I do.<eos> - Sonia.<eos> - Yes, Janice.<eos> - Can I talk to you?<eos> - I do not like my job.<eos> - You do not?
- "nobody gets hurt".<eos> Collette, love.<eos> Fucking loads of them.<eos> Do you want to talk to these guys?<eos> I'll do the talking, OK?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Youse will have to let us through.<eos> Good morning. We agreed none of this would happen. - Yes, we did.<eos> - You know the law, Mr. Hughes.<eos> - Yes, I do. - Good.
Yeah.<eos> The power's back up.<eos> Put your shirt on.<eos> Go find something to do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Turn that music down!<eos> Donna.<eos> I put a shirt on, Daddy.<eos> Boy, you sure did, didn't you? Mm-hmm.
Boy, this shit's strong.<eos> What?<eos> What, you don't think I never smoked dope before?<eos> What do you think I am, a caveman?<eos> Shit.<eos> I just don't like it. It ain't good for me.<eos> I start thinking the FBI is chasing after me.<eos> My heart starts racing so fast, I'm worried it's not gonna stop till I'm dead.<eos> Hey, Jimbo, me and Carroll... we don't care that you never did see combat, just so you know.<eos> We really don't.
I don't know where they live, but I have their numbers.<eos> OK.<eos> That's OK.<eos> We could figure that out.<eos> I got the phone.<eos> Take a look.<eos> I bought you a shirt.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Do you like blue?<eos> - Yeah... I do.
I love you.<eos> It's a playhouse!<eos> It's totally awesome!<eos> It looks like our date is over.<eos> It's just beginning.<eos> Daddy's home!<eos> Hey, honey, how are you?<eos> My baby!<eos> I had a dream you would come home.<eos> You did?
I had to see you.<eos> Has something happened?<eos> I've met someone. Someone who's becoming important to me.<eos> - Soren.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You're my friend, and I thought...<eos> I don't know. I thought I should tell you.<eos> I'm glad you did.<eos> Nothing will change between us, will it?<eos> Of course it will.
Well, there you are!<eos> We start rehearsals tomorrow.<eos> You're back.<eos> I have wonderful news.<eos> I've found a way to get onto the Presidio and into the mine shaft.<eos> It is all right.<eos> Do you know me?<eos> Very well.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Not yet, but you will.
I could retrieve that memory.<eos> There is a possibility that it could explain the coma and prove our innocence.<eos> I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly subject Counsellor Troi to a potentially dangerous procedure.<eos> And I refuse to be a party to any of these proceedings.<eos> Jev is making a reasonable request.<eos> If we're to be accused, surely we're entitled to a defence?<eos> Tarmin did a memory probe on another of your crew.<eos> Has she suffered any ill effects?<eos> - No.<eos> - And neither will Counsellor Troi.
YOU'RE MAKING A SPECTACLE OF YOURSELF. YOU'VE GOT ME OUT HERE CAMPING.<eos> I'M STARVING, AND I HATE IT.<eos> GIVE ME THE CREDIT CARDS AND THE KEY.<eos> YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.<eos> THEY'RE MY CREDIT CARDS, TOO.<eos> AAH! STUPID DOG.<eos> I SHOULD HAVE HAD YOU BOTH PUT DOWN.<eos> IF I HAVE TO DRIVE MYSELF, I'M GOING HOME.<eos> NO, YOU WON'T.<eos> YES, I WILL!
Now the whole family will be against you.<eos> - The greengrocer's family ?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Against me ? - Sure.<eos> I didn't know it would be so dangerous.<eos> Judge Bernardino, Now all's well because I gave everything back.<eos> - To whom ?<eos> - The carabinieri.<eos> They said they'll give it to him.<eos> They won't.
- They're so nice. - You were great, Bob.<eos> - You really were.<eos> - You were incredible.<eos> I mean, dad choked, you saved him.<eos> It's such a big day for the whole family.<eos> And here's the one who made it happen.<eos> Dr. Leo Marvin.<eos> Dr. Leo Marvin.<eos> Get out. No, we won't get out.<eos> We won't.
- I won't.<eos> It's all right, Kevin.<eos> I don't give away my sources.<eos> It is a genuine report, isn't it?<eos> What's the circulation?<eos> Very limited, I take it.<eos> Just cabinet ministers and five senior people at Smith Square.<eos> The Deputy Chairman and four senior directors.<eos> Don't ask me anything else.<eos> No, I won't.
You do want the job, do you not?<eos> This way, Doc...<eos> You spend much time in a chronic hospital?<eos> - You would remember.<eos> - I guess not, then.<eos> We have M.S., Tourette syndrome, Parkinson's disease some of them we have not got a name for.<eos> - What are they waiting for?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - How will they get well?<eos> - They will not.
I don't need anything from you.<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> Goverment takes a pretty big hunk out of my paycheck every month.<eos> Where do you think your welfare checks are coming from, eh?<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> You want me to join your corps?<eos> Think of what our radioactiv kids will be like then.<eos> I stopped thinking about kids a long time ago.<eos> You always say that things will change.<eos> Maybe they will.

Hi, sugarpuss!<eos> Hi, sweetheart. - So? - So?<eos> So, how was your date, Lolly?<eos> Date?<eos> My ex-wife has a date?<eos> - With who?<eos> - I'm not telling you.<eos> - I'll find out.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> I will.
What's up?<eos> Sorry, I couldn't help it.<eos> Never mind. I nearly fainted.<eos> It happens to me, in church too.<eos> I needed that so bad.<eos> So did I.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> You're the man. Think of something.<eos> - Let's leave. Please!<eos> - We will...
To heel!<eos> Halt! He said he had friend in the neighbourhood<eos> Down, Lokis<eos> Did he come here?<eos> No, why?<eos> Down, Lokis.<eos> Sit down<eos> Let him have it<eos> What if he bites<eos> He won't
- He told me to fuck off?<eos> Ok, I have an idea.<eos> Everything's fine guys.<eos> Italia-Marocco.<eos> Who wins take the pipes.<eos> We go to 10.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> - how many sad players you saw wich they never won and they hung their shoes on some walls and now laugh in the pub and it's ten years they are in love with a woman they never loved -<eos> - how many have you seen?<eos> How many you will.
This main ventilation shaft leads beyond the wall.<eos> I can shut down one fan and leave this door unlocked.<eos> I'll get you the right work detail and leave tools at the shaft.<eos> This way looks faster.<eos> -No, it's longer.<eos> -Let's stick to plan A.<eos> Let's get you to the infirmary.<eos> Why your plan A?<eos> It's better than your plan B, which you don't even have.<eos> Not yet, but I will.
Because I don't think it's a choice that you'd make in a normal frame of mind.<eos> And what would you know about a normal frame of mind?<eos> That's a good question.<eos> So what do you have to do to get ready?<eos> Load a tape and turn on the camera.<eos> Do it.<eos> So, where do you get your money from for rent and tapes, stuff like that?<eos> Underneath my mattress.<eos> And what are you gonna do when this money runs out?<eos> It won't.
- Destroy it now.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Prepare to jettison the module.<eos> We can't do that. It will remain until it comes into contact with a planet or another ship. The results would be disastrous.<eos> You're saying no matter how bad I think it is, it's actually worse?<eos> - This won't hold it.<eos> - Go on.<eos> Within 30 minutes, it's going to push out of its module. It will break out of the containment area.<eos> - No. It can't break through this!<eos> - Yes, it will.
whole this time during the war ... I was longing to sit under my trellis.<eos> Did you also kill anyone?<eos> -Don't ask.<eos> Was it bad in the army?<eos> -Did you butcher?<eos> No, we saved this for you.<eos> My dear Toncka, now let's all eat together.<eos> No, that's for you.<eos> -Eat.<eos> -I won't, daddy.
What do you wanna do now?<eos> There's a party down the street.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Are you insane?<eos> You destroyed my life and now you want to go to a party?<eos> - You don't like me, do you?<eos> - I've never hit a woman before, but...<eos> - Let's make up.<eos> - That won't work.<eos> - Of course, it will.
- What geezer?<eos> - Some bald geezer.<eos> Reckons you owe him 266 quid back rent.<eos> I told him there's no question of payin' rent on a property cut with rodents.<eos> He takes exception to this. Starts comin' on really bald with me.<eos> - You mean ratty.<eos> - I told him to piss off.<eos> You bloody fool.<eos> We'll end up in court again.<eos> - No we won't.
Yes, I am. Small enough to stay in his arms.<eos> I'd cross mountains and plains in search of my loves. I'd go see the shoots in the valleys... the budding vine, the blooming pomegranate trees.<eos> We're off limits.<eos> I was thirsty.<eos> Me, too.<eos> - So hot!<eos> - Record high.<eos> is sister Thérèse very ill?<eos> Very.<eos> Will she....
The Thunder Road, I christen thee the Thunder Road,<eos> The Thunder Road!<eos> - Oh, now it breaks.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> I knew we should've put hinges on this thing.<eos> I'll take it very easy at first because something might happen and we all could be killed.<eos> Stop talking about getting killed.<eos> It's gonna be great.<eos> What if the ship falls apart?<eos> - She won't.
Fatso, can't you find out who plants leaflets with Kraft?<eos> Is it a hunt?<eos> - No.<eos> - So why do you need it?<eos> It's business.<eos> I don't know, but I may ask.<eos> I'll find you.<eos> Listen!<eos> Maybe you'll have more such spare hard tracks tomorrow?<eos> I will.
Do you suppose that all this immense electrical display... is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me?<eos> Even from a scientific standpoint... the chances against our being struck are enormous.<eos> The steel picnic knives... the only articles which might attract the current... are in the other carriage.<eos> What is to be done?<eos> How do you propose to silence him?<eos> - The driver?<eos> - My dear girl, no.<eos> Mr. George Emerson.<eos> I don't wish to judge him uncharitably... but I know he will talk.<eos> He will not.
People love me here.<eos> They say you have debts.<eos> Who?<eos> Who says that?<eos> That's a malicious lie!<eos> Do you have pupils?<eos> I don't want pupils!<eos> They get in the way. I have to have time for composition.<eos> Composition doesn't pay. You know that.<eos> That one will.
You're still missing two.<eos> A century ago, when the British made a bloody raid on this temple, a priest hid the last two stones here in the catacombs.<eos> So that's what you've got these slaves digging for?<eos> - They're innocent children.<eos> - They mine gems to support our cause.<eos> They also search for the last two stones.<eos> Soon we will have all the five Sankara stones and the Thuggees will be all-powerful.<eos> What a vivid imagination.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> You will, Dr Jones.
I'm ready.<eos> Will you tell me why you boys want that blasted carp?<eos> It's for our mother, sir.<eos> She's going to have a baby, and she's not very well.<eos> And Mr. Pak said carp blood's the only thing that'll help her.<eos> Without it, my mother will get worse or even...<eos> You wouldn't want my mother to die, would you?<eos> Oh, please, help us.<eos> Please save her.<eos> You won't?
Down there.<eos> We had better get started.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Let us try it.<eos> Christine has to come through the door.<eos> You have to get into the office and stay out of sight.<eos> Once she gets inside, hit the button and bring the door down.<eos> Then we will have her trapped.<eos> What if he does not come?<eos> Christine will.
Where are you?<eos> To be or not to be...<eos> That's not really a question.<eos> Does that woman really matter to you?<eos> Something really strange... almost taboo...<eos> A force propels me towards her...<eos> Like the tide rushing in...<eos> It also goes out.<eos> I'll help you. Will you let me?<eos> He will.
- l don't want to see you tonight.<eos> I just forgot to call you.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> I know, but you can't treat me like this any more.<eos> - l won't.<eos> - l can't always be second choice.<eos> - You're not.<eos> - l am, and you know I am.<eos> I promise it'll never happen again.<eos> Yes, it will.
You stay away from my little girl.<eos> Goddamn you, girl!<eos> Is he always like that?<eos> That was civil<eos> A couple of years back, Caught his wife in bed with another man. He killed them both.<eos> He wasn't put away?<eos> He's the judge's cousin.<eos> He's going to hurt her.<eos> No, he isn't, michael.<eos> Horace platt will.
Yes.<eos> How about some breakfast?<eos> I was just gonna make some.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Well?<eos> Leon ... .<eos> What's going on?<eos> There's only two of us now.<eos> Then we're stupid and we'll die.<eos> No, we won't.
We have no choice.<eos> Take cover! Get back!<eos> Watch out!<eos> Danger!<eos> Hold it, hold it! Where are you going?<eos> Now go back to work, come on.<eos> Those logs up there.<eos> Huerequeque, come here.<eos> How can this trunk withstand the pull of hundreds of tons?<eos> It will.
Right.<eos> -I Iove you.<eos> -I Iove you, too, sir.<eos> Aren't you coming to bed?<eos> King.<eos> I'm horny.<eos> Okay. AII right.<eos> -obviously a music lover.<eos> -I dare you to hit high C.<eos> well, I will if you will.
Morning.<eos> We seem to have... lost our train.<eos> - Two weeks.<eos> - Two weeks!<eos> Bugger it!<eos> Unless you're game enough to cross the lake.<eos> Hey, Arch, two weeks, that's not too long...<eos> - Arch, hang on!<eos> - Better take this.<eos> Hey, Archy, will ya...
- The bill.<eos> - I don`t want to leave.<eos> It`s early.<eos> - We have to go.<eos> - Let`s dance.<eos> - Better to go.<eos> Can`t we dance?<eos> I will dance alone.<eos> Somebody wants to dance with me?<eos> - I will.
So what?<eos> I'm so confused!<eos> Let's go back to the palace, the hell with the coalman!<eos> - Well, I'll go out for a drink now.<eos> - You what?<eos> - I'm going out for a drink.<eos> - Come here.<eos> - What?<eos> - You'll go take the coal to the notary's.<eos> - Alright, I will.
It's from the Manifesto.<eos> - Then abolish it!<eos> - I didn't say it.<eos> Take your clothes and abolish it.<eos> Marx meant bourgeois family.<eos> I know what Marx meant. You shut up!<eos> I'll break your neck!<eos> Let's dance.<eos> Will the sun ever shine in this town as it should?<eos> It won't, Dino. Never.
I've seen ten create a fearful momentum and you have over 100 here.<eos> With weapons.<eos> - And some really don't want to be here...<eos> - You saw the muster yesterday.<eos> - They had a chance to leave, they stayed.<eos> - 11 kids did leave.<eos> Sounds like 11 boys who weren't much good to us anyway.<eos> I don't care what happened here.<eos> I don't wanna see scared kids crawling over the wall in the middle of the night.<eos> You won't.
What? And arrange the escape of the football team.<eos> Colby's escape?<eos> All of them. The whole team.<eos> This match is a propaganda stunt for the Germans. It's a wonderful opportunity for us.<eos> But why send me? The French may have thought of all this themselves.<eos> Indeed they may, and then again, they may not.<eos> We have to get word to them somehow.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> Find out if an escape is feasible. Ask them to try it.<eos> If they won't?
Let me get at you again, wretch!<eos> You can do as you please.<eos> -I forbid you ever to come within my sight.<eos> As you like.<eos> I abandon you.<eos> Abandon me.<eos> I disown you.<eos> -Disown me.<eos> I disinherit you.<eos> As you will.
I would like a little consensual validation on this.<eos> We may have demonstrated a whole new force in nature.<eos> For God's sake, don't you agree it merits further investigation?<eos> I've got tapes, notes, everything at my place.<eos> What time would you like to come look at the stuff?<eos> Two, 2:30.<eos> I just want to get the girls.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - L'll get it, I'll get it.<eos> - No, no, I will.
- What class is it?<eos> - First, but it's been downgraded.<eos> Here.<eos> The latest scientific discovery.<eos> Not even on the market yet.<eos> - But it's poison! - No!<eos> It's not the original bottle.<eos> The hospital gets everything in bulk.<eos> - Will it cure him?<eos> - No, it won't.
Well, too bad you're my mother.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I know.<eos> Wait till you meet your dad - again.<eos> You haven't seen him for so long.<eos> I forgot what he looks like.<eos> I know, me too.<eos> I bet he looks the same - sexy and tough.<eos> I hope, anyway.<eos> Yeah, he will...
I see you are practiced in worshipping things that fly.<eos> Good.<eos> Rise before Zod.<eos> Now, kneel before Zod.<eos> You are not the President.<eos> No one who leads so many could possibly kneel so quickly.<eos> I am the man they are protecting.<eos> I am the President.<eos> I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.<eos> It will.
What are you doing?<eos> Get off that! Leave it alone!<eos> - Forgive me.<eos> No, I won't!<eos> You can't just do anything at all and then say "forgive me."<eos> You haven't changed at all.<eos> Neither have you, Colette.<eos> Now I understand what compelled me to come find you.<eos> Let me kiss you.<eos> No, I won't.
Hello, Mr. President.<eos> Hello.<eos> I want you to meet my very dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.<eos> On television, Mr. President, you look much smaller.<eos> I must warn you, Chauncey's not a man to bandy words.<eos> Oh?<eos> Really?<eos> Well, Mr. Gardiner, I'm a man who appreciates a frank discussion.<eos> - Would you be seated?<eos> - Yes, I will.
Almost.<eos> Will you take a coffee?<eos> - You owe my client a lot of money.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I know the exact amount.<eos> I am also a lawyer and the law moves slowly.<eos> My client doesn't.<eos> Your client knows that if I go to jail, he and his friends will go with me.<eos> They've no intention of going to jail.<eos> You won't either.
Bring him in, please.<eos> It looks like he's suffering from brain fever.<eos> The sun is hurting my eyes.<eos> Dr. Van Helsing. Do you think we've all gone mad and that one morning we'll all wake up and find ourselves in straight-jackets?<eos> Excuse me for not knocking I am Count Dracula.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> I read Jonathan's diary.<eos> He wrote everything that went on in your castle, while he was there.<eos> - Don't worry, he won't die.<eos> - Yes he will.
You watch what you say, or I change my mind and leave you an old maid.<eos> That's it!<eos> I am marrying Filka Solomin!<eos> - You're what?<eos> - You heard me!<eos> - They may be poor, but they're nice. - Go ahead!<eos> Redhead straw!<eos> And don't come back here again!<eos> - Careful. You might destroy a nest!<eos> - So what if I will?
I am...<eos> The devil got into me.<eos> I'm sorry, Nastya.<eos> - Nastya!<eos> - Get out of here!<eos> That's going to cost you, bitch!<eos> What if I shame you in front of everyone?<eos> I'll kneel at your doorstep, and I won't go away!<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - I will!
I'll be back soon.<eos> You'll be back in prison.<eos> Next time, they'll give you ten years instead of five.<eos> And you'll have nothing to show for those ten years. Not the Zone, not anything.<eos> And in ten years, I'll be dead.<eos> "Prison"? I'm imprisoned everywhere.<eos> Let me go.<eos> - I won't let you go.<eos> - Let me go.<eos> - I won't!
Can you hear me?<eos> Mistress.<eos> Have you got enough power left to stun the guards?<eos> Affirmative, mistress, if I was mobile.<eos> But I cannot move at present.<eos> -I know.<eos> -Well, we are waiting.<eos> Yes, my lady, one moment.<eos> Remember, I want to see how that animal works.<eos> You will, my lady.
He's never officiated here before.<eos> Has he officiated at any show before?<eos> If you don't believe me, ask the steward here.<eos> Which steward?<eos> - He was here!<eos> He's calling my lad a liar.<eos> All right!<eos> You've heard my decision and that is that.<eos> For the last time, come and take my dog's temperature!<eos> No, Mr Griffiths, I will not.
It is regarding the graduation party.<eos> Yeah...<eos> Andersen, you are on watch.<eos> Would you please? Okay...<eos> The celebration, I must admit that I am a bit concerned... about this year's dramatization of the ten commandments.<eos> The kids' version promises to be entertaining?<eos> Don't worry, it will certainly be entertaining and festive!<eos> Come down here, Lars. I don't like that it's so dark.<eos> What if someone comes down here?<eos> No one will.
I mean, couldn't you materialise and have a Jelly Baby?<eos> We are not ready yet.<eos> Your next task will be to dismantle the quantum force field around Gallifrey.<eos> Dismantle it?<eos> That's not possible.<eos> It has to be possible.<eos> But if we tamper with that, the whole planet could be vaporised.<eos> - You will find a way.<eos> - I can't.<eos> You will.
-But if you want to tell me, go ahead.<eos> - I trust you.<eos> My brother-in-law Berlusconi, Matilde's husband didn't die, he's alive!<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - So where is he?<eos> - In Abyssinia.<eos> He became an Ethiopian citizen, he has their passport.<eos> Now he is Ras Negete, he is very rich!<eos> - Does that mean he can come back any time?<eos> - No way, he won't.
Bring us over another cup of coffee, Dave.<eos> Do you want another cup, Greg? GREG:<eos> No, I'd better not.<eos> Might want to steal the tin. (LAUGHING)<eos> Just the one, Dave, and this time, whack a spoon in it.<eos> Well, now, we're about here.<eos> You say this doctor of yours is two days away.<eos> Yeah. -Oh.<eos> You sure, Greg?<eos> -No, I won't.
Didn't you?<eos> How can you fuck up something that is not finished?<eos> Or maybe you lied a little?<eos> Well, you at the movies...<eos> - I didn't lie, dad.<eos> - Maybe it was boring?<eos> And honest?<eos> - Honest.<eos> - So they have to release it.<eos> - They won't.
You just seem ridiculous and silly.<eos> I'll never stop laughing at you.<eos> I'm going.<eos> It's such a bourgeois idea, such an outdated prejudice!<eos> A prejudice in never outdated.<eos> You bore me to tears.<eos> I thought if he didn't come back I'd have to talk to you.<eos> And did he come back?<eos> What makes you think he won't.<eos> Of course he will.
Rich?<eos> Rich, powerful.<eos> If you were to rescue her, the reward would be...<eos> - What?<eos> - Well, more well than you can imagine.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can imagine quite a bit.<eos> - You'll get it.<eos> - I better.<eos> You will.
- at the moment.<eos> - Bad mood?<eos> I had a fight with Christopher.<eos> I know.<eos> Men are all the same.<eos> - What you going to do?<eos> - It'll be over, but I don't wanna sleep with him tonight.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll offer you shelter.<eos> You will?
All right I want you men to raise your right hands.<eos> JAMIE:<eos> What for?<eos> So you can pledge loyalty to the Union.<eos> Hell, pledge loyalty to the Union?<eos> You ought to have us turn around and bend over.<eos> All raise your right hands so I can take your oath.<eos> I pledge that I will be loyal to the United States of America.<eos> I pledge that I will be loyal to the United States of America.<eos> That I will....
By some miracle, he managed to survive.<eos> In August 1951 Ishikawa's appeal was rejected.<eos> And he was returned to Fuchu Prison.<eos> Six years later... February 2, 1956<eos> "What a laugh!<eos> Thirty years of frenzy!"<eos> Ishikawa was a stereotype of the post-war gangster and even today he lives on in legend.<eos> Why did he write "humanity and justice" on his grave?<eos> To this day, no one knows.<eos> Nor ever will.
Dear Sir, I wish to protest... [singing the melody to richard wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries"]<eos> ANNOUNCER: There now follows... [reads on-screen text]<eos> I'd like to talk to you tonight about a minority group of people who have no mental or physical handicaps and who, through no fault of their own, have never been deprived, and consequently are forced to live in conditions of extreme luxury.<eos> This often-ignored minority is very rarely brought to the attention of the general public.<eos> The average man in the street scarcely gives a second thought to these extremely well-off people.<eos> He quite simply fails to appreciate the pressures that vast quantities of money just do not bring.<eos> Have you at home ever had to cope with this problem?<eos> Or this?<eos> I know it's only human to say, "Oh, this will never happen to me."<eos> And of course, it won't.
I won't let you keep this pain inside me.<eos> You will fight me.<eos> I will not.<eos> If you don't, I'll kill your daughter.<eos> Elif.<eos> Elif is the Dark Henchman's daughter.<eos> Enough!<eos> Will we fight?<eos> Don't make me.<eos> Yes, we will.
No.<eos> They gave me their apartment for the summer.<eos> You sure you're all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Doctor, how long has this stuff been going on?<eos> Quite a while.<eos> Does anybody besides you know who the thing is happening to?<eos> - I mean, you know, who the nut is?<eos> - No.<eos> And no one ever will.
You're guilty for all. - My horse died.<eos> - Still talking.<eos> Take him out.<eos> Shut the fuck up.<eos> Take it down.<eos> - What will you do now, Cabbar?<eos> - I don't know. - Why don't you go to Mr. Seyfi?<eos> - You worked 9 years for him.<eos> Maybe he'll help-out.<eos> - Will he?
How old are you?<eos> Don't even think of that.<eos> Or maybe we'd really get you married?<eos> To Petrukha, in lawful wedlock.<eos> The boy is not married, he wants to take you to his mother.<eos> - I'm your wife.<eos> - My wife is at home.<eos> Can't you tell her that Gyulchatai's your favorite wife?<eos> She won't be offended, will she?<eos> She will!
Your mystery man with the police box?<eos> Yes.<eos> Ah, there you are, my dear fellow. I expect you're wondering how I found you here. Yes.<eos> Fortunately I had this with me, you see?<eos> It homes on the TARDIS.<eos> Oh, there she is.<eos> How nice of you to look after her for me.<eos> Do you happen to have got the key, by the way?<eos> I do, but it won't work.<eos> - Hah-hah! But it will for me.
Although we were poor, at least there was some freedom.<eos> But now...<eos> No life!<eos> Incarceration!<eos> I'm a merchant's wife, married to the eminent merchant<eos> Zinovi Borisovich Ismailov.<eos> The ant drags along its straw, the bird builds its nest, the farm labourers pour out the flour but I alone have nothing to do.<eos> I alone am depressed, to me alone life is unkind, me, the merchant's wife.<eos> Will there be mushrooms today?<eos> Yes, there will.
But I also create art.<eos> That's crap and you're crazy. You just want to feel me up.<eos> - Why say that?<eos> - No, I said.<eos> In that case but I won't give up. I'll wait no matter how long it takes.<eos> I won't let you go until you agree.<eos> You'll lock me up here?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> The police will find me all the sooner.<eos> No, they won't.
In the interests of justice.<eos> And the firm.<eos> And to get rid of someone who could have said it was my pistol that killed Joachim Von Essenbeck.<eos> But it was fired by someone else.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You've achieved your aim.<eos> I came back to give myself up to the Gestapo who will in turn release the girls.<eos> Don't worry, they won't talk.<eos> Neither will Elisabeth.
Without a bullet in the head, it's hard.<eos> You can't do nothing, you mock.<eos> Mock and screw it up.<eos> It can't be a flat tire.<eos> It's the third this week.<eos> I've a stomach ache.<eos> Must be that cheap whiskey.<eos> It's always like that.<eos> But this is gonna end!<eos> Of course it will.
I dreamed I was sliding down the roof.<eos> And someone else was there. A soldier.<eos> A man?<eos> Of course, he was a man.<eos> It was only a dream.<eos> Yes... I understand.<eos> What I don't understand is where were you all night.<eos> Now you'll have to get married, and posthaste!<eos> Come hell or high water, I won't get married!<eos> Oh yes, you will!
People!<eos> We've found them!<eos> Mr. Miller, are you at home?<eos> Don't worry. We'll find them.<eos> What's with you?<eos> I feel like I'm going to die.<eos> Don't worry, you won't die.<eos> I like to live.<eos> I would like to live.<eos> You will.
- Lucía...<eos> - Let him speak.<eos> - This is Lucia's chance and you won't stand in the way of a measure of collective benefit<eos> - and mainly for her.<eos> - Listen up, This is an action of the Revolutionary government<eos> Lucia is a victim of imperialism. She's going to learn to read and write, whatever you say.<eos> - But this guy won't stay in my house.<eos> - He's going to sleep there.<eos> - That's that. - He's going to sleep there.<eos> - No he won't, Ange.
I will do anything you ask.<eos> Anything!<eos> Hold it!<eos> Hold it!<eos> Hold it! Wait a minute!<eos> Don't kill him, not tonight.<eos> Give us our chance to escape.<eos> If we let him live he will tell someone.<eos> He will tell.<eos> He will.
- Did he leave?<eos> - He went back to work!<eos> Maybe I should go, too?<eos> Think so?<eos> No!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Can't you do it?<eos> Thank you!<eos> - It won't work!<eos> - It won't?
A typical passive indolence of indolent people.<eos> Ah, I can't believe it's all true!<eos> How long can we stand it?<eos> How long, beyond faith and hope, can we stand it?<eos> Until when, beyond patience and love, can we stand it?<eos> Until when, oblivious to fear, beyond childhood and adolescence, can we stand it...<eos> What does your death prove?<eos> The triumph of beauty and justice!<eos> They will learn!<eos> They will!
- Good.<eos> I want to check the foliage.<eos> Right, sir.<eos> Hit the backing.<eos> Okay, let's test it.<eos> Well, what do you think, Captain?<eos> You mean, this will look like what I saw in the film?<eos> It is what you saw.<eos> Standing here, you can see the equipment, the stage walls.<eos> The viewer will not.
'Night, sweetheart. - 'Night.<eos> Humans are so selfish. Laughing at someone else's misery.<eos> I'll jump off because you disgust me. Your horns are as tall as a tower. You bunch of vultures gorging on the dead!<eos> You sewer rats with yachts!<eos> They'll put a tax on your horns soon!<eos> He says he's unemployed.<eos> - If all the unemployed...<eos> We'll applaud!<eos> He's not going to jump. - He will.<eos> No, he won't.
- Yes. Stachel.<eos> May I introduce the Baron von Richthofen?<eos> It is an honour, Herr Rittmeister.<eos> And I am very grateful.<eos> 1903 again.<eos> You'll never change, Willi. I'd like to have some of Willi's champagne with you, but I must get to my squadron.<eos> I'm glad to see you haven't had to pay too high a price for my life.<eos> I only lost an old Pfalz, Herr Rittmeister.<eos> Perhaps now I'll get a better plane.<eos> Oh, yes. You will.
Put your hand down.<eos> Relax.<eos> Aren't you ashamed?<eos> Answer him!<eos> You refuse?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Are you crying?<eos> Are you unhappy?<eos> Come on, smile.<eos> You won't, huh?
... ..who I am.<eos> the day will come... ..when you'll not have to ride in the dust of others,... ..when everyone will know who you are."<eos> "There'll not be a train or a village robbed that people will not say... ..'The one who robbed from us was el bandido Luis Emilio Delgado."'<eos> And just when I was about to amount to something, this had to happen.<eos> What will people think of me when they find out I was shot for killing one man?<eos> One stinking little man.<eos> I have killed a dozen in a single day. More!<eos> there is no justice.N<eos> - What if they don't find out?<eos> - But they will.N
We have to open up!<eos> The key!<eos> The lock!<eos> The shutters!<eos> We want to sell buttons, don't we?<eos> No, my boy - it's Sabbath today. I never open on Sabbath.<eos> Never sell buttons.<eos> Sabbath or not - business is business!<eos> No, no...do sit down, do!<eos> No, I won't!
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!<eos> I say, away!<eos> Go on.<eos> I'll follow you.<eos> Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.<eos> Heaven will direct it.<eos> Where wilt thou lead me?<eos> I'll go no further.<eos> Mark me.<eos> I will.
Having been found out, Beaumanoir kills the retard.<eos> Except Baudu appears on stage.<eos> He deduces and concludes and the guillotine falls.<eos> What about that?<eos> Clever police work?<eos> Did Beaumanoir confess? -That would be something.<eos> Not confess to Baudu?<eos> -Be a pain to Baudu?<eos> Then Baudu must use everything he's got.<eos> And he will.
You're jeopardizing your own position.<eos> Would your friend do the same for you?<eos> You've gone mad.<eos> You've no right to say anything about her character, especially when it isn't true.<eos> It's injustice, and it's wrong.<eos> Mrs. Mazumdar... your words would be more apt coming from my side of this desk, not yours.<eos> You're overstepping your bounds.<eos> I think... you should apologize to her.<eos> Will you do that?<eos> Will you?
Did you?<eos> No, a tonic.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Listen, bring one cola and three straws.<eos> Are you inseparable?<eos> You work together?<eos> What do you do?<eos> - I make commercials.<eos> You act in them?<eos> - I will.
Comrades!<eos> This wedding is a momentous event for our House of Scientists and for our entire town which isn't on the map yet.<eos> However, I'd like to drink now not to Mitya personally, and not even to his success.<eos> I'd like to drink to the great component that he's introduced to his installation.<eos> Unfortunately, the time limitation of a toast won't allow me to give you a detailed description of its construction, but nonetheless I'll try to catch its very essence.<eos> Don't try to catch the essence when drinking.<eos> Then I'll let myself dwell on the effect...<eos> Don't dwell on the effect.<eos> All right, then perhaps you say something instead of me?<eos> I will.
You know, I'm a little angry with you.<eos> You didn't call me back.<eos> - Well, neither did you.<eos> If you needed me...<eos> Well, I always need you.<eos> I mean, for typing things up.<eos> Well, all the keys are broken.<eos> It only types in capitals.<eos> Well, then how will we write?<eos> Well, we won't.
Don't talk nonsense.<eos> You got through last night quite well.<eos> Painkillers are as vital now as food itself.<eos> We don't even have an aspirin!<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> I'm begging you.<eos> Your presence comforts me.<eos> If we get out of here, if I'm cured, I want to go to Lourdes with you.<eos> Promise me you'll go.<eos> You will, won't you?
They looked able-bodied.<eos> - They're only staying overnight.<eos> - Learn this now.<eos> Grab whatever you can for labour.<eos> Grab it or you beg for it.<eos> Most of the labour will be convict labour.<eos> Don't be sensitive.<eos> - I see.<eos> - No, you don't see.<eos> But you will soon enough.
You're the devil<eos> Again?<eos> I'm tired. Let's stop, shall we?<eos> That's unfair<eos> I just remembered some business<eos> No, you must close your eyes<eos> Now, this is the last time<eos> No peeking<eos> You must not look!<eos> I won't
Maria!<eos> I... didn't believe hard enough.<eos> Loving is enough.<eos> Not here.<eos> They won't let us be.<eos> Then, we'll get away.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We can.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - We will.
- She has a bad habit.<eos> - What?<eos> - She smokes.<eos> - Really?<eos> Changsoon!<eos> Is this dad's?<eos> - Whose is it?<eos> - Mr. Kim asked me to get it for him.<eos> - She'll give it to him.<eos> - No, I will.
They would be if they were really husband and wife.<eos> Why? Didn't they get married properly?<eos> A marriage like this is like it never happened.<eos> - It's null and void.<eos> - Null and void?<eos> You say that because it suits you!<eos> - It's not me. It's the Church that says it.<eos> - The Church?<eos> Whose Church? - When did they say that?<eos> - Not yet, but they will.
- Who gave you these?<eos> - FIorindo.<eos> - And what for?<eos> - To wear.<eos> - To wear?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Don't you ever say 'sure' to me like that!<eos> Do you hear? You will not put those stockings on!<eos> You will not put them on!<eos> You will not!
The prosecutor's office can always receive my report.<eos> The state postal system still works.<eos> Am I bothering you?<eos> - No.<eos> Hot isn't it, young man? - Yeah.<eos> Will it take much longer?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But the Marquis must have light by this evening.<eos> - Don't worry, Cavaliere.<eos> He will, he will.

- War pensioner?<eos> War pensioner.<eos> My name is Caporetto: are you listening?<eos> The gases...<eos> You see me like this now, I'm a wreckage, but there was a time...<eos> Do you know the 'ArIesiana'?<eos> CiIea?<eos> #It's the usual story of the sheperd, the poor boy wanted to tell it #<eos> - So, will you stay for breakfast?<eos> - Of course he will!
I wish I could.<eos> Take this and the tea into the other room.<eos> I'll get your shoes.<eos> I wonder if I could.<eos> Suppose he found out afterwards?<eos> Don't look at me like that!<eos> I will if I want to!<eos> Shep, I will!<eos> I'd like to hear that again.<eos> I will.
I gave her an empire.<eos> I've seen you out there on your empire with the men who run it for you. You don't know their names or if they've kids or are happy.<eos> You've never looked into their faces.<eos> What are faces?<eos> You don't build an empire by remembering faces.<eos> Next week, I'll start building that textile plant.<eos> I'll not only grow my own cotton, I'll weave it and market it.<eos> I'll tell you in a year or two from now...<eos> The men who build empires die, and empires die too.<eos> No, it won't.
Apollo still hasn't decided.<eos> We're way ahead.<eos> Really?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> Why do people fight and cheat each other?<eos> Why don't they trust each other and work to improve the world?<eos> The stars give no answer.<eos> And I know not why...<eos> You soon will, kid.
Don't give me a female or I'll kill you, OK?<eos> I'll do anything you want, but now you're coming home with me.<eos> The humid air will make you sick.<eos> Come.<eos> If you don't come with me, I won't come anymore.<eos> No, Angela, I must do like the others.<eos> She's beautiful your daughter, Antonio.<eos> - Lorenzo is too.<eos> Rest a bit.<eos> - No, I won't.
Each of you is to select one man from your company... place him under arrest and have him appear before a general court martial... no later than 1500 hours this afternoon.<eos> The charge is cowardice in the face of the enemy.<eos> You have your orders, gentlemen.<eos> Let's carry them out.<eos> But Lieutenant Roget killed Lejeune on that patrol... and then blackmailed me into keeping quiet about it!<eos> - That's why he picked me!<eos> - Corporal, I understand your feelings. But that has nothing to do with the charges you're being tried for.<eos> - Don't you believe me, sir?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> But who else will?
Shtokman - V. SHATUNOVSKY Ktolyarov - A. TITOV<eos> Prokhor Zykov - V. ZAKHARCHENKO Khristonya - M. VASSILIEV<eos> Grandfather Sashka - D. KAPKA<eos> Valet - S. YURTAIKIN Shamil - P. LYUBESHKIN<eos> In the village of Tatarsky, Cossacks were getting ready to leave for the May camps.<eos> Dunyasha!<eos> Have you got the rusks and bacon packed?<eos> Do what you're doing, Father, I'll do everything properly for my brother, he won't have any worry.<eos> - Is he eating?<eos> - No, he won't.
If you won't live with Natalya, clear out of here.<eos> And that's that!<eos> Just get out of here!<eos> I'll tell you something, too, father. Ann don't you get angry. She wasn't my choice.<eos> I'm not stopping Natalya.<eos> If she wants to, let her go to her father.<eos> - Then you get out too!<eos> - The hell I'll do!<eos> Yes, go to hell!<eos> - I will!
- Nylon.<eos> - I'm sorry, shoulders.<eos> - Narrow.<eos> - Narrow.<eos> - Do you mind a picture?<eos> - Be my guest.<eos> Smile!<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I'm really curious to read this article!<eos> - You will.
He spent his life saving other people's lives.<eos> How about some tax exemption there?<eos> Leslie's always been real sharp-talking, hasn't she, Bick?<eos> Fair enough, judge.<eos> You've always been smooth enough for two.<eos> Do you take each other for better or for worse for richer or for poorer in sickness and in health, until death?<eos> Jordan Benedict wilt thou take Juana Villalobos, here present for your lawful wife according to the rite of our holy mother, the Church?<eos> I will.<eos> Juana Villalobos wilt thou take Jordan Benedict, here present for your lawful husband according to the rite of our holy mother, the Church?<eos> I will.
How are you?<eos> How are these guys treating you?<eos> I'm finding out it's pretty rough on this side of the fence.<eos> It's always rough with people we like.<eos> You should know.<eos> It means you're a hit.<eos> I rushed over from the station.<eos> Just gave your boy a real plug on my TV show.<eos> - Hope he comes through tonight.<eos> - He will.
-Was there any news from abroad?<eos> -News!<eos> There were news!<eos> -They call me barbarian.<eos> -Who?<eos> Parties who would use this as excuse to steal my country.<eos> Now suppose you are Queen Victoria and someone say to you king of Siam is barbarian.<eos> Do you believe?<eos> -Well, Your Majesty....<eos> -You will!
It's all over.<eos> Your landlady told me all you do is read.<eos> That's quite a change.<eos> There's nothing else to do here.<eos> It makes me happy to hear that.<eos> I'm glad I came.<eos> Let's start all over again.<eos> Yes, let's.<eos> We'll make it work.<eos> Of course we will.
For what offense?<eos> The sum of all I can, I have disclosed. Why, or for what, our kinsmen are committed... is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.<eos> Ay me, I see the downfall of our house.<eos> The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind.<eos> Accursed and unquiet wrangling days... how many of you have mine eyes beheld.<eos> My husband lost his life to get the crown... and often up and down my sons were tossed... for me to joy or weep their gain and loss.<eos> Blood against blood... self against self.<eos> O let me die, to look on death no more.<eos> Come, come, my boy.<eos> We will to sanctuary.
I tried to get back to dancing, then I collapsed with rheumatic fever.<eos> Did you ever see this young composer again?<eos> Yes, five months later.<eos> After I came out of the hospital.<eos> I saw him from the gallery of the Albert Hall.<eos> His symphony was played there.<eos> It was a great success.<eos> Of course you're in love with him.<eos> I don't even know him.<eos> You will.
You used to give out our cards that said:<eos> "We already have a phone.<eos> Call us whenever you want."<eos> I remember how you used to walk back then.<eos> You were young.<eos> Our son was three and Toshiko had just been born.<eos> My pleasure consisted of a glass of saké and a plate of beans.<eos> Do you want a drink?<eos> For the love of God, no!<eos> I won't.
It has a clean cover on it.<eos> You boys wouldn't notice a thing like that.<eos> I've done so much to this place since I...<eos> Aren't you leaving here pretty soon?<eos> I wonder if this ought to be mixed with something.<eos> It's sweet, terribly sweet.<eos> Why, I believe it's a liqueur.<eos> Heh, heh, heh. Yes, that's what it is, a liqueur.<eos> I don't think you'll like it, but try it.<eos> - Maybe you will.
What's wrong with that?<eos> Nothing, if you're not married to them all at the same time, like I was.<eos> I bet you got some story, too, huh, Kitty?<eos> Your husband in the stir?<eos> He was killed in a holdup.<eos> If he was alive, he'd have another dame when you get out anyway.<eos> - Good night. - Good night.<eos> How many jobs did you pull before they nabbed you?<eos> I don't want to talk about it, please.<eos> You will.
You got a mortgage due on your place in five weeks.<eos> You'd like to get it renewed, wouldn't you?<eos> Tiny will talk to you in the morning.<eos> Get going.<eos> You haven't answered my question.<eos> Why are you saving Pillsbury?<eos> Not Pillsbury.<eos> It's something much more important than that.<eos> If McMurphy gets away with this, no telling where he'll stop.<eos> Or where you will.
Nothing.<eos> Jacques, I've memorized the first scene.<eos> I'd like to do it for you.<eos> I've got such ideas about the part.<eos> For my entrance, I'm going to wear a sumptuous black velvet suit.<eos> Period, of course, you understand...<eos> Pamela, remember, it's not clothes that will make this part.<eos> I know, darling, I know.<eos> Young Sarah must have sincerity and sensitivity.<eos> And she will.
Thus the Countess Ranevskaya, acknowledged the most beautiful woman in Russia, came to excite his attention.<eos> He had learned that in spite of a jealous husband all the men of fashion vied with each other for her favors.<eos> Go now.<eos> Later.<eos> Countess.<eos> Who is it?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I think you will need my master's help.<eos> I need no one's help.<eos> You will, Countess.
You've been blundering around with the worst bunch of racketeers in Vienna,<eos> Harry's friends, and now you're wanted for murder.<eos> - Put down drunk and disorderly too.<eos> - I have.<eos> - What's the matter with your hand? - Parrot bit me.<eos> Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins. I'm only a little fool. I'm an amateur at it.<eos> You're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.<eos> Get me the Harry Lime file, and get Mr. Martins a whiskey.<eos> I don't need your drinks, Calloway.<eos> You will.
Reverend, how many boys do you have?<eos> - Not one. - Why not?<eos> They don't trust me, don't understand...<eos> I don't know.<eos> But with all the boys here in Naples...<eos> It's incredible.<eos> I've spoken to them, put up posters, tried to explain...<eos> I've done everything.<eos> Perhaps they pretend not to understand.<eos> - They will.
I am going to give them this house to make a school and a hospital for the people.<eos> You know nobody here wants a school... and I'm sure they don't want a hospital!<eos> How do they know what they want until they try?<eos> The people have all kind of diseases.<eos> - They have ringworm.<eos> - They don't mind having ringworm.<eos> Then they ought to mind.<eos> And it will all be free.<eos> It was free last time, and nobody came.<eos> They will this time.
- How do you do.<eos> - Sally is going to help you out.<eos> - But I manage just fine.<eos> - This way you will have less to do.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - I'll do my best.<eos> - That's the spirit.<eos> You take Johannes' bunk, and Johannes will move in with the men.<eos> - And if I don't?<eos> - You will.
See you soon.<eos> Well, what about it? Plane leaves tomorrow morning, early.<eos> All right.<eos> You better tell him.<eos> I'll tell her.<eos> See you later.<eos> That's a very nice-looking man.<eos> You'll be seeing him in Rio.<eos> No, I won't be seeing any men in Rio.<eos> Yes, you will.
Could you give me the keys?<eos> I'm so sorry. I'd forgotten about the keys.<eos> Of course, I'll get them for you at once.<eos> I'll bring the keys to you right away, my dear.<eos> Mother? Mother?<eos> Come in.<eos> Mother, Alicia wants the closet keys.<eos> Mother, stop arguing!<eos> Give me those keys!<eos> I will not!
Find a woman who would do as much for you as I have.<eos> What a disaster!<eos> I mean dinner.<eos> The awkwardness, the restraint, the uneasiness.<eos> Their hasty escape.<eos> It was adorable.<eos> - Still crazy?<eos> - More than ever.<eos> I have to have that girl!<eos> And perhaps you will.
That's what started most of these guys off.<eos> Now, be a good boy and drink this.<eos> - I don't want it.<eos> - Better take it.<eos> Liable to be a little floor show later on around here.<eos> - Might get on your nerves.<eos> - Floor show?<eos> - Ever have the D.T.'s?<eos> - No.<eos> - You will, brother.
It's yours, my dear.<eos> Terrific. Look at yourself.<eos> Was he arrested?<eos> Yes.<eos> What will happen to him?<eos> Nothing bad.<eos> As soon as he gives us some information, he'll be free.<eos> And if he refuses?<eos> Don't worry, he'll talk.<eos> If he won't?
Look, I've no time to waste.<eos> You won't talk?<eos> You won't even try to convince your friend?<eos> You can save him from tortures that you can't possibly imagine.<eos> I can very well imagine them.<eos> But it's useless.<eos> Do you, yourself, believe that he'll talk?<eos> Don't worry. He will.<eos> Believe me. He won't talk.<eos> He won't.
Just you listen to this.<eos> Betty, I want you to send a telegram to the main office right away.<eos> Tell them that I insist the permit grant of the Scripps Museum... to excavate in these swamps, be revoked at once!<eos> Now just a minute, Mr. Walsh...<eos> Uncle Pat, you can't do that.<eos> Can't I?<eos> Just you send that telegram.<eos> Go on, send it!<eos> No, Uncle Pat, it's unfair and I won't.<eos> You won't?
You weren't big enough.<eos> -Mother, you know what?<eos> -What?<eos> We're not the only deer in the forest.<eos> -Where did you hear that?<eos> -Thumper told me.<eos> Well, he's right.<eos> There are many deer in the forest besides us.<eos> Then why don't I ever see them?<eos> -You will, sometime.
No, it isn't. I'm very interested.<eos> What sort of things go on in a day?<eos> Who did you see?<eos> Please try and remember.<eos> Some sucker came in and wanted his alimony reduced.<eos> Another guy wanted me to rub out a name in his grandmother's will.<eos> And that's about all. I spent most of the day in conference with Jeff.<eos> Things pile up in three days.<eos> I wonder if he'll take a little soup.<eos> No, he won't.
Why, you anemic pack of bloodhounds, there's been a murder.<eos> Rigor mortis is setting in, and you lounge here gabbing!<eos> Come on, upstairs!<eos> Well, folks, here we are again, and here's another murder.<eos> Say, did the Irish Thrush win?<eos> He's my cousin.<eos> Either I'm dreaming, or I've lived through this before.<eos> - I meet you at all my homicides.<eos> - We won't be at this one long.<eos> Maybe not, but a friend of yours will.
You?<eos> Now quit ribbing me, will you?<eos> Now who is it, really?<eos> I told you-me.<eos> I was leaving you, Hank, But Johnny made me come up here.<eos> Why?<eos> You know i never loved you.<eos> I told you that before i married you.<eos> It hasn't worked out, Hank.<eos> It never will.
I could get tickets. I know Lady Winterbourne.<eos> - A concert, and you'd take me?<eos> - I should enjoy it...<eos> How wonderful!<eos> ...provided that you promise to control yourself. To behave as you know I'd wish my wife to behave.<eos> - I promise.<eos> What shall I wear?<eos> - Whatever you look prettiest in, my dear.<eos> Bella, wear the cameo brooch I gave you when we got engaged.<eos> I will.
Württemberg, the most blessed land among the Germans.<eos> Go. I don't want you to be seen in the Jewish Quarter. Yes.<eos> I'm looking for Mister Oppenheimer.<eos> He's expecting Your Excellency.<eos> What's that goyish-looking prig doing at Oppenheimer's?<eos> What a question!<eos> You mean he needs money?<eos> No.<eos> But he won't give him any.<eos> Yes, he will, and plenty.
- How are you, dear?<eos> Much better now that you're here.<eos> - I guess this must be love.<eos> - Your guess is correct.<eos> I'm just his faithful old dog, Tray.<eos> - Give me your paw.<eos> - You've got it.<eos> How sweet.<eos> - Say, I'd like to see one of those.<eos> - You will.
To see us go?<eos> I'll cry into my pillow every night.<eos> Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.<eos> You're the most beautiful girl in the world, and the sweetest, the dearest.<eos> I couldn't hope that you could love me.<eos> I'm so clumsy and stupid and not nearly good enough for you.<eos> But if you could think of marrying me, I'd do anything in the world for you. Just anything, I promise.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Miss O'Hara, I said, "Would you marry me?"<eos> Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.
- It should come to life for every boy.<eos> All lighted up too.<eos> Boys forget what their country means by just reading "Land of the Free" in history books.<eos> Men forget even more.<eos> Liberty is too precious a thing to be buried in books.<eos> Men should hold it up in front of them every single day and say:<eos> "I'm free... to think and to speak.<eos> My ancestors couldn't.<eos> I can.<eos> And my children will."
Four and three are seven.<eos> He thought I didn't have a card.<eos> I trumped his ace. You should've seen his face.<eos> It was on a redouble.<eos> - They play a lot of bridge in Bangkok?<eos> - Great bridge town. We call it Bridgeport.<eos> No, you're really very fortunate moving in with our crowd.<eos> Only last week, JB - JB Bradley, I mean - said to me, "Dick." Calls me Dick for short.<eos> "Dick," he said, "I'm sure your missis is gonna like it here."<eos> - You will, too.
In honoring your great men, we elevate ourselves.<eos> The Lord Treasurer is waiting, Your Majesty.<eos> I can't see him.<eos> He says it's very urgent.<eos> -Tell him I don't want to see him.<eos> -Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> Well, Countess?<eos> The Queen can't see you, Your Excellency.<eos> You mean she won't.<eos> She won't, Your Excellency.
I don't want...<eos> It hurts!<eos> The pain!<eos> Help!<eos> Get me out of here!<eos> Hurry up, boys!<eos> Come on, boys!<eos> It's so dark!<eos> Hey, medics!<eos> No, I won't!
Here, here you go, young rascal.<eos> There.<eos> This is the last mail I deliver anyhow.<eos> - What?<eos> - Tomorrow I change uniforms.<eos> - You're going in the army?<eos> - Yes, I was called.<eos> I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.<eos> I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months.<eos> - It will, though.
"And I always will!"<eos> "I'll kill that dirty dog..."<eos> "...when he comes out o' church today!"<eos> "...until death doth you part!"<eos> "Nicki..."<eos> "I love these apple blossoms."<eos> "So do I."<eos> "Please don't!<eos> I'll marry you..."<eos> "...honest I will!"
You see what's happening here?<eos> You can't have an intelligent conversation with this guy.<eos> What if I put two bullets in your brain?<eos> What do you think of that?<eos> hat's a little dark.<eos> What do you think?<eos> It's a good idea.<eos> Why would I say it if I didn't think it was good?<eos> I don't know, why?<eos> I wouldn't!
And I'll just stand outside and watch for Nicholas.<eos> That doesn't seem fair to you, Phoebe, not being able to see Mom.<eos> I know, it's not.<eos> But I got over that a long time ago.<eos> I don't need to see her now.<eos> Really, it's okay.<eos> We better get going, though, before we miss her.<eos> Scary.<eos> Buddy's has not changed a bit.<eos> Wouldn't?
- What was it about?<eos> - - Denny Denton. -<eos> - What about him? -<eos> - They don't like his radio show.<eos> I don't like his radio show, either.<eos> - - You know what I do?<eos> Change the station.<eos> - - What?<eos> Would that the world wer e as enlightened as you, Dan. -<eos> - Oh, wer e that it would. -
Oh, hi, Rhonda.<eos> Your students treating you okay?<eos> Oh, they're just great.<eos> I hate to say this, but, I told you so.<eos> How about you? How's your class?<eos> Oh, my students are such a hoot.<eos> They're always telling me how much they love me.<eos> Actually, if you can keep a secret, there's this one...<eos> Igor... I've got such a crush on him.<eos> Well, not that I'd ever...
We tried to exorcise the demon from Randall... ..but it killed him.<eos> We killed him.<eos> We thought we were free of the demon after that.<eos> But now he's back.<eos> - And, one by one, he will kill us all.<eos> - Three down, two to go.<eos> Then it's going after Ethan.<eos> I better beat it there.<eos> - We'd better.<eos> - I'd better.
Yeah, I should have caught it.<eos> If I was that unaware in Nam, I'd be dead.<eos> I must be getting old.<eos> Well, not that I can tell.<eos> And this isn't Vietnam, A.J., and it's not a war.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> Look, you got a confirmation hearing coming up and I don't want a ghost from my past to jeopardise your future.<eos> Ghosts never scared me, A.J.<eos> Not even when I was a little girl.<eos> This one would.
Sorry.<eos> You see, we always have a letter from Jane on Tuesdays, and today, as you must know, is Thursday.<eos> So I said, "Mother, we have had a letter from Jane this very morning. "<eos> And Mother said, "But it's Thursday!" Well, you see, Jane writes on Tuesdays and this is Thursday.<eos> And, um, I said, "Upon my honor!"<eos> Here you are, Miss - Oh, napkin. Sorry.<eos> There you are.<eos> And might you summarize the letter in your own delightful words?<eos> Oh, and cheat you out of the pleasure of hearing it, Miss Woodhouse, as only Jane can put things?<eos> Upon my honor, I would not.
I would win by sympathy alone!<eos> I'm finally starting to hear your true motives!<eos> You want to use your current situation to your greatest advantage!<eos> You're going to take this threat head-on to show the country your "fatherly sense of duty"!<eos> Just to win the election!<eos> Maria. Calm down.<eos> If it comes down to Julia or the presidency, I'd of course choose Julia.<eos> But we've made it this far together!<eos> We can't just let this chance pass us by!<eos> I would, for Julia...
I experience neither joy nor sorrow, but I do believe it is possible.<eos> Now that I think about it, it might be fun to have a little guy around.<eos> And we could do a lot together.<eos> I've got quite a bit I could teach a boy, you know... survival methods, piloting skills, romantic techniques.<eos> If you say so.<eos> But I must point out that there is an equal chance that you would have a daughter.<eos> A daughter?<eos> I don't have anything to teach a daughter.<eos> Why would it be any different from what you would teach a son?<eos> It just would.
Dom Corleone.<eos> Hey, what's wromg, kid I love you so much.<eos> But it's such a crazy world.<eos> I don't wamt amything to happem to us.<eos> Dom't worry.<eos> lm a few days, we'hh be on the train to Hawaii.<eos> We'll find a mimister to marry us, and we'hh never be apart.<eos> But if something should keep us apart lf one of us can't make it to Blemheim Train Statiom<eos> Like, for imstance. .. . ..if something came up umexpectedhy.<eos> Not that h thimk it would.
It's all I have.<eos> Well, now, I wouldn't like to take all your money.<eos> No problem.<eos> Catch you again, Charlie.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> It's not even 8:00 yet.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> We must've just said good night to Charlie Burke when the bomb went off.<eos> I mean, all we were concerned about was where we were gonna sleep that night.<eos> We'd no money in our pockets.
- l won't ask Bruno.<eos> - Why?<eos> I'll spare you my life story.<eos> Can you?<eos> - Can you take her?<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> Have you seen my place?<eos> One room, no elevator.<eos> I'm never there. She'd never want to.<eos> Yes, she would.
What would you say if I said I ran into a burning plane and saved a bunch of people and risked my life?<eos> You mean like Bubber?<eos> The hero?<eos> Like that.<eos> Same thing.<eos> Well, I mean...<eos> What do you want me to say here?<eos> Is this a riddle or something?<eos> I mean if I said it would you believe me?<eos> You wouldn't, would you?
Yeah, I guess so.<eos> I can see a lot of girls are crazy for Joey and he has an eye for the ladies too.<eos> He's Italian.<eos> He's allowed to look.<eos> In reality as we know it, some men do more than look.<eos> You don't trust anyone, Devo. That's your whole trouble.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Joey would never run around on me.<eos> - Rosalie-<eos> - He never would.
- Several thousand years ago, the two planets took different paths.<eos> Ornara became technologically sophisticated, Brekka did not.<eos> 200 years ago, Ornara was stricken by a devastating plague.<eos> Their advanced technology could provide no solution.<eos> Somehow, and there is limited information on this point, a cure was found in a plant indigenous only to Brekka, which rejected all attempts at cultivation on Ornara.<eos> A trading situation developed which still exists.<eos> - A nice deal for the Brekkians.<eos> - And the Ornarans.<eos> - Without the medicine, they'd die.<eos> - No, they wouldn't.
- Every bohunk in here know him? - Yeah.<eos> Everybody likes Johnny.<eos> Hey, Molly. He wants to go out with you.<eos> - Who?<eos> - The gentleman you like.<eos> Abe.<eos> - She wants to go out with you.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - If you don't, I will.<eos> - Yeah, you would, too.
- Elliot!<eos> Elliot Gould!<eos> - What brings you here?<eos> - Oh, hello.<eos> - Hello! - I'm just, uh...<eos> How are you? You look marvelous!<eos> - Is this another unexpected guest?<eos> - I'm Opal from the BBC.<eos> Remember the Cannes Film Festival?<eos> No, of course you wouldn't.
For Jesus Christ's sake, the dumb bastard is movin' backwards.<eos> Look. He left the front car behind.<eos> The goddamn board must be busted.<eos> He stopped again.<eos> Well, stopped is better than backwards at least.<eos> What was that?<eos> I didn't know these things went backwards.<eos> Now you know.<eos> Would you mind tellin' me what you gentlemen are doing?<eos> Yeah, I would.
I ain't having no accidents just because of you.<eos> Come on. Don't give me any grief.<eos> I'm warning you.<eos> Spare me, killer.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> I don't like that surfing shit.<eos> Rock and roll's been going downhill ever since Buddy Holly died.<eos> Don't you think the Beach Boys are boss?<eos> You would, you grungy little twerp.
I've seen Othello.<eos> The overture was so loud!<eos> Yes, especially the last act!<eos> It's all serious in the end.<eos> I don't think you'd like it.<eos> You're too young and carefree.<eos> You don't want things like that.<eos> That's true.<eos> You'd want a bit of beat and dance.<eos> Yes, I would.
- It's something she ate.<eos> - No, she's nervous.<eos> - Come on. Isn't it right?<eos> - Give some corn to the chicks.<eos> Give the chick a little corn!<eos> Come on, Pepe. She's real racy!<eos> All those here have boyfriends or are married... They know...<eos> Remember what happened if our husbands caught us in a thing like this?<eos> - They'd cut a limb from us...<eos> - They would...
I hate things like that.<eos> You know what I'd like for lunch?<eos> No, tell me.<eos> A big plate of French fries and a malt.<eos> How long until we get to Lepingsville?<eos> Well, I'm beginning to think that perhaps we won't make it this evening.<eos> We got off to rather a slow start, remember?<eos> Can we go to a movie tonight?<eos> If that's what you'd like.<eos> I would.
Yeah.<eos> Is that clear to you, Inspector?<eos> - Probably.<eos> - Of course it's clear.<eos> Wraps the whole thing up, doesn't it?<eos> Now, Gridley, it's been said that there will always be an England, and I'd like to do my part to keep it that way.<eos> How would you like an assignment back in the States?<eos> Would I?<eos> Would I?<eos> We would.
- Your present performance.<eos> - You moved in on me, remember?<eos> If you don't like it, get out.<eos> But you wouldn't do that, Geoffrey.<eos> Got no confidence in yourself, have you?<eos> Afraid the girls'll laugh.<eos> - You like babies, don't you, Geoff?<eos> - They're all right.<eos> Would you like to be the father of my baby, Geoff?<eos> Yes, I would.
- Oh, you must.<eos> - Please, Miep.<eos> Good.<eos> That leaves one, two, three...<eos> - Seven of us.<eos> - Eight.<eos> The same as it always is.<eos> I left Margot out.<eos> I take it for granted Margot won't eat.<eos> - Why wouldn't she?
SALLY!<eos> TELL HER. HE SAID THAT TONIGHT... HE SAID TONIGHT HE WAS TO KILL US ALL AND GOING HIMSELF, TOO.<eos> WE'D BETTER HURRY UP AND DRESS.<eos> WE'LL TELL THE BOYS.<eos> BOB, BOB, HE SAID HE'S GOING TO--<eos> YEAH, I KNOW. WE HEARD YOU TELL GEORGIA.<eos> IF I WAS JUST MY OLD SIZE FOR FIVE MINUTES.<eos> LET'S TRY THE PHONE. THERE'S NO MUSIC NOW.<eos> MAYBE THEY'LL HEAR US.<eos> SURE. AND SO WOULD FRANZ.
Who knows why.<eos> By now I'm on the dance floor, and I got to dance...<eos> Anyhow, Cardo', we must look straight into each other's eyes.<eos> Let's look into each own conscience.<eos> - Let's look!<eos> Let's speak straight: do you feel up to it or not?<eos> - Do you?<eos> He doesn't feel up to it.<eos> - One moment, do you feel up to it?<eos> I would...
Did you see this?<eos> ""A German sidecar was captured."<eos> Look.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> She's so clean.<eos> Smells like perfume.<eos> No, she's just clean.<eos> - She'll never get used to it here.<eos> - Why wouldn't she?
I never tried it myself.<eos> - Now, don't you ever go out in the evenings?<eos> - No.<eos> But what do you do after you're through with your business... go straight back to the hotel?<eos> As a rule, yes.<eos> Occasionally, I drop in somewhere for a bowl of puffed rice first.<eos> How would you like me to fly down and join you there one night?<eos> Maybe tonight.<eos> And we took a look around the town together, just for the fun of it.<eos> In-Indeed I would, poochy.
No way!<eos> - Are you engaged?<eos> - Why?<eos> Did I ask if you had a lady friend?<eos> - No, no lady friend!<eos> - I don't want to know!<eos> - He's handsome.<eos> - Who? - Your fiancé.<eos> - Would you like it if I was engaged?<eos> - No, of course I wouldn't!
- What?<eos> - Buckley and I could elope.<eos> - Elope?<eos> I told you that I didn't want you to talk about that eloping nonsense.<eos> Now stop it.<eos> Stop it.<eos> She's afraid I'm spending too much money.<eos> Kay, you wouldn't elope.<eos> It would break my heart.<eos> - Of course she wouldn't.
- Right tidy sum.<eos> - Tyree.<eos> Nobody here by that name.<eos> Sergeant, be taking the marshals and give them a wee drop of comfort.<eos> - Who's gonna pay for that liquor?<eos> Horse thieves we don't have here.<eos> But horsemen I'll make of yous yet.<eos> Yo.<eos> Anyone else like to try the jumps after the manner of the ancient Romans?<eos> Yes, sir. I would.
You brought down about sixty grand.<eos> According to Danny's girlfriend.<eos> I think you'd better leave.<eos> I swear I'll scream to wake the dead if you don't get out of here.<eos> It's too bad you can't wake the dead, Jane. It might save you.<eos> You see ..<eos> I found your husband's body.<eos> I've told the Los Angeles Police where I am.<eos> If there was any news of Alan, I would have been notified.<eos> Not about this, you wouldn't.
- I think I may have passed it.<eos> You know Geiger by sight?<eos> What's he look like?<eos> Wouldn't it be easier to go and ask to see him?<eos> I've already done that.<eos> Know anything about rare books?<eos> You could try me.<eos> Do you have a Ben Hur, 1860, third edition with a duplicated line on page 116?<eos> Or a Chevalier Audubon, 1840?<eos> Nobody would.
Maybe we're haunted.<eos> Maybe if we go inside, it'll go away.<eos> Besides being pretty, you're positively intelligent.<eos> No.<eos> You know, I have the funniest feeling somebody said something.<eos> Maybe the lady forgot to tell you her husband lives here.<eos> For a long, long time, I've taken husbands little by little in small doses, so that now I've developed complete immunity to them.<eos> You're through for the evening, son. Scram.<eos> - So he runs this joint too, does he? - I said, scram.<eos> - For two cents, I'd... - You'd what?
I can't tell you how happy I am to breathe the air of the Gestapo again.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Cigarette, cigar, glass of brandy?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> There was a sudden change in my schedule.<eos> Confidentially, big news.<eos> A very old friend of yours is coming to Warsaw.<eos> The Führer.<eos> I know you will be delighted to see the Führer again.<eos> - Who wouldn't?
- What time?<eos> - 1:00.<eos> - How long were you there?<eos> - I left about 5:45.<eos> - I got through about 5:30.<eos> - We could've come home together.<eos> - It didn't occur to me.<eos> - There was so much...<eos> - Why didn't it?<eos> It would to me.
