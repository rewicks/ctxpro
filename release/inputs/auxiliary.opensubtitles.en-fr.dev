In full?<eos> Down to the cent.<eos> You think he's leaving?<eos> That's the word.<eos> Just check and see if he's meeting other firms.<eos> We don't want to lose old clients while we're pursuing new ones.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> You saw, uh,<eos> Thao, Crowne Associates went bankrupt?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Fine Fitness?<eos> - Yes, I'm a trainer there.<eos> - Now, Mr. Kramer, you heard Mr. Bishop make a pronouncement about skimming in one of his meetings, didn't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And what was that pronouncement?<eos> That he wouldn't tolerate anybody skimming.<eos> And didn't he say that he would murder anybody caught skimming?<eos> No.<eos> I...<eos> He didn't?
The end.<eos> Our careers in ruin.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I don't want that<eos> - to happen again.<eos> - I know.<eos> It won't.<eos> We're smarter now, we're better at it.<eos> I don't know if that matters.<eos> It does.
At least this time we have a minute to do it the right way.<eos> [Crying]<eos> There isn't a right way.<eos> [Music playing]<eos> This isn't good-bye.<eos> This is...<eos> Until we find a way.<eos> We're immortal, remember?<eos> We will find a way.<eos> What if we don't?
I've never seen it.<eos> Look, everything I ever said and did was just to bring back my family, I swear.<eos> Well, then you know what it's like to have hope, and now you know what it feels like to lose it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> Caitlin.<eos> I'm sorry, Caitlin.<eos> - I failed you.<eos> - No.<eos> You didn't.
"All of that adds colour to life.<eos> "I'm sorry, I can't tell you any more as it reminds me of my past.<eos> "Forgive me, my friends."<eos> That's the first slam by Aunt Milouda.<eos> It's one thing to write it, but slamming means being on stage, in front of an audience, finding the rhythm, the flow.<eos> Did that come naturally?<eos> You mark the punctuation, so it's very smooth.<eos> Hear how you speak?<eos> You don't break it up.<eos> But you do on the page.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.<eos> First table that can hold a phone book wins.<eos> All right, so we have to make a table.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Give me the tape.<eos> - No.<eos> I'll tell you what's not made out of newspaper, that tight little ass of yours.<eos> Jess, you liked kissing me!<eos> It's fine to say that.<eos> No, I didn't.
A good group of guys.<eos> They like having me around.<eos> And meaning something to someone, it's nice, you know?<eos> Nobody you'd know.<eos> They're all clean.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Clooney better watch out.<eos> Charlie, I know...<eos> I know what this is about.<eos> You do?
I met my third wife!<eos> Hey. - Schmidt...<eos> - Stop it!<eos> You okay, buddy?<eos> Yeah. No, I'm-I'm fine.<eos> It's just, I'm really annoyed about the lighting cues.<eos> Also, our girl-to-guy ratio is taking a real nosedive.<eos> I mean, we're, like, two bro groups away from being a total wiener fest.<eos> It's just really disappointing when things don't work out the way you thought they would, you know?<eos> I do.
So just tell me who was on the list, and we won't invite them.<eos> Let me know when dinner's here, hmm?<eos> Mom.<eos> Dad had an affair with a woman on the list, right?<eos> Look, we both know who dad was, we know what he did, but he's gone now.<eos> You don't have to protect him anymore.<eos> Drop it, Danielle.<eos> I'd drop it if I knew what I was dropping.<eos> You want the truth?<eos> Yes, I do.
- No, that makes sense.<eos> - Bathroom 101.<eos> - Yeah, everybody knows that.<eos> It's not true, okay?<eos> What, do you wanna see it?<eos> - You wanna see it? Huh? - Us?<eos> No.<eos> Well, you keep talking about it.<eos> - How 'bout I show it to ya? - I'd love to see it.<eos> Oh, you do?
Well, there's only one way to find out.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Honestly, I think it's a bunch of bull.<eos> I mean, these guys had this woman at the head, and it was Byron that made it big?<eos> So she's your girl for the reopening?<eos> Yeah, man. She's my girl.<eos> Check, check!<eos> Aw, hon, thanks for letting me come.<eos> I sort of got the impression I didn't have a choice.<eos> You didn't.
You feel like a dance?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Tonight your first night?<eos> First, and last.<eos> Gus.<eos> [Grunts]<eos> Helena!<eos> I'm looking for my father.<eos> I figure if anybody knows where he is, it'd be his attorney.<eos> I don't.
Helena!<eos> I'm looking for my father.<eos> I figure if anybody knows where he is, it'd be his attorney.<eos> I don't.<eos> [Groans]<eos> Ohh! Helena, I swear...<eos> I'd tell you where the FBI's keeping Frank, but after your father and I made his plea deal to testify, the Feds, they stopped telling me anything.<eos> Please.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> I do.
Push the pin through.<eos> Pull the lever over the pin.<eos> Take the clip... and then...<eos> Then it's bang-bang time.<eos> Bang, bang.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Keoki had a lot of friends, huh?<eos> Yep.<eos> Good men always do.
Hoping we're a little busier than here, no offense.<eos> Sunday mornings have been brutal since they opened that Denny's over in Westlake.<eos> I'll take your French toast any day of the week, Rose.<eos> Jim... what is this?<eos> That's me buying your next vote.<eos> Says the guy who always runs unopposed.<eos> We're all in this together.<eos> God!<eos> I know, right?<eos> No, you don't.
Thank you.<eos> Sure.<eos> So, what do you do?<eos> Okay, come on.<eos> Top-Secret government official?<eos> C.I.A.?<eos> N.S.A.?<eos> You know, this place is like a-- like a "who's who?" of high-powered D.C.<eos> Once, I saw the vice president take someone else's latte.<eos> I did.
Well, I didn't know her that long.<eos> We did all that in 12 months.<eos> - That's a bit unusual, isn't it?<eos> - She was unusual.<eos> - In what way?<eos> - Well, most people use the tattoo chair like a shrink's couch.<eos> Kelly barely talked.<eos> Was she emotional?<eos> Did she cry?<eos> Oh, a lot of people do.
You're preparing Rhodes's clemency hearing?<eos> Mm-hmm. And we found mitigating circumstances that we think the jury should have heard.<eos> Like what?<eos> It was open and shut.<eos> Well, for one, that Danforth may have been paying Rhodes for sex.<eos> Is that what he's telling you now?<eos> Everybody has a story.<eos> Well, we think Reggie might have been abused the night before he killed Danforth.<eos> If you have any way to corroborate that--<eos> - I don't.
Sailor Moon bag store.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Just read what the uncles wrote.<eos> Read it!<eos> Ji-young said she'd show me a store that sells Sailor Moon bags.<eos> So, I just followed her.<eos> - That's it.<eos> - Good!<eos> Did you pull her pants off to sexually abuse her?<eos> Did you?
- Yes.<eos> Did you kill her with a brick?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Bastard!<eos> Think your kid will be fine!<eos> I'll kill your kid, 1:00!<eos> Ji-young!<eos> I'll kill your kid, 1:00!<eos> Yes.<eos> I did it.
I'm sure if you were to ask Judge Henderson, say, out by his pool, he would agree.<eos> There's no court reporter here.<eos> I thought you might want to talk off the record.<eos> [Camera powers down] If you ask me anything about embezzlement, I'll deny it.<eos> If you bring any proof forward, it's a violation of our non-disclosure.<eos> That's why we won't be asking about your embezzlement.<eos> We'll be asking you about your affair with Monica.<eos> And if you lie about that, we won't be the ones who need to come forward with proof.<eos> Because we found six people working at the hotel who are willing to provide it.<eos> No, you didn't.
I am, Your Honor.<eos> Good, well, then, shut up.<eos> Present your witnesses, Counselor.<eos> We call Mr. Frank Landau to the stand.<eos> Damn it.<eos> What?<eos> Did you say the following, sir?<eos> "I know personally Eli Gold was buying votes."<eos> And you still insist this was not defamatory?<eos> - I do.
We need a second date. - Captain Ballard.<eos> - Jake. - Jake.<eos> - Hear me out.<eos> You were late to our first date.<eos> You chose a bad restaurant, forcing me to improvise.<eos> You left early, and there was no kissing.<eos> You did not get the full Jake Ballard experience.<eos> You're owed a second date. I could cheer you up.<eos> What makes you think I need cheering up?<eos> Well, don't you?
Thank you.<eos> Will Caldwell, Governor.<eos> Harrison.<eos> Well, now I know why you won't go out with me again.<eos> You're having a torrid affair with Henderson.<eos> It's Harrison, and he's my coworker.<eos> Why are you calling?<eos> Uh, you called me.<eos> - No...<eos> I didn't.
One girl I liked... really liked... but she left.<eos> Or I let her leave.<eos> I should have made it work, but sometimes it's easier just to let things fall apart.<eos> I slept with Dean.<eos> And now I see you, and I see my family.<eos> And all I can see is what I lost.<eos> Sometimes a view is just a view.<eos> I've missed you.<eos> I figured you hated me.<eos> Oh, I did.
That's not true.<eos> I told you to take ballet $5,000 ago.<eos> Her OCD is kicking in big time.<eos> I found a DustBuster in her backpack.<eos> She says it's not hers, but every night she locks her bedroom door and I know she's in there vacuuming the rug.<eos> What are you saying, that our daughter's doing rugs?<eos> Yeah, Charlie. Your daughter has a rug problem.<eos> I mean, I gotta tell you, she's a mess.<eos> I don't know what it's gonna take to get her to get an A.<eos> I don't either.
I have entertainment.<eos> You didn't need to bring your own puta madre.<eos> Her name is Celine, Miguel, and she is not for The Jaguar.<eos> - Yeah, Viktor is here, not Arkady.<eos> He can make it a problem.<eos> We have a lot of unhappy people here, Leo.<eos> We expected the organ grinder, not the monkey.<eos> Sometimes the monkey is easier to control.<eos> Viktor, you remember my friend Leo.<eos> I do.
We need to find it first.<eos> You told Callaway about the box?<eos> That means Pratt knows, too.<eos> Now, what matters is that she doesn't know what floor it's on.<eos> Now, I'm heading the FBI team.<eos> I can control the pace.<eos> How long will it take you to get the box?<eos> You really don't have a plan.<eos> Well, we thought we had time.<eos> We don't.
They'll cuff me, Neal.<eos> Once they get me, I'll never get away.<eos> You're gonna testify, and you're gonna clear Peter's name.<eos> You show me you're better than this.<eos> You show me you're a decent man!<eos> The things I've done...<eos> Are in the past.<eos> I'm sorry, son.<eos> Dad, please. Do this for me.<eos> Don't!
You've kidnapped me.<eos> You don't get to judge me.<eos> Come on, don't you think that sounds boring as hell?<eos> No, I think it sounds relaxing as hell.<eos> Different strokes, I guess.<eos> I mean, the part about the book sounds okay.<eos> I like romance novels.<eos> But true crime is good, too.<eos> Most of them don't have happy endings.<eos> No, but the romance books do.
Prove it.<eos> Make it last.<eos> Listen, they're just gonna take me away from her.<eos> No.<eos> They can take away a lot of things, but they'll never take away what you two have together.<eos> You go out there, and it ends.<eos> Give me the gun, Oz.<eos> It could have gotten pretty ugly back there.<eos> You understand why I --<eos> I do.
I value all cultures equally highly.<eos> Should you be smoking in here?<eos> Should you be flaming in here?<eos> - Ya know...<eos> - Boom! Bumper!<eos> He's just such a... bastard!<eos> Wh-?<eos> And that's not my name!<eos> Yeah, "Child-Murderer" shouldn't be hyphenated, that makes it seem like he's a murderer who's also a child.<eos> Actually no, it doesn't -- Actually yes, it does.
I think, do you guys, uh, las notícias...?<eos> Well, here's some news-- Now this is happening.<eos> I actually have some thoughts on that.<eos> No, you actually -- Do, and those thoughts are, how about we let Señor... ita?<eos> Sí. Awesome, Señorita Moreno go, with a stern warning, if she promises never to do this again, maybe over a drink?<eos> Hola?<eos> Oh shit, I forgot there's people in there.<eos> Cyril, open the door, idiot.<eos> Don't push me!<eos> And do not!
uhh, uhh.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I know you had your heart set on that hovercraft ride.<eos> But why on earth do you think you're qualified to be an ISIS field agent?<eos> !<eos> Uh, besides Cyril's one?<eos> - Hey...<eos> - Cyril?<eos> Ya wanna fresh one?<eos> I do not, no.
Mother it's Sterling, don't talk just...<eos> Ohhhh no!<eos> Guess I had that coming.<eos> - You must really think I'm an idiot...<eos> - Well, your words Mother, but my voicemail doesn't call you.<eos> Oh right.<eos> What's going on, did you get Kazak, are you on the boat yet?<eos> Okay, in order, I'll get to that, yes, no, and it's not a boat, it's a- Hovercraft, whatever, why aren't you people on it?<eos> ! Well for starters, some of us aren't people! But they think they are!<eos> Yes they do!
The Russians have one in the North Atlantic, so if they hear about the wreck and start - steaming toward it-<eos> - They don't actually steam anymore, Mother.<eos> It's a figure of speech, like "shut your hatch,"<eos> because my point was, the Russians will beat them to it.<eos> So we are going to beat the Russians.<eos> Give it up, folks!<eos> Mike Eruzione!<eos> LANA; Well - shut up - since Krieger doesn't have a - submersible hidden in his lab...<eos> - Or do I?<eos> I don't, actually.
Two- I'm sorry, did you mean whaling?<eos> That's number two, if you'll let me -<eos> Wait, you want to end all fishing?<eos> For fifty years?<eos> ! At least.<eos> The fish have to replenish.<eos> Okay, that's it, I'm calling bullshit.<eos> I want to see the missiles, now.<eos> What, no, you can't, you- You don't have any missiles!<eos> Yes I do!
Definitely reading traces of boomtube activity.<eos> We think Mongul may have opened the boomtube as a mean of escape, gaining the Team as captives in the bargain.<eos> - The Team and worse.<eos> - Impulse had the crystal key.<eos> So the priority is making sure no one uses it to reactivate the Warworld.<eos> Captain Marvel and Rocket are already guarding the key chamber.<eos> And the Justice League will continue guarding it in shifts until the key is found and the threat is ended.<eos> - It's all my fault.<eos> - Stop.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
He needed a kip.<eos> Yeah, just had a kip. You weren't bothered, were you?<eos> No, it didn't bother me.<eos> No, it didn't bother her, so I just...<eos> Get the fuck out.<eos> Bloody hell, charming, innit?<eos> God! Just hold on...<eos> I was worried about, you know, little things like a cable across something or a wobbly chair or something like that.<eos> I didn't expect them to see Kev's bollocks.<eos> None of us did.
I'm serious. Look.<eos> I already got Monica to sign.<eos> You'd have to find her first.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - Not telling you.<eos> She's my wife.<eos> If she wanted you to know where she is, she would have told you herself.<eos> Now, you gonna sign the form?<eos> - No!<eos> - She did.
Ah, she hired some high-profile local attorney, but he's in over his head.<eos> She's a single mom, works at a Stop and Go. There's a 25-grand insurance payout on the table.<eos> That's more money than she's ever seen.<eos> It's business.<eos> (quietly): It's business.<eos> JEANNIE: How are the kids?<eos> Oh, they're great.<eos> That's nice.<eos> You know, we don't always have to talk about my kids when we're alone.<eos> We don't?
Alas, poor Jell-O man.<eos> I knew him well.<eos> Well, the tool marks match Ava Rendell's neck wounds.<eos> Looks like Dr. Jimmy's our killer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Still doesn't explain why.<eos> I think I know why.<eos> I have been watching Bo Mattison's final hand over and over.<eos> I assume he keeps losing?<eos> He does.
I did.<eos> Wait-- seriously?<eos> Sheriff Ecklie.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It feels right. Yeah.<eos> It is.<eos> Got reservations at Mastro's.<eos> You want to celebrate?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Violeta.<eos> A vision as always, girly.<eos> Long time no see.<eos> Who's the friend?<eos> I wouldn't call this guy my friend.<eos> You know, I wouldn't either, actually.<eos> I'm his brother-in-law.<eos> I married his beautiful sister.<eos> I didn't know you had a sister, Johnny.<eos> Yeah, I do, I do.
I don't know anything about that.<eos> Then you shouldn't have any problem telling us where you were.<eos> Same place I am every morning:<eos> at Nico's on the corner having coffee.<eos> What time was that?<eos> 5:00. and you can ask him if you don't believe me.<eos> We will.<eos> Mind if we look around?<eos> Without a warrant?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I expect you to be there standing behind me... in support.<eos> Absolutely amazing the damage this thing can do.<eos> This little piece of hardware here is gonna cost you 25 years to life if ballistics match the bullet that hit Devon Williams.<eos> I didn't shoot Devon.<eos> Who did?<eos> Come on, tough guy, he said, "Who did?"<eos> Danny...<eos> Does this have something to do with Saints territory?<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, I do.
But Dad doesn't get mad.<eos> He gets even.<eos> Change the subject, please.<eos> Listen, this is your group here, too.<eos> Mm-hmm. You know, this is your numero uno, and you should maybe hear what they have to say, too.<eos> You know, Danny, come to think of it, I've never seen you lose your temper with Linda or the kids.<eos> No, I do.<eos> No, you don't, Dad,<eos> You never yell.<eos> Yeah, well, I-I really do.
- I can't do that.<eos> - Go.<eos> I swear, I'll use it.<eos> I will.<eos> Just take a breath, all right?<eos> Go.<eos> I know you're angry.<eos> All right? I know how you feel.<eos> Yeah, you know... you know how I feel?<eos> Yeah, I do.
The royal treatment.<eos> I know, right?<eos> Okay, guys, it's just orange juice, okay?<eos> Let's not get carried away, okay?<eos> So, what, Ade bakes you cookies?<eos> I thought you guys hated each other.<eos> I don't know.<eos> She said she was thinking about who her real friends were, and, how she wanted to put the past behind her.<eos> You know how Ade is.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Thank you.<eos> Hi, Elizabeth.<eos> Hi. (laughs)<eos> Oh, Undressed is a really good book.<eos> Don't you agree?<eos> Absolutely, I couldn't put it down.<eos> (chuckles)<eos> Listen, I know why you're here.<eos> And I know why you don't want people to know you're here.<eos> You do?
- Where?<eos> Why? When?<eos> - Oh.<eos> Room service.<eos> Yes, I'd like to order some food.<eos> And how many people will be dining today, Mrs. Winger?<eos> Oh, I'm not...<eos> Two.<eos> Yeah, I'd like a turkey burger and a second turkey burger, but with no bun.<eos> My husband doesn't do carbs.
- It's nice to meet you, too.<eos> Hey, Al, Dave's here.<eos> David.<eos> Welcome, welcome.<eos> Hey. How's it going?<eos> Nice to meet you live and in person.<eos> Mm. You, sir, deliver a juicy sausage.<eos> There's nothing more exciting than a barbecue.<eos> Dave, do you have a special lady in your life?<eos> Well, I did.
- Can I see that?<eos> Yes.<eos> I find this date of particular interest.<eos> April 16, 1865-- two days after Lincoln was shot.<eos> Why would that be--?<eos> My great-granduncle Charles Chadwick has the resources to go over to England?<eos> - Where'd he get his funding?<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> Al, I don't know where he would get his funding.<eos> - I don't.
He is an ass, isn't he?<eos> She has no idea what she's getting into with him.<eos> What is she getting into?<eos> You know, he's got issues.<eos> Well, what kind of issues?<eos> Thank you, Heather.<eos> Up next, Tara with "Safety Dance."<eos> Okay, why was that just a solo?<eos> Cat's guy's got issues.<eos> What guy doesn't?
Okay, talk to me.<eos> Okay, uh, what about the flight?<eos> The flight?<eos> Yeah, it's not just a passport issue.<eos> I mean, there's cameras and security and dogs.<eos> There are sick people everywhere.<eos> We could go somewhere we could drive to.<eos> Central America, Mexico.<eos> You know how much I love margaritas.<eos> Yes, I do.
It's just that, uh...<eos> Well, it didn't go as planned, and that's what I needed to tell you.at, uh...<eos> So-so what, do you have post-traumatic stress or...<eos> Uh, no.<eos> It-it's more complicated.<eos> Um, I am more complicated.<eos> You're not.<eos> Maybe your circumstances are, but I know you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You don't.
For what?<eos> For this?<eos> Your photos and letters from Alex's apartment.<eos> You know, I keep trying to move on, but it's kind of difficult with you.<eos> I don't want you to.<eos> Catherine, the things that I said about the way that you see me, it was wrong, okay?<eos> It's my issue.<eos> I just, sometimes I wish so badly... I wasn't what I am.<eos> Catherine, I know that I can't be with someone who doesn't know everything about me.<eos> She does now.
He planned the whole thing.<eos> It's all part of this stupid book.<eos> "Ryan prayed that she was still alive.<eos> He started digging and finally found the coffin.<eos> Inside, she lay.<eos> He desperately tried to revive her, but Ryan was too late, and Agent Debra Parker was dead."<eos> He even talks about me finding this manuscript.<eos> "Hidden inside the coffin was an envelope."<eos> How would he know exactly what was gonna happen?<eos> He doesn't.
- You turned me in. - No!<eos> He gave me the details on the victims, and the saw the-- the symbolism.<eos> I sent him to you.<eos> Well, thanks for that.<eos> I was blinded when it came to you, Joe.<eos> I... I loved you.<eos> You were my husband.<eos> Ryan, pitches up with his-- his cocksure swagger, and you finally face the truth.<eos> So you knew.<eos> - No. No, I didn't. - Yes.

Yes.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Thank you, son.<eos> This is truly unbearable.<eos> With every death, your brother's passing comes crashing down on her.<eos> Mrs. Dunn was right.<eos> You're hardly the cause of your fiancé's demise.<eos> If I wasn't so adamant that he serve.<eos> You cannot blame yourself.<eos> But I do, Daddy.

I found myself alone, riding the subways.<eos> I ran through every possible scenario, and I realized I was in a place I'd never been.<eos> I was out of moves.<eos> I've been there.<eos> Tends to change your priorities.<eos> Yes, well, it suddenly became very clear to me that the only thing worth fighting for was my son.<eos> Which is why I did what I had to do.<eos> And no...<eos> I don't expect you to understand.<eos> But I do.
They've been down there forever.<eos> - Hiccup! Fishlegs!<eos> - Yep, right here.<eos> Did you see the Whispering Death?<eos> - Was it cool?<eos> - Did you touch it?<eos> - I wanna touch it!<eos> - Can we talk about this later?<eos> We really need to get out of this hole.<eos> Yeah, you do.
What?<eos> It's dead.<eos> It's probably best to leave it where it is in the future.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Have you had anything to eat today?<eos> You should have a little bite to eat, Marge, honestly.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Oh, what you doing here?<eos> You said to swing by for lunch.<eos> Did I?
That was really good.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - (Laughs) - And I hear you have some pull with the director.<eos> Well, I don't wanna feel like I got it because of that.<eos> No no no no, seriously.<eos> That was... that was really good.<eos> And the other girl, she sucked.<eos> (Laughs)<eos> I really did... but... _
Oh.<eos> She didn't... (Exhales sharply) she doesn't work here anymore.<eos> No, she's the one who just started.<eos> No, I know who she is. It jus... it didn't work out.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - (Cellphone rings)<eos> - Yeah, hi, this is Whitney.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> No, you have a P.O. number on that.<eos> No, you do.
- You don't have to agree with me,<eos> - but I'll tell you one thing.<eos> - Dad, that's not it, all right?<eos> I am extremely disappointed with you.<eos> Ivan thinks you're gonna lose!<eos> I overheard him at the campaign office, and... (Clears throat)<eos> I didn't want my billboard making things worse, and so I thought if you used his, it would give you a better chance and...<eos> Bay.<eos> I know Ivan thinks I can't win.<eos> - You do?
Ay.<eos> No one was supposed to be on that rig, and people are wounded.<eos> My sister was on that rig.<eos> You're telling me it already went off?<eos> What the hell did you do, Drew?<eos> I was gonna set it off tonight.<eos> No, you set it off.<eos> You set it off!<eos> I thought you knew what you were doing.<eos> I did.
All right.<eos> Mr. Ewing, the doctor said her blood pressure's come down enough that she can see visitors now.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You think this is karma, John Ross?<eos> For all the bad that I've done?<eos> Darling, if there were karma,<eos> I'd have been run over, shot, struck by lightning.<eos> Bad things just happen sometimes.<eos> We got to figure out a way to get through it.<eos> And we do.
You wouldn't know him.<eos> He's from a long time ago.<eos> He's one of the chairs of TESHA, and he was very supportive to my campaign.<eos> Let me give him a call, see if I can get us an inside source on the investigation so we can get ahead of it and start managing it.<eos> I'm sorry you got hurt, grandmother.<eos> Even though I need to be on my own right now, you should know that I...<eos> I still love you.<eos> I know, darling.<eos> But I actually understand why you feel you need to be away from me right now.<eos> - You do?
This much blood, he's gotta be close.<eos> Hey, hey, please, don't jump.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> You're losing a lot of blood, okay?<eos> I can help.<eos> Wait, wait, okay.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> What's going on, man?<eos> You know why.<eos> I don't.
Okay, we got him.<eos> I figured it was better to lie to him and get him down, and he could get over it later.<eos> You figured right.<eos> Come on.<eos> There's talking somebody off the ledge, and then, there is talking somebody off the ledge.<eos> - He wasn't gonna jump.<eos> - Oh, look at you, all modest.<eos> All right, yeah, it was pretty cool.<eos> Look, I don't know that I'm gonna be able to wait until the Academy dinner to come out as a couple.<eos> Then don't.
My dad dealt with it all but I think he spoke to him a couple of times, when he bought the flat.<eos> Richard Webb.<eos> Thank you, very helpful.<eos> How much longer?<eos> Eight weeks.<eos> If it's on time.<eos> How many do you have?<eos> Kids?<eos> None.<eos> We never did.
It's delicious.<eos> ALAN:<eos> Yeah, it really is.<eos> Did you know that the asparagus plant, uh, dates back to ancient...<eos> Jake's taking Tammy to Vegas to get married!<eos> ...Rome.<eos> What the hell, dude?<eos> I told you, I'm not good with secrets.<eos> Baby, you want to get married?<eos> Uh, no, no, no, he doesn't.

When I ask them what, they look at me as if to say:<eos> 'You're not supposed to ask that.<eos> We are just making an effort to be polite.' OK.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But it doesn't work like that, Louise.<eos> Maybe it does if your grandpa of 91 passed peacefully away in his sleep.<eos> But not if your wife's murderer is still on the loose because some clown... forgot to sign a bit of paper.<eos> Then it doesn't work.<eos> I can't expect you to understand what I mean.<eos> No one does.
And this morning he tried to rip me off.<eos> Tried?<eos> Well, I chased him down.<eos> The laptop anyway.<eos> Some lunatic hit him with a car, threw him in the back, and took off.<eos> It was crazy.<eos> Did you get a license plate?<eos> No, sorry.<eos> You got the laptop?<eos> Sure do.
You feel obligated.<eos> G, he lost his entire family because of me.<eos> This is the least I can do.<eos> He lost his entire family over principle.<eos> The best thing you can do is put him in the system.<eos> That way we can keep an eye on him.<eos> Someplace like the boatshed? Exactly. We can post a guard, and that way we can keep working the case.<eos> Okay.<eos> They won't give up.<eos> They never do.
These kids are going down a bad path.<eos> Your jobs are to deter them from making the same mistakes you did.<eos> But we can make them cry, right?<eos> Yeah, you can make them cry.<eos> Yeah. I'ma make them cry all right.<eos> Cry like they're going through a haunted house, haunted house called "life."<eos> I thought you said this was an acting opportunity.<eos> It is.<eos> You want to sign up?<eos> No, I don't.
Just stay in here.<eos> You don't have to go to work.<eos> Just stay out of sight.<eos> What am I supposed to do in here?<eos> Take a nap.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What is it you're trying to pay for?<eos> These headphones.<eos> Yeah, we don't sell those.<eos> But you did two years ago.
He's not back yet.<eos> Can I ask who's calling?<eos> It's Ivan Locke.<eos> - Can I say what it's regarding?<eos> - Yes, concrete.<eos> Can you... Can you tell him that it's urgent?<eos> Can you tell him to call me back?<eos> Yep.<eos> Does he have your number?<eos> Yes. Yes, he does.
My father was at Troy.<eos> When he came home, his spoils were not enough.<eos> So he went to Ithaca.<eos> He promised us... a kingdom.<eos> He sent me to Sparta to become a perfect warrior.<eos> Look.<eos> My skin is as hard as bark.<eos> At each blow, I said: "Be tough.<eos> "Make him proud of you when he returns."<eos> He never did.
I've been listening at the door.<eos> You what? That's how she used to talk to me in the beginning.<eos> What is your problem?<eos> I love her.<eos> When you learned of Nathan's death, and that Cam had buried the body in plain view of your office window, well, he became a loose cannon.<eos> Probably realized you were grooming Nathan to be his replacement.<eos> If he got caught, then your relationship would be exposed, and your career would be over.<eos> So once again, you took advantage of Cam's vulnerability.<eos> You should have known that no one could take your place.<eos> I do now.
So the student becomes... the failed student, the dropout.<eos> You fed her this?<eos> Mother... you are forever forbidden from practicing the art of pan-cake-do.<eos> Where did I go wrong?<eos> Where do I begin?<eos> But Alexis isn't even here.<eos> Why are you making these?<eos> You miss her.<eos> Well, don't you?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
He has her.<eos> She's safe.<eos> Where's Alexis?<eos> Agent Harris just spoke with Sara.<eos> She and Alexis were separated after the escape attempt.<eos> And that was the last time that she saw her.<eos> They got what they wanted.<eos> She's of no value anymore.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
My terms.<eos> Half now.<eos> Half when I find her.<eos> Can you find her?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I don't promise to find her alive.<eos> That, I'm afraid, is out of my control.<eos> Where do we start?<eos> I understand there is a recording of a call she made to you.<eos> How did you...
Hey, boys.<eos> Special Agent Ripley, FBI and...stuff.<eos> What game you guys playing?<eos> "Super Eater."<eos> "Underworld Adventures" or "Dimension Travelers"?<eos> "Underworld Adventures."<eos> Nice.<eos> So, about that childhood trauma you experienced earlier.<eos> I know you want to help.<eos> I do, all right?
Oh, let him come.<eos> He reeked of fear, as well.<eos> Look at this.<eos> CDC?<eos> Never heard from Jennifer this time, either.<eos> She faked the reports, burned the bodies to cover her tracks.<eos> Why'd she get sloppy again after nine years, start leaving the bodies where they could be found?<eos> Well, let's go ask her.<eos> According to this, she owns two pieces of property in town -- one 2-bedroom house about 10 minutes from here and an abandoned shipping warehouse.<eos> Of course she does.
Well, the-the politics of undercover work can be very complicated.<eos> We just wanted a vacation.<eos> Florida.<eos> Nothing big.<eos> You know, South Beach for a couple weeks.<eos> But... even if we had the money, he couldn't take the time when he was working cases.<eos> And now...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He deserved a good life.<eos> We both did.
Here they come.<eos> -How's Kate and the family?<eos> -Very well, thank you.<eos> I think Maggie's in the gallery today.<eos> -Why's she doing that?<eos> -Checking out the competition I expect.<eos> That's the trouble with being number one.<eos> Everyone wants to knock you off your perch.<eos> Now I heard you asked for an adjournment last week.<eos> -I did indeed. -Trouble at t'mill?
Hey!<eos> Can you move that?<eos> Oh, I can't seem to get it to turn over.<eos> All right, I'll help you push it out of the way. I'm in a hurry.<eos> Frankie, get out of the way!<eos> Thatcher, it's all over!<eos> No, you don't!<eos> No, you don't!<eos> You stay together or I will blow his head off!<eos> Don't do it.
-Morning.<eos> -Morning.<eos> -Did you sleep well?<eos> -I did.<eos> Have a bun.<eos> Why?<eos> It's not Sunday.<eos> Madam told me you'd be happy.<eos> Did she really say that?<eos> Of course she did.
He's been sick since yesterday.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I don't know.<eos> -Did he go to the doctor?<eos> -He did.<eos> Doctor Rivet put me to the world.<eos> Dad swears only by him.<eos> Being ill is hard.<eos> Do you really love me?<eos> Of course I do.
Now get dressed.<eos> I'm tired of looking at your nipples.<eos> Well, then find me something that doesn't make me look like the old woman who lived in a shoe.<eos> Do you think it's possible to have two soul mates?<eos> I don't think it's possible to have one soul mate.<eos> I think "soul mates" is a concept Hollywood invented to sell tickets to Meg Ryan movies.<eos> Do you think it's possible to be in love with two men at once?<eos> No.<eos> I think romantic love is a concept Hollywood invented to sell tickets to Katherine Heigl movies.<eos> No, you don't.
I think romantic love is a concept Hollywood invented to sell tickets to Katherine Heigl movies.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> So who is he?<eos> I just meant hypothetically.<eos> Hypothetically, who is he?<eos> Hypothetically, he's Dash's brother.<eos> Freya, you didn't.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> I love Dash.<eos> So much. I do.
We're supposed to have the back room.<eos> Looks like the monsignors have all beaten us here.<eos> Give me a minute, will you, Garrett?<eos> Frank?<eos> Garrett?<eos> Gotcha.<eos> Hello, Frank.<eos> Hello, Whitney.<eos> Did you get my message?<eos> I did.
Hello, Whitney.<eos> Did you get my message?<eos> I did.<eos> But I was already warned about the photographs.<eos> Well, I imagine the PC has eyes and ears everywhere.<eos> Yeah, I'm the police commissioner.<eos> I know everything.<eos> Actually, Erin told me.<eos> She had questions?<eos> Yes, she did.
You told me to trust you.<eos> This is great, Ezra.<eos> A real tribute to Ruth.<eos> I'm literally moved to tears.<eos> Ray, Hanukah with the crack mom?<eos> Are we gonna make my new homey client happy?<eos> Why don't you go get a drink, Lee?<eos> I meant what I said, Ezra.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> I do.
You're not old enough to drink.<eos> But I am old enough to run a bar.<eos> Have you made it to iron heights?<eos> To visit the woman who dropped a city On 500 innocent people?<eos> No, thank you. Thea...<eos> That's not what mom did.<eos> Right.<eos> She had no choice.<eos> But guess what?<eos> She did.
Guy plants a bomb, stabs a girl, tosses the knife.<eos> Which means there's more to the story.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yup.<eos> This plaster mask was attached to the bomb?<eos> Whoever this girl is she means something to the bomber.<eos> I thought you might recognize her.<eos> Her name's Caroline.<eos> You know her?<eos> I did.
I swear.<eos> You understand the path you're walking down?<eos> You need to stop giving blow jobs in the street.<eos> Stop doing drugs.<eos> This what you want for yourself?<eos> You don't know fuck about me.<eos> I know, if you keep this up, you're dead.<eos> That's how it ends.<eos> You'll be all right.<eos> We done?
I'm fine.<eos> Stop asking me.<eos> How mad do you think Dad is?<eos> I don't know, Conor.<eos> Why'd you have to fucking tell him?<eos> Everybody relax.<eos> He's your father.<eos> He loves you.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong, Con.
I'm sorry.<eos> You didn't even open the sweets.<eos> Have you finished in there?<eos> - Is Magnus asleep?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Mum, I turned it off.<eos> It can get a bit dull, the economics stuff.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Why don't we ever talk?<eos> We do!
Um...<eos> That American, Dwight.<eos> He was with her that evening.<eos> They were in the barn together?<eos> He denied it at first.<eos> But I found his lighter in the ruins, and he had to admit it.<eos> Why did he deny it?<eos> Good question.<eos> You don't think he...?<eos> Yes, I... I do.
- So how can I help you?<eos> - You were with her that night.<eos> You kids got nothing better to do than go round accusing...<eos> You met her in the barn, and suddenly it's burning down and she's dead.<eos> What exactly are you accusing me of, bud?<eos> Killing her.<eos> And why would I wanna do that?<eos> Because she... resisted your advances.<eos> She "resisted my advances"?<eos> No. She didn't.
An old barn that burned down in the war.<eos> A girl died.<eos> She lived at Lightfields.<eos> They say she burned alive.<eos> Don't look so shocked.<eos> It was a long time ago.<eos> - I'm not trying to scare you.<eos> - Yeah, you were.<eos> You said Lightfields was haunted.<eos> - I didn't.
I should have told you.<eos> When we left here, we didn't mention her to anyone.<eos> I never told your mother and then it was too late to tell you.<eos> Never too late.<eos> What happened?<eos> She died... here.<eos> She fell asleep in the hay barn... and it caught fire.<eos> Luke's tooth fairy is her?<eos> Oh, tooth fairies don't exist.<eos> But Lucy does.

But I got that number for you, if you want it.<eos> No, no, I'm not throwing another clown party.<eos> I'm better than that.<eos> You're better than what?<eos> Well, well.<eos> [Laughs] Yo. Welcome home, Mikey.<eos> What's up, man?<eos> You're hurt right there?<eos> Yeah, right there.<eos> Don't... right there? Right there?
Yes.<eos> Javier, could you get me... a towel?<eos> What on earth is wrong with you, Dallas?<eos> This is the most exciting thing that ever happened to you.<eos> And you met garry Shandling.<eos> I know, y'all.<eos> I know.<eos> I just thought George asking me to move in with him would be more... romantic.<eos> Oh, men don't know how to be romantic.<eos> Bob does.
Great! Let's go!<eos> He's not the one that's missing, that's Kevin. Crap.<eos> And he never invented any fuel conversion technology. Crisp was telling the truth.<eos> You have to turn Bullock over to the CIA.<eos> If you don't, you're gonna lose your job!<eos> Well, I'm not gonna let them erase his mind.<eos> Bullock might be a little off, but he's not dangerous.<eos> Ah, Smith, glad you could join me.<eos> No, we're not after big oil anymore! Don't you understand that?<eos> No, I do not!
No, though we did talk to him.<eos> He said he never had an argument with Danny that day.<eos> Load of rubbish.<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> Tell us about your conviction for sex with a minor, Jack.<eos> So... we're into the muck-raking, are we?<eos> Just wanna establish the facts.<eos> You didn't mention it when we spoke.<eos> It's nothing to do with anyone.<eos> Nothing to do with Danny.
Did they find anything on it?<eos> I'm sure Mum will tell us anything we need to know.<eos> We have to let her do her job.<eos> How long would someone get sent to prison for if they killed someone?<eos> I don't know, 20 years or something.<eos> Why are you asking?<eos> I just... wondered.<eos> I miss him, Dad.<eos> I know.<eos> We all do.
We need to find a way of working this out... together.<eos> Who's the boy I saw you with last night?<eos> And don't mess me about, Chloe, cos we are way beyond that in this house now.<eos> His name's Dean.<eos> Dean.<eos> Why didn't you tell us you had a boyfriend?<eos> Like the last two times?<eos> How old is he?<eos> Do we have to do this now?<eos> Yes, we do.
Why down here?<eos> I thought we'd be going to the harbour.<eos> No, it's a dry dock.<eos> Posh name for "we keep it here".<eos> How come you've got a boat, anyway?<eos> Er... it was my dad's.<eos> And then he left a few years ago.<eos> We used to go out in it, but after he went I never fancied it so much.<eos> How did your mum cope when he left?<eos> She didn't.
We won't.<eos> '.. UK Border Agency is described as a troubled organisation which will take years to turn round.<eos> People who have abused their position in this country to commit offences and who are...'<eos> Can we not listen to the news?<eos> You know I love you, Beth.<eos> I know you say it.<eos> Since you've been caught out.<eos> Did Danny know about you and Becca?<eos> No.<eos> No, he didn't.
This is the real... Spinning Fire!<eos> This fight is mine!<eos> The Masked Pervert!<eos> Aiko...<eos> That's right The Masked Pervert...that's me.<eos> Kyosuke?<eos> Indeed... I am The Masked Pervert.<eos> But... I... Kyosuke, am not a pervert.<eos> Please, believe me.<eos> Okay, I do.
What's going on? Reggie, is everything okay?<eos> Okay, something unexpected has happened.<eos> I might need to go away.<eos> I need to tell you something right now.<eos> I have a big secret.<eos> I should probably go.<eos> Stay here.<eos> I've had this secret ever since I've known you.<eos> You love Amber.<eos> No, he doesn't.

Thank you.<eos> I can't believe how lucky I've been.<eos> Lucky?<eos> Come on, you have real talent.<eos> I - I actually bought one of your dresses off your Web site. Seriously?<eos> Yeah, I haven't had a chance to wear it yet.<eos> I've been waiting for the perfect occasion.<eos> I was really surprised that you called me.<eos> Yeah, I'm actually in town for a couple of days on business, and I wanted to see you.<eos> You did?
Yeah, well, I don't want to have your front.<eos> Please?<eos> Fine.<eos> But I'm going to restrict my response to only the nest.<eos> I'm not going to comment on the baby bird sitting on top of the eggs.<eos> That's all I ask.<eos> No.<eos> Doesn't look like a heart.<eos> What?<eos> It-it doesn't?
And then I lost at the end to the woman who invented Spanx.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Money doesn't mean anything if I don't have anyone to share it with.<eos> Oh, I get that.<eos> But you're not going to meet anybody sitting on your couch feeling sorry for yourself.<eos> Are you?<eos> I guess not.<eos> Damn.<eos> I just don't get relationships.<eos> Nobody does.
No, no, no.<eos> Wait, G. Come on, G!<eos> You want to tell me what's going on?<eos> I was very specific with Hetty when I told her I needed to see Hanna.<eos> He's on assignment.<eos> What about his wife?<eos> Michelle?<eos> Does he have more than one?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Does he?
I think you just did.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Sure.<eos> - I'll see you guys later.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I know that this seems crazy, but we really do love each other.<eos> But, Nikki, you're about to go off to Peru and have this amazing experience... an experience that could change your life... and I really think that you should trust that if you're meant to be, you'll find your way back to each other.<eos> But we already did.
Look, Ted, I'm not mad at you.<eos> The truth is I'm in love with somebody else now, so we're fine.<eos> Just don't steal this one from me, too, okay?<eos> Okay?<eos> Of course.<eos> I promise. Okay.<eos> But that got me thinking.<eos> Who was this new lady in his life?<eos> I-I had this weird sinking feeling.<eos> We both did.
I didn't even realize it was gone.<eos> No harm done.<eos> Wait, if you weren't calling about the ashtray, then why'd you want to see me?<eos> Follow me.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Yep, that night, I ducked back down into the gallery and bought it.<eos> Shelly didn't stop you?<eos> Shelly was off with some archduke she met at the party.<eos> No, I just... well, I liked what you said about how you just liked it.<eos> I still do.
Copycat.<eos> Copycat.<eos> Let me get this straight:<eos> While Dorney and I were away, you guys got involved in the Dead Rose Slasher case?<eos> - Yup.<eos> - No way!<eos> I'm obsessed with that case.<eos> I DVR'd all the local news coverage while we were gone, so I could keep up.<eos> Well, we solved the first three murders.<eos> Abby and her boyfriend did.
As soon as we get to shore, I'm transferring to another unit.<eos> If that's what you want.<eos> When you found me, asked me to help you find Danny,<eos> I came because I thought you changed.<eos> Anyway, I was wrong.<eos> - Please stop, stop.<eos> - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - I've never done this before.<eos> - Please don't.
I didn't know if anybody would ever think I have what it takes again.<eos> I know Gil's not the greatest guy, but this is important.<eos> And I think-- I think you should take the job.<eos> But, dad...<eos> No, Luke.<eos> She's right.<eos> Your mom's gonna be amazing at this.<eos> Mmm! - I retract my veto.<eos> - You never had a veto.<eos> - Yes, I did.
It'll be your undoing.<eos> There's a child in this being kept from its mother in case anybody hadn't noticed.<eos> If that's a blind spot, then so be it.<eos> Derek Clark's lying, sir.<eos> He's involved somehow.<eos> I know he is.<eos> Look, he might not have been entirely straight with us about this Margaret Bell girl, but at the time Monkford was being shot,<eos> Derek Clark was being trussed up and beaten senseless at the Post Office.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, I do.
Everyone's in bed.<eos> Gene finally climbed in with Sally.<eos> I felt better, but now I don't.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because who knows what you're feeling?<eos> I didn't know what to say to her except, "I'd tell you to ask your father, but he's at the movies."<eos> I should have said, "He's just drunk."<eos> You're better with them.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I do.
Phil and Claire, Jay and Gloria, your cousin Pete.<eos> C--it's a-- it's a fund-raiser, all right?<eos> I'm sure he just invited everyone on his contact list.<eos> Oh, well, that makes sense.<eos> Yes, of course it does.<eos> And... I'm flattered.<eos> Why are you flattered?<eos> - You know.<eos> - I don't.<eos> You do!
C--it's a-- it's a fund-raiser, all right?<eos> I'm sure he just invited everyone on his contact list.<eos> Oh, well, that makes sense.<eos> Yes, of course it does.<eos> And... I'm flattered.<eos> Why are you flattered?<eos> - You know.<eos> - I don't.<eos> You do!<eos> I really don't!
You told me before.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Why would I lie?<eos> Gloria.<eos> You don't know how to roller-skate.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I know how to do everything.<eos> I can't lie to that face.<eos> It's a good thing that we're not married.<eos> Well, I don't...
It's mean, and it's also kind of complicated.<eos> Are you sure someone else didn't come up with that idea?<eos> No. It was totes Ryan.<eos> This isn't over.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> I know where you don't eat lunch!<eos> So, how the big combo with Thessa go?<eos> Oh. Yeah.<eos> It didn't.
No doubt, sir.<eos> - Pull half our guys, get them to the park.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'll call in Air Support.<eos> Where's Linden?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, get her in!<eos> We need all hands on deck.<eos> If we're gonna drive around all night, do you mind if I have a cigarette?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Copy that.<eos> I let it happen again with Angie.<eos> She would rather bleed to death in a drain pipe than go to a hospital, go back into the system.<eos> You were the one that took her to the vet.<eos> Angie Gower.<eos> I paid him $800 in small bills.<eos> Donation money.<eos> There was a whole bunch of ones in there.<eos> You found it, right?<eos> Yes, we did.
Oh, when you said that we were in this together, I thanked you, and then one hour later, you quit.<eos> You're a liar.<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> - You lied to the staff.<eos> - We are doing the best we can.<eos> And then I'm this poor sucker running around trying to fix this mess that you all made!<eos> You don't!<eos> You do not want to get into whose responsibility this is.<eos> You don't want to get into who's responsible for all of this.<eos> You don't!
We went behind his back long enough.<eos> Cristina, we should probably keep what's said in here private.<eos> Well, then count me out.<eos> I have a heart-lung transplant coming in.<eos> Oh, well, Karev's kid just got a kidney from U.N.O.S.<eos> Two transplants in one day?<eos> Three with Kepner's D.C.D.<eos> Three?<eos> That doesn't happen.<eos> Well, it did, okay?
I didn't want to kill anyone and I didn't want to be killed.<eos> I saw the men of this village go off to fight.<eos> I saw the courage it took for them to offer themselves up to suffering.<eos> None had the courage to reject suffering apart from you.<eos> What happened to Joe Middleton?<eos> Shot.<eos> At dawn.<eos> She doesn't love you.<eos> She loved my brother.<eos> She still does.
Danny, am I going to have to go into Witness Protection?<eos> - I won't do it.<eos> - I will not move to St. Paul and start over again as a travel agent.<eos> That is a dying industry.<eos> Okay, just because Stevie's Italian-American makes him a mobster?<eos> You know, guys, that's racist, so if you'll both excuse me.<eos> You know what?<eos> I am so sick of Italian people claiming to be offended by mob stuff.<eos> You obviously all love it!<eos> No, we don't.
Yeah.<eos> - Hey, there. - Hello.<eos> Good job walking in that straight line.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> You're one of those ritzy doctors<eos> - that works over at Shulman and associates?<eos> - I am.<eos> You must think you're so great, strutting around in your fancy clothes.<eos> No, I don't.
Then who paged me?<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Well, I noticed your patient has acute abdominal pain.<eos> Any chest pains?<eos> Because if you wanted to put her through the lodox for a full body scan, you could.<eos> If you wanted, you know, to... use the lodox.<eos> Do I need a full body scan?<eos> - It only takes 13 seconds.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> No, you don't.
No lodox. Thank you.<eos> So recently, the pain has been getting worse?<eos> - I thought I had the stomach flu.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> I drown myself in that sanitizer stuff, but when you're teaching kids, oh, they're just little germ bags.<eos> Ah, I've been out for a week.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, it's been great for me. I haven't taken a day off in 28 years.<eos> You know how many, um, cooking shows they have now?<eos> I don't.
Yeah.<eos> I'm just-<eos> - I'm really happy for Bailey.<eos> No, you're in pain.<eos> You've been standing all day.<eos> Here.<eos> Sit down.<eos> You know, I really- - I don't--<eos> I don't want to keep saying yes and then not following through with it, okay?<eos> I-I really don't.
You're not scared of this guy.<eos> No, I'm scared of Dr. Bailey.<eos> Hey, Karev.<eos> Think he's onto us?<eos> That was pretty funny today.<eos> Uh, the--the pranks, the drug test, the pages...<eos> You guys, you really got me.<eos> Yeah, well, the kid's got a little crush on, uh, Wilson.<eos> We were just having a little fun.<eos> Oh, the kid does.
Callie, I asked for an ortho consult, and they sent me to you.<eos> Weren't you supposed to leave hours ago?<eos> I was, but then... baked Alaska.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Well, hey, look at it this way.<eos> Now you have time to spice up your speech for next year.<eos> And I still need an ortho consult in O.R. three when you're done.<eos> Spice... spice up?<eos> No, I didn't say that.<eos> Uh... you did, though.
Sit.<eos> What?<eos> How?<eos> How?<eos> I made a call.<eos> We set up a video stream to the conference.<eos> You're going on live.<eos> Oh! I don't have my notes.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Yes. Yes, you do.
And...<eos> I've had a pretty bad year.<eos> I was almost killed in a car wreck.<eos> Then I... nearly lost my wife in an accident that claimed the life of my best friend and the father of my child.<eos> And... some other stuff.<eos> I'm an orthopedic surgeon by trade and I work with cartilage, so I've spent a lot of time thinking about what holds us together when things fall apart.<eos> I'm so sorry I haven't been to visit you more today.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Do you... do you believe that God plans for two people to be together?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Water...<eos> I need water.<eos> You are lucky I don't shove a hose down your throat and drown you.<eos> Where is she! ?<eos> Do you feel that?<eos> Calvin, whatever pain you are feeling right now, that's nothing compared to what you put me through for the last 3 years, do you understand me?<eos> Now, where is Amelia?<eos> Where is she!<eos> - I know that you know.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Or, as Mrs. Green, our neighbor, refers to it as, the best two minutes of her day.<eos> Hey, Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man.<eos> You know, everybody's life has failures, but the test of your character is how you respond to those failures.<eos> When life knocks you down, you don't lie on the canvas crying and overeating like Al Gore after the 2000 election.<eos> Boy, he blew up like the Hindenburg, didn't he?<eos> Look, you gotta get up and start swinging.<eos> Michael Jordan got cut as a sophomore from his high school varsity team.<eos> Don't know if you're aware of this, but that wasn't the last time he ever played basketball.<eos> J.K. Rowling had "Harry Potter" turned down by a dozen publishers.<eos> Did she Quidditch?
Now I want pie.<eos> Yeah, I knew it was a long shot.<eos> Honey, is this police thing serious?<eos> I mean, should we be getting Ryan a lawyer?<eos> No, no, no, they called to see if he would make an appointment to go see him.<eos> It's not like they're kicking the door down, pepper-spraying him, and hitting him like he's a piñata.<eos> You sound disappointed.<eos> I am.<eos> You pay the police salaries, you expect a certain level of service.<eos> He didn't do anything wrong.
The Rammer Jammer will be open in a couple days.<eos> Wade Kinsella and Lemon Breeland owning a business together?<eos> Better get used to living on muffins.<eos> Wade and Lemon are BlueBellians, and we will support them.<eos> But, you know, maybe we should all practice cooking our own breakfast, just in case.<eos> Man, we are going to be huge.<eos> I cannot believe that this is actually happening.<eos> And I agree: huge.<eos> And who cares that everybody thinks we're going to crash and burn, right?<eos> They do? Uh, yeah.
It's a pleasure doing business with you.<eos> We're not trying to play to the balcony.<eos> Just talk normal.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.<eos> - I assume that's our bust line.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Start hiring writers.<eos> So I'm in the middle of breakfast this morning, and I get a call from FBI ops asking why they haven't been informed that we're running a reverse on a Vzakonye dealer.<eos> Imagine my surprise since I didn't know we had a Vzakonye dealer.<eos> We don't.
I didn't let her take them.<eos> Man: You heard the lady.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's time to go home.<eos> - She's so hot.<eos> - There's that chick.<eos> I'm telling you, man.<eos> If you hadn't gone all a-hole on her, I totally had a shot with that shot girl.<eos> [ Laughing ] Yeah.<eos> Sure, you did, man.
shrimping.<eos> Jim:<eos> Did anyone see you?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> The moon.<eos> And some gators.<eos> Okay, then how'd your fingerprints end up on this bottle of Graydon's in Jimmy's R.V.?<eos> Same bottle that somebody spiked with shrimp, knowing that he'd, uh, throw a shot back at midnight after finishing work on his hog, sho' nuff.<eos> You got me.<eos> Well, I do, Landon, on camera.
Okay, now open them.<eos> Barney, I swear to God, if I open my eyes and your bare ass is an inch away from my face again...<eos> Just open your eyes.<eos> Ted, I'd like you to meet 20-Years-From-Now-Barney.<eos> 20-Years-From-Now-Barney, you remember Ted.<eos> 'Sup?<eos> Hey, Ted.<eos> What's this I hear-slash-remember about you not wanting to see Robots vs. Wrestlers?<eos> Yeah, it's just that I don't want to see it.<eos> - You don't...

That's my job.<eos> And I love it. (whispers):<eos> Topsy.<eos> Hmm?<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> (whispers): Tooooopsssyyyyy.<eos> Are you saying Top Chef?<eos> I think he said Topsy.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> (whispers): Yes, I did.
"Messenger of God."<eos> "Messenger of God." Dean, we have to go there.<eos> On that hunch?<eos> You can barely function.<eos> I'm only gonna get worse.<eos> I mean, until I get back to the real job, until we find the third trial -- we're out of Prophets!<eos> We're not gonna figure out what Kevin couldn't!<eos> I say we go to this messenger of God who wrote it in the first place!<eos> And you think that this Metatron is hiding out in the mountains with a bunch of Indians?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.
You know they're gonna shut the door on Hell?<eos> I'm not worried, kid.<eos> You have no idea what's on this demon tablet, all right, the power you could have gotten with this if you weren't running around like a chicken with his head cut off.<eos> You think I can't make you tell?<eos> I know you can't, and you do, too.<eos> You know what?<eos> I've already won.<eos> I have the Angel Tablet, you little smudge.<eos> And I got deals and plans up the jacksie.<eos> And I don't...
Ms. Swift, hello.<eos> I'm supposed to be in the ladies' room.<eos> Just down the hall.<eos> Colin fires lawyers once a week.<eos> But he's kept you on.<eos> You're probably the most successful relationship in his life.<eos> - I wouldn't call it a relationship.<eos> - He talks about you.<eos> Don't you want to know how he talks about you?<eos> No, actually, I don't.
Uh, it's getting dark.<eos> I better go in the tent and do base camp stuff.<eos> (Gene yelling)<eos> Oh, no!<eos> The tent's running away.<eos> Oh, get back here with base camp, Gene!<eos> I don't want to!<eos> Helen said she'll get you crackers!<eos> HELEN:<eos> No, I didn't!
"but bears it out even to the edge of doom.<eos> "If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved."<eos> Now please join us in the dining room for dinner.<eos> Beverly, it's so good to see you again.<eos> We just love having your daughter back in our lives.<eos> Julian, it looks like you haven't changed a bit.<eos> I'll see you at dinner.<eos> Wow.<eos> Your mom still hates me.<eos> She does not.
Unbelievable.<eos> Weren't you just here?<eos> We have an afternoon session, too.<eos> We've got yoga and then we've got therapy, and...<eos> Not too late to join.<eos> Uh, I'm kind of in the middle of handling a major crisis here, if you haven't noticed.<eos> Oh, I noticed.<eos> You're early.<eos> Yeah, well, Dominic says on time is late.<eos> Yes, he does.
[ Sighs ] For too long.<eos> [ Exhales sharply ] And so have you.<eos> So have you.<eos> You and I are nothing alike.<eos> You have reached the voicemail of Detective Sarah Linden.<eos> Linden, pick up your damn phone!<eos> ...as soon as I can. [ Beep ]<eos> Call me back.<eos> You think you know what this is, Sarah?<eos> You don't.
If I can just get you to remember how you felt about her...<eos> I don't want to remember.<eos> I mean, why do you care so much?<eos> Do you remember how we first met?<eos> It was 1864.<eos> Stefan had just killed you father, made you turn into a vampire, and he was killing his way through Mystic Falls.<eos> You hated him.<eos> Rightfully so, but before you left, you asked me to help him because no matter what happened, he was still your brother, and you cared about him.<eos> Now you need help, and he cares about you.<eos> We both do.
Privacy, I guess.<eos> There's no shame in it.<eos> Do the kids know yet?<eos> - We told them last night.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Well, you know, if you need anything, you don't hesitate to ask me, okay?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dad, I want you to come home.<eos> We both do.
Right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Too soft.<eos> It sags in the middle.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You would think they would spring for a decent bed.<eos> But I guess that's kind of the point, right?<eos> No matter where you are, no matter what city or town, you're always in the same place, the same shitty room... here.<eos> You got anything salty, pretzels or nuts or something?<eos> Uh, no, I-I don't.
- Hi.<eos> I'm Bill.<eos> Uh, this is my wife, Elaine.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you as well.<eos> So nice to meet you both.<eos> I can see the family resemblance.<eos> - That's what people say.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, they do.
And I-I get it.<eos> I get it.<eos> You see us together, and you think, "it seems easy."<eos> That's not it.<eos> You're their mother.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - Right.<eos> [ Sighs ]<eos> We have to follow orders.<eos> - No, we don't.
But sometimes the Centre sees a pot of gold, and they can't keep their hands in their pockets.<eos> You should get Philip and Elizabeth out of this, Arkady.<eos> They just stabbed you in the back.<eos> You care so much about them?<eos> So long as I still have this job, I'm responsible for my officers.<eos> You're responsible for them, too.<eos> This is happening in one hour, Claudia.<eos> It means I would have to abort the mission on my own.<eos> - You have that authority.<eos> - I do?
Well, go upstairs and get you some more.<eos> What I want you to do for me when you get back to Southfork is I want you to pack your things.<eos> Will you do that for me?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't hear you.<eos> Yes.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Court now calls case F13-75634, the State of Texas vs. Roy Vickers.<eos> Mr. Vickers, do you understand that you're being charged with conspiracy to commit capital murder and for transporting counterfeit goods?<eos> - I do.
I don't follow.<eos> Well, they say opposites attract, right?<eos> Well, that ain't the case with us.<eos> You and I play the same game.<eos> We scheme, we seduce, we betray, and we've done all the above to each other a few times over.<eos> That was then.<eos> Who's to say it ain't gonna happen again?<eos> Hell, who's to say it ain't happening right now?<eos> I say.<eos> Sure you do.
Mm.<eos> We sent her away, Frankie.<eos> Shipped her off to a fix-it camp.<eos> Camp Tantrum.<eos> They call it Camp Tant-a-Rum, but we all know what it is.<eos> Lucy's gonna be so pissed when she gets home.<eos> I'm scared, Frankie.<eos> I'm so scared.<eos> I had no idea. Oh! (Crying)<eos> I really didn't.
Everybody stared.<eos> Like I was a freak.<eos> I rang Dean.<eos> He came and got me.<eos> I just wanted a break from being sad.<eos> I loved Danny.<eos> You know I loved him.<eos> But I need a break from being the dead boy's sister.<eos> It's suffocating me and I know you can't understand that.<eos> No, we do.

Yeah.<eos> And what did that person do?<eos> He carried the body off the boat... .. and laid it on the beach.<eos> Then he got back on the boat and went off.<eos> Which direction?<eos> West.<eos> And did you recognise the person that laid Danny's body on the beach?<eos> Susan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Depends on what you're willing to pay.<eos> The going rate for benzos is $5 a pop.<eos> I could use 50.<eos> Looks like you're a little light.<eos> Of course, I'm... sure we can work something out.<eos> Ah, damn.<eos> You bit me.<eos> I thought you boys liked it rough.<eos> You want more?<eos> Damn right, I do.
Yeah, that is interesting, Sue Ellen.<eos> It's very interesting.<eos> But you know what I think is even more interesting than that?<eos> Is why Ken would bring this to you when he knows that if he were to do that, he'd find himself in some serious trouble of his own.<eos> I gave him my word I'd protect him.<eos> Well, that's very nice of you.<eos> It was completely delusional, but it was very nice.<eos> Now, you know damn well that if you do anything with this report... Anything at all...<eos> There'll be nothing stopping me from taking Ken down.<eos> I do.
We're the show to beat.<eos> And the key to staying that way is marketing.<eos> Subways, billboards...<eos> This fabulous ad that you took out in the times.<eos> I didn't place a full-page ad in the Times.<eos> Then who did?<eos> Jerry.<eos> Don't get upset.<eos> We need all the help we can get.<eos> Not from him we don't.
We can deal with it together, you and me.<eos> I...<eos> I'm already late.<eos> I have to...<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'll see you there?<eos> [Indistinct chatter]<eos> I can't believe everyone showed up even after you called to cancel.<eos> We didn't.
Are we doing the right thing?<eos> We've been Houston and Levitt for so long,<eos> I don't know how to be just Houston.<eos> Me neither.<eos> I think that's why it's the right thing.<eos> To us.<eos> To us.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> It worked.<eos> Of course it did.
I'm sorry.<eos> Karen told me the story, okay?<eos> What story?<eos> You know, how he wanted to sleep with her, and she said no, but then you did, and you got the part.<eos> Is that what Karen said?<eos> - What else did she tell you?<eos> - No...<eos> I'm not blaming you.<eos> It's Derek who's doing something wrong, and I'm trying to stop it before it happens again.<eos> Hey, Ivy, you don't...
You should know that our encounter with the wine did not go well.<eos> Stay away from him, Tom.<eos> You've done enough damage.<eos> Eileen. Thought you'd be wearing black today.<eos> No, Jerry, I'm saving it for your funeral.<eos> - Hey. You're looking uncommonly radiant.<eos> [Chuckles] Did you get your hair done, or something?<eos> Don't try to make me feel better, Derek.<eos> I know everybody hates me.<eos> Well, I don't.
Couldn't leave him with one friend, could you?<eos> So everybody knows what's in that letter except for me?<eos> Yes, it's six against one.<eos> Stand down, sir.<eos> How could you do this?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If you want, we could tell you.<eos> No, I don't want to know!<eos> I mean,<eos> I do, but...
Um, listen...<eos> I know Ruby's back, and she's bringing you picnics and making googly eyes at you, but before you make any decisions, you should know I'm throwing my hat in the ring, too.<eos> I don't have a picnic, or, at this second, a hat, but I can get both.<eos> So... Anyway.<eos> Yours is the only hat in the ring, Annabeth.<eos> Ruby left.<eos> See, uh, I told her I had feelings for someone else.<eos> You did?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You do?
- No.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - This is kind of a hard place to get into.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I only got in 'cause I told 'em that my teenage daughter was trapped inside.<eos> I don't have a teenage daughter.<eos> I'm not old enough.<eos> Not interested in having children anytime soon.<eos> Maybe one day. Whoa.<eos> Did you just... me?
Shut up.<eos> I am so into minerals!<eos> God, now I have more questions.<eos> This place is amazing.<eos> Oh, my God. [Laughs]<eos> - What?<eos> - Danny!<eos> Do you have a dandruff problem, Danny?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Sometimes, I do.
I don't know what you're doing to him, but, I mean, everyone is over at his house at a party.<eos> I have never seen that side of him.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I've been working really hard to open him up.<eos> Yeah, I think his ex-wife really did a number on him.<eos> Wait.<eos> Uh, Danny has an ex-wife?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You knew about that.<eos> No, I didn't.
What?<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Ma'am, the White House released this picture.<eos> What?<eos> No, no. This isn't...<eos> Amy, this isn't the photo that we approved.<eos> - No.<eos> - Look at this.<eos> It looks like I'm tweeting when a guy loses his leg.<eos> Yeah, it does, ma'am.
That doesn't mean that it can't be twisted into something horrible and nightmare-inducing.<eos> What about the Chinese?<eos> Did you scrub our footprints?<eos> I got three teams on it.<eos> - Well done.<eos> - [Sighs]<eos> I understand you were successful.<eos> - I hate when he does that.<eos> - You have the prion?<eos> We do.
She owes her life to Telemachus.<eos> He managed to convince the assembly.<eos> You followed your heart.<eos> Your son isn't a warrior, but he can use his tongue.<eos> He's like you.<eos> You too have a way with words.<eos> Words betrayed me.<eos> Homer, tell them one of my adventures, in your words.<eos> He alone understands me.<eos> But you, my dear friend, you no longer do.
He's my son and yours.<eos> Kings have no more sons, no more friends... no more wife.<eos> He promised to take me far away.<eos> He said we'd be happy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Ulysses has gone completely crazy.<eos> He doesn't trust anyone.<eos> And he kills everyone I love.<eos> - I understand your sadness.<eos> - No, you don't.
- Bless you.<eos> - God bless you, son.<eos> Don't be late.<eos> - When will you be back? - l don't know.<eos> - Hurry up, Deusa.<eos> - l am hurrying I have things to do in there.<eos> Are you bringing Tuca over today?<eos> Today's your day to stay with him. What time should I bring him?<eos> - Just let me know first, okay?<eos> - l did, Clecio.
Everyone.<eos> And stay away from that dealer, he's not the man for you, Paulete.<eos> Getting high and going wild is one thing... but having that guy in here is another.<eos> No one wants him here, no one.<eos> He's trouble, he's jailbait.<eos> And stop saying that I'm robbing from you guys.<eos> Cut that out, ok?<eos> You see, Clecinho, see?<eos> - l never said that, Clecinho.<eos> - You did.
Actually, I was wondering if I could take some pictures inside, too.<eos> My wife's great-grandmother used to live here.<eos> Her name's Norma June Mayfair.<eos> What the hell do you want?<eos> Nothing.<eos> We don't want anything.<eos> We'll leave.<eos> We're leaving.<eos> Why did you say my name?<eos> I didn't.
I think so.<eos> Where should we feed Dame Nellie on Sunday?<eos> She can't eat in the servants' hall.<eos> And what about the pianist?<eos> Well, he can join us and she can have a tray in her room.<eos> You don't think she should dine with the house party?<eos> An Australian singer?<eos> Eating with her ladyship?<eos> Never mind the Duchess!<eos> No, I do not!
Absolutely.<eos> Yeah, you never know, right?<eos> I should get back to work.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> Thanks for the hot dog.<eos> All right, there we go.<eos> There's the little peach pit.<eos> Holy crap, there he is!<eos> He looks just like you, baby.<eos> He kind of does, doesn't he?
- Yeah.<eos> Rick from sales is moving to our Columbus office.<eos> Well, I want it.<eos> No, I need somebody with experience.<eos> This is about our night in the tent.<eos> - I can assure you it is not.<eos> - But I've been here for months.<eos> My temp position's ending, and I'm ready.<eos> I would love to keep you around, but Uncle Matt's not gonna let me hire someone who doesn't have a proven track record.<eos> Which all those people out there do, okay?
I know what I risk.<eos> You could sink your steel into me -<eos> to the hilt - if you wished.<eos> My lady.<eos> His Holiness, Your Majesty, my lords.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen -<eos> Pray open the dance.<eos> Such delights!<eos> Your sister looks quite entrancing, does she not?<eos> She does.
And if judicial impropriety is proven, I will take every appropriate measure to secure a presidential pardon for David Clarke.<eos> Uh, uh... Uh...<eos> Next question, please.<eos> I can't believe that you dragged David Clarke into the conversation one week before the election.<eos> (Conrad) Well, I was double tapped with a rogue question.<eos> I gave the only answer I knew would stop their next salvo.<eos> "Their"?<eos> I thought you believed that Kenny Ryan<eos> - was behind the stunt.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
Where'd you go?<eos> I'm not saying a word.<eos> (Church bell tolling)<eos> Thank you for seeing me, sister.<eos> (Woman) You realize that the decision you make is permanent and that a vow is sacrosanct.<eos> Once taken, I shall never break it.<eos> I do, sister.<eos> Then I promise to find your son the best possible home and never to tell him who his mother is.<eos> You forgot the last promise.<eos> I didn't.
How do I look?<eos> Exactly like your father did when we got married.<eos> Except handsome and skinny.<eos> Come on, Colleen, the ceremony's about to start.<eos> Let's go to our "hot mothers of the grooms" seats and scope out which cater waiters we're gonna schtup.<eos> Uh, I'm-I'm so sorry, but I-I'm gonna be walking Bryan down the aisle.<eos> Why didn't anyone tell me?<eos> I would've worn something more revealing had I known I'd be part of the processional.<eos> You got to put the fresh produce at the front of the grocery store, if you know what I mean.<eos> I do.
I got it.<eos> Penny, the Drake is the best place to get married in Chicago.<eos> I mean, Oprah and Stedman have had it reserved for 17 years. Okay, slow down.<eos> Pete and I are very happy with the wedding that we have planned.<eos> Speaking of Pete,<eos> I called him and I invited him on a fishing trip.<eos> - Oh. - Seems like a future father-in-law kind of thing to do, you know?<eos> Do you think it's too soon to ask him to call me "dad"?<eos> Yeah, Roy.<eos> I do.
I may write a paper.<eos> I find it highly unlikely that Starfleet would allow such a paper to be published. Based on the highly sensitive subject matter. Of course.<eos> Well regardless, gentlemen.<eos> Apollo learnt what it took our respective peoples centuries to discover.<eos> Self sacrifice is the best way to live. Benefiting both the giver and the reciever.<eos> If I had an entire culture worshipping at my feet on bended knee...<eos> I'm not so sure I'd be in a hurry to change things either.<eos> Well, one thing's clear.<eos> They sure did love humanity.<eos> Apollo still does.
You can't force me.<eos> What do you prefer? Therapy, or a mental institution?<eos> It's for your own good.<eos> It can't hurt to try.<eos> What about my money?<eos> I thought we might donate it to a charity. Like one that helps prostitutes.<eos> Great idea.<eos> Assholes!<eos> It was a shock, I didn't understand.<eos> I still don't.
Give it to me, then.<eos> Well, they are going to test you.<eos> Oh, they are.<eos> But, by 'eck. It's the day after tomorrow.<eos> They don't give you much time.<eos> Oh, this was posted 10 days ago.<eos> It must've got lost.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> He knows his stuff.<eos> Course he does.
Mr Green.<eos> Lord Gillingham's valet.<eos> She swore it wasn't.<eos> No, it wasn't him.<eos> She said a man... ..broke in and was waiting down here for you, a stranger.<eos> That's right.<eos> Because, if it was the valet... ..he is a dead man.<eos> It wasn't him!<eos> You only say that because you didn't like him.<eos> No, I did not.
I retract the vesicouterine fold to expose this shiny, grapefruit-sized mass here, which is the uterus.<eos> Number 10 scalpel.<eos> Is that the end of the lesson?<eos> Dr. Langham.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> No. No. I'm fine.<eos> I-I was just, uh... Listening to our exam room.<eos> There's some money trading hands about what's going on in there.<eos> - I don't know if you knew that.<eos> - I didn't.
She's probably right.<eos> I'm still getting out from under the meds that they gave me.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause you so much as even squawk about God in here, and you get thrown in with the Looney Toons.<eos> Yeah. Well, liberals are everywhere.<eos> Yeah. Well, they ain't wrong, you know?<eos> About what?<eos> Oh, this girl, Chapman?<eos> She made me believe that he'd chose me.<eos> He didn't.
Bennett!<eos> I need to talk about grocery money.<eos> Behold!<eos> I bring the lost sheep back to the 99.<eos> All right, as you know, we don't have a river to dunk you in, but we cleaned out the muck sink.<eos> And yeah, you might just wanna take off your shirt.<eos> Okay! Nope, see, I can't do this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I really want us to get along, I do, but I can't pretend to believe in something I don't.<eos> And I don't.
Oh... chess match begins again.<eos> Trouble is this time I don't want to play.<eos> You have nothing to offer me.<eos> Remember our mutual friend, Naseem Vaziri?<eos> He took it off.<eos> One joint at a time.<eos> You can't play chess with a dead man.<eos> I need you... to broker a weapons deal for me.<eos> I said... you have nothing to offer me, Agent G. Callen.<eos> But I do.
Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, how dreadful!<eos> Poor Clive.<eos> At least he didn't suffer.<eos> Oh, he did.
What did you have for breakfast?<eos> Pancakes.<eos> Lucky.<eos> Pancakes? !<eos> Sheesh.<eos> How'd you sleep last night?<eos> Okay, I guess.<eos> If you sleep well the first night, it means you're in a good place.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I just do.
Oh, there's no need to apologize.<eos> Yeah, none at all.<eos> Because you didn't ruin it.<eos> Do you, Alan, take Jennifer...<eos> Uh, actually it's Adam.<eos> Ah. Do you, Alan, take Adam...<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> That's a little officiating humor.<eos> Do you, Adam, take Jennifer to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Been hiding that box for nine years.<eos> I thought you were the only one that knew of its existence.<eos> But after the gunfire ended, the box was missing, and this was in its place.<eos> "Drop the case.<eos> You have until tonight""<eos> (breathing heavily) What case?<eos> I'm investigating a security leak inside CBI.<eos> The leak will turn the Tupperware over to authorities if I don't back off.<eos> You know what'll happen if they unseal that box.<eos> I do.

My point is, he opened the safe, and he saw a Tupperware box.<eos> Which was stolen this morning.<eos> To blackmail LaRoche into dropping his investigation.<eos> What investigation?<eos> Well, apparently there's a security leak inside the CBI.<eos> Well, maybe your thief took it.<eos> No, LaRoche's new safe is way out of his league.<eos> In any case, the missing plasticware has the power to end LaRoche's career.<eos> And you really don't know what's inside?<eos> (Chuckles) No, I-I don't.
Oh... call me Sean, my boy--Sean.<eos> Well, I haven't seen you since you were, what?<eos> 15?<eos> You haven't changed a bit.<eos> And you've brought a policewoman with you.<eos> Great pleasure to meet you, young lady.<eos> Come on upstairs and let's catch up.<eos> I've been following your doings, Patrick.<eos> I know why you're here.<eos> Well, of course you do.
How is it he seems to read your mind?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Red John's got powers.<eos> Real psychic powers that you refuse to believe in.<eos> Teresa will hear what I'm saying, but you've no faith, so you're deaf to the truth.<eos> He's got powers.<eos> That's why he'll always defeat you.<eos> So I take it you have no alibi for the night before last.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Clever.<eos> If you're willing.<eos> Of course.<eos> Splendid.<eos> Great.<eos> A little girl has been left at the CPS offices in Carson Springs.<eos> I am trying to confirm I.D. as Caitlyn Turner, and you're listed as one of the contacts.<eos> Does Caitlyn have a small birthmark on her left arm?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, she does.
Didn't he just retire? A month ago.<eos> 30 years in the arson unit, and he gets shot on vacation.<eos> Nervous about testifying?<eos> I've only done it once.<eos> All Cavanaugh and I have to do is establish chain of custody to get Paddy's ledger admitted into evidence.<eos> I'll be glad when you get rid of that copy of his damn book.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> No.<eos> - And you don't want to.<eos> - Yes, I do.
You're gonna stay alive, but without her.<eos> Come on, Sean.<eos> Give me minute, Vince.<eos> You know, I never thought I'd say this, but these sweet potato fries are growing on me.<eos> Try them with a fresh mint.<eos> Don't push your luck.<eos> Speaking of luck-pushing, he totally could have pulled that trigger.<eos> No, he wasn't going to.<eos> [SCOFFS] You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Yeah, but I've had this exact fantasy loads, right?<eos> And what we do is we give her my room and then I come in with you. Ah, no.<eos> No, no, we are not sharing a bed.<eos> Yeah, but we won't have to, not for long.<eos> Because, right, here's the genius bit.<eos> Oh, I'm glad there's a genius bit.<eos> There is. After, like, one or two nights me and her get it on and then I get my room back anyway.<eos> And what if she doesn't fancy you?<eos> What? One - she's filthy.<eos> Two - she does.
Shredder, do you mind?<eos> What's that?<eos> I don't want you looking at me when I'm eating it.<eos> Oh, right, shall I? No, stay. Just turn around.<eos> You have to peel it.<eos> I know, I know you have to peel it.<eos> They're high in energy and, erm, yellow.<eos> Do you like them?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
No!<eos> No!<eos> Shoot the glass!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Put down the knife.<eos> Drop your guns, or I'll gut her.<eos> Oh, God, help me.<eos> Phillip, you don't want to do this.<eos> You don't know what I want.<eos> Actually, I do.
How do you feel?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> All right, good. Let's do it.<eos> You're late, Hotchner.<eos> Sorry. Sorry, I got held up by the cops.<eos> You what?<eos> They called.<eos> They wanted to ask a few more questions.<eos> Oh, they did, did they?
Hotchner.<eos> Aaron.<eos> Sean, you need to come in.<eos> We think you may be in danger from the unsub.<eos> He's targeting Edinburgh employees.<eos> Yeah, I heard about Jim Peters.<eos> Look, I didn't kill him.<eos> I know that.<eos> I also know why you ran.<eos> Of course you do.
Garcia, where's Feretich now?<eos> At the airport.<eos> All right, notify Morgan and Reid.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Larry Feretich?<eos> FBI.<eos> Larry Feretich, you're under arrest for the murder of--<eos> He killed my daughter!<eos> He killed Megan!<eos> No, he didn't.
I had to push 'em away.<eos> I wouldn't even know what to say to 'em.<eos> Well, you better think of something fast.<eos> We got you surrounded.<eos> What are they doing here?<eos> They're hoping to talk to the man they used to know.<eos> Danny.<eos> Sis, look, we couldn't move on Trevor Holt until we got all our ducks in a row, which meant connecting him to the first victim.<eos> And you did.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Oh, it's so good to see you.<eos> Yeah, it's good to see you, too, Mrs. Desai.<eos> Well, well, two days back, and you've certainly had your share of female visitors, sweetheart.<eos> Visitors?<eos> As in, um, plural?<eos> As in... as in two.<eos> Lacey ended up staying the night here.<eos> Oh.<eos> Wow.<eos> You guys didn't...?
My conference ends today.<eos> I could talk to the parents about the program before I go back to Oklahoma.<eos> And if they're against it?<eos> Then I'd advise that they get a safe room.<eos> We did your interviews.<eos> We put Henry through your tests.<eos> And do you know what the result is?<eos> He's worse!<eos> He kicked a hole in his bedroom door!<eos> I don't even--
It feels really good having you inside me.<eos> And by "you," I mean your voice.<eos> And by "me," I mean my ear.<eos> I'm gonna stop talking right now.<eos> That would be my preference.<eos> One stack of High Society, please.<eos> Thank you for stopping by.<eos> Of course.<eos> Uh, you said you had news.<eos> I do.
That you're scared again.<eos> No.<eos> That's not it.<eos> Then will you tell me what's going on with you?<eos> There are so many things that I have wanted to tell you for so long.<eos> I never told you what happened to me on the island.<eos> You didn't have to.<eos> I can see that it changed you.<eos> That's the thing.<eos> Laurel, it didn't.
So, I'm a little, uh... foggy on how I got home last night.<eos> Blonde detective, Deb...?<eos> McKenzie.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> (sighs) Oh. Yeah, right, McKenzie.<eos> She was at that charity function.<eos> I saw her at the bar.<eos> I don't think I've ever seen you so lit.<eos> I tried to do my partner a favor... and it backfired.<eos> Did I, um... did I do anything inappropriate in any way?
Okay, look, I wrote this letter years ago, okay?<eos> I was all pumped up from the Chinese drums at the Beijing Olympics.<eos> But I don't feel that way anymore about you.<eos> Danny, deny it all you want, but sooner or later you're coming back here.<eos> And that's not even your favorite one.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> You guys got a sec?<eos> Because someone went in my office and thought it was his or her right to stir up a hornet's nest with his or her Mindy stick.<eos> Oh! I didn't send the letter.<eos> Oh, you didn't?
Would they sing Kumbaya?<eos> No, Brendan thinks Kumbaya is a negro spiritual<eos> - that's been co-opted by white camping culture. - Ugh.<eos> Listen, doc, doc,<eos> I'm gonna join the practice.<eos> What?<eos> I'm with you guys again, only because of the fight.<eos> 'Cause this guy said I was his brother.<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> Oh, no, no, you did.
Tell him, the noose is tightened.<eos> And I warn you.<eos> Race betrayal is a crime.<eos> It's dangerous to have a jewish friend if you want to achieve something here.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You mean, more dangerous than having an affair with a german<eos> if you have a wife and daughter?<eos> Do you have the papers?<eos> I need a photograph.<eos> Did you for...
- No, I will have some rest.<eos> You should ask your father to examine you.<eos> You should have called. I have work.<eos> And if you came to...<eos> I don't care about you eating meat.<eos> It's about my marriage. I fixed Maurice's troubles.<eos> I talked to the General.<eos> It's all good. That moron won't go to prison.<eos> The General is a libertine.<eos> You didn't...
The update is the man that we have in custody probably did not do it.<eos> I'm not sure that's exactly what they're looking for.<eos> There's the mother.<eos> Mrs. Walton.<eos> I don't understand what's going on here.<eos> Why did you take my son?<eos> - Do I need to get a lawyer?<eos> - Follow me.<eos> I'm sure there has to be some type of mistake here.<eos> My son didn't do anything wrong.
Maybe someone's setting me up. I don't know, I've been here.<eos> Who else has access?<eos> Someone in the building?<eos> A friend?<eos> Another programmer?<eos> (Tom):<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Mom...<eos> - The codes...<eos> You didn't...
- Yeah!<eos> - Oh. Why?<eos> Well, I know you're only in town for a short amount of time and I really wanted to get to know you better, but I actually told Sandy that I would go to this play with her tonight.<eos> In fact, I promised, so...<eos> - Oz, you really don't...<eos> - I actually do.<eos> I'm sorry, Bill.<eos> I can't go with you to the show.<eos> I think you're making a good choice.<eos> - You do?
- Oh. Why?<eos> Well, I know you're only in town for a short amount of time and I really wanted to get to know you better, but I actually told Sandy that I would go to this play with her tonight.<eos> In fact, I promised, so...<eos> - Oz, you really don't...<eos> - I actually do.<eos> I'm sorry, Bill.<eos> I can't go with you to the show.<eos> I think you're making a good choice.<eos> - You do?<eos> - I do.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Callie, this is Lena.<eos> Lena, Callie.<eos> I guess I could take her to one of the group homes.<eos> It's just for a few weeks, right?<eos> So, Mariana and Jesus were in the foster program, too.<eos> They came to us about eight years ago, and we formally adopted them five years ago.<eos> - Foster system sucks. - Jesus...<eos> [Mariana] He's right.<eos> It kind of does.
- Well, Vasquez was a pain in my ass!<eos> - Amen!<eos> Sacramento can have him.<eos> Right now, since both of you are partnerless, starting tomorrow, I'm going to pair you up with Mike here.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> - Is that a problem?<eos> No, that's not a problem.<eos> - May I ask why?<eos> - I asked.<eos> - You did?
Ryan, how are you gonna celebrate?<eos> My friend Steven's taking me out<eos> - for a steak dinner.<eos> - Oh.<eos> No, thanks. [Chuckles]<eos> Wyatt has me on a very strict no-red-meat diet, and I don't miss it at all.<eos> Beef, steak, meatballs-- I don't even think about it.<eos> French dip, hot dogs, meatballs.<eos> - You said meatballs already.<eos> - Did I?
You won't tell us your last name.<eos> We don't know why you're in this group.<eos> You know, Anne, unlike your generation, who's all about your Facebook updates and your sexting, I choose to keep a few things private.<eos> All right, everybody.<eos> See you in a little bit.<eos> "S.I.T.A.T.A.W.Y.D."?<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> [Gasps] Oh, man.<eos> It's K. I want answers.<eos> We all do.
That's okay.<eos> What about Kathleen?<eos> What about Lizzie?<eos> You two got along.<eos> Oh, I forgot about Lizzie.<eos> You know, I don't want to leave our kids with somebody you forgot about.<eos> Well, she's the alternate.<eos> Well, it's a disaster plan.<eos> Most disasters don't happen.<eos> They do to us.
Holmes really isn't coming, huh?<eos> No.<eos> He wants to take care of Irene.<eos> I mean, if things were normal, I'd say, there's no way he sits out an entire investigation, but right now, who knows?<eos> He's really thrown by all this.<eos> Yeah, well, that makes two of us.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> You believe this guy is real?<eos> Moriarty?<eos> I do.
I promise you, if you don't burn me with that hot acid, I will spend the rest of my life making sure no one ever tries to take your eggs again.<eos> Sound good?<eos> Well, I guess that's that.<eos> I'm telling you, up close, face-to-face, it was much more ferocious.<eos> I'm just saying, one of us was there and one of us wasn't.<eos> That's it.<eos> Now do the teeth and the hot, dripping acid.<eos> Perfect.<eos> - You know, Fishlegs...<eos> - I do, Hiccup.
That was your wife.<eos> She wants to meet for coffee to talk about your birthday.<eos> My birthday's not for two more months.<eos> Yeah, I think it's a little weird.<eos> She doesn't know about us.<eos> There's no way.<eos> See ya, baby.<eos> Old photos.<eos> Yeah, I thought she might like to see them.<eos> And she did.
This Tiffany lapel pin-- Claudia's husband said it was hers.<eos> Edward, your record indicates you've been living off your sticky fingers for a while now, am I right?<eos> You know, I got a lot of friends like you, stealing for bare essentials... sleeping in rooms with no heat, under paper-thin blankets, and bitter as hell at folks like the Drexlers for what they take for granted every day.<eos> Makes sense you want some for yourself, man.<eos> Absolutely not the case here.<eos> Did she catch you lifting this pin?<eos> Did she threaten to turn you in?<eos> Is that what happened?<eos> The key to my sobriety is reliance on a power greater than myself, you know what I mean?<eos> Yeah, I do.
So Claudia Drexler, former drug addict, embraced her past and ended up helping a lot of people.<eos> And then there's you, with your thieving' youth and your knowledge of junkie behavior.<eos> You do realize that's what broke the case, right?<eos> Right.<eos> The silver lining.<eos> Why don't you pay off that loan shark and straighten things out with your mother?<eos> Thank you, but...<eos> I can't take your money, Don.<eos> You don't want to be judged by your past.<eos> Neither does she.
Truthfully?<eos> Yes.<eos> I used to think you were uppity, barging into a man's world.<eos> Until I started working there myself.<eos> Well I can live with uppity.<eos> But someone has to ask the hard questions about Dieppe.<eos> My son fought there, Mrs. Shannon.<eos> I know.<eos> And I was relieved to hear that Stanley survived.<eos> I do my homework.
Bernie?<eos> - Oh, hi, Shirley.<eos> - Hello, Annie.<eos> Abed seems to be having a good time, which is all that matters.<eos> You're right.<eos> Looks like he made the right choice.<eos> He certainly did.<eos> So, we agree.<eos> The best woman won.<eos> She certainly did.
The branch manager found her a few minutes after 9:00 when he arrived to open the vault.<eos> Initial indication puts time of death between 8:50 and 8:55 A.M. this morning.<eos> That's very specific.<eos> What can I say?<eos> I'm good at what I do.<eos> And security footage shows her entering the vault at 8:46, and she was found a few minutes later.<eos> Wait, we have the murder on tape?<eos> Why didn't you say so?<eos> My work here is done.<eos> Because we don't.
I will endeavor not to crash the car.<eos> ( Train rattling )<eos> ( sniffling )<eos> ( sneezes )<eos> I'm selling hydrangeas, George, not the grippe.<eos> No, sir.<eos> Allergies.<eos> Give.<eos> Mostly everyone paid.<eos> And them that didn't?
Get your fucking John and Timothy ass...<eos> See what I struggle with?<eos> 10% of the club.<eos> The acts come back, the other problem goes away, and it's 10%.<eos> That's a fair price.<eos> You're going to pay it.<eos> That's... that's my judgment.<eos> Do you accept?<eos> ( Scoffs )<eos> I do.
Where can I find a better voice-activated search machine?<eos> Oh, I can't please any woman.<eos> Milhouse, I'm not sure why you left me in the forest, so I made cookies.<eos> But I didn't know what kind you liked, so I made seven kinds.<eos> I've become my mother.<eos> Well, common sense never goes out of style.<eos> That was too easy.<eos> Lisa!<eos> Did you see Marlon Brando in "Mutiny on the Bounty"?<eos> No, nobody did.
To the contrary, you've only revealed part of the truth.<eos> I owe you nothing.<eos> You want the whole truth?<eos> I know a great deal more than you think.<eos> I know that Sutter was your target all along. I know that you had him under surveillance.<eos> I know that you didn't want to reveal that surveillance to the authorities, so you utilized me to expose him.<eos> You're slipping, Holmes.<eos> I'm referring to the truth about Leah Sutter's murder.<eos> Wallace Rourke killed her.<eos> No, in fact, he did not.
Nope, still in the wind.<eos> 48 hours trying to I.D. his girlfriend, and nothing.<eos> You'll get him.<eos> Yeah, well, case is getting colder by the day.<eos> Is that Mom's fault?<eos> I wonder where he got that idea.<eos> No, Sean, it's not your mother's fault.<eos> Well, that's nice to hear.<eos> You really believe that?<eos> I do. Big difference between medical decisions and police decisions.
Sliding weight in the nose, a little give in the seat.<eos> That would be cheating, Pop.<eos> Relax.<eos> The car will pass inspection.<eos> We'll just have a competitive edge.<eos> That's what's special about the Henry Special.<eos> You gonna tell Sean?<eos> Course not.<eos> He needs to have plausible deniability.<eos> Just like you did.
Sorry?<eos> This lot. UNIT.<eos> They investigate alien stuff, anything alien.<eos> What, like you?<eos> I work for them.<eos> You have a job? !<eos> Why shouldn't I have a job?<eos> I'd be brilliant at having a job.<eos> You don't have a job!<eos> I do.
And... DING! ..ding.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's a machine that goes...ding!<eos> DING! Made it myself.<eos> It lights up in the presence of shape-shifter DNA. Ooh.<eos> Also it can microwave frozen dinners from up to 20 feet and download comics from the future.<eos> I never know when to stop.<eos> My love, I do not understand.<eos> I'm not your love.<eos> And yes, you do!
Oh!<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, yes, that is good!<eos> That is brilliant!<eos> Oh, oh, oh!<eos> I'm getting that too - that is brilliant!<eos> Ha-ha-ha! I've been thinking about it for centuries!<eos> She didn't just show me any old future - she showed me exactly the future I needed to see!<eos> Now you're getting it.<eos> Eh? Who did?
Doing okay?<eos> I guess.<eos> I really screwed things up this time, didn't I?<eos> Well... you certainly screwed everything you could.<eos> I mean, I had such a good thing going-- first with Tammy and then Ashley--- and now I'm all alone.<eos> That's because you're a Harper.<eos> It's what we do.<eos> We take something good and turn it into nothing.<eos> I don't like being a Harper.<eos> Nobody does, son.
For us.<eos> "us"-- that's sweet.<eos> And, uh, unfamiliar.<eos> There is No place that's gonna be safe As long as muirfield's out there.<eos> Not for him.<eos> Muirfield?<eos> They won't stop until they have caught and killed him.<eos> No, no, no, don't go in!<eos> You can't go in there!<eos> No, no, no, don't, sir!
Let's go give her some lilies.<eos> See, it's just like we're walking in Central Park.<eos> Hey, we don't get to do that.<eos> What?<eos> Who is that?<eos> Is that Gabe?<eos> What is he doing here?<eos> Well, did you tell him what today was?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe Tess or Joe did?
In the middle of nowhere?<eos> And who went to all the trouble to move her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> So, what are you gonna do?<eos> You can't just leave her here.<eos> If Muirfield cared enough to move her out here, and I move her back... it's just gonna put my family on their radar.<eos> It's not worth the risk.<eos> Besides, there's a cracked headstone I've been going to for a decade.<eos> So, you don't want to know what happened to her?<eos> No, of course I do.
- Help!<eos> Help!<eos> Oh, my God, Vincent.<eos> Vincent, just...<eos> He...<eos> There was an experiment.<eos> Vincent, he was a soldier, they changed his DNA, they turned him into this, and now they're trying to kill him.<eos> Good!<eos> No one can know...<eos> What did you do?
I know what he is.<eos> Look, I'm not gonna expose him.<eos> I just want to meet him.<eos> I'm sorry, I told you, I don't...<eos> Catherine, after everything I shared with you about Muirfield and what they did to me, now you're gonna lie to my face?<eos> I'm not.<eos> I saw what he did to that sniper at the barn.<eos> I told you,<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yes, you do.
Sergeant Linklater is to be left in peace, Mr Reid, as you well know.<eos> Do you know, Sergeant, when we first plucked you from that pike on Chicksand Street, I thought, above all, that the sanctity of this force must be protected.<eos> Because, to those who wish to live in peace hereabout, we must be their buttress to that aim.<eos> We found a powdered substance on the dressing table of a woman named Pang... ..discovered its nature and made our own, here.<eos> I beg you, sir, give it to me.<eos> One or two questions answered and I shall.<eos> Stay here, get it all.<eos> Now, this is what I know already - this narcotic for which you clamour is about to be launched onto our streets.<eos> Do I have it right, Sergeant?<eos> You do, sir.
He hunts her down the same streets.<eos> Here - more arrests for vagrancy, drunkeness.<eos> Ropemakers, Trinity, Thomas Street.<eos> There's pattern to his behaviour.<eos> And so, I thought, Inspector, if I took a turn through those streets myself, I might build an understanding of him, may indeed pick up his trail.<eos> Then go.<eos> Flight - Drake goes with you.<eos> I'm sure Mrs Drake expects the sergeant.<eos> - He's right.<eos> She does.
Come with.<eos> I've a job.<eos> No.<eos> Take my knife.<eos> And what about you?<eos> Please. For this job, at least.<eos> I told you.<eos> We can do this.<eos> You heard about Otto?<eos> Course I bloody did.
His wife was taken from him.<eos> I do hope that you will pass my sympathies.<eos> I cannot find him, Jane.<eos> I believe he holds himself responsible for it.<eos> And was he?<eos> No.<eos> But such guilt... ..it is not unfamiliar to him.<eos> Nor to myself.<eos> I try to understand, Edmund.<eos> I do.
The man is a fool, with no more taste and discernment than a monkey in a milliner's.<eos> We shall see you right.<eos> One day or the next, I shall have to learn to survive by myself.<eos> And besides - if you'll forgive me asking... ..do you not have more pressing matters to contend with?<eos> Only that the Captain's currently... ..absent from Tenter Street.<eos> I shall be fine and you are not to fret.<eos> Well - best be about it, then.<eos> Rose, forgive me... ..but do you... ..do you remember the first man who...paid for you?<eos> Of course.<eos> And did it...
There's all the facilities in there.<eos> Got the moisturizers, the lotions.<eos> - Run a bath if you want, mate.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Was I too loud earlier?<eos> What, having intercourse with Glenn?<eos> No, earlier.<eos> You didn't hear me on my typewriter?<eos> - Workin' away?<eos> - No, I didn't, no.
- See you Monday, Kives.<eos> Have a great weekend, sweetie.<eos> Man, I would so like to come on those tits.<eos> Oh, Kives, you filthy troll.<eos> So, Pritch, what have you been up to?<eos> Dating, mating, or masturbating?<eos> It's one of them and you don't know which.<eos> Well, then, I have my answer.<eos> - You don't have your answer.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Hmmm... I don't...<eos> Boy, you're no good at this.<eos> Look at those stars.<eos> Lovely isn't it?<eos> And to think how few of us ever really see them.<eos> You have a touch of the dreamer.<eos> Wish I had your passion.<eos> No... I I me...<eos> I meant while you're dancing.<eos> You do it so well.
So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?<eos> I'm not gonna schmooze anybody.<eos> I'm gonna let my work speak for itself.<eos> That's great.<eos> That shows a lot of integrity.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm a naive idiot, right?<eos> Oh, good, you heard me.<eos> You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision.<eos> Sheldon Cooper does not do "cozy."
And I go there, and, uh,<eos> I can see him in the window.<eos> And... before I can open the door, though,<eos> I wake up.<eos> And for a second, I forget.<eos> That's okay.<eos> That's normal.<eos> Takes time.<eos> Do you know how long it takes a little boy to stop asking where people go after they die?<eos> 'Cause I do.
Gas can-- that would've helped fuel the fire.<eos> So the guy gets shot in the head, dumped in the trunk, and then the car was lit up to destroy evidence.<eos> Let's just hope they didn't get all of it.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.<eos> Is there any news on Grace?<eos> We haven't found your daughter yet, but I'm confident we will.<eos> We've identified the deceased young men who were found at the scene with your son Steven as J.D. Kesey and Duke Givens.<eos> Did you know them?<eos> No, I did-I didn't.
Don't.<eos> If you're comfortable here, you should stay as long as you like.<eos> Really?<eos> No.<eos> But stay the night.<eos> We had turned off the pressure, which meant it was time to turn on the fun and shift Matty's gears from brother to lover.<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Something we've never done before.<eos> - You don't have to do this.<eos> - But I do.
A letter.<eos> Like, actual, solid mail.<eos> And yes, I still have it.<eos> Well, you gonna give it to us?<eos> Or do we have to get a subpoena to get it?<eos> Or we can avoid it.<eos> The thing is,<eos> I think you owe me one, as I did not launch four errant bullets into a crowd of commuters.<eos> I said you fired four times. One was errant.<eos> No, you didn't.
It is a mere technicality.<eos> You know, I thought that you would be more excited about this.<eos> What is going on with you?<eos> Oh. I get it.<eos> You think that we should book your band.<eos> Definitely not the one with Meatball, but I'd consider the one with George Tucker.<eos> Oh. This is about George Tucker.<eos> Because he broke up with Tansy, and now you think Zeorge is inevitable?<eos> No?<eos> You don't?
Back to a dead end.<eos> Actually, I don't think so, Booth.<eos> Mia was zeroing in on specific labs that were capable of mutating a virus.<eos> Level-four labs.<eos> The most dangerous.<eos> - Is that Dr. Burke?<eos> - No, her facility is level two.<eos> Her lab doesn't have any exotic pathogens.<eos> C.D.C. checked.<eos> Well, her current facility doesn't.
- Burn them, burn them all.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, I have a date tonight, and, you know, there's a lot of women who sleep with you, and I can't figure out why, so maybe it's about clothes, and maybe...<eos> Are you asking me if I'll help you pick out clothing - so you can seduce a woman?<eos> - I was.<eos> I don't know. It's only all I've been wanting for the past ten years, Nick.<eos> Yes, that is how you wrap a son of a bitch in wool.<eos> Now, if somebody asks you who you're wearing tonight, - what do you say? Do it, bro.<eos> - I don't want to do that.<eos> - I don't want to do that.<eos> - Do it.
- We never actually ate, so...<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> I'm getting a snack.<eos> I'm going to bed.<eos> - Can I have some of these?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Jess, I can help you.<eos> I got it.<eos> I got it.<eos> I don't even n... I don't even...
She doesn't know about sexy stuff.<eos> She couldn't even figure out what we do with the bowling ball.<eos> Sophie, you should've seen what was in here.<eos> I mean, he had this anatomically correct real doll he named Alexis.<eos> Yeah, well, she's very pretty.<eos> He had a sex swing.<eos> Ooh, a sex swing.<eos> What are you gonna tell me now?<eos> That he had a water bed?<eos> I did.
I was... lying to Annie.<eos> You know, I've been... trying to pretend that there is nothing between you and Annie.<eos> But I saw the way you looked at each other at the theater,<eos> I read her book, and I can't hide from the truth.<eos> Neither should you.<eos> The truth is, it doesn't matter what's between us.<eos> Because...<eos> I end up hurting her every time we try.<eos> That's the guy I am, and Annie knows it.<eos> No, she doesn't.
- Shut your mouth.<eos> - Shut your mouth.<eos> I will jump over there,<eos> - and shut it for you.<eos> - Edit that out.<eos> Do you have any other evidence, Mr. Belcher?<eos> You bet he does!<eos> You got something, right?<eos> - Come on, give it to 'em.<eos> - Actually, I... I don't.
That has to be the one.<eos> You've got to get it. I will marry you if I can still be a father.<eos> Exactly what are you suggesting?<eos> I want Valentina to give us one of her eggs.<eos> Where's his suitcase?<eos> What's going on?<eos> - You're going back to rehab.<eos> - What? !<eos> I didn't know you and Mr. Powell had a son.<eos> We don't anymore.
When Mrs. Evelyn caught us, I saw our reflection in the glass.<eos> And we looked like bad people.<eos> If you try to make your marriage work and it doesn't, then maybe we can talk about the future.<eos> But I need to know you tried, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> So what are we gonna do about the crazy lady that wants my kid?<eos> Maybe we should talk to the guy that was crazy enough to marry her.<eos> I did not know Alfred spoke to Valentina.<eos> You must believe me.<eos> I do.
Thank you.<eos> Do you serve cheese fondue?<eos> - Mr Renault...<eos> - For two?<eos> Come with me.<eos> We're barking up the wrong tree.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Nothing enables us to question Servaz's guilt.<eos> I heard a noise.<eos> - I don't.
Everyone in position?<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> May we begin, Mr Renault?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Your balaclava!<eos> How does it start again?<eos> - "Vanessa, it's Michel..."<eos> - OK!<eos> - You have the script.<eos> - Indeed I do.
I believe Leslie said to organize these by year.<eos> Way ahead of you.<eos> [Laughter] Pilo fibles.<eos> Ugh.<eos> Filo pilos.<eos> Filo pilos?<eos> That's not right.<eos> - Are you broken?<eos> - No, everything's fine. Well, I guess that settles who the new Jerry is.<eos> No, it doesn't!
Burly's terrible.<eos> He actually has a really beautiful voice for a backup singer.<eos> Right, that's what I meant.<eos> I love Andy, but to be perfectly honest, Mouse Rat's music is not my thing.<eos> I really only listen to, like, German Death Reggae and Halloween sound effects records from the 1950s.<eos> And Bette Midler.<eos> Obviously.<eos> You know what, I'm retiring from music.<eos> - Andy.<eos> Andy. - Done.
Well, it's easier than you think.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Horses?<eos> ! Yeah.<eos> We got them for the whole day.<eos> Mazur Ranch is just over that hill.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> They're so beautiful.<eos> You know how much I love riding.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> I guess I've just gotten used to protecting myself.<eos> Look - - I'm not the same girl that I was when you left.<eos> B-but this was my problem to fix.<eos> I went and I saw Vandermeyer today.<eos> Y-you what?<eos> But he's not gonna be bothering us anymore, all right?<eos> Don't worry. No, of course I'm gonna worry, Kyle.<eos> I mean, come on -- if the police knew that you were even 10 yards from Vandermeyer -- and, by the way, how do you even know that he has something to do with this?<eos> Honestly, I don't.
Oh, I like working here.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> Uh, I want you to look into something, but come back only to me, not the partners.<eos> The sad thing is,<eos> I like Rainey.<eos> I've always liked Rainey.<eos> And so, you have no idea why she accused you of this?<eos> No.<eos> She got pretty drunk at this party.<eos> We all did.
Hey. I'm short on time here.<eos> Don't rob me of what little joy I have.<eos> Anyone seen Jeremy?<eos> Ohh. He went to see Bonnie.<eos> He'll be back later, you know, before...<eos> - Well, you know. - Yeah.<eos> Stefan, can I, um... Can I have a moment?<eos> Sure.<eos> - This could get interesting.<eos> - Usually does.
But Martin's never around-- always directing or developing.<eos> Did he develop a lot during your marriage, too?<eos> Take a lot of "meetings" at night?<eos> I see.<eos> Was he cheating on Gretchen, too?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Why am I not surprised?<eos> Mr. Elliot cheated on you?<eos> Both times I was "with child."<eos> So, of course, he did it to Gretchen, too.
She is the love of my life.<eos> Why would I kill her?<eos> You tell me.<eos> There is no reason in the world, sir.<eos> No reason.<eos> Okay, Cody. Fair enough.<eos> I know when a man is telling me the truth.<eos> Do you have any guns?<eos> Do I have any guns?<eos> Yeah. Y-yeah, yeah, I-I do.
That kind of sacrifice deserves respect.<eos> Not like this.<eos> Kelsey put the department in a hell of a spot.<eos> We've got a major PR problem.<eos> You're talking PR?<eos> No offense, Garrett, but you never walked a beat a day in your life.<eos> I'm doing my job.<eos> Maybe you should give it a try.<eos> You don't know what it's like to watch your partner die in your arms.<eos> I do.
But I got it.<eos> Okay, hurry.<eos> Let's put it in the pot.<eos> Okay.<eos> This needs to steep for a few hours.<eos> So we leach out all his sweat.<eos> Then, we add the reduction to the rest of the potion.<eos> Then comes the hard part.<eos> Hard part?<eos> Didn't we just do the hard part?
- Yes.<eos> - Do you know his name?<eos> No.<eos> Where did he drive you?<eos> Back here to the hotel.<eos> What does it matter where he drove me?<eos> Don't move.<eos> We're trying to identify the man who can identify the man who chased you.<eos> - You said he saw him.<eos> - He did.
And are you the birthday girl?<eos> Yeah. And what's your name?<eos> Charlotte.<eos> Charlotte.<eos> And how old are you, Charlotte?<eos> 12.<eos> Well, Charlotte...<eos> Do you recognize me?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No. I don't.
Man. Excuse me.<eos> Hey, I'm Jack Nelson.<eos> Hey. You're the Jack Nelson who worked with Lindi Ortega.<eos> Will Lexington.<eos> How you doin'?<eos> Listen, that performance tonight was great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That song was amazing.<eos> Did you write it?<eos> Uh, y-yeah, I did.
I just been kidding myself thinking it was gonna last forever.<eos> Does that sound... stupid to you?<eos> No.<eos> Good.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I just...<eos> You need to... to get out, man.<eos> Oh. I-I-I didn't mean it.<eos> Please, just get out.<eos> I-I didn't...
Is this not a party?<eos> ♪ She cranks, she cranks ♪ Whoo! Brother, that is the one.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> We got it.<eos> So?<eos> How'd it feel?<eos> It feel good?<eos> Uh... yeah. Great, I guess.<eos> If you got more like that one...<eos> You do, right?
Yeah. It was kind of a love song vibe, right?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I'm not interested in love songs.<eos> Country music staple, isn't it?<eos> It's hard to write about things you don't believe in.<eos> You don't believe in love?<eos> Well, let's put it this way... pretty much everybody that has told me they loved me in my life has lied.<eos> I don't know if it was me or... they just weren't capable of it.<eos> I... the point is, I'm pretty damn sure it doesn't exist.<eos> It does.
Hey, hey, buddy. Why don't you just, uh... keep your mouth busy with the cheap beer you've been sucking on?<eos> Your accountant said to come up with the $10 million in cash, you'd have to liquidate some of your securities... several stocks, bonds, mutual funds.<eos> But that would do it.<eos> Yes, but will it satisfy him?<eos> Addicts are never satisfied.<eos> She would know.<eos> He's never gonna stop, is he?<eos> You don't deserve this.<eos> You don't deserve any of it.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
Maybe I should take a sip of wine before I go in.<eos> People always say I'm great at parties.<eos> Don't know how many dentists are looking for a drunk Beyonce impersonator, but worth a shot.<eos> Brick, what are you doing?<eos> Oh, I'm earning my family life badge for Prairie Scouts.<eos> You-- you're in Scouts?<eos> Since when?<eos> Joined a couple weeks ago.<eos> Did I not tell you?<eos> You did not.
Are you home?<eos> Front room.<eos> Oh my goodness...<eos> You made it home safe and sound and in one piece...<eos> Hello, old girl.<eos> Stay there.<eos> Bloody hell...<eos> It's okay, I got you.<eos> I wanted you to see.<eos> I did.
The situation has changed.<eos> There's too many eyes on us.<eos> We need to end this.<eos> End it?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> You asshole.<eos> We talked about the fact this moment was coming.<eos> No, you talked about it.<eos> I never accepted it.<eos> I still don't.
I need help getting an exhumation order.<eos> Who you want to dig up?<eos> My father.<eos> He died when I was 12, and I grew up thinking that he killed himself.<eos> Now you're not so sure?<eos> Recently, I got ahold of his suicide note.<eos> And the lab ran a test, found a partial print.<eos> Wasn't his.<eos> And you think he was murdered.<eos> Yes, I do.
Nikita.<eos> You can't stop me from saving them.<eos> Not why I'm here.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I can save them.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> You need to go.<eos> I'm not letting you die here alone.<eos> I'm not the one who dies.<eos> Everyone around me does.
Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> The girls are out.<eos> - Four!<eos> - I got five.<eos> Get them!<eos> Get them!<eos> You didn't have to come back.<eos> You didn't have to come at all.<eos> No one else ever did.
A low-level analyst who was killed, resurrected in a hole filled with criminals and murderers.<eos> A low-level analyst who's gone up against the MSS,<eos> FBI, CIA, ordered heads of state executed, even kidnapped the President of Uzbekistan from inside the White House...<eos> All while living under the threat that someone like you would come in here and put a bullet in my head.<eos> So believe me when I tell you, Vazquez, that file you read is in desperate need of a revision.<eos> You're gonna want to get that.<eos> Madam President.<eos> Let me speak with Fletcher.<eos> You got our message?<eos> Everyone did.
Enjoy your tennis, Ambassador Goldface.<eos> - You, too, Mrs. Cash. - Oh.<eos> That's so, so funny!<eos> - Good save.<eos> - I think they bought it.<eos> I bet they think we bought it.<eos> Not our scene?<eos> You know what that means, right?<eos> Those two richies think we're not good enough to hang out at a tennis club.<eos> - They do? - Yeah.
You bought 40 burner cell phones to make 40 untraceable dinner reservations.<eos> - You have the facial hair you have. - Eh!<eos> Okay, I get it! I get it.<eos> Leave the goatee out of it.<eos> - It's hard to leave it out.<eos> - Really hard.<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe two impulsive people can work in a relationship.<eos> Hey, it works for Ice and Coco T.<eos> Sure as hell does.
Why?<eos> Well, I'm thinking if she's not going to listen to reason, what she needs is a demonstration.<eos> All right, watch this.<eos> Hey, Sal, sorry to interrupt, man, but, um, my good friend and longtime member of the bluebell Longshoreman's Union has an announcement to make.<eos> Wade. Uh...<eos> Now, some of you may know I recently took over the Rammer Jammer...<eos> This is a disaster.<eos> How could you encourage Wade to hold Fight Night at the Rammer Jammer?<eos> You know the type of people that show up to mixed martial arts?<eos> 'Cause I do.
Okay.<eos> Well, to be fair, you did throw all that stuff at him, okay?<eos> Napkin dispensers, and soup, and all of that Parmesan cheese.<eos> And then you drew on the walls.<eos> It's called modern art.<eos> If I was a artist, people would pay millions for those drawings.<eos> You're not an artist.<eos> You know what rhymes with "liar"?<eos> "Lawyer."<eos> No, actually it doesn't.
I'm not peeing in his tailpipe!<eos> 'Cause you scared?<eos> Or because you don't pee standing' up?<eos> (laughing) CHICKEN: It's okay, it's okay.<eos> You can do it from a sittin' position.<eos> I pee like everyone else!<eos> Okay?<eos> And I can pee on one leg if I...<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't...
What?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm not interested.<eos> But why not?<eos> Frankly, um, I don't need the drama.<eos> Drama?<eos> What is this drama I keep being accused of?<eos> I don't want the drama either.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I've listened to your dating stories and you may think you don't want drama, but you do.<eos> Maybe you do.
Looks great, Abs.<eos> Thanks.<eos> New sheets?<eos> And pillowcases.<eos> And a new set of towels for your bathroom.<eos> Very plush.<eos> He mad I bought the house?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> He wants to come, Bunchy.<eos> We all do.
You know what?<eos> You put it that way...<eos> But just half a glass, okay?<eos> Go on.<eos> Three-quarters.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We talked to Cory Harrison's girlfriend.<eos> According to her, he was in a good mood when he left her apartment yesterday morning.<eos> Then something must have happened between home and the restaurant.<eos> In fact, something did.
That would...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> If he was standing there... then the bullet would've gone right through his head.<eos> How did Barber miss?<eos> Well, before the first shot, Vaughn stumbled.<eos> Stumbled?<eos> Kids and old people stumble.<eos> How did he stumble?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He just did.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> What's this?<eos> The records of phone calls made by Thomas Barber, a contract killer.<eos> Phone calls that he made to you.<eos> Look, please, I...<eos> I didn't know he was gonna hurt anyone.<eos> He told me he was from a rival lab, that they wanted the patent first.<eos> I was mad at Eric, a-- and I needed the money.<eos> - Where did you meet?<eos> - We didn't.
Oh, you know, the trials -- God's little "pull in case of emergency"" the Leviathans get out of control, you put them in Purgatory.<eos> Demons get a little too demonic, toss 'em into Hell.<eos> Angels get uppity, slam the pearly gates.<eos> Are you saying you know the trials to close heaven?<eos> I wrote 'em down.<eos> It's not something you forget.<eos> Look, I think a little alone time would be good for the angels.<eos> At the very least, it would s-- [ dog barking in distance ]<eos> It would stop the fighting up there from spilling out down here, which will happen.<eos> It always does.
But you -- you are a warrior.<eos> I've got the plan.<eos> You've got the muscle.<eos> We can do this.<eos> Heaven needs your help, Castiel.<eos> I am the one that caused these problems.<eos> I should be the one to fix them.<eos> But you understand this is, um, not going to be easy.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
- What's the point?<eos> ! - Do you still love me?<eos> Do you?<eos> Still love me?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> It matters.<eos> Do you still love me?<eos> It's a yes or no question.<eos> Olivia...<eos> I do.
My last interaction with Regina wasn't so great either.<eos> She embarrassed me in front of... someone.<eos> I was at her party.<eos> I called her out.<eos> She told me not to be so sensitive.<eos> And then she walked away.<eos> And that's the last time we spoke.<eos> Regina knew that you loved her.<eos> I hope so.<eos> She did.
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> [Groans]<eos> Do you... do you know what you're saying?<eos> I mean, she's with, you know, and he's... he's been very clear about...<eos> You know, and we just can't... you know.<eos> I don't think we have a choice anymore.<eos> I mean, she knows just about everything except that.<eos> She does?
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> [Groans]<eos> Do you... do you know what you're saying?<eos> I mean, she's with, you know, and he's... he's been very clear about...<eos> You know, and we just can't... you know.<eos> I don't think we have a choice anymore.<eos> I mean, she knows just about everything except that.<eos> She does?<eos> You do?
Everything all right?<eos> Uh, not exactly.<eos> And by that, you mean...<eos> Remember the night that Nick brought Juliette over to my house to... the night that Monroe was supposed to show me something that was going to make me believe everything Nick had told me.<eos> You know where this is going, Rosalee?<eos> - I have a feeling.<eos> - Good.<eos> 'Cause maybe you could talk them out of it.<eos> Rosalee, don't you think it's too late for that?<eos> I don't.
I'll take you down even faster and even harder.<eos> 'You started working with DCI John Luther in January 2009.<eos> 'Is that correct?<eos> That's right.<eos> 'And what was the first investigation you both worked on?<eos> 'A home invasion, murder.<eos> Suspect's name was Alice Morgan.<eos> 'She was the daughter of the victims.<eos> 'Do you want me to go through every case we worked?<eos> ' Course they do.
Come on, Mom.<eos> I'm a straight A student.<eos> What makes you think it's something bad?<eos> I spent 12 years at Catholic school.<eos> There is no way the principal is calling me at 7:30 in the morning to request a meeting to tell me you're an A student.<eos> He's got the greatest defense ever:<eos> "I don't remember""<eos> He remembers a blonde named Lacy asking to sit with him.<eos> He doesn't remember killing his own girlfriend?<eos> Maybe because he didn't.
You know what I don't get?<eos> You always taught me to fight for what I believe in, to fight to make the world the place I want it to be, and now that I'm putting that into practice, you want me to stop.<eos> I also taught you to respect authority.<eos> I've been very respectful, Mom.<eos> I even went to Mrs. Pender's office today to ask if we could have a town hall meeting, so that the students and the administration could have their say.<eos> Well, see, that's a great idea.<eos> And she shut me down completely.<eos> She said if I continued the protest, I'm not just gonna be suspended, she'll make sure I get kicked out of school.<eos> Wait, she said that?<eos> Yeah, she did.
But for what?<eos> For whatever his Holiness intends.<eos> - Cesare Borgia!<eos> - Alfonso.<eos> Finally we're on first-name terms.<eos> Spar with me, brother.<eos> - Brother-in-law.<eos> - You'd love me as a brother.<eos> - Have you ever loved your brother?<eos> - I did.
Be careful Prospero, you tread on splintered glass.<eos> He's starved the powder of all we know, so has she.<eos> Someone paid for those shipments, they have a purpose, hidden from you.<eos> But does it matter?<eos> The point is, those stores exist.<eos> I know where.<eos> We should capture those stores, hold them both for ransom.<eos> - When we have neutered Cesare Borgia...<eos> - You hate him, don't you?<eos> As do you.
And be both king and pope.<eos> You saw what happened to Colonna, so you know the rules.<eos> We knew them already, my lord.<eos> Good.<eos> Never presume that I will not act on my worst instincts.<eos> Or that it is not in your best interests to stay loyal to me.<eos> We have an army here.<eos> It is well stocked, powdered at last.<eos> It has generals. They imagine they rule.<eos> They don't.
We are.<eos> We're trying everything we can think of to wake him up, Ethan.<eos> We haven't given up on him.<eos> Neither should you.<eos> Hey. Hey.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Okay?<eos> Hey, you want to go split a few dozen pitchers?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I felt betrayed.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> I-I stood by him for 24 years.<eos> You withheld that he was having an affair, and then you went out of your way to make it look like his work got him killed.<eos> Because it did.<eos> All right, look, I admit it.<eos> Okay?<eos> I said some things to Dale, but I was upset.<eos> Besides, I didn't go near that apartment.<eos> I didn't.
And right now, I am watching a double-breasted...<eos> Wait... they know each other?<eos> Whoa, wait... what is going on here?<eos> Oh, my God, it's happening.<eos> This is just like I imagined.<eos> Right in front of Ted, so I can rub it in his face.<eos> The belt is mine!<eos> Hi, guys.<eos> Barney, you remember Liddy.<eos> I do?
I succumbed.<eos> I didn't know what I was doing.<eos> I beg your forgiveness.<eos> Will he stop working with children? - Forever?<eos> - We'll be vigilant.<eos> You made that promise to Denis Pourveur's father.<eos> And you didn't keep it.<eos> Nothing happened between Denis and me.<eos> Do you swear in front of the cross?<eos> Of course you do.
I don't have a good moral compass.<eos> You know, for example, right now, I'm debating whether or not I should ask Margaret if I can go or just lie to her and not tell her where I am.<eos> Because if I tell her no one will be home but the two of us, I think she's going to say, "Then come on over to our house."<eos> All right.<eos> We could do that.<eos> When we could be alone at your house?<eos> We're not going to do anything.<eos> You say that now, but who knows?<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, you don't.
Hard.<eos> It's a risk.<eos> If you want anything out of life, you've got to take a risk.<eos> You cannot be afraid of failing, or getting hurt, or getting shot.<eos> A man's got to do what a man's got to do.<eos> You got it?<eos> He really misses Robie.<eos> Hey.<eos> What'd he say? How'd it go?<eos> - It didn't.
No one understands how difficult it is to be a father when you're a teenager until they've done it.<eos> Hell, no one realizes how hard it is to be a father, anyway, until you've done it.<eos> And I recommend you don't do it.<eos> So when this guy leaves, don't be fooling around with Kathy in that empty house.<eos> Geez, you know, not every guy is thinking about sex every minute of the day.<eos> All right some of us maybe, but... you know, I'm not completely insensitive.<eos> I don't think this would be the time to approach her.<eos> I don't think high school would be the time to approach her.<eos> - You just wait.<eos> - You didn't.
Why would I break up with you?<eos> Because your life is already complicated.<eos> Why would you want more complications like a girlfriend with an ongoing baby drama?<eos> You're the one who's stupid, you know that?<eos> I don't care if my life is more complicated because of you and who you are.<eos> You're also the sweetest girl I ever met.<eos> So Don Juan wants to take the baby?<eos> He says he does, yeah.<eos> Yeah, well, he doesn't.<eos> No, unfortunately he does.
Fight your way to the leaders.<eos> Once we have Aquaman and Wonder Woman, this war is over.<eos> You murdered my wife, Diana.<eos> She tried to assassinate me, Arthur.<eos> I was protecting myself.<eos> Yet you wear her helmet like a trophy.<eos> No.<eos> A warning.<eos> I can't believe I ever loved you.<eos> You never did.
- Hi.<eos> - I've been looking for you everywhere.<eos> - Mom.<eos> Everybody's in there...<eos> what are you doing in here?<eos> We don't know anyone.<eos> Of course you don't... that's why I have to introduce you.<eos> So, how do you know him?<eos> The deceased.<eos> Oh, I don't...
Everything all right?<eos> I just... couldn't bring myself to tell him.<eos> About what?<eos> His brother.<eos> Linda, Freddy's death was an accident.<eos> He got shot on my watch.<eos> It's my responsibility to tell Rusty.<eos> I just...<eos> I just don't know how.<eos> Yeah... you do.
No.<eos> I don't like being in this crappy town on a good day.<eos> So you got trapped.<eos> The one day<eos> I decide to leave Westlake to come see you and that thing just...<eos> comes down out of nowhere.<eos> You were coming to see me?<eos> Yeah, I kept hearing about problems with our little arrangement.<eos> The one you assured me you had under control?<eos> Which I did.
Maybe way back then, she knew the dome was coming.<eos> Or... the stars are something that will happen now that the dome is here.<eos> You think she could see the future?<eos> If she did, then you can, too, because you started talking about the pink stars during your seizure.<eos> I-I was just babbling.<eos> Unless you weren't.<eos> Junior...<eos> Do you really think her painting it and you saying it was a coincidence?<eos> I don't know what to think.<eos> Yes, you do.
We used to be trapped, but at least I could still grow my crops.<eos> Without sunlight, we all starve.<eos> If we don't freeze to death first.<eos> What if the temperature starts dropping?<eos> My family is already<eos> - out of propane.<eos> - Listen,<eos> I give you my word: nothing like that's gonna happen.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.
For everybody's safety.<eos> Now...<eos> I am asking every single uninfected adult in this room to agree to a monogamous feeding relationship with a healthy vampire in exchange-- in exchange for that healthy vampire's protection for you and your children.<eos> Listen, I understand you're upset.<eos> Talk to your reverends.<eos> Talk amongst yourselves.<eos> But this is the only way we know how to protect you.<eos> Now, if we're gonna be safe, every single human needs a vampire and every vampire needs a human.<eos> Now, I hope I'm gonna see all y'all tonight.<eos> If I don't...
Just got off the phone with Portia.<eos> She said she and the kids are doing fine, except for Coby woke her up at the crack of dawn.<eos> What'd I come in here for?<eos> Coffee.<eos> I need coffee.<eos> Can you get me some, too, Daddy?<eos> Adilyn Braelyn Charlaine Danika, you ain't even two weeks old yet, so, no, I'm not gonna get you some coffee.<eos> Hey, are you gonna go with me today to the mortuary?<eos> If you want me there, I'm there.<eos> - I do.
- You all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Come on in.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - You want a drink?<eos> - Ice?<eos> - No.<eos> I was surprised to get your call, Ray.<eos> Didn't think you came back to Boston anymore.<eos> I don't.
It's over.<eos> Two seconds ago.<eos> Door.<eos> You can keep the photo of your boyfriend.<eos> So.<eos> Over.<eos> Ten seconds ago.<eos> Tonight, the fire department responded to a three-alarm blaze after an explosion...<eos> Gibbs, we may have a problem...<eos> We do.
But I have nothing to hide.<eos> So, then, national security isn't threatened by you and...?<eos> Adam?<eos> Now you're asking the questions.<eos> That was merely a statement with the possibility of a question mark at the end.<eos> I went to Israel to bury my father.<eos> It was a moment of weakness.<eos> I felt alone.<eos> You need to talk to Legal.<eos> No, I don't.
Better chance of finding a whale in a kiddie pool.<eos> This place is a ghost town.<eos> Turns out a car bomb can really clear out a room.<eos> Go figure.<eos> Hmm.<eos> I broke up with Jack today.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Thought you'd be a bit more philosophical than that.<eos> I loved that man.<eos> I still do.
But when opportunity knocks...<eos> Yeah, well opportunity's about to kick open that door and shoot us both in the head.<eos> Somebody's about to kick in that door and shoot us both in the head.<eos> Really?<eos> You joking?<eos> You joking?<eos> Are you done?<eos> Max... chill out.<eos> You want to see them?<eos> No, I don't.

Give them to me.<eos> Oh, gotcha!<eos> Just like Richard Gere in Pretty Woman.<eos> Remember the jewelry box that he snaps shut?<eos> Chomp.<eos> I love that movie.<eos> Yeah, it was a classic.<eos> Want to take a shower?<eos> No.<eos> No, I... don't.
- By taking down the Falcon.<eos> Listen, if it weren't for him, they would never have been able to frame my father or force Padma into delivering that program.<eos> It doesn't matter who killed her, Nolan.<eos> The Falcon is the reason that she's dead.<eos> Look, believe me,<eos> I want to make him pay.<eos> But he's been underground for two decades.<eos> No one knows what he looks like,<eos> - let alone how to contact him.<eos> - Victoria does.
You know where this picture was taken?<eos> I haven't the slightest idea.<eos> I had you goin' for a minute, didn't I?<eos> Why's it make you so nervous, the idea that I might not like something as much as you do?<eos> I just want to make sure that we have stuff in common, ya know?<eos> Mm-hmm. It's great to have things in common.<eos> But if people match up too much, then there aren't any surprises.<eos> Yeah, that'd be pretty dull.<eos> And I don't think you like dull.<eos> No, I don't.
Here it is.<eos> Oh, my God, Spence...<eos> I gave the RV to "A" for nothing.<eos> I hate it when people do this to my work.<eos> So it is yours.<eos> My stamp on the back.<eos> Which I guess is how you got here?<eos> Why'd you make it?<eos> Didn't your friend tell you?<eos> No, she didn't.
I know what I'm doing, okay?<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You're used to dealing with Rosewood's finest.<eos> They can't find their nightsticks with both hands.<eos> She and that other Detective are the real deal.<eos> Believe me, I know the difference.<eos> I will do whatever it takes to protect my mother.<eos> I don't care what she did.<eos> Hanna, we don't know what she did, okay?<eos> None of us do.
That?<eos> That was a gift from my late mother-in-law.<eos> Come.<eos> Meet Tippi.<eos> I can't keep coming back.<eos> It's uncanny, isn't it?<eos> Careful what you say around her.<eos> It may come back to haunt you.<eos> - Want a sweet potato?<eos> - No, Tippi, we don't.
What that person doesn't realize is that if I don't offer that up,<eos> "A's" gonna serve it up on a silver platter.<eos> Why are you here, Toby?<eos> I don't want to play any more of your games.<eos> I moved the RV.<eos> "A" asked for it in exchange for something that I wanted.<eos> Wh-what did you want?<eos> Did you think that making more deals with the devil was gonna protect us?<eos> How did you even know where Mona parked it?<eos> I didn't.
Just let me be!<eos> Let you be?<eos> Mom's getting prepped!<eos> We need you here!<eos> Get here now!<eos> Fuck, everything's just perfect!<eos> Daddy, your foot!<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> Why aren't you sleeping?<eos> I already did.
Is he nuts? !<eos> Stop!<eos> Fucking...<eos> What a fucking moron...<eos> I just want to talk...<eos> I really don't know!<eos> All I want to know is... the reason why Park's looking for Lee.<eos> I don't know, I swear!<eos> Please let me go, okay?<eos> You really don't?
Mr. Perrault?<eos> Alvin Klein, IIB.<eos> This is my deputy minister, Danielle Belanger, and you've met Damien,<eos> Police Nationale Lieutenant and my Head of Security.<eos> How can, uh, we help you, Mr. Klein?<eos> Sir, we've received information that suggests your life might be in danger.<eos> My life has been in danger ever since I accepted this position.<eos> What exactly have you heard?<eos> Unfortunately, the picture isn't clear at the moment, but do you know a man named Julien Couvreur?<eos> Of course I do.
I don't know.<eos> I don't understand this.<eos> Africa of all places.<eos> If he wanted to help poor people,<eos> Why couldn't he just go to burbank?<eos> What does your note say?<eos> it doesn't matter. Excuse me.<eos> Uh, next up... The lamborghini.<eos> I want that.<eos> No, you don't.
Africa of all places.<eos> If he wanted to help poor people,<eos> Why couldn't he just go to burbank?<eos> What does your note say?<eos> it doesn't matter. Excuse me.<eos> Uh, next up... The lamborghini.<eos> I want that.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
How did that go?<eos> Good.<eos> Helped me realize something...<eos> You were right.<eos> Valentina does deserve the best.<eos> And that piece of crap doesn't even come close.<eos> You're a liar.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You said you didn't know how to write lyrics.<eos> I don't.
But you have to know, I never stopped loving you.<eos> Then why didn't you want to see me the last time I was here?<eos> Last time?<eos> Four years ago.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I went through this phase, thought I wanted to know where I came from.<eos> So I hired a private detective.<eos> He tracked you down.<eos> But when I came here and asked to meet you, your father told me you didn't want anything to do with me.<eos> He did what?
Cops aren't missionaries; they're cops.<eos> Have you talked to Jamie?<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> I'll let you two have the room.<eos> I don't want to fight with you, but I do want you to hear the other side.<eos> The other side of right is wrong.<eos> While I don't entirely agree with my boss's policy, I do recognize that it addresses certain realities.<eos> Like telling poor people that crimes against them don't matter as much as crimes against the rich?<eos> The policy does not target poor people.<eos> Oh, the hell it doesn't!
I'm fine, Dad.<eos> I'm not gonna take it too personal, if that's what you're talking about.<eos> Danny... everything about this Bitterman thing, I want it by the book.<eos> It would be a terrible waste if this tragedy served to make a bad thing worse in there.<eos> Yeah, yeah. I got it. Got it, Dad.<eos> Check in on your brother.<eos> Yep. Will do.<eos> Noni and Nona.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Baez, do me a favor.
I'm beginning to understand how you acquired such a dim view of humanity, Harold.<eos> Wait.<eos> How rude of me.<eos> I can see for the first time, and you're blind.<eos> We'll need some glasses for Harold.<eos> I'm sure you know his prescription.<eos> 3:00.<eos> How's that?<eos> I still don't know where we're going.<eos> Yes, you do.
You don't have to walk so fast, you know.<eos> Guys, you know... I've been thinking a lot about the Earth.<eos> We got to leave it better than when we found it.<eos> - Is this what you wanted your life to be?<eos> - Is this how you wanted to enjoy your best friend's wedding?<eos> Nick, look, no.<eos> Stop that.<eos> - I am not a healthy person.<eos> - Yeah, I know. I know, Nick.<eos> Oh, you do?
I gotta do something.<eos> I have a suggestion, but it comes with its own set of risks.<eos> What are we talking about?<eos> How brave are you, Jack?<eos> I always did love this ring.<eos> Well, we thought about keeping it a secret, but with all the press surrounding the family right now...<eos> Ugh.<eos> Don't talk to me about overexposure.<eos> You saw the video of me and my friend Regina?<eos> Yes, I did.
I did it!<eos> I did it!<eos> ...Heather Smith and Gene Belcher.<eos> - Yay!<eos> - Yay!<eos> Wait, why are there four winners?<eos> Finalists, please report to your table and begin assembling your second original display.<eos> Second display?<eos> If you thought our first table was good, which you did...<eos> No, we didn't.
Ooh, is there a rat exhibit?<eos> I think those are picketers.<eos> Picketers?<eos> Even the people who get paid to go in there don't want to be in there!<eos> That's how terrible it is!<eos> It's a good thing your mom isn't here.<eos> Why, Mom likes protesting?<eos> What?<eos> No, she loves chanting.<eos> Oh, who doesn't?
You know, the heart surgeon's on standby, and we'll get you in there the second that stent arrives.<eos> All right. Let's pray for green lights.<eos> Right. See you soon.<eos> Heart surgery?<eos> I thought Charlotte told Emily you were gonna be fine.<eos> Well, I lied.<eos> Listen, if... If it doesn't go well, I don't want her last memory to be about that.<eos> I want it to be about us and our kid and...<eos> Oh, I really needed to see her smile.<eos> And she did.
That man has taken everything from me.<eos> Nothing... not you, not anyone... is gonna keep me from making Grayson pay for what he's done.<eos> What did the doctor say?<eos> Ems, Declan's dead.<eos> What?<eos> His aortic artery ruptured.<eos> Jack was just here.<eos> He's... He's going out of his mind.<eos> I don't know what he's gonna do next.<eos> I do.
"Me condescending big concern chief."<eos> You need to step outside and get some air.<eos> Right now.<eos> All right.<eos> So, do you always send off your drunks to drive themselves home?<eos> Holly's keys.<eos> A cab is on its way.<eos> Have you heard from Cady lately?<eos> No, I have not.<eos> If you do...
He bought me a drink.<eos> Bought me several drinks.<eos> And... And then when I started feeling dizzy, he said he would drive me home.<eos> Just thought he was being a gentleman.<eos> But then he pulled down this gravel road and he raped me.<eos> And then he just... Kicked me out of the car when he was done.<eos> Left me there.<eos> And I just laid there.<eos> I just wanted to die.<eos> But I didn't.
Meaning?<eos> Maybe Brandi killed Ross Lanten in one of her PTSD blackouts...<eos> And he's covering for her.<eos> They had a small arsenal in their house.<eos> You find any ammo?<eos> Just blanks.<eos> You find a .38?<eos> Not in here, but maybe Greg dumped it.<eos> You two find anything at Holly's place?<eos> Ferg sure did.
Who's missing?<eos> Your daughter.<eos> Why didn't you tell me Cady left town?<eos> 'Cause it's none of your business.<eos> Why did she leave?<eos> You'd have to ask her.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tell me where she is, and I will.<eos> You don't even know where your own daughter is, do you?<eos> No, I don't.
But if you get shot, we're off the hook 'cause you signed a release.<eos> So until this chase is over... and the way this guy is driving, that shouldn't take too long...<eos> I want you to slump down in your seat...<eos> Clear!<eos> Good.<eos> We got him!<eos> See?<eos> Easy as that.<eos> Get out of the car!<eos> Do it!
In Cuba, he told me a lot about his family.<eos> - He loves you a lot.<eos> - We love him a lot too.<eos> I'm lucky to have married him.<eos> He's kind, right?<eos> You have many clients today?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> I don't have a single appointment the whole week.<eos> Viviane come on Friday, but she doesn't pay.<eos> She doesn't?
Hello.<eos> Your bun is pretty.<eos> You look like a bride.<eos> Thanks, I forgot.<eos> Nelly did it.<eos> - Goodbye, Arlette.<eos> - Don't worry about it, Mom.<eos> I just came to give you a gift.<eos> I hope you like chocolate.<eos> - You don't?
She can't get pregnant from a blowjob!<eos> That's not all we did.<eos> Really?<eos> What else?<eos> And you didn't wear a condom?<eos> Well, Billy's so huge, the condom broke.<eos> Wow, Billy.<eos> You know, sex could have killed you.<eos> I told you I wanted to feel a vagina.<eos> Yeah, he did.
You can stay here, or you can move in with your Dad.<eos> It's your choice.<eos> Just let us know what you decide.<eos> Well, don't stay up too long. 'Cause it's late, ok?<eos> - Ok.<eos> - All right, love.<eos> You're back.<eos> That was some fight, man.<eos> You heard that?<eos> We all did.
That seem to be so different, but they can come to an understanding and they can actually work together.<eos> You know what?<eos> You make such a good point.<eos> You make such a good point.<eos> (CLEARS THROAT) Uh... Just to be clear, Roger, you're not asking for anything and I'm not agreeing to anything.<eos> Obviously, I can't say anything explicitly.<eos> Neither can you.<eos> You understand that?<eos> Will, do I understand?<eos> Yes, you do, sir.
The President's chair is a couple inches higher than the rest of the chairs in the Oval Office.<eos> And I used to think, "Oh, my God, that's so ridiculous."<eos> But now I think it makes sense because I think it's a good psychological trick.<eos> Yeah, that's what I...<eos> Oh, you're not finished?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Oh, she loved the cheese. (LAUGHS)<eos> Loved it.<eos> When I grow up, I want to be vice president just like you.<eos> Ah, no, you don't.
- Get me what I need.<eos> - Understood.<eos> - You're ok with this?<eos> - Taking down Liber8?<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> That's not what I'm talking about.<eos> Dillon just gave you a free pass to use any tactic necessary.<eos> And I intend to use it.<eos> He doesn't have the authority to do that!<eos> - Nobody does!
- I don't know.<eos> And not knowing makes me vulnerable.<eos> And that's not my only blind spot.<eos> The message you sent to yourself.<eos> Did it contain any information that you didn't tell me?<eos> No, why?<eos> Garza said something about my purpose.<eos> Did she say anything about it to you?<eos> Kiera, I wouldn't hide anything from you, you should know that by now.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Sorry...<eos> You said that you can track Travis?<eos> - I think so.<eos> - Good.<eos> Maybe we can get to him before they do.<eos> I will find you, Garza.<eos> Are you there Cameron?<eos> The city can only get smaller, protector.<eos> How do you know this will work?<eos> I don't.

We know how to lose a blood specimen.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Jeez, look at those sharp military corners.<eos> Oh. - Thank you.<eos> - No problem.<eos> Oh, Dr. Prentiss, I did not see you standing there.<eos> - I don't do hugs.<eos> - It's a gesture.<eos> I don't believe in gestures.<eos> Um... yes, you do.
They do halal stuff.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Peace, man.<eos> Hey, we're not kids anymore.<eos> Hamza, get in the back.<eos> - Tell him Hamza.<eos> - What?<eos> - You split with that chick.<eos> - She likes you.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
Can we chat?<eos> What is it, dude?<eos> Your crew got soy sauce all over my computer.<eos> And according to our agreement, you must pay all the damages.<eos> - How much do you want?<eos> - $300.<eos> It's a piece of crap.<eos> But it was a gift from my father.<eos> And you know how important family is in our culture.<eos> Again, I don't.
The baby's kicking.<eos> You want to feel?<eos> [Laughs]<eos> That's nice.<eos> You gotta get some rest.<eos> We have to move in the morning again.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I can't do this much longer.<eos> I thought we were safe here.<eos> I did too.
Went by your desk with the lab report, but you're not there.<eos> What do you got?<eos> Something which finally sheds some real light on the mystery of the cattle mutilations across this country.<eos> - While we're young, wu.<eos> - Ovaries.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> That's what was taken from the cows.<eos> Their ovaries.<eos> Now you know.<eos> Yes, I do.
Carpe diem.<eos> Seize the day, people.<eos> Make your legal lives extraordinary.<eos> Oh, Captain, my Captain.<eos> [Sighs]<eos> There was a time I would've been relieved to see that-- no more Louis.<eos> It's just wrong.<eos> This whole merger is wrong.<eos> How'd it go with Harvey?<eos> It didn't.
Take me on anytime you want, but don't punish Harvey's client for what I did.<eos> You did?<eos> You just happened on evidence from his time at the D.A.'s office?<eos> Oh.<eos> Ah.<eos> The redhead.<eos> Well, it doesn't matter, because he may not have been the one to betray me, but he didn't stop it.<eos> So after you threw him under the bus and I saved him, he should have thrown himself back under the bus?<eos> You just don't get it.<eos> Yes, I do.
They are my family.<eos> That's what you're working for.<eos> II understand.<eos> I do not understand.<eos> Eminent domain.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - Final hearing's Tuesday.<eos> If we don't win, this place becomes a shopping center.<eos> Then this place becomes a shopping center, because nobody wins eminent domain cases.<eos> But what if we did, Mike?
[Groans]<eos> That disloyal piece of filth.<eos> Believe me, I know how you feel.<eos> Do you?<eos> Because I've heard you prefer to work alone.<eos> Well, I don't.<eos> I may have been above him when we started, but for the last two years, we worked together side by side.<eos> I'm not a sentimental person, but it meant something to me, and I thought it meant something to him.<eos> - He deserves to be shot.<eos> - He does.
I would.<eos> What?<eos> You asked me before if I'd do it again.<eos> I would.<eos> You put me in that position again, and I'll do whatever I have to do to win.<eos> Because we win.<eos> Are you saying screw this deal, let's kick his ass?<eos> No.<eos> I'm saying take the deal.<eos> We already did.
Look, I get you...<eos> You're in trouble and have to choose between your life and your friends'.<eos> Tough decision.<eos> But if I were you, in your situation, I'd save myself. That's normal.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> We know you didn't kill the soldier.<eos> If you bring us what we need to catch the killer, we'll forget your past and give you a chance to start life afresh.<eos> - Who killed the soldier?<eos> - Come on, man, you know.<eos> - No, I don't.
Just go back out there.<eos> Linette: Thanks for coming, Kyle.<eos> I hope I didn't interrupt anything when I called.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> [ Sniffles ] What's going on?<eos> I just can handle this rehab treadmill.<eos> [ Voice breaking ] I'm just not strong enough.<eos> Linette, I have been exactly where you are right now.<eos> I just want to snap my fingers and get my old life back.<eos> But do you?
Angélique.<eos> I thought about it a lot.<eos> Give me a chance.<eos> I beg you.<eos> Listen, Damien.<eos> I am exhausted.<eos> You should go back home.<eos> - Why?<eos> You don't work.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I have:<eos> candied rose petals from Damien.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Damien?<eos> No, I didn't meet Damien, but he sent me a message and flowers.<eos> You are so pretty, Angèle!<eos> You are strange.<eos> Is it Samir?<eos> Have you met Samir?<eos> I didn't.
Where did you get your mug?<eos> Don't take the piss.<eos> Frogs don't usually adopt Arabs, but Chinese kids because they're good students.<eos> But I'm not adopted.<eos> What does Djalil want from you?<eos> He wants his money back.<eos> Why?<eos> He thought he'd given it to someone else.<eos> It makes no difference.<eos> It does for him.
I saw the darkness and the stars.<eos> Suddenly, someone spoke from the fire to me.<eos> He said,<eos> I would be the first to of this darkness breaks through.<eos> And I believed it immediately,<eos> But that was not God, right?<eos> Of course not, but I heard a voice.<eos> We believe pilots to such voices,<eos> Yes.<eos> We do.
He'd be over there right now being a good friend.<eos> Danny's awesome, isn't he?<eos> Oh, I should go over there and be a good friend?<eos> Good idea, tuck.<eos> Ben, what are you doing here?<eos> Just being a sensitive and supportive friend.<eos> So is there anything I can sensitively support you on?<eos> Yeah, do you think you could help me with my friend Ben because he's acting like a crazy person?<eos> Riley, I know about the test.<eos> You do?
It's not like I lie around wishing I could hang with you and your lame superficial friends anyway.<eos> I don't blame you for anything.<eos> Then why did you call me a bad mother?<eos> You're not gonna blend in here.<eos> You might as well accept that.<eos> I joined the soccer team.<eos> Why did you move that picture?<eos> I'm trying to start over.<eos> What chance do I have if my own mom doesn't believe me?<eos> I do.
Not this part.<eos> When I got the message from my older self, you told me that I have the power to shape my future.<eos> If you really think that I have the power to change, so why can't he? !<eos> Because I can see the good in you.<eos> You just gotta give yourself a chance with him.<eos> I can't.<eos> You're doing exactly what Garza did to me, you're not like that!<eos> - And he's not like you!<eos> - You don't know that!<eos> But I do.
I won't stand in her way.<eos> Alright.<eos> - And I didn't betray him.<eos> - I know, I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I'm sure you'll be able to make him feel better.<eos> It's not his fault that he needs me more than you do right now.<eos> I don't know if that's true.<eos> You have your father's strength.<eos> You always did.
And he did?<eos> Your orders have weight, Theseus.<eos> You say these people are my followers.<eos> Gather them.<eos> I have something to say.<eos> You have no idea how badly I wanted him dead.<eos> Yeah, well you made the right choice.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Because if I failed...<eos> No, Kiera, you didn't, ok?
1712 Laguna Way.<eos> What-are you kidding me?<eos> We're chasing a bail jumper, man.<eos> We work for these guys.<eos> No, it's not what you think.<eos> Well, it looks like your girlfriend cut some corners--<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Let me tell you something, okay?<eos> I was there for that takedown.<eos> She did nothing wrong.
Something the matter?<eos> (sighs) We need to talk.<eos> Okay.<eos> About the wedding, about us getting married.<eos> Oh, the ceremony-- that doesn't matter to me.<eos> And I won't be wearing white.<eos> I don't think we should do it.<eos> I should've thought this through before.<eos> But this is what you wanted.<eos> But you didn't.
All right.<eos> What would I tell him, Ray?<eos> Conor hitting that kid in the back of the head?<eos> The way we fucked up our kids?<eos> We didn't fuck up our kids.<eos> How you hate your father?<eos> The way we have to hide out in Calabasas?<eos> The way you fuck?<eos> I thought you liked the way I fuck.<eos> I do.
Trust to luck, trust to luck<eos> Stare fate in the face.<eos> For your heart will be easy<eos> When it's in the right place<eos> I'm not gonna lie to ya, Kevin, and you can do what you like to me.<eos> You can shoot me through the head or the heart.<eos> Don't tempt me.<eos> But I loved Ellen.<eos> Maybe not as much as you, maybe in a different way,<eos> but I did.

What does that mean? Okay.<eos> I read one more thing.<eos> - Oh, another story.<eos> - Just one more.<eos> It's called the Tunguska Event... and, um, it was a comet... or a meteor or something like that... that entered the atmosphere over Siberia... and exploded over Earth.<eos> So, it didn't actually have physical impact.<eos> It didn't touch Earth.<eos> It didn't leave a crater or anything, but the force of that explosion... flattened trees for hundreds of miles. But it only killed about one to two people.<eos> It's Siberia. There were probably only two people there.<eos> Yeah, but they don't necessarily...
Why would I send flowers?<eos> Because we're married.<eos> I... I don't mean I wouldn't send flowers.<eos> But last time I did, you didn't really like them very much.<eos> Yeah, w... I don't... I don't like carnations.<eos> You know, you know that.<eos> But I... I like flowers.<eos> Well, looks like you have a secret admirer.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Freeport College, is it?<eos> I noticed your T-shirt this morning in the town square.<eos> I assume you two are dating.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Is that against the law?<eos> Depends on what you do on your date.<eos> I just got one question for you, Trent.<eos> Are you okay with Whitey Culver getting fired for a crime he had nothing to do with?<eos> I don't know that he had nothing to do with it.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Hey, are my eyes as slitty as yours?<eos> Slittier.<eos> I'd take your place if I could.<eos> Frank's got me on desk detail.<eos> Not that I'm complaining.<eos> I'm just glad to be back.<eos> You... you seem to be adjusting quite well.<eos> You know, I really am. (Chuckles)<eos> I mean, I'm not gonna pretend what happened to me didn't suck.<eos> It did.
I can lay the whole thing out.<eos> (Lowered voice) What is this?<eos> What's going on?<eos> McNally, tell me what you know.<eos> (Lowered voice) She's bipolar.<eos> - She told you that?<eos> - No.<eos> I found out by accident.<eos> But she made me promise not to tell, so...<eos> I didn't.
And you wonder where he gets it from.<eos> Well, you don't have to worry about protecting your yard anymore.<eos> Apparently, Jenna's thinking about installing a home security system.<eos> Bite your tongue!<eos> A home security system to a dog is like the cotton gin to a slave.<eos> It's an insult.<eos> It says you're easily replaceable.<eos> You know why they call us "watch dogs," Ryan?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> No one does.
She's driving me up a wall.<eos> Lavon and I can never...<eos> Uh, I shouldn't be complaining.<eos> Oh, no, it's fine.<eos> Lemon, listen, um... is it just me or are things a little... weird between us?<eos> Weird?<eos> No, things are not weird.<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> Everyone knows you're sleeping with someone, and everyone expects that I know who it is.<eos> And I don't!
I see you have a head for business.<eos> We'll send a TV crew<eos> and broadcast 30 minutes of images of your country plus a 3-hour live broadcast with advertising slots.<eos> The slots are worth 3 million dollars.<eos> Mr Chang says to study the contract.<eos> Is it really necessary?<eos> There's a party tonight to meet the girls.<eos> Reassure me, that was a real yes, wasn't it?<eos> - See how I won him over?<eos> - You certainly did!
What did your sister want with me?<eos> Why did Marcel kill her?<eos> I see you brought friends.<eos> - They're not with me.<eos> - They're with Marcel, that's all that matters.<eos> He killed my sister because she broke the rules.<eos> So I talk to you in front of him I'm next.<eos> - Are you two gentlemen following me?<eos> - Marcel said we are your guides.<eos> - Oh, he did, did he?

Cronenberg.<eos> There's a screening in the park tomorrow, and I was wondering if you'd like to go with me.<eos> I need to be really clear about something.<eos> 'Cause a lot of what you're saying, I'm not gonna lie,<eos> - is...<eos> - Yes, I just... I asked you out.<eos> What about Frank?<eos> I don't think it's his kind of movie.<eos> Doesn't... worry you anymore?<eos> No, it does.
- Celery?<eos> - Celery. - That's a great name.<eos> (Radio chatter) Gail seems upset.<eos> Do you actually believe that Friday the 13th is bad luck?<eos> You know, how high-rise buildings never have a 13th floor, and a house is harder to sell if it's 13 on the street?<eos> The whole 13 thing seems kind of weird.<eos> Yeah, it is really weird.<eos> What's wrong with Gail?<eos> I was hoping you'd get that I don't wanna talk about it.<eos> I did.
Means we can be a little late.<eos> - Okay, great.<eos> - Okay. Yeah.<eos> Let's do it. Can't wait.<eos> I've always wanted to hang out in a hot pink bedroom.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Because... looks good on you.<eos> Pink is your color. You sure you want to do this?<eos> No.<eos> No. I don't. I don't.
Are you still here?<eos> Yeah, just wanted to make sure you're okay.<eos> Gravy.<eos> Thanks for your concern.<eos> Please stop acting like you're okay about me and Nick.<eos> Andy, I'm fine.<eos> S-so then what we... we have your blessing?<eos> My blessing?<eos> (Voice breaking) No.<eos> You don't...
Yeah. Only way to live.<eos> (Radio chatter) - So how long have you and Nick been doing it?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> 'Cause I'm guessing, like, three or four weeks.<eos> I mean, that's when I noticed the difference, because you have this, like, this, like, glow.<eos> And Nick... he just...<eos> he looks, I don't know.<eos> Like more... like, accomplished.<eos> I don't have a glow.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Come on, you've got to wash this.<eos> Hold still.<eos> You got a great bedside manner.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're lucky I don't like beards.<eos> Women say that, but they don't act like it.<eos> You're like my brother.<eos> You don't have a brother.<eos> I want you to stop.<eos> No, you don't.
I would have introduced myself sooner, but it's been so busy here.<eos> You must be kris.<eos> Sharon, kris.<eos> This is my own personal police captain.<eos> Kris:<eos> Oh, well, it's so nice to meet you.<eos> Thanks for letting me come and watch today.<eos> I was just telling kris that this is an easy one because you guys already caught the murderer.<eos> Lloyd:<eos> No, they didn't!
Would you guys mind taking it?<eos> Yo, Kate.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's up?<eos> Yeah, what's going on?<eos> Look, there's something that I have to tell you guys, but there's someone else that I have to tell first.<eos> Castle.<eos> It's me.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Yeah, we do.
And that whole time, she was right here on the Island?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> - How could this happen?<eos> - Well, there's still a lot that we don't know about this case.<eos> But, uh, please believe me when I say we are doing everything we can to find the person who did this.<eos> We know it was a long time ago, but anything you can tell us about Amanda's abduction could maybe help with our case.<eos> It was her summer break, and we were at the water park.<eos> Amanda had worked up enough courage to... go down the high slide, so I-I walked her over to the line and... and I waited at the bottom.<eos> I had my camera out to take that picture of her coming down.<eos> She never did.
I saved her life.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm telling you straight.<eos> - No, don't.<eos> - It's the truth.<eos> I swear, I saved her.<eos> - He put a gun in my mouth...<eos> - Don't.<eos> - ...and he wanted to do it and I stopped him.<eos> - Don't.
I'm gonna say goodbye.<eos> - Talk to you soon, baby.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So, that's the famous casey, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hear he's in afghanistan.<eos> Yeah, he's, uh, working with soldiers who have ptsd.<eos> You miss him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
- Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> This whole thing is a nightmare.<eos> We specialize in solving nightmares.<eos> Well, I appreciate that, but Stanton wants to handle it himself.<eos> - What?<eos> Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> He says he wants to keep it in the family.<eos> That doesn't...
- Yes, they're all balls that he's collected from games he's played in...<eos> even some from little league. 270 balls total and it weighs about 100 lbs...<eos> - in case you were wondering.<eos> Yeah, he came to teach a softball camp I was at when I was 12.<eos> You're his daughter, right?<eos> Daphne?<eos> - I'm Parker.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Do you play softball?<eos> - I did, until college.
Nobody likes him.<eos> - Huh. - He got a habit?<eos> Aside from hurting people?<eos> Look, he burned my hand.<eos> I talk to you, I don't know what he'll do.<eos> I thought this was a sober house, huh?<eos> Like Lewis will do anything anyone tells him to.<eos> They don't sell these in New York anymore.<eos> Five krazy?<eos> Yeah, they do.
Is that Mary?<eos> - Think so.<eos> - Okay. Here we go.<eos> Mary Bigsby drives a blue minivan.<eos> I got the tags right here.<eos> We'll find it.<eos> Your mother is staying with Cailin.<eos> - Do you think that's okay?<eos> - Do I think it's okay that my mother is babysitting a grown adult?<eos> - No, I do not.
She needs to learn.<eos> Set some boundaries.<eos> You know, I barely know her.<eos> I don't want her to hate me.<eos> Look, teenagers are like big Toddlers.<eos> You would see the cute Toddler in her if she was yours.<eos> Maura, she's a good kid.<eos> - And she worships you.<eos> - No, she doesn't.<eos> Yes, she does.
- Oh, boy. What happened?<eos> I don't want my kids to know any more bad stuff - about their father.<eos> - I'm a vault.<eos> He didn't pay our taxes.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> How much do you owe?<eos> - $27,000.<eos> - That's a lot of cans.<eos> Yeah, but I have several jobs I'm doing, and ... and I'll find a way.<eos> - I-I always do.
Seth, no.<eos> You invited me here to see your boat, remember?<eos> Your boyfriend's out of town, And you come by with a bottle of wine?<eos> Now, did you dump him, And I'm, like, a rebound-type thing?<eos> 'cause that's cool, I don't mind--<eos> It's nice to see that your ego hasn't changed.<eos> When you dumped me, Justine?<eos> You said you saw no future with a dumb jock.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Oh, yeah, you did.
You were his bookie.<eos> He was a good guy, Nate.<eos> I really liked him.<eos> But the kid could not pick a team to save his life.<eos> He lost a lot of money, a lot of money that he couldn't pay back.<eos> Listen, my son's gambling problems were just that-- his problems, not mine.<eos> Now if you'll excuse me...<eos> Oh, actually, they've become your problems.<eos> You see, for a while, I was collecting from Nate's ex, and she was very good about paying, so long as she had the kid.<eos> But now she doesn't, and you do...
Who was the deal with?<eos> He didn't say.<eos> He really loved me.<eos> Even after we exchanged photos.<eos> Ashley, did Kurt ever say he had any enemies?<eos> Anybody who wanted to hurt him?<eos> Oh, I know someone who wanted to hurt him.<eos> My psycho ex-husband.<eos> Well, I guess Ashley didn't tell you about how I found out about them.<eos> No, she didn't.
I got to go.<eos> Daniel!<eos> Is that really a good idea?<eos> I wouldn't be doing it otherwise.<eos> You just hallucinated your virtual girlfriend.<eos> - Natalie Vincent, are you jealous? - I'm concerned.<eos> You're not sleeping.<eos> You've abandoned your routine.<eos> - You know where this leads, Daniel.<eos> - No, I don't.
- Maya has another appointment.<eos> Well, Ruby got skunked, again.<eos> You think she would have learned her lesson after she cornered one two weeks ago.<eos> Abyssinians are famous for their beauty,<eos> - not their smarts.<eos> - Abyssinians.<eos> Hank, stop!<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Maya, I thought you said you didn't board cats?<eos> - I don't.
I'm afraid you can't go dancing with Gainsley.<eos> After what he did?<eos> Look, they didn't say forever, it's just that things are hot right now.<eos> There's a lot of attention on you.<eos> Look, I tried my best to...<eos> I'll be a son of a bitch.<eos> They've been bugging us.<eos> The Feds?<eos> They never had access.<eos> Who did?
Yeah!<eos> Did you teach him that?<eos> That's the way to do it, Devon! Whoo!<eos> Oh, I've seen it, and I don't believe it.<eos> Devon Langer just shot a turnaround jumper from the line, and it went in.<eos> That is an absolute first for me.<eos> Whoo! That's the way to do it, Devon!<eos> Whoo! Looks like you're doing a great job with my son.<eos> Did he tell you that I'm his biggest fan?<eos> Yes, he did.
Tea?<eos> No.<eos> It's a special blend they make for me in Thailand.<eos> This is a business where people say a lot of things, but it's what they do that matters.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> She says I should be doing Nike, not some sort of tiger-juice musk.<eos> Right, easy for her to say that she can get you big endorsements after I've done all the groundwork, right?<eos> Look, if you want someone who blows smoke -- and trust me, she can do it well -- then I say go with her.<eos> And how do I know you're not blowing smoke right now?<eos> You don't.
It won't be a horse next time.<eos> Okay, open it.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> How?<eos> I'll call her.<eos> And that's it?<eos> For now.<eos> The less you know, the better.<eos> We don't smoke out here.<eos> I do.
It's not from her.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know what?<eos> We can track Lexi's cell phone.<eos> No.<eos> We took it away.<eos> Ok.<eos> Um...<eos> I think that we should file a police report.<eos> I really do.
- Sarah?<eos> Where are you... ?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Callie, stop!<eos> Sarah, wait!<eos> Liam told me you would do something like this.<eos> He doesn't love you, Sarah.<eos> He's just using you.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
It's about Liam.<eos> Yeah.<eos> * It's not where you come from * * it's where you belong * * nothing I would trade *<eos> * I wouldn't have it any other way * * you're surrounded by love and you're wanted * * so never feel alone * * you're at home with me * * right where you belong *<eos> [School bell rings]<eos> Hey.<eos> So, I guess Brandon and Talya are back on?<eos> - How'd that happen?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It just did.
I didn't want to contradict you in case<eos> - you said something in your statement...<eos> - Whoa, hold on, wait.<eos> So, you thought I might be lying?<eos> He dropped the gun, Mike.<eos> Before you shot him.<eos> You sure?<eos> Mike, listen, you heard gunshots, you were amped on adrenaline and I was lying on the ground.<eos> Of course you thought that he still had the gun.<eos> - But he didn't.
[Creaking]<eos> Can't sleep?<eos> No.<eos> I can't stop thinking about tomorrow.<eos> I have no idea what you're going through, you know.<eos> But I do know a lot about lying.<eos> One lie turns into all these other lies.<eos> And before you know it, things are just... you know?<eos> Look, whatever you decide, you know we've got you, right?<eos> I do.
She wants daisies.<eos> Multi-colored daisies.<eos> So no, honey, it's not that bad, if you don't mind having a clown wedding.<eos> Ok, mom, let's just take a breath.<eos> There's no need to be so judgmental.<eos> I'm not being judgmental.<eos> I am trying to give you a beautiful day.<eos> - And I appreciate that.<eos> - I don't think that you do.<eos> - Dana, she didn't...
I always liked her.<eos> She's still alive, huh?<eos> Yeah, she's still alive.<eos> That's a blessing.<eos> Losing your mom-- that's a big one.<eos> That's a big one.<eos> That shit ain't gonna work, Mick.<eos> So just be a man and shut the fuck up.<eos> So, how'd you find me?<eos> I didn't.
Bye.<eos> Maybe my pin didn't need to be a ticket for the guilt train.<eos> Maybe it could just remind me that I was lucky I had a boyfriend.<eos> Besides, it wasn't like I was gonna rub it in anyone's face.<eos> [All gasp] Oh. Sorry.<eos> Or maybe I was.<eos> About time we all get to click "Like"<eos> on this bizarro ritual.<eos> Although I forgot to wear a fucking shirt.<eos> I didn't.
It's down to Great Ball Of China and Tropic Like It's Hot.<eos> Oh, so you want me to vote China?<eos> You shouldn't jump to conclusions.<eos> You aren't very good at it.<eos> I need you to make Great Ball lose.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> All you need to understand is that there's nothing to understand.<eos> So do I even have a choice?<eos> Both: [Giggling] Don't be silly.<eos> Of course you do.
[Soft rock music playing] [Squeals] Let me see your pin.<eos> Ah!<eos> Ooh, crafty.<eos> Why aren't you wearing it?<eos> I want to see it on.<eos> I'm not putting it on, and I'm not going to the dance.<eos> - Did you break up?<eos> - No!<eos> - Matty doesn't want to go.<eos> - No. I don't.
I'm not leaving, Wallace.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I'm not going to tell you again-- get out!<eos> I would have left him for you.<eos> Liar!<eos> Why don't you believe me?<eos> Because you lied to me!<eos> You never loved me!<eos> Yes, I did, Wallace.
Exactly.<eos> It was terrible.<eos> Three people read it.<eos> I quit.<eos> But you're writing another novel.<eos> Oh, I'd rather aim high and miss than not aim at all.<eos> So you're saying I'm a coward.<eos> I'm saying you have, uh, 36 hours to decide if you want to give up fun for four years to meet your olympic destiny, which could be glory or agony.<eos> I know which decision will cause the most painful regret...<eos> So do you.
You know, I broke up with Greg today.<eos> You did?<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know... he's kind of lame, and I just don't think he really gets me.<eos> But he wrote that song about you.<eos> I know.<eos> That song was amazing.<eos> And honestly, I think that's why I stayed with him this long.<eos> I always thought you were too good for that guy.<eos> You did?
You know what I'm saying?<eos> You heard of a G-string?<eos> I have.<eos> Yeah, well, I would make a T.K.-string.<eos> Yeah, and then I would do some flavored panties for the disenfranchised young ladies down here, and I would put some booty pads in it, 'cause you want that donky-donk in the trunky-trunk when you're messing with the Brickhouse.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> I think that T.K. could be for lingerie what Joe Namath was for pantyhose.<eos> It's like a masculine take on the feminine.<eos> Okay, I love it.<eos> Y-you do?
This is my one and only warning.<eos> The next time I see you, it'd better be on a book jacket.<eos> Okay, she is not invited to the wedding.<eos> "Get in a few rounds"?<eos> What did you want me to say, that you accidentally left out your evidence photo of the blown transformer?<eos> Castle, you went through my classified photos?<eos> - What the hell were you doing?<eos> - Trying to help.<eos> - I didn't think I'd get caught.<eos> - Yeah, well, you did.
Not that Toy World!<eos> Mom!<eos> I... I thought that you guys could go with Boyd<eos> - to pick something out... - Oh. Since he's gonna be spending more time here before and after school.<eos> Oh, yay!<eos> Oh, good!<eos> Good!<eos> Good!<eos> He loves "Go, Diego, go!"<eos> Of course he does.
I think I followed the thread!<eos> You know what? Could we not have the "Terms of Endearment" fight right now?<eos> [ Knife thudding ] It's a great movie.<eos> - She died slowly of cancer.<eos> - It's a great movie!<eos> She died a painful death of cancer!<eos> She married someone her mother didn't love, by the way!<eos> Okay. So, I know that I can be a little possessive when it comes to Reggie Jackson, so I'm going to think this out logically.<eos> I mean, do I wish that he forewent dating altogether and stayed with me forever?<eos> - Yes, you do.

Oh, honey, we all do something we regret.<eos> No, I mean recently, and the thing I did...<eos> Well, I just might have died...<eos> inside, I mean...<eos> If I hadn't done it.<eos> And even if it's a bad thing, that's the right reason to do something, isn't it?<eos> You mean to...save yourself?<eos> Well, my mother did always say you have to be your own best friend.<eos> Did you know that my mother died when I was a girl?<eos> I did.
Well, I don't know what kind of conversation you expect to have here if you won't acknowledge the fucking obvious.<eos> The CIA gave you that story to set me up.<eos> For what?<eos> The big lie.<eos> Now, despite what they said,<eos> Nicholas Brody is not responsible for the explosion at Langley.<eos> And you can prove this?<eos> Yeah, that's why I'm here.<eos> Did Saul Berenson know when he testified before the Senate subcommittee?<eos> Of course he did.
He's unstable.<eos> Is that your professional diagnosis, Mom?<eos> He's... Dana, he's not what you need right now.<eos> Maybe he's exactly what I do need.<eos> Dana, every doctor at the center, every pamphlet, every book that I've read on getting well, they all say the same thing, you don't want to start a relationship.<eos> What, with someone who actually understands you?<eos> Is that what they say?<eos> Do you realize how crazy that is?<eos> You think they know something, the people in here.<eos> Well, they don't.
The case officer in question, she's been diagnosed as bipolar.<eos> It's Carrie.<eos> She called a reporter.<eos> Apparently she thinks it's important they quote,<eos> "Hear her side of the story."<eos> The CIA gave you that story to set me up.<eos> For what?<eos> Nicholas Brody is not responsible for the explosion at Langley.<eos> Did Saul Berenson know when he testified before the senate subcommittee?<eos> Of course he did.
Ms. Mathison, I am sorry.<eos> But you've been designated a security risk.<eos> My hands are tied.<eos> Ms. Mathison?<eos> I'm gonna have to take you upstairs now.<eos> I need a few minutes with my client.<eos> Carrie, I am going straight from here to the Circuit Court to file an emergency appeal.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Who was responsible?<eos> I thought it was Brody.<eos> That's what you told the Senate.<eos> That's what you told the entire world.<eos> You have a manhunt on five continents, a $10 million reward...<eos> Did he do it?<eos> Yes or no.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> - I don't...
It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You said you'd tell me the truth.<eos> And you told me I was incapable.<eos> You might be right.<eos> But if you want to talk to someone you can trust... who was there, you should know that the man who built the bomb and moved the SUV... he didn't die in the explosion like they say.<eos> As far as I know, he's still in this country.<eos> Where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who does?
You know what he asked me?<eos> Who moved the bomb?<eos> If it was Brody.<eos> Now, why would he ask me that?<eos> That implies that there's a difference of opinion on that subject.<eos> You should know that the man who built the bomb and moved the SUV, he didn't die in the explosion like they say.<eos> As far as I know, he's still in this country.<eos> Where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who does?
This was two years ago.<eos> It hardly fits the profile.<eos> Any munitions training?<eos> Experience with explosives?<eos> All right, add him to the list anyway.<eos> Yeah, which begs the question-- are we even sure that the guy who made the bomb moved Brody's car?<eos> - Depends.<eos> - On what?<eos> On whether or not you believe Javadi.<eos> - Which you do.

Ask him.<eos> What was he doing in Caracas?<eos> You didn't even know he was there, did you?<eos> I got another message from Carrie.<eos> Is she calming down at all?<eos> No, the opposite.<eos> Senator Lockhart just paid her a visit.<eos> Somehow, he knows about Caracas.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> Well, he does.

You know it's way too late for any of that.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Let's go back.<eos> What did you bring me?<eos> They were out of baguettes, so I got croissants instead.<eos> Did you see this?<eos> I did.
It's usual in new-borns.<eos> Correct, doctor, you get extra noodles.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She's studying medicine.<eos> She works like crazy and helps her parents here.<eos> These youngsters are tough.<eos> Been working here long?<eos> Since forever.<eos> I've always worked here.<eos> What do you do?
I'm not sure yet.<eos> I mean, if I go to my dad's old house then your mother will know we're arguing, and if I go to his new house, then he and Kathleen and Grace will know that we're arguing so...<eos> I really don't know.<eos> Well, text me if you figure it out.<eos> Of course, I'm sure Ben's door is always open.<eos> Say hi to Leo for me.<eos> If I end up going over there, then I will.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Oh, come on, you know I'm not gonna go over there.<eos> No, I don't.
That house didn't get paid for by doing contract work for the county health plan.<eos> Okay, Meadows sells drugs, so he's killed like a narco.<eos> Gedman uses prostitutes, so he's beheaded.<eos> Illegals poisoned.<eos> A judge and a prostitute bisected.<eos> It's all over the place.<eos> It's personal, it's political.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> It does.<eos> It does to him.
Yeah, and I need to get to the CVS<eos> I got to buy one of them... their shower seats.<eos> Mom fell again, three times now, but will she use a walking stick like a sensible, normal human being?<eos> Let's see.<eos> Oh, no, she will not.<eos> Wow, you going to church.<eos> There's some weird stuff's been going on.<eos> Weird, Steven?<eos> I seem to have a... a monkey on my back.<eos> Well, hells bells, we all do.
Days.<eos> I have a bad feeling.<eos> What about Gus?<eos> (GROANS) He's not picking up either.<eos> Zina, hi.<eos> You scared me.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> No, you... You just... Well, yeah, it's just...<eos> You said you were still in Laredo.<eos> I did? Yeah.
I find that work helps the tongue.<eos> Give it a shot.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, that feels good.<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> I killed a man.<eos> Aren't you gonna tell me I sinned?<eos> Depends on the situation.<eos> As we both know, sinning supposes a belief in a higher power.<eos> Which you lack, Steven.<eos> Yes, I do.
And smile.<eos> That's it.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Hey, clear off!<eos> Hold it in your hand.<eos> You too, hold it like that.<eos> Look over here.<eos> Over here !<eos> One, two...<eos> - No, don't!
- Boyfriend?<eos> - Zamir Kraji, or something.<eos> - Albanian maybe?<eos> - Some kind of thick accent.<eos> Sure, maybe.<eos> Well, it's probably...<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> Zamir Kraji, it's the police!<eos> Oh, hey, Teddy, did you hear somebody cry for help in there?<eos> Yes, I did!
- Except I won't.<eos> - What?<eos> My offer is, your client takes himself down with Alek, confesses to money laundering.<eos> Think of it as adding a few years onto your life.<eos> Work on your squash game at Club Fed for five to seven years, hope like hell Alek dies in prison or finds God.<eos> If he doesn't, then... well, at least you got a head start.<eos> That's not much of a deal.<eos> I hope you can run fast.<eos> I thought we did have the homicide on Alek.<eos> Of course we do.
That's it, that's her.<eos> I feel like I'm back in court...<eos> Take half.<eos> Hey, you know the authenticity pitch.<eos> Indeed.<eos> It sucks.<eos> I want you to just go in there...<eos> What?<eos> It does not suck!<eos> Yes, it does.
This again? Are you kidding me?<eos> Somehow I always let you talk me out of it.<eos> We're getting married, and I-I need to know that you love me for me, and not some guy you want me to be.<eos> It is like you have been brainwashed by these idiots that you've only known for two months.<eos> These "idiots" seem to get me more than you do.<eos> Just so you know, the acoustics are very good in here.<eos> You are being ridiculous.<eos> Do you really want to throw your life away?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Sonofabitch!<eos> Oh, God, I need a drink.<eos> Hi, I'm Christy and I'm an alcoholic.<eos> Hi, Christy.<eos> I've been sober 118 days.<eos> Oh, don't applaud for that.<eos> They've been the worst 118 days of my life.<eos> Um...<eos> The only reason I'm here is because, uh, I didn't want to turn into my mother.<eos> And I did anyway.
Her father owns the restaurant;<eos> I'm pretty sure he'd fire me, and then what?<eos> I was an English major.<eos> I can't believe you're sleeping with that loser.<eos> I can't believe you're sleeping with this loser!<eos> Hey, we were mostly studying.<eos> Shut up, Luke.<eos> I love him.<eos> - Please, I used to love him!<eos> - She did.
He sent me a text that he was at a friend's house and he would be home late.<eos> So?<eos> So he never came home at all.<eos> - Oh, geez.<eos> - And I was worried, you know, because I made dinner and everything.<eos> I mean, it's not like him to just disappear like this.<eos> Denise, did you call that number... the one he texted?<eos> No.<eos> I'm afraid and I don't want to know.<eos> Probably because you already do.
"She-kay."<eos> T.K.!<eos> T.K., wait.<eos> That's Mr. King to you, Ms. Kane.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I've already apologized twice.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> You want me to beg for your forgiveness?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
You stole money from the company, but now you're gonna make amends, Carl.<eos> Yeah, I-I-I don't know if that's possible.<eos> You haven't told me everything, have you?<eos> Look, your -- your friend who set up this meeting with the FBI, he did it for me to make a deal, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you trust him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you want to free yourself from this mess, whatever it is?<eos> I do.<eos> I do, for my family, for -- for my sanity.
You're not part of the plan.<eos> But... I'm in.<eos> But...<eos> - You're not.<eos> - But...<eos> Evan, the plan is to let Milos think he's coming here to be part of a clinical trial, land at JFK, and get arrested.<eos> That's it.<eos> We deviate from that, we start taking risks.<eos> But if you really want to do something...<eos> - I do.
I'm taking you over there.<eos> Now, what this is, ma'am, is a precipitous labor, so we'll get you in a room--<eos> Precipitous labor?<eos> Wh-what is that?<eos> Quick.<eos> Apparently, your baby has a train to catch.<eos> No, no, I can't be here.<eos> I'm supposed to deliver at Maternity.<eos> Well, where you don't want to be is sitting in a car on Charles Avenue.<eos> You don't. I don't.
All right.<eos> Save a little for next time.<eos> No way!<eos> He came!<eos> - Ohh!<eos> Happy Birthday, Brody!<eos> - Hey, Carol!<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I knew you would come.<eos> - No, you didn't.
So the missile can't be fired.<eos> That doesn't make sense.<eos> Who steals a missile to make it useless?<eos> No, they used the onboard computer to access Pakistan's missile controls, their centralized system.<eos> It's Pakistan's version of N.O.R.A.D.<eos> So the Shop doesn't just control one missile now?<eos> They control all of them.<eos> Michael camouflaged the entrance to the access road, so the truck is secure for now.<eos> Okay, well, the good news is the Shop no longer controls the missile.<eos> I do.
Full house?<eos> You win again?<eos> I think I'll be good tonight and stay in with you.<eos> ♪ Baby, baby, please let me hold him ♪<eos> Where's Hoju?<eos> Where's Hoju?<eos> Where's Hoju?<eos> Where's Hoju?<eos> ♪ We want to make him stay up all night ♪<eos> ♪ Yeah, we do.
He does, baby, he does.<eos> Can I just say good-bye to him quick?<eos> Sure.<eos> I guess this is it, little guy.<eos> Da-da.<eos> The most beautiful words a father can hear.<eos> - Da-da.<eos> Da-da. - Oh.<eos> Hey, one day you'll have kids of your own.<eos> I do.
There.<eos> Not this time.<eos> Think the pigs made them sick?<eos> Or we made the pigs sick.<eos> I think we should stay away from Judy a while.<eos> - Just in case.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I don't like it, but...<eos> - We have to protect her.<eos> Yes, we do.
I'm Bart Simpson.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Agent Crawford, FBI.<eos> You guys know I don't talk to field agents.<eos> Get your boss on the phone.<eos> I'm not here for you. I'm here for your dad.<eos> What do you want with his dad?<eos> Go back to sleep, Milhouse.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> I didn't.
Oh, you're so right.<eos> - No she's not. - Yeah, she is.<eos> I mean when they were the bad boys, we liked them so much better.<eos> And when I was the good girl, I liked me better.<eos> This is so screwed up.<eos> I cannot seem to figure out a way to get out of it.<eos> You just have to tell him that you don't want to get married.<eos> What?<eos> I want to get married.<eos> - No, you don't.
Jenkins, let him in, please.<eos> Alexander, how lovely of you to drop by.<eos> Thank you, Jenkins, that will be all.<eos> - If you need me, just call. - I will.<eos> Excuse me,<eos> I don't remember inviting you in.<eos> We've never stood on formality, have we?<eos> Why are you here, Alexander?<eos> - You know why.<eos> - Yes, yes I do.
I had Derek on there twice.<eos> So who's number one? Harris?<eos> Just because he's missing doesn't mean he's dead.<eos> So if he's not dead, our chemistry teacher is out secretly committing human sacrifices.<eos> Yeah, I guess that just sounded way better in my head. Well, what if it's somebody else from school?<eos> Like, you remember Matt?<eos> We didn't know that he was killing people.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> I... yes, we did.
Yes.<eos> Please, stop crying.<eos> I feel better, but I'll feel better when I know it's done.<eos> Don...<eos> Yes?<eos> I can't believe you would do this for me.<eos> You know I have children, too.<eos> I know that's not why you're doing it.<eos> And I hope-- well, I hope you know that I was just frustrated with you.<eos> I do now.
That means he's capable of anything.<eos> What exactly did she say?<eos> Please, I'm just trying to forget it.<eos> Drink that.<eos> - Feel better now?<eos> - I do.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Did she seem happy?<eos> Yes.<eos> She did.
Really?<eos> We can't both go.<eos> I know.<eos> I want you to stay here.<eos> You put all that energy and optimism back into the business and let me go out there.<eos> I'm the one who needs to start over.<eos> With Peggy?<eos> No, with my family.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Yes, you do.
Uh, I hate to interrupt.<eos> I think, Byron, I know what you want to hear.<eos> And it has nothing to do with the shooting days or the cast because you've had a long and fruitful creative relationship together.<eos> I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, that when you say you want a reason, you want to know why we would push you like this.<eos> It would help.<eos> Well, the truth is that I don't think Ted wants to say.<eos> 'Cause it's, well, it's a little bit personal.<eos> In fact, it's very personal.<eos> I'm not sure I know what you mean.<eos> Yes, you do.
You're certainly better at it than I am at whatever I do.<eos> But I would like to think that I have learned not to tangle with your kind of animal.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Where you are and who you are is not my concern.<eos> I surrender.<eos> So what does that mean to me?<eos> I want you to graciously accept my apologies.<eos> Work alongside me, but not too closely.<eos> Again, I don't understand.<eos> Yes, you do.
So, shall we seize the moment?<eos> Carpe diem away.<eos> Buddy, I told your mom that we were gonna clean up this mess.<eos> Do I have to?<eos> Oh, I'm afraid so.<eos> Yeah? Is it okay if the team sleeps over tomorrow after the game?<eos> The whole team?<eos> That's a lot of kids.<eos> I know, but nobody else can do it, and I told them that my dad was back, and they want you to show us some plays.<eos> Oh, you did, did you?
One of them just gave me his card.<eos> Like I need help with my stroke.<eos> Hey, who's that guy with Derek?<eos> Beats me.<eos> That's how it happened.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> I know.<eos> Hell of a shock.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> None of us did.
Thank you for hosting Christmas dinner tomorrow night, by the way.<eos> You didn't give me much choice.<eos> Hey, you're the one who has to watch Wilfred.<eos> And there's no way he's coming back to my place.<eos> Last time, he did that, like, fish juice thing on my carpets.
Especially when you do the monster truck rally voice.<eos> You got smacked!<eos> Okay, I'm just gonna come out and say it.<eos> I know you didn't burn the drawing.<eos> What? Of course I did.<eos> You saw me do it.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Well, then how come I found it when I was digging around in the yard the other day?<eos> Damn! How did you find it?<eos> I didn't.
Ohh!<eos> Mm.<eos> Do you see that?<eos> Natalie's sitting with the crossing guard.<eos> She just never hangs out with all the kids.<eos> Well, can you blame her?<eos> I mean, how can any of these kids help her with her career?<eos> Just worried that she's having trouble making friends.<eos> Mm.<eos> I did.
I'm Asian, adopted, and my parents are gay.<eos> How do you like that kind of pressure?<eos> You're the perfect minority trifecta.<eos> You could be illiterate and still get into Harvard.<eos> Also, Grace, honey, you should probably go through the vocabulary again when you get a minute.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And who's the most special person in the world?<eos> I am.<eos> And who loves Grace?<eos> - My dads do.
You get drunk and binge on cookies.<eos> Marina.<eos> For me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> "Happy Valentine's day."<eos> Thanks.<eos> And thanks so much for helping me tear those pictures down.<eos> You know, I was so crazed, I didn't get a chance to tell you that.<eos> You're such a great guy.<eos> Marina, I didn't...
Nice timing.<eos> That's friends of mine.<eos> - We're gonna walk out there, all right?<eos> - Are you...<eos> - Trust me.<eos> - What?<eos> Just trust me.<eos> You want to die stuck here, hmm?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> - You don't.
There.<eos> - How many?<eos> - I can't tell.<eos> We can take 'em.<eos> No!<eos> They're infected. Same as at the prison.<eos> We fire at 'em, get their blood on us, breathe it in.<eos> We didn't come all this way to get sick.<eos> How do we know the ones in there aren't any different?<eos> - We don't.
I swear!<eos> What the fuck are you doing? I told you to stay away from him.<eos> - He tried to get out.<eos> - Come on. Have some mercy, I beg you.<eos> I'll die back there.<eos> Oh, for God's sake, please!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> - Oh, Jesus.<eos> - I thought you locked the door.<eos> I did.
- This your boy?<eos> Yeah. Toby.<eos> What's your name?<eos> - You find out if you pass.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> - Where am I going?<eos> Len'll tell you when you get there.<eos> You got a minute to get there and back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If I don't?
She didn't have a chance. I told her we're not for sale.<eos> Right.<eos> It's nice to be wanted, but they're not Starbucks, and we're not Seattle's best coffee.<eos> Or Diedrich's coffee.<eos> Or coffee people.<eos> - Or Tazo.<eos> - Okay, we get it, honey.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You get it.<eos> I did.
Finlay was playing chess with him.<eos> Weren't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What was the last thing you said to him?<eos> Probably something kind.<eos> No, you said...<eos> "Fuck you, you fucking loser."<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
And nobody judges you.<eos> We all just sit and listen, so...<eos> You can't tell Rudy 1 where I am - he thinks I'm doing the laundry.<eos> I do the service wash.<eos> But you should come.<eos> Or definitely think about it, you know.<eos> You're nice.<eos> What's up with you?<eos> I think the probation worker fancies me.<eos> Oh, for God's sake, Finn, you monkey-faced prick, does he heck!
You heard what he said, he doesn't...<eos> I know, but he's wrong and stupid.<eos> He doesn't like what I do and he thinks I'm a dilettante.<eos> That is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard in my life.<eos> And he doesn't care at all that it's an insulting thing to say.<eos> He's having...<eos> He's not having any reaction.<eos> He's enjoying it, hurting your feelings.<eos> I think he enjoys it.<eos> [Nina] Do you?
The reenactments are how I honor service to our country.<eos> He just didn't see it that way.<eos> Ethan's opinion on the reenactment was petty and personal but hardly enough reason to kill for.<eos> But it wasn't just his opinion, was it?<eos> He took a Pro Bono case representing a group of vets...<eos> That wanted to see the reenactments abolished entirely.<eos> A case he was never going to win.<eos> The court of public opinion was against him!<eos> The community loves the reenactments.<eos> Everyone does.
Okay, I'm not sure what I did to offend you, but I'm sorry.<eos> Well, maybe you should just check with your girlfriend.<eos> You think I don't know what she's up to?<eos> Uh, Zoe's up to nothing, except diagnosing me and learning to juggle because you won't let her back in her practice.<eos> "Her" practice?<eos> - Her practice!<eos> - No, I didn't mean that.<eos> Oh, so that's what she thinks?<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> I didn't...
Good luck to you.<eos> Are you aware that 87% of people in this town don't think Joel and I should belong together?<eos> - What?<eos> - Have you not read Dash's poll?<eos> Well, I-I read about the soft serve.<eos> It was right after the soft serve!<eos> Yeah, I'm a single-issue voter, so...<eos> Come on. You know, it's obvious.<eos> They don't like Joel.<eos> You didn't either, until a few days ago.
- Yes, I am.<eos> It was kind hot, right?<eos> I'm just gonna... I'm gonna take a nap.<eos> Sleep it off, babe. Sleep it off.<eos> Is, uh... - Is he alive? - Yeah.<eos> Super-duper drunk, but alive.<eos> Good. Good to hear that. Um...<eos> listen, Zoe, I just... I just wanted to say that I... do not completely regret it.<eos> Picking you up on the side of the road.<eos> - I don't.
She didn't kill Wilden, she didn't put the gun in her overnight bag.<eos> "A" did.<eos> I walked right into the trap.<eos> All right, what Emily thinks...<eos> I know what Emily thinks, but I can't say anything to them.<eos> Because "A" is threatening to take down my mom and my dad if I say one thing about my mom being framed. One word, one freaking letter, my whole family's locked up.<eos> Tom, don't...<eos> Don't call her.<eos> She needs to know this.<eos> She already does.
Emily?<eos> What are you up to?<eos> Just doing some homework.<eos> The clinic called.<eos> You rescheduled your appointment?<eos> I had something to do.<eos> For Hanna.<eos> I know your friend is in a terrible situation, but this is just as important.<eos> If you ever want to be able to swim again...<eos> I do!
And I know that Mona confessed to a lot of that, but is there anybody else who still wants to hurt you?<eos> Is history repeating itself?<eos> You guys took a long time to speak up, and if this is happening again... it was an accident.<eos> Some speed freak lost control and used my front porch as a bumper.<eos> Where is this college?<eos> Maryland.<eos> She isn't answering my calls.<eos> She's really ragged right now.<eos> She thought her mom was gonna get bail.<eos> We all did.
You don't owe me anything.<eos> I want to explain.<eos> Wilden and I had a history.<eos> I did some things I'm not proud of.<eos> Things... he knew about, and he... he tried to use them to hurt me and Hanna.<eos> He was a corrupt cop, Ashley.<eos> I saw him... the night he was murdered.<eos> We had an argument.<eos> I know you didn't kill him.<eos> No, I didn't.
Well, I was just hanging out in my apartment.<eos> I can't lay a lot lower than that.<eos> And you never saw the shooter?<eos> Well, I was pretty busy trying to keep my brain matter intact.<eos> And you were on your way to the airport.<eos> Personal trip.<eos> To Israel?<eos> I'll travel for good hummus.<eos> Does Agent David know you've been delayed?<eos> She does.
Well, well.<eos> How was the desert?<eos> They say it's a dry heat.<eos> Welcome back, boss.<eos> What do we got?<eos> The usual.<eos> World went to hell while you were gone.<eos> I've got sniper slugs in my living room, and the Duck man found a rat in his lab, and, uh, there's a terrorist named Parsa who...<eos> Yeah, I know all that, DiNozzo.<eos> Of course you do.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - I only came by to give you these.<eos> - Now you're giving me my car back?<eos> - DCU doesn't need it anymore.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it got burned in an operation?<eos> What?<eos> You don't want it back?<eos> No, I do.
- Yes, you do.<eos> - I only came by to give you these.<eos> - Now you're giving me my car back?<eos> - DCU doesn't need it anymore.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it got burned in an operation?<eos> What?<eos> You don't want it back?<eos> No, I do.<eos> Yeah, Raff, I do.
- I only came by to give you these.<eos> - Now you're giving me my car back?<eos> - DCU doesn't need it anymore.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it got burned in an operation?<eos> What?<eos> You don't want it back?<eos> No, I do.<eos> Yeah, Raff, I do.<eos> I-I do!
What are you talking about?<eos> Two blasting caps like these were duct-taped to the tank.<eos> We going too fast for you?<eos> Well, tell us if you need us to slow down.<eos> The first blast blew a hole in the aluminum tank, allowing pressurized propane gas to escape into Alberto's car.<eos> The second blast ignited the propane.<eos> We found a receiver under the front bumper of Alberto's car.<eos> We think the transmitter is a key fob.<eos> - You have your keys on you, right?<eos> - Yes, but I don't ...
But he doesn't have the mirror.<eos> And he doesn't know where it is.<eos> Guess what? I do.<eos> Mr. Fuller, sir. We are so lucky you're not hurt.<eos> Shame about the slipper.<eos> We must find those thieves. We will.<eos> If I don't find them, the authorities will.<eos> We don't need them.<eos> We have the shards, but we don't know where the mirror is.<eos> You don't, but I do.
Couldn't eat, couldn't sleep.<eos> Paul convinced me to go on a road trip.<eos> And we went to spring fling at Michigan, ended up at a party... And I met this girl.<eos> We liked the same books, same bands.<eos> And in 20 minutes, we were finishing each other's sentences.<eos> And I thought you were so noble breaking up with me so I'd go to Vienna.<eos> I should have known you'd dump me for another girl.<eos> - It's not that simple.<eos> - Really, I don't need to know.<eos> Yes, you do.
- It's not that simple.<eos> - Really, I don't need to know.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Her name is Natalie.<eos> We're still together.<eos> - You're married?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm schizophrenic.<eos> I know, Daniel. And I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
Something that matters.<eos> Come on, something.<eos> You first and then we'll see.<eos> Depending on how riveting your life is.<eos> Riveting, yeah.<eos> It's not that.<eos> OK. Erm...<eos> I got married very young, as it goes.<eos> You know how it is.<eos> Well, actually I don't.
No problem.<eos> I really am... sorry.<eos> What for?<eos> I'm sorry... if what we did... made you feel... bad.<eos> Or cheap.<eos> I wouldn't call 300 quid an hour cheap.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> - I don't know what your circumstances...<eos> - No.<eos> No, you don't.
That's the NHS nowadays!<eos> But this way's much more effective so...<eos> Can I have it in there then?<eos> No, Mrs Black, I'm afraid you can't...<eos> Please?<eos> I'd be ever so grateful.<eos> Mia, please...<eos> Well, perhaps we should play it safe.<eos> You know best.<eos> I do.
The past is the past.<eos> Right now... you're getting up.<eos> You lay your fucking hands on me, and I'll scream.<eos> You need to get up.<eos> Conor's upset.<eos> So is Bridget.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I talked to him.<eos> You got some fucking nerve, you know that?<eos> I do.
Geez, I can't tell you nothing, can I?<eos> What the fuck is going on today?<eos> I want you to leave, Mickey.<eos> Stay away from my family.<eos> Abby, come on.<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> You wrote to me; all those letters helped me so much.<eos> You know how much it meant to me keeping up with those kids?<eos> I love those kids.<eos> I really do.
Okay, I'm going in now.<eos> You...<eos> Sorry.<eos> I mean that.<eos> -Was that something you had planned?<eos> -She had me fooled too first.<eos> She likes to play hubot.<eos> They are transhuman.<eos> Did you tell her I'm THS?<eos> Did you?
Inger has gone to work.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Waiting for Inger.<eos> Do it in the garage.<eos> Inger is my daughter.<eos> Please, Lennart... go out in the garage!<eos> Good morning, beloved Matilda!<eos> Good morning.<eos> Tell it to go out in the garage.<eos> Do it yourself.
What?<eos> Eddy, this is Fae.<eos> I can't read the dialect but...<eos> How long were you asleep at Selene's?<eos> A few years.<eos> Perhaps a few hundred.<eos> - But I'm at right as gold.<eos> - You're obsolete, man. You can't track.<eos> You don't even know what this thing is.<eos> Of course I do.
Stop it<eos> Crazy bitch Dirty bitch<eos> Stop it<eos> You dirty Don't move!<eos> Drop the gun<eos> These ignorant fools<eos> Who have you shot?<eos> Is that not enough yet?<eos> You just want to make your father sad right? Now you will live alone<eos> Please don't do it
I get nervous and then I overcompliment to a point to where it loses all its meaning.<eos> - Not the best strategy.<eos> - Hey, you're doing better than me,<eos> I'm just sitting here, staring at my menu silently.<eos> This is, um...<eos> This may kind of be my first date ever.<eos> Well, you're doing great.<eos> You wanna hear about my first date?<eos> - I don't know, do I?<eos> - Yes, you do.
It's a start.<eos> It's better than what I've been doing... "Blending in,"<eos> hiding and hoping that things are gonna get better.<eos> I think we can both agree that's not working.<eos> What do you think's gonna happen, Danny?<eos> One party and suddenly everyone's gonna forget about your past?<eos> I don't think that this is about other people forgetting about my past.<eos> I think it's about you.<eos> If the masks and the jump ropes are bringing back bad memories, if it's making it weird for you to date me, I get that,<eos> Lacey, I do.
Although I have been really stressed since this whole recession thingy.<eos> Everyone is so moody.<eos> Times are hard.<eos> I know, right?<eos> I'm so glad it's over now.<eos> You know, it's weird.<eos> You know when you dropped out of sixth form last year? There was this massive rumour doing the rounds that you were...<eos> You know...<eos> You thought I... Vera Draked?<eos> Well, everyone kinda did in an unspoken Facebook kind of way.
Where?<eos> 11601 Ridge Lane.<eos> [ Door creaks ]<eos> Don't shoot me, sheriff.<eos> I'm unarmed...<eos> among other things.<eos> What if the Ferg had answered this call?<eos> Well, then he'd have quite a story to tell.<eos> But the Ferg didn't take the call.<eos> You did.
Yo, yo...<eos> give 'em back.<eos> [ Vehicle door closes ]<eos> That look like him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How is it that kids out here in the middle of nowhere still manage to look like Philly gangsters?<eos> They all watch the same TV shows.<eos> Boys, we have a problem.<eos> We ain't got a problem.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Oh, yeah!<eos> You're gonna wear it!<eos> Really?<eos> So, Moses Clearwater has a record?<eos> According to Quaqua Nation Tribal Police.<eos> Assault and battery.<eos> Last year, Moses beat up an oil executive because he was surveying the land, looking for a place to drill.<eos> Huh. That is interesting.<eos> I didn't know Moses owned any land.<eos> Mm-hmm. He doesn't.
It's because everyone's downloading at the same time.<eos> Hey, I read Hallie's column yesterday.<eos> - On Sandra Fluke?<eos> - That chick can write.<eos> I'll tell her you said so.<eos> She knows who I am?<eos> Sure. Yeah.<eos> Why wouldn't she?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She does.
That's the difference.<eos> Deep down, they think he's an asshole.<eos> He's an asshole right on top.<eos> No, they, his friends in arbitrage--<eos> I know. I was making a joke.<eos> You're really--<eos> You're impressive.<eos> I have to make a phone call.<eos> - Did you call?<eos> - I did.
Go ahead.<eos> Your honor, there's nothing really to say.<eos> Then I'll say it.<eos> We'd been fighting a lot.<eos> I decided to go to Zach's office to talk to him, to work things out, away from the kids.<eos> I saw him and his assistant, Janice, kissing.<eos> I did not kiss her!<eos> How many times do I have to tell you that?<eos> I know what I saw, Zach.<eos> No, you don't, Rosie.

I know what I saw, Zach.<eos> No, you don't, Rosie.<eos> You don't!<eos> Your honor, it was tax season,<eos> Janice and I were working on a complicated return, and we were missing one crucial document.<eos> Without it, I was in serious trouble.<eos> She found the file and I gave her a hug.<eos> It was completely innocent, yet she will not believe me.<eos> I know what I saw, Zach.<eos> No, you don't!
I could see the end of this.<eos> We'd be done.<eos> We're murderers, Frank.<eos> Ain't no end to that.<eos> He knows.<eos> He knows what Brendan did for Skelos.<eos> Covering up the murders.<eos> Getting them declared suicides.<eos> He doesn't know you're involved.<eos> And you do?
I got to tell you the way you run this office is ab solutely gorgeous.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> We've been trying to run the office more gorgeously.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just that I didn't expect the chiropractor to be so...<eos> You--<eos> Hi!<eos> I'm Joe Longo.<eos> Dr. Mullins, or Chelsea, if you like.<eos> I do like.
Mel, look, I need your help.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> Milan.<eos> Second-day air.<eos> Oh, is that the jacket you weren't gonna buy to show me how good you were at waiting?<eos> Waiting sucks, okay?<eos> "Close Your Legs" was written by a woman with 200 cats.<eos> At a certain point, you just want to go for it.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
Look, you guys, if you want to be teammates, then you have to surrender the "me" for the "we."<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Keep it up.<eos> Yeah, girl. We're doing good.<eos> Yeah, but can you seriously pick your feet up some more?<eos> Okay, blindfolded,<eos> I'm faster than you, so stop.<eos> You really have to go there right now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
it's a game for the old or the British.<eos> Kinda the same thing.<eos> A bi-cultural joke.<eos> Quite funny for a Republican.<eos> Don't tell me my coffee's being served to me from across the aisle.<eos> I prefer to think my position is outside the narrow grid of U.S. politics.<eos> Are you telling me that you're a socialist?<eos> 'Cause we got one of those in the White House.<eos> Do you even know what a socialist is?<eos> Why, yes, I do.
Yes. Yeah, I know that.<eos> And, uh, I was wondering if I could still get my slot.<eos> No. Yeah, I mean that makes total sense.<eos> Is there a waiting list or...<eos> That long, really? Okay.<eos> Could you put me on there anyway?<eos> You want help?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hope you got good feedback after the meeting.<eos> I did.
Just please tell me you had nothing to do with this.<eos> I'm just enjoying watching his fall from grace that's all, the police have interviewed me and let me go.<eos> That didn't answer my question.<eos> No.<eos> I had nothing to do with it.<eos> They've charged him, he's guilty as hell.<eos> So what else have you got?<eos> I was chatting to an old DI I used to work with, he reckons Hopkins and the girl were seeing each other.<eos> Do the police have proof of that?<eos> Yes, they do.
Listen to me.<eos> She stands to lose control of this company permanently if we don't do something.<eos> Then do something.<eos> I'm trying, but you're cutting off my legs because of a bond you had with her father.<eos> No, because I value relationships over money.<eos> Well, I value the terms of our merger.<eos> And Hessington Oil was one of your biggest selling points.<eos> And Harvey Specter one of yours.<eos> I'm not going to stand for losing this takeover.<eos> Then don't.
Your parents' choice to "homeschool," much better.<eos> Okay, that was only till I was ten, and my mother's science fair was legendary.<eos> You must be so proud of your uncontested blue ribbons.<eos> Okay, you know what, I'm not gonna let you shatter the glass that I spent years blowing.<eos> And I'm certainly not gonna let the likes of you tell me who I can and cannot blow.<eos> [Shoes clacking] He's not gonna come.<eos> He will.<eos> You pushed his assistant?<eos> I charmed her.<eos> You didn't.
- Can't you get past the punch line?<eos> - No.<eos> Well, it probably helps that--<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Probably helps that what?<eos> That the shoes you walked 14 blocks in cost $1,200.<eos> - Okay, that was spunky.<eos> - I didn't mean to imply--<eos> - Yes, you did.
- No.<eos> Well, it probably helps that--<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Probably helps that what?<eos> That the shoes you walked 14 blocks in cost $1,200.<eos> - Okay, that was spunky.<eos> - I didn't mean to imply--<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - Yeah, I did. Ahem.
That's not funny.<eos> - No.<eos> - No, but it is your problem.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Yeah. Well done.<eos> Fucking asshole.<eos> Ha ha ha!<eos> RICHMOND: Fancy that beer?<eos> You want it?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> Kind of ashamed of myself, you know?<eos> Are you gonna see him?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I want to.<eos> Fucking knew we should have kept some of those diamonds.<eos> I got a kid.<eos> Yeah, you do.
This road is going to take us all the way to Mexico City!<eos> Aaaaaah!<eos> Samuel Pinkett!<eos> Philip Bourne!<eos> We have you surrounded!<eos> Give yourselves up!<eos> - This is it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We nearly did it.<eos> Didn't we?
No.<eos> What was the "well"?<eos> Hmm.<eos> I'll take Neal to where the guy usually is.<eos> - We found him already.<eos> We tracked him down.<eos> - Are you for real?<eos> The interview was fun for me and it shouldn't have been.<eos> Well, you know what my mother would say?<eos> I absolutely do not.
I read the HR report.<eos> There's honestly nothing to ask about.<eos> It was upsetting.<eos> I don't want to minimize it, but--<eos> - Were you sent to a doctor?<eos> - By HR.<eos> - A psychiatrist?<eos> - Yeah, and I'm fine.<eos> The doctor prescribed Paxil, but I don't take it.<eos> - You don't?
You're a good man, Bidwell.<eos> Now, then.<eos> Foxes the length and breadth of Derbyshire will be quaking in their dens at the mere sight of you on this little fellow.<eos> No-one's ever spoken to my brother as freely as you do.<eos> You've brought such laughter to Pemberley, Elizabeth.<eos> I want that kind of ease for myself.<eos> Do you have someone in mind?<eos> Well, I'd never marry without my brother's approval, especially after...<eos> Darcy wants only for your happiness, Georgiana.<eos> We both do.
- Thanks, mate.<eos> - To us.<eos> - To us.<eos> - And we never got caught.<eos> - Well, he did...<eos> What?<eos> He did.<eos> He hasn't seen me in two years.<eos> He's already passing judgments.<eos> - Well, you do with me.
- I deserted you at the airport, didn't I?<eos> Listen! You all deserted me.<eos> If you ask me, alright? You're the one who wants to get back.<eos> But for some reason you won't own up to it.<eos> So you keep using me as an excuse.<eos> - Just leave it, eh.<eos> - What?<eos> Leave it.<eos> I know, you don't really want me here.<eos> - No one does.
Excuse me?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Look, I'm sorry, OK?<eos> I didn't mean to push you.<eos> No, no, it's not that.<eos> Are you Erica?<eos> Yeah? I'm your date.<eos> OK. Do you not recognise me from the photo?<eos> You did pick me.<eos> Actually, my brother did.
You weren't just waiting for his sick mother to die so you could get a larger settlement?<eos> I was waiting for his mother to die because that is the decent thing to do.<eos> I wasn't just gonna walk out on him during something like that.<eos> But you're okay with secretly leasing an apartment across town?<eos> That's a lot of secrets for one person.<eos> Husbands and wives keep secrets from each other.<eos> Have you ever been married, sheriff?<eos> Yep. Then you know how stifling it can be.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
You know, maybe we should work out a couple of - sweet dance moves, you know?<eos> - What is that? Yeah.<eos> Like, that we could all do in unison. Or maybe we could wear the same outfit!<eos> Okay, yes!<eos> We'll create a visual harmony, same outfit, good.<eos> Oh, you guys, you guys, if we want to stand out, you know what we got to do?<eos> - We got to focus on our story. - Yes!<eos> Those competitions are all about how singing helped you overcome some major obstacle, you know?<eos> So I'll do, like, a stutter, and I'll say I got it from-from watching, like, a friend get blown to bits in Iraq. Ooh, ooh, you know what?<eos> And do it with a Southern accent
- Yeah, it's like Christmas...<eos> Hot, sexy Christmas.<eos> I am ready to unwrap my gift.<eos> Me too because I have been a good girl this year.<eos> So what are we using?<eos> Well, I thought we'd start with the traditional God-given equipment.<eos> No. You know what I mean.<eos> Birth control.<eos> - We don't have to use anything.<eos> - Yes, we do.

Look, I sold 45 brownies yesterday.<eos> And I've been averaging an extra $100 a week.<eos> I'm glad you're saving for retirement, Ma.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Excuse me, girls.<eos> - Did you see her face?<eos> - I think she's hiding something.<eos> Hey, Ma.<eos> I want you to meet Mark, my lawyer.<eos> - How do you do?
I never even left the courtroom.<eos> Want my dealer or not?<eos> I didn't sell ritalin to anybody.<eos> I just gave a couple pills to a friend.<eos> At least, I thought Max was a friend.<eos> I need to know where you got the ritalin, Ashley.<eos> Ashley was diagnosed with ADHD when she was 11.<eos> Her pediatrician prescribed it to help her concentrate.<eos> So how long have you been taking it?<eos> - I don't anymore.
Now, come on.<eos> We need to get out of here.<eos> Frost, I got to go.<eos> Bye.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I thought I was gonna have to visit you at Starbridge.<eos> Oh. We should have called.<eos> How did you get away from the warden?<eos> - You don't want to know.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
With a bunch of guns<eos> Guns?<eos> What guns, man?<eos> Fishing pole.<eos> Not a--not a rifle.<eos> Yeah, okay, but you stole her car.<eos> Stole it?<eos> I dumped it.<eos> Tricia never wanted an orange Lamborghini.<eos> You did.
We can talk about that later.<eos> I want a seat at the table, Sonya.<eos> I've been working for you people long enough.<eos> I want to meet the man in charge.<eos> I had a feeling this was coming.<eos> I've earned it.<eos> I know you think that's what you want, Michael, but this organization isn't just a job.<eos> I know what it's like to work for you and Burke.<eos> I know what it is.<eos> No, you don't.
In a long-term undercover job, the most difficult challenges aren't professional.<eos> They're personal.<eos> You have to try to remember where the line is between who you need to be and who you really are, because, when that line starts to blur, it affects everyone around you.<eos> Hey. Thanks for coming.<eos> What was so urgent that I had to run out in the middle of a job?<eos> There are things that you need to know I didn't think could wait.<eos> Here I am.<eos> The mission, getting in with this organization, I have a lot riding on it.<eos> I know.<eos> We all do.
Hey, Maddie.<eos> Charl-ay!<eos> Hey, you better watch those Raptors, man.<eos> They look a little hungry.<eos> Did you come by to play dinosaurs?<eos> No. Not quite.<eos> I was hoping you knew where Mike was.<eos> Presently, no.<eos> Why don't you try calling him?<eos> I did.
That's fucking murder!<eos> He tried to strangle me in the cabin!<eos> The guy talks to a fucking hole in the ground!<eos> Esther, they would have done background checks on all of us. If he was dangerous, they wouldn't have put him in here with us.<eos> What makes you think they've done anything right?<eos> None of this is right.<eos> We don't know who anyone is!<eos> I don't know who you are!<eos> I don't know who you are!<eos> None of us do!
Can't see the beacon anymore.<eos> I don't know if we're gonna make it out of here.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> And I want to be strong, 'cause otherwise... why the hell did I come?<eos> My foot's a lot worse.<eos> I don't want them to know.<eos> I don't think I'm gonna make it.<eos> Think I made a big mistake.<eos> I don't know where the hell we are.<eos> Nobody does.
We were walking in that direction, and I thought the beacon would be right here.<eos> It's not here.<eos> I fucking know that.<eos> - It's not here.<eos> - Yeah, I fucking know that!<eos> Do you wanna beat me up?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Come on. If you wanna hit me, hit me.<eos> - I don't wanna fucking hit you.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Go ahead.<eos> Hit me right in my face.<eos> - Why don't you do it?<eos> - Look at me.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Talk to me. Why did you take her?<eos> (Miljan) He told me to.<eos> - Who?<eos> Who told you--<eos> - He did.
'Cause you had to come and bust him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, but that was so important, you had to.<eos> How could you not, you know?<eos> Don't feel bad.<eos> We just had to tell everybody that Johnny took the food, and it makes me feel really bad.<eos> I think Johnny's gonna have a rough time at camp with everyone now.<eos> I think he's just done himself the biggest disservice, 'cause he didn't get away with it.<eos> If he had have got away with it... genius.<eos> But... he didn't, so... yeah.
What are we gonna do?<eos> I don't know. Um...<eos> I don't think we can really leave and just go in one direction like originally planned.<eos> That seems kind of stupid and illogical right now.<eos> But at the same time, I definitely don't want to stay here and wait for someone to come find us and do what they did at that base camp.<eos> Guys, I'm just thinking about the-- the grim situation that we're facing right now, and I think, uh, whoever took the rifle should own up right now.<eos> I never found it.<eos> I didn't find it, either.<eos> I didn't even have the bullets.<eos> I did.
!<eos> You all don't know nothing?<eos> Huh?<eos> _<eos> (Sam) Cameramen said they don't know anything.<eos> They're just told to shoot.<eos> Basically, it's just a paycheck to them.<eos> Do you-- do you know anything?<eos> Y'all-- y'all really know what the hell's going on?<eos> And apparently, y'all don't.
In the meantime, Blake Bridges is no longer a client of V3.<eos> Dani, I need a word with Troy alone. Thanks.<eos> So, I hear you've been meeting with V3 board members without me.<eos> Why?<eos> Just a standard analysis of last quarter's earnings.<eos> Without me.<eos> Yes, there was a scheduling conflict. Hmm.<eos> Evan Lewis had to be in L.A. all month, uh...<eos> Jeff Williams had another round of chemo.<eos> I didn't -
Five witnesses who can place Evans at Dagby's apartment the night he died.<eos> And what do they have to say?<eos> It was 8:00 in the evening.<eos> I'd forgotten my knitting at Clayton's.<eos> Every now and then, I sit on a pair of Pauline's needles.<eos> She leaves them at my place all the time.<eos> The needles and her phone.<eos> So, I usually do a little knit 1, purl 2, until she comes back to get them.<eos> Well, I mean, I like knitting, too.<eos> Who doesn't?
Oh, God.<eos> Poor Erin.<eos> God!<eos> I guess I'm pretty lucky you guys are picking me to help you, huh?<eos> Freeze it there, please.<eos> Okay, so tell me, if your tracking device was so damn fantastic, how did you not know what was happening to this girl, huh?<eos> I think Briana was drugged before she got into the car.<eos> Her heart rate and respiration slowed.<eos> We thought she had just fallen asleep on the way to an appointment.<eos> She did that sometimes.
Vocal adrenaline?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> The warblers are evil incarnate little craps.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> Good God, have you lost your mind?<eos> Tina, everybody, hear him out.<eos> Look, I want this to be more than just an ordinary proposal.<eos> I want this to be a cultural statement.<eos> Sure you do.
Whatever I want, OK, whatever I feel...<eos> I have a lot of discipline, OK?<eos> I have rules.<eos> I would never do something that would hurt you or upset you.<eos> I would never do something to make you feel bad, OK?<eos> I would never ask you to do something you didn't want.<eos> I'll take you home.<eos> I don't want to go there.<eos> Why?<eos> I just don't.
I thought you were out of the game.<eos> I am.<eos> My plane takes off tonight, and...<eos> I thought this was my last chance to -- to see you.<eos> And... to give you these.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The doctor...<eos> She's pretty.<eos> You have a plane to catch.<eos> So I do.
Thank you.<eos> And thank you for the information about Carl.<eos> I guess he was just getting rich off dirty money and couldn't live with himself.<eos> I thought you could use the closure.<eos> If there is such a thing in these...situations.<eos> Dani...<eos> You know what kind of man I am.<eos> Do I?<eos> Yes.<eos> You do.
Someone ordered their slaughter to benetit the national interest.<eos> Give me water!<eos> This is the first step.<eos> I'll put all the nations who led the world into war in that same position.<eos> Soga!<eos> You've been inf--<eos> Soga?<eos> This is... a gap in the maze, maybe?<eos> How did she leave the barrier maze?<eos> No--she didn't.
- Bye.<eos> I'm gonna walk around.<eos> Okay. - You want me to...<eos> - No.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey. Jo, that dress is amazing.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You look good too.<eos> Yeah, you really do.
- Mom.<eos> This is really weird.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And this is so much better.<eos> - Matty--<eos> - Listen, Jenna--<eos> No, you talk first, since you're the one who came over to do it.<eos> I mean... talk.<eos> Jenna, I don't want you to think that I hate you.<eos> I don't.
Okay, so maybe I'll have to speed up my process.<eos> [Phone whirs] It's from me.<eos> It says I'm walking towards you, and we'll be saying "Hi" in about four seconds.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - You invited me to lunch.<eos> - When?<eos> At the frozen yogurt place.<eos> We didn't even speak.<eos> We did, telepathically.
Jenna, put yourself in their shoes.<eos> You're asking them to hang out with the guy who broke up their friends.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Don't be.<eos> They don't have to like me.<eos> Hey, come here.<eos> The only person I care who likes me is you.<eos> Why can't they be happy that I'm happy?<eos> - They'll come around.<eos> - And if they don't?
Boat?<eos> Wow!<eos> Look at you.<eos> You must be really looking forward to this date.<eos> It is not a date.<eos> I'm going out for dinner with an old friend.<eos> But, be honest, what... what do you think about this dress?<eos> Does it look like I'm trying too hard?<eos> - No, I...<eos> - Oh, yes, it does!
You know what?<eos> We could put the money in another bag and leave that one here with the rest of the stuff.<eos> We can buy a small bag tomorrow at the station.<eos> Hey, Manuel, I'm going to buy some cigarettes... and some pastries for when Vicky gets here.<eos> You take care of that, and it'll be all set when I get back.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Can you get me a sandwich?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> - You have money, right?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
I don't mean to overstep...<eos> But, yes, I want to know if it's true, please.<eos> What's the consensus at Langley?<eos> - 60/40 in favor of.<eos> - Where do you fall in there?<eos> Ah, see, honestly...<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I mean, I'd like to think that you guys are together, but if you're not, I hope you are doing everything humanly possible to make it happen, 'cause...<eos> 'Cause you hit the jackpot.<eos> You did.
I was-- I was trying to save you.<eos> Ii... And I thank you for that.<eos> But I'm gonna have to live with that for the rest of my life and wonder if it was all worth it.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too, Fi.<eos> You're traveling a path with Michael.<eos> You always have.<eos> I can't go down it with you.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
I was tortured for us, you know that.<eos> I helped build all of this.<eos> And that, my dear, is what makes this so very hard.<eos> Mm, see, I need to know what you've done, what you've compromised.<eos> I'm gonna give you five seconds to come clean before this becomes a lot more painful.<eos> Now, who are you working with? - Please.<eos> - Who were those men?<eos> Five, four, three... James, I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Please don't do this.
Imagine my surprise.<eos> Of all the people he could've reached out to, why you?<eos> Guy needed a cop.<eos> That I get, but somebody had to point him in your direction.<eos> Might sound crazy, but at first, I thought it was you.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> He needed help.<eos> Thought you figured I'd step up for your sake, old times, whatever.<eos> - Look, I'm not saying it made sense.<eos> - It doesn't.
It's mine.<eos> Ezequiel got us a phone, but I-I didn't send that message.<eos> No, no, no, this could not be my daughter's cell phone number.<eos> Gisele: Stop lying.<eos> You must stop lying, Lukas.<eos> - Mama?<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> Gisele, stop.<eos> - No.<eos> - Don't.
This ARC program has caused nothing but trouble, Alec.<eos> Why is every woman in my life conspiring against me?<eos> Emily's on me about the same thing.<eos> What good can come from a program that tramples individual privacy?<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> Because the same program can be used to protect people from the government controlling what they see and hear.<eos> Look at us, all together.<eos> A family.<eos> You expect me to believe you care about people's access to the truth?<eos> Of course I do.
To corrupt and control the present in order to win the future.<eos> What they didn't plan on, is me.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> It's play money.<eos> You use it in a game, which seems to be what you're playing.<eos> We have a bigger problem, and I'm still waiting for you to solve it.<eos> You mean Escher?<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> You see, you don't get to dictate the terms of our little arrangement.<eos> And you do?
Yeah, the one that's not returning our phone calls?<eos> Well, a neighbor did... she said she saw Rayann entering Noelle's building at 3:30 A.M.<eos> The morning she died.<eos> Rayann lives in Santa Monica.<eos> What was she doing all the way across town the morning Noelle died?<eos> You don't know anything about how a dog park works.<eos> You're supposed to put the dog down, let her run around.<eos> It's a loaner.<eos> I don't want her to get eaten by one of these big dogs.<eos> No, I don't.
Nelson will nail it.<eos> We can't bring it in, but that doesn't mean the prosecution can't.<eos> We get them to knock down the firewall.<eos> Easier than knocking down this wall.<eos> Hey.<eos> Huh?<eos> Tag, you're it.<eos> Aah!<eos> Thanks for bringing over dessert.<eos> I didn't.

Okay, farmers.<eos> Let's work on the almanac later.<eos> All right?<eos> Why would someone put ag-lime on her?<eos> It accelerates desiccation and masks the odor.<eos> - Huh. How was she killed?<eos> - There are ligature marks.<eos> - So she was strangled.<eos> - Well, I didn't say that.<eos> I did.
Tara, wait up!<eos> You can't bail on a performance because I trained with Saskia.<eos> I'm not.<eos> You said it was my call.<eos> Now you're blaming me for taking up a massive opportunity.<eos> Have you thought about why Saskia wants to help you out of all the dancers in the Company?<eos> Because she thinks I'm good?<eos> Not to get back at me for trying to have her fired?<eos> Saskia sees something in me, something special.<eos> You clearly don't, do you?
Goodbye, Cameron.<eos> Norma said you had something for me?<eos> I do.<eos> He dropped it.<eos> I win. Do you?<eos> What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Why do you hate Harold so much?<eos> - I don't hate him.<eos> - Yeah, you do...
Don't write that!<eos> Write:<eos> "He wasted Matt at dice."<eos> And then...<eos> Yes...<eos> It's my turn.<eos> No.<eos> I'm playing until I beat him!<eos> - Write: "Big Max is a cheat!"<eos> - No! Don't!
You just got out of Queens for God's sake.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Looks like we got your hotel clerk Yablonski.<eos> Patrol out of the 1-4 found him in a dumpster.<eos> Single shot between the eyes.<eos> This lady of yours covers her tracks, that's for sure.<eos> Yes, she does, doesn't she?<eos> Carrie, how much would you bid on a silver inlaid cat food dish?<eos> Oh, I-I didn't know you had a cat.<eos> - I don't. - Oh.
Crowd (Chanting):<eos> Dimka! Dimka!<eos> Dimka! Dimka!<eos> Dimka! Dimka!<eos> I was supposed to be here a half hour ago, but someone slashed my tires.<eos> It's not her.<eos> We got the real Andrea Weston.<eos> Jackie set us up.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> You do?
Why would I throw that away over a low-rent hustle?<eos> 'Cause you're a cheap bastard with anger-management problems.<eos> The real question is, why are you playing a municipal course when you can play the best courses around the world?<eos> I can't gamble on my own properties.<eos> It's bad for business.<eos> Well, so is looking good for my murder.<eos> So, until further notice, don't go joining any foursomes out of state.<eos> I've got a 9:00 A.M. finance meeting at Hilton head tomorrow.<eos> I can't miss that.<eos> Not anymore, you don't.
and from your new friends.<eos> I had to guess your measurements, but I think I did all right.<eos> I'm not going.<eos> You're mad because you lost a fight?<eos> I'm mad we had to fight.<eos> At all.<eos> This last month, I've been shot at, you've been captured, and we've had more run-in's with Ultra than we've had in the past two years.<eos> We can't go topside.<eos> And of all people, I'd expect you to support me.<eos> I do.
We're not doing fireworks. Come on.<eos> How long have you lived here?<eos> Uh, about a year and a half.<eos> This place seems small for someone your age.<eos> You don't even have a kitchen.<eos> Oh, no, I have a kitchen.<eos> Look.<eos> Ta-da. That's not a kitchen.<eos> That's a microwave behind a sheet.<eos> Oh, well, I don't really...
It's now 3:15<eos> - And you've got the young 'uns at play.<eos> - Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> Yeah. The only problem is that I'm having quite a "adults only" party.<eos> And I'm just concerned about the kids Seeing some of the shit that's gonna go down.<eos> I don't see any guests.<eos> You don't see any guests at the moment, no.<eos> You don't at the moment, but they are on the way, And we are talking actresses, we're talking models, We're talking actors and musicians,<eos> So, as I say, it could be a little bit x-rated, - If you catch my drift.<eos> - Oh, I do.
But this is Arthur's son.<eos> I know, let me handle Arthur.<eos> You just work your mission.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know what happened on the bridge.<eos> Joan, I'm sorry.<eos> No, I'm sorry you had to experience that, but I need you to know you don't need to worry.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I do.
- No, but I failed to tell--<eos> I am who they say I am, Ruth.<eos> I done every damn thing they say I done.<eos> My father once told me... to put the past behind you, you must accept that you've moved beyond it.<eos> I don't think you have, Mr. Bohannon.<eos> The truth is, until you do...<eos> I'm not sure the railroad can save you.<eos> The point of this was to get Bohannon out and my son-in-law in.<eos> You said Ames would go along once he heard the evidence.<eos> He didn't.
My knee swells up every time the weather's coming.<eos> You done enough.<eos> Go on back.<eos> Move the camp.<eos> We'll be along directly.<eos> What was you doing out there?<eos> I'm only gonna say this once.<eos> This here baby white.<eos> I know that.<eos> I do, but she mine.
This council has heard enough.<eos> I will deliberate on a just punishment... as revealed by heavenly father.<eos> They hurt you bad?<eos> No.<eos> You?<eos> I told them I wasn't forced.<eos> I wanted you to know.<eos> Appreciate that.<eos> Guess it don't make much difference now.<eos> It does to me.
Should I step out, so you can measure the blinds?<eos> - So, Walt, how's Cady?<eos> - Cady's fine.<eos> That's funny 'cause I don't think she is.<eos> I think she's feelin' lost and alone.<eos> And I think deep down... she's angry because she put her entire life on hold for you when you needed her.<eos> And now that the tables have turned and she needs you you're too busy bein' Sheriff to even notice.<eos> Not only do you think you'd be a better sheriff than me you think you can walk in here and tell me how to be a father?<eos> Walt I know what happened in Denver.<eos> No, you don't.
She's embarrassed.<eos> She just needs some space.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> Just... the idea of her sitting there at home, all...<eos> I'm gonna go over there right now,<eos> - and I want you to come with me.<eos> - Danny, I don't think...<eos> Don't you want her to forgive you?<eos> - Of course I do.
So, Axe Cop, do you still think babies are dumb?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Aloha!<eos> We're back.<eos> Oh my gosh, we had such an amazing time.<eos> This volcano was about to erupt and everyone was like "we're going to die," but Flute Cop used his flute to charm the volcano.<eos> Let's just say it'll never erupt again.<eos> Did you miss daddy?<eos> Did you miss daddy?<eos> Yes, you did.
Don't go, Monique! Aah!<eos> I begged for someone to help.<eos> My own mother turned away from me.<eos> Sophie screamed and screamed for her sister, anyone to do something...<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> but no one did.<eos> Yet you survived.<eos> Therefore, someone or something intervened.<eos> Yes.<eos> Someone finally did.
So I did what he asked, but I was too late.<eos> Oh, God! Monique!<eos> Oh, let go of me!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it! Let go of me!<eos> Stop it!<eos> I got you.<eos> There was something about seeing Davina fight.<eos> She didn't just go along to the slaughter, you know?<eos> I do...
I've gone on two dates with the guy, and I'm more upset about that than seeing "murderer" scrawled across my brother's grave.<eos> It's called healing, Cami.<eos> For month's after the massacre, I couldn't think of anything else, and then suddenly, nothing.<eos> I need to feel that pain.<eos> Without it, I feel broken, empty, like there's someone to blame and I'm letting them get away with it.<eos> If you have found a way to turn it off, don't question it.<eos> The only person that is responsible for Sean's behavior is Sean.<eos> Do you really believe that?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Elijah killed her.<eos> But...<eos> Agnes was the last living elder.<eos> If she's dead, then I'm safe.<eos> Marcel would've told me.<eos> Maybe he didn't want to lose his secret weapon against the witches.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Why would I lie to you?<eos> Because you want something from me.<eos> Everyone does.
And whom, may I ask, do they need protection from?<eos> Me.<eos> You see, I recently ordered the slaughter of a group of vagabonds out in the bayou.<eos> Turns out, I may have been too hasty.<eos> Thing is, if the vampires find out I'm protecting them, it won't sit well.<eos> I think I can arrange something... on one condition.<eos> For her own good, I believe it is time for my niece to leave town.<eos> Oh, It's quite all right.<eos> She knows<eos> She does?
- We're not there yet.<eos> - How long before you're comfortable?<eos> Lance Corporal Herman Valenzuela is on the phone.<eos> - Valenzuela's dead.<eos> - No, he's not. He is on the phone.<eos> I need some kind of sign from you.<eos> I need an indication, some kind of indication, that you--<eos> - What?<eos> - Fully understand the stupidity of this.<eos> - I do.
What does it matter?<eos> It matters.<eos> It matters because there were holes in the story, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Now, Don, a ton of them, right?<eos> - We didn't see the holes because--<eos> - Ah!<eos> That's institutional failure, right?<eos> You don't have to answer that.<eos> - In fact, don't.
Jerry Brown's challenged Chris Christie to a race.<eos> Sponsored by HeartBlast, a new defibrillator company from the people who brought you--<eos> Piers Morgan and Rihanna had a Twitter fight about her haircut.<eos> I'll give you $100 if you go pitch that to Will.<eos> I know you're not gonna think this one's important, but it is.<eos> - Star magazine...<eos> - Nope.<eos> ...is reporting that a palace source confirmed that Kate Middleton is pregnant.<eos> - That's news I want to hear.<eos> - You just did.
Don't worry, I know you had a special night planned, so of course I'm coming along.<eos> You know why?<eos> - Because we spent six minutes and 20 seconds--<eos> - On Etch-a-Sketch, yeah.<eos> - It was a story and you know it.<eos> - No, it was a gaffe.<eos> He came out and said, "Don't worry about anything I've said during the primary.<eos> I can be whatever you want me to be."<eos> He didn't say it.<eos> Fehrnstrom did.
He probably entered in right there.<eos> Though there's no fishing worth a damn anywhere near here.<eos> But it is near an elk migration route.<eos> Looks like we found our man. Or at least his truck.<eos> You said Keith worked for you?<eos> Yeah. Till I had to fire him. Why?<eos> Found out he took a few guys out on a special hunting expedition. They offered him money to shoot a bald eagle, and he took it. Killing animals for money is one thing.<eos> Stabbing a man to death's another story.<eos> You think Keith could've killed Connor Redding?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Come, Doctor, lets clean you up.<eos> You reek of horse inards.<eos> Here you go, Mikha.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh God, what on earth's that smell?<eos> It's worse than the dead!<eos> I got it in Grabilovka.<eos> Oh I see... um...<eos> I didn't realise they had a parfumerie.<eos> They don't.
It's just...<eos> It's just a learner's permit.<eos> Aw, here he comes.<eos> What do I do?<eos> Just don't... Don't freak out.<eos> Just act super confident.<eos> Okay.<eos> You have a broken taillight.<eos> License and registration, please.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, yeah, done and done.
Look, I'm gonna go back to my office.<eos> You can come-- No, no, wait, wait.<eos> I'm waiting.<eos> Red John killed Sophie because she could identify him.<eos> Now he could have stolen my records without ever seeing her.<eos> He must have wanted to meet her, to talk to her.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, I don't know why.<eos> Maybe curious about someone that was close to me.<eos> But he did.
Cheeseburger, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese.<eos> Comfort food.<eos> A condemned man's last meal.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> H-how had he dishonored himself?<eos> Miss Makkena, you wanna tell us?<eos> Me?<eos> Why?<eos> Because he told you.<eos> Uh, no. Sure, he did.
It's not, it's just... you've just been so aloof lately.<eos> - I've really felt it, Lace, a lot.<eos> - Why are you sitting with us?<eos> I'm sorry, you guys, post-Archie, it's been a little weird.<eos> Wanna come over tonight?<eos> Hang out?<eos> You too, Jana.<eos> ( Bell ringing )<eos> Cole, you know I didn't do this.<eos> Um, actually, I don't.
- Ms. Rossi.<eos> - What's this about, John?<eos> - It's about Marilyn.<eos> She's a top-notch investigator, currently working for a well-respected private firm.<eos> Would you like to see my credentials?<eos> No thanks, that won't be necessary.<eos> - I don't get what's going on.<eos> - Well, it seems the Crane investigation has gone a little off course and I think Marilyn here can really help us out.<eos> - You don't have the authority to...<eos> - Actually I do!
Okay, uh, Harper comes here to kill Maki.<eos> He's already done that. What's he still doing here?<eos> Maybe he's not finished.<eos> Now is that any way to welcome a man into your home?<eos> Who are you?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I'm just, uh, looking for a guy and a girl.<eos> I'm told you know where I can find them.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I don't know if that's such a good idea.<eos> What, the sandwich or the triggering memories?<eos> Because everything that happened up here is good.<eos> Uh, but we don't have to eat, we can just talk.<eos> Or if you have somewhere better to be...<eos> No, not at the moment.<eos> But you do have somewhere to be?<eos> And you're wearing new clothes and you're showered.<eos> Did I not shower before?<eos> No, no, you did.
Let's race.<eos> Really, Shackleford?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What, I'm sensitive to your client's needs, and he wants to close this deal.<eos> You're not sensitive to my client.<eos> You're stalking him.<eos> Your shoes match your outfit.<eos> I didn't know they made spanx for men.<eos> You know, they make spanx for women, too.<eos> I do.
Why do you care so much?<eos> It's my heartbreak, not yours.<eos> 'Cause we're friends.<eos> Friends.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Aren't we?<eos> Hey, man, that song... way better than those jingles you were writing the other day.<eos> You know how many songs I've written since I've been here?<eos> Two, and they both sucked.<eos> - No, they didn't.
It's my heartbreak, not yours.<eos> 'Cause we're friends.<eos> Friends.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Aren't we?<eos> Hey, man, that song... way better than those jingles you were writing the other day.<eos> You know how many songs I've written since I've been here?<eos> Two, and they both sucked.<eos> - No, they didn't.<eos> - Yeah, they did.
There would be no other reason for him to come to town unless he was trying to kill me.<eos> Hey you!<eos> What's that face?<eos> What's that look?<eos> What look?<eos> That look.<eos> I know that look.<eos> There's no look.<eos> You know something, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.
Hey you!<eos> What's that face?<eos> What's that look?<eos> What look?<eos> That look.<eos> I know that look.<eos> There's no look.<eos> You know something, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yes, you do.
What's that face?<eos> What's that look?<eos> What look?<eos> That look.<eos> I know that look.<eos> There's no look.<eos> You know something, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> No, I don't. Yes!
Chuck here was just about to tell us how to get in touch with Turbo.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Keyword. Was.<eos> But I don't need all your drama.<eos> Wait.<eos> So you're not going to help us?<eos> Oh, honey, help you?<eos> I just don't have time for this.<eos> I'm not a miracle worker for Larry, Moe and Tubby.<eos> Oh, no he didn't!
Put your hands on the counter now.<eos> Drop the knife, or I'm gonna shoot!<eos> See, my father was a driver.<eos> For 50 years, customers... they'd sit in the back of his town car, treating it like a garbage can.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I took the last guy.<eos> We lived on the dollars they'd flick across the front seat.<eos> They broke him.<eos> I know what you're feeling.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I want to know what it is he had Dmitry trying to find at Shadow Pond.<eos> It's called detailing the provenance.<eos> You have to do it for every auction.<eos> If it works, we get Milos and whatever he's been after.<eos> And if it doesn't, we still get Milos.<eos> That was Boris.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> The men he had trailing Milos lost track of him.<eos> We know what happened to the last guy Milos got suspicious of, he had him killed.<eos> Actually, he did it himself.
What's up?<eos> I bought you a little present.<eos> - Really?<eos> - It's a friendship bracelet.<eos> - Aw.<eos> - It's my way of saying I'm sorry for keeping you in the dark about Phil and me.<eos> I should have known I can trust you with anything.<eos> Oh, Eden, I don't deserve this.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No, I really don't.
Someone who knows what this is about.<eos> Chloe.<eos> Then you know he killed her, and something had to be done.<eos> I never touched your daughter.<eos> You may not have put your hands on her like that monster did, but you're just as guilty.<eos> I didn't do anything!<eos> Exactly.<eos> See, her ex-boyfriend found her three times-- three times, using your Lifetrace.<eos> And every time he found her, we asked the company to take her information down, and they didn't do it, and so he found her again, and again, until the last time when he killed her.<eos> All because you and your company didn't do anything.
I find it takes years of business meetings to learn the kinds of things that a few martinis can bring about in one meal.<eos> We can talk about cyber-security, or whatever else might really be on your mind.<eos> I'll have my office set it up.<eos> You know, I thought I could handle this.<eos> But seeing the two of them together, it takes everything I have not to scream right now.<eos> Let's walk it off.<eos> They say when you're pregnant, the hormones change the way you feel, but I think it's simpler than that.<eos> I think they help you understand what's important and what isn't.<eos> I hope she knew how I felt about her.<eos> She did.
I said, "No.<eos> "He could never have committed these heinous crimes<eos> "because only one man lives in such dark places.<eos> Oliver Tate."<eos> Well, you would know.<eos> You pimped to him.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Is that why you bore false witness against me?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do, Jake.
Your guys' favorite, right?<eos> Ellie? Right here, Dad.<eos> You gonna get that?<eos> You shouldn't have dragged Mom out here.<eos> She saw me with Matthew.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> You should have just kept this between you and me.<eos> Why?<eos> Matthew and Jake had their daddy issues, and, thanks to you... so do I.<eos> You-you and the boys-- you did...?
Are you sure you're okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I've just got a lot on my mind.<eos> Stuff at home is very complicated.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I can't talk about it.<eos> SAMANTHA: So, it's about your wife?<eos> Maybe you need to just be honest with her and tell her you don't love her anymore.<eos> But I do.
Those things are driving me nuts, they're so constrictive.<eos> It's like my legs are trapped in a straitjacket.<eos> Eric, they're pants.<eos> People have been wearing them for thousands of years.<eos> Oh, no, no, not my people.<eos> The Beales of the Clan McBeale.<eos> And now you're Scottish?<eos> As heather and haggis.<eos> So why don't you wear a kilt?<eos> I do.
We have to work with what we have.<eos> Well, the guys in the boatshed are small fish.<eos> They're well-trained, they're well-funded, but they didn't order this.<eos> That was somebody higher up.<eos> Somebody who has access to technology that allows them to intercept air traffic control and sabotage a private jet's in-flight computer.<eos> Yeah, Hetty, this is a lot bigger than we initially thought.<eos> I mean, we're talking war crimes by private contractors.<eos> We'll get them, but today you caught two small fish, and sometimes small fish are the most perfect bait for big fish.<eos> This is far from over.<eos> You did well today.
Yeah, if "F" stood for "fabulous."<eos> Did you get the, uh, Drunken Pigs?<eos> With extra kimchi-- you're welcome.<eos> I think I just felt a shiver.<eos> Want me to, uh, grab something to drink?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, I have got you covered, my friend.<eos> Wow, one day you are going to make somebody the perfect personal assistant.<eos> Got a fork?<eos> I got a spork.<eos> Yeah, yeah, you do.
Oh, yes, you are because I cannot watch this alone.<eos> It is rated triple-B.<eos> What's that?<eos> Blood, breasts, and beasts.<eos> What was the last one?<eos> Beasts.<eos> Well, you know how I like big beasts.<eos> Either way, you're watching it with me.<eos> I thought you loved horror movies.<eos> I do, just not by myself.
Negative.<eos> He's moving the doctor on to the curb.<eos> He's moving towards the bus.<eos> On it.<eos> Go.<eos> Watch out.<eos> We lost them on the bus!<eos> I knew it.<eos> I told you he'd use the bus trick.<eos> No, you didn't.
- Just be there by nine.<eos> I need you to set up a surveillance team to 4025 Gray Avenue.<eos> I'll set up an arrest team.<eos> - OK, I'll work on a warrant.<eos> - OK, I'm gonna have a chat<eos> - with our friend Bridget.<eos> - OK.<eos> Wanna grab a coffee?<eos> You know someplace good?<eos> I do.
All right, I'll bring my A game.<eos> I didn't know you liked it rough.<eos> This is not a game, Bridget.<eos> I thought we were good.<eos> I thought we had a connection.<eos> You've been playing some kind of angle this whole time.<eos> I need to know what it is.<eos> You really think I have some kind of secret agenda?<eos> You all played your parts.<eos> I do.
It's bright red and says "alarm".<eos> Actually it says "larm".<eos> Oh, maybe they were trying to keep out the "urglars".<eos> Well, I... the bush is blocking the sign!<eos> If we don't go right now, we're gonna miss our opportunity.<eos> How are we going to disable an alarm without any professional know-how?<eos> That's what prison is mostly, a bunch of criminals teaching each other how to do a better job of stealing stuff.<eos> Go on.<eos> Nah, that's boring, you don't want to hear about it.<eos> Sure we do.
- Joe...<eos> - Mel, shh shh.<eos> Look, if I don't come back, just promise me one thing.<eos> Anything.<eos> When that kitchen timer beeps, you take the chicken out, okay?<eos> But you make sure the juices run clear because...<eos> No one will get food poisoning from a Joe Longo chicken.<eos> Going to prison for a crime I didn't commit was rough.<eos> But the worst part was knowing that my best friend betrayed me.<eos> He did the crime, but I did the time.
Jeremy swore he was through with his indiscretions. We...<eos> We were on the yacht to rekindle our relationship.<eos> So you thought one romantic dinner on a yacht would fix your problems?<eos> No, but...<eos> we had to start somewhere.<eos> Look me in the eye and tell me you loved him.<eos> Tell me you didn't wanna tear his face off.<eos> Do I look angry to you?<eos> I loved Jeremy.<eos> I still do.
Don't walk away.<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> I'm right.<eos> You see?<eos> I am right.<eos> You know I'm right!<eos> You know I am right!<eos> You do!
all right. we're angry.<eos> we're getting revenge.<eos> we're a little bit tipsy.<eos> we should not be driving.<eos> we're taking the bus.<eos> i love the bus!<eos> (jake) so the waitress heard the couple arguing at dinner.<eos> apparently he was having an affair, and it was not the first time.<eos> two years ago, she caught him with a dog walker who was walking his dog, if you know what i mean.<eos> i do.
I read that bears climb trees.<eos> - I'll lose him.<eos> - They're fast.<eos> Galaad, just stop!<eos> Sprinting, I can still handle a bear.<eos> Maybe he'll leave if he sees us.<eos> I think bears are fearful.<eos> Well, quite evasive.<eos> Dad told me.<eos> - He did?
We still can.<eos> I know it.<eos> You look like you're having as good a time as I am.<eos> Turns out they're both lousy dates.<eos> You wanna get the hell outta here?<eos> I'd say that's the best offer I'd had all night.<eos> All right, here's to you for talking up your label - and keeping your secret safe. - Hmm.<eos> Here's to killing two birds with one stone.<eos> Hey. You mind if I have a word with my artist?<eos> Um, I don't, if she doesn't.
If you don't do something soon, things are gonna get worse.<eos> A lot worse!<eos> Okay, concentrate.<eos> Come on, Freya, Ingrid can empty a freaking lake.<eos> You can do this.<eos> Wow. You really are a klutz.<eos> It's kind of adorable.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - I work here.<eos> - No, you don't.
Joanna Beauchamp?<eos> You are under arrest.<eos> You killed her husband right before her eyes.<eos> - You look exactly the same.<eos> - Immortality will do that.<eos> She had this strange little doll made out of hair.<eos> It's called an energy talisman.<eos> Is it supposed to suck away your powers?<eos> No, not supposed to.<eos> It does.
And-and I can't explain why.<eos> All right, look,<eos> I appreciate the whole mysterious vibe thing. I'm sure it works on some guys.<eos> I just don't have the time to figure you out right now.<eos> Okay? I'm busy.<eos> Okay, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Sorry. Okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What you said was right.<eos> I did...
I'm sorry.<eos> What you said was right.<eos> I did...<eos> I did lie to you.<eos> I did... use you, and I feel terrible about it.<eos> You may not want to figure me out, but I want to figure you out.<eos> When we first met, there was this connection.<eos> A spark between us.<eos> And I want to get to the bottom of it.<eos> You do?
Thank you.<eos> Close your eyes and drink.<eos> Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum.<eos> Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum.<eos> Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum.<eos> Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum.<eos> Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum.<eos> Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum.<eos> Did it work?<eos> It did.
Sweetie...?<eos> What's happening?<eos> I just died.<eos> Wendy killed me.<eos> Wow, we are getting married this weekend.<eos> I guess we are.<eos> Of course, the first time I met you, I knew we'd get married.<eos> - Y-You did not.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> No, I-I did.
Why don't you try looking at the picture.<eos> Yeah, maybe he was here a couple weeks ago.<eos> You help him remove a tree stump?<eos> What? No.<eos> I'm betting you sold him some C-4.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I have to check my records.<eos> What'd you say his name was?<eos> I didn't.
Low, slow flyer incoming starboard side.<eos> Low, slow flyer incoming starboard side.<eos> All right, boss, you got the UNICOM frequency.<eos> This is NCIS Special Agent Gibbs.<eos> The Benjamin Franklin has locked on to you with their weapons.<eos> Lieutenant?<eos> It doesn't have to end this way.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I need to do this.<eos> No, you don't.
We found the door open, blood and beer bottle on the floor.<eos> No Haibach.<eos> Rigsby's canvassing the neighbors.<eos> This is bad.<eos> Not really.<eos> Confirms the theory that someone is going through my list trying to find Red John.<eos> Haibach has been abducted, and he's probably gonna be tortured to death.<eos> Yeah, he's in for a rough night.<eos> And we have to tell Smith and the F.B.I. that he's been taken and that it's connected to the Marx case.<eos> No, we don't.
- Ed, this is not the time.<eos> - And get out of my sight!<eos> So this man is clearly unhinged.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Hi, Damian Tremblay, this is my construction site.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I'm Detective Black.<eos> Do you know anything<eos> - about what happened here?<eos> - Of course he does!
But, Olivia, this man is homeless, a transient.<eos> He attacked a violent criminal with his bare hands and then he explains it away by telling you that he's part of a secret ring of super spies.<eos> He's clearly mentally ill.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Probably.<eos> But can you look into his story?<eos> Ask around?<eos> Don't you have that friend at the FBI?<eos> - If you really want me to ask, I will.<eos> - I do...
I'm sure she has her reasons.<eos> We made a deal.<eos> My people you stay away from, especially Huck.<eos> I'm not here to talk to your people.<eos> I'm here to talk about Jeannine Locke.<eos> You need to leave.<eos> I'm sure you realize by now that there is one thing I have a say over.<eos> If you ever wanna see Jake Ballard again, America will believe it was Jeannine Locke that had an affair with the president.<eos> How do I know he isn't already dead?<eos> You don't!
A full one more!<eos> Felt like flying!<eos> I'm the only one not sleeping in this hospital.<eos> I'll wake them up.<eos> Mao'er, massage by back, it really hurts.<eos> Please!<eos> Mao'er, a proper nice massage!<eos> - Go run again.<eos> - What? Come on, go run again!<eos> No, you do that.
- They're good with me, don't worry.<eos> - Are they good with you?<eos> We're all roommates.<eos> Maybe you could buy him cigarettes.<eos> Smoking helps killing time.<eos> No, I don't smoke anymore.<eos> Get her to buy something else, something to eat.<eos> Some biscuits or fruit.<eos> Who makes your laundry?<eos> - We do it ourselves.
Ooh, she's eight months pregnant.<eos> And about to pop, but she says she's fine.<eos> She's been camped out in the conference room for two days.<eos> Running a city-wide operation.<eos> Jones, I can't put her or her baby at risk just because she wants to close the book on Greytrade.<eos> Look, Peter, I'm no psychologist, but I don't think it's about this case.<eos> I mean, she's staring down the barrel at Diana Berrigan, single mother, and that's scary.<eos> But I think the idea of her losing Diana Berrigan, Special Agent... I just think that's scarier.<eos> She knows she always has a place here.<eos> But does she?
You went to Brooklyn Residential High.<eos> What sport did you play?<eos> All state in wrestling.<eos> Are we done?<eos> Mm, not quite, but you can get on with your day now, Mr. Jacoby.<eos> Oh, you know that vault that was in Kaplan Security, the one with the $2 million cash in it?<eos> It's all gone now.<eos> But you knew that.<eos> Or you didn't know that.<eos> Well, now you do.
(SCOFFS) You really believe that?<eos> What's your name?<eos> C'mon, man.<eos> We're locked up in the same house.<eos> You can call me... (GRUNTS)<eos> - You know what?<eos> Where are Mom and Dad?<eos> They should be here by now.<eos> They'll come.<eos> And what if they don't?
You're under suspicion of murder, Father.<eos> I said I didn't follow her.<eos> She told me she could get her hands on this box.<eos> It was a golden opportunity to expose them all.<eos> We were going straight to the newspapers.<eos> But she betrayed you.<eos> She took it to Sanderson.<eos> She needed money, and she turned to the man you loathed most to get it.<eos> Did you kill Lavinia, Father?<eos> No, I didn't.
Well, she texted me early this morning and said she was going to see a lawyer.<eos> I remembered your name.<eos> She's not answering her phone.<eos> She's not at work.<eos> The police said I can't file a missing-persons report for 48 hours.<eos> I was hoping you might know something.<eos> I...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I...<eos> I don't.
I didn't.<eos> She must've ...<eos> - Oh, lord.<eos> Much better.<eos> Haven't felt that "someone's watching my every move" feeling since I failed my driver's test.<eos> You want to tell me what the hell's going on?<eos> - S.H.I.E.L.D. got to you?<eos> - They picked me up in L.A.,<eos> I helped them in a crisis, and now they want to recruit me.<eos> Of course they did.
He rocked the white-guy dreadlocks<eos> - before they even got all trendy.<eos> - Gross. [ sighs ]<eos> I just ...<eos> I just can't believe my Dad would look through my room and my computer.<eos> I feel so violated!<eos> And then to embarrass me like this?<eos> I mean, it literally looks like I wrote "Ace McBrady" like 50 times.<eos> - I know how you feel, Hil.<eos> - No, you don't.
But Skye?<eos> You said this was a select team.<eos> Assembled to work new cases, to protect people.<eos> I don't see how letting some hacker tag along --<eos> I'm looking for an objection I haven't already anticipated.<eos> I'm calling this.<eos> But your frown will be on record.<eos> We've been called in to investigate an 0-8-4.<eos> We all know what that means.<eos> Yes, we do.
There isn't any chance we get to keep the device, is there?<eos> It's not mine to give, but I'm sure we can find a way to resolve this respectfully in a way that gives your coun--<eos> Rebels.<eos> Stay close.<eos> On my six.<eos> Let's go.<eos> They're coming for it.<eos> Let's move!<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It does to me!
Not "what," "who." She's a cat.<eos> He went after your cat?<eos> He went after his cat.<eos> He tortured his cat?<eos> He deprived her of my letters.<eos> Louis, you lost your shit during a negotiation because someone didn't read your letters to their cat?<eos> Harvey, please.<eos> I'm sorry I lost my head.<eos> I don't even remember signing the agreement.<eos> Well, you did!
- Are you not listening to me?<eos> I was thinking about moving in with you, and then I find out that you go to my dad--<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Are-- are you saying this changes everything?<eos> - It's complicated.<eos> - What's complicated about it?<eos> Forget--I don't even want to get into this with you right now!<eos> Rachel, if you don't want to live with me, why don't you just tell me you don't want to live with me?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Well, do you?
No, but her reputation is.<eos> She'll survive.<eos> You're lying about her.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> Stephen, I'm gonna ask you this one more time.<eos> If anything you ever said to me was true, please don't do this.<eos> I'm sorry, Donna.<eos> I have to.<eos> - You get what we need?<eos> - No, she didn't.
Take off the shackles off and let me convince her this fight isn't with me, it's with Edward.<eos> Okay, Harvey.<eos> Okay, you win.<eos> Shackles are off.<eos> There's something that I need to tell you, and...<eos> I really don't want to.<eos> Okay. [Chuckles] You're scaring me.<eos> Jessica came by my place this morning.<eos> - She knows about us.<eos> - She does.
We're outside the walls!<eos> Eren.<eos> I'm sure that's the signal from Captain Levi.<eos> We'll rendezvous with the Captain!<eos> Cut the chatter till we get back.<eos> Erwin... Why did you order Levi to resupply?<eos> There's no time to waste.<eos> The Female Titan was eaten.<eos> But did you see the person inside get eaten?<eos> I didn't.
And why are you still here?<eos> I just wanted to tell Carrie about my Ninja adventure.<eos> I slept with that guy from Youshi... whatever, and now he's wanting to take me out.<eos> So lame.<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> Hmm, that someone would like to get to know you?<eos> Yes, that does sound dubious.<eos> Please.<eos> You have idea who I am.<eos> Oh, don't I?
Bye. ..create a second layer around the oocyte: the zona granulosa.<eos> The diameter of the oocyte keeps on growing bigger because of the multiplication of follicle cells up to 180 microns.<eos> At the end of the evolution you see the creation of a structure producing oestrogen.<eos> Pizza di Lione.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We won the race?<eos> Yes, we did.
Open it. You'll see.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> You always loved it.<eos> Don't... touch me.<eos> Well, that's disappointing.<eos> But not altogether surprising.<eos> - You work for him?<eos> - No. Of course not.<eos> He works for me.<eos> They both do.
You'd see them arguing about it all the time.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Hated it, did he? Hmm.<eos> You got me.<eos> A foolish lie.<eos> The truth--I was mad as hell about Visualize.<eos> I'm trying to expand our business, he joins some moonbat cult?<eos> We fought about it a lot, so now I feel guilty that we ended on bad terms.<eos> But I didn't kill him.<eos> You didn't, did you?
How did you get the autopsy before us?<eos> I still have friends in CBI, Teresa.<eos> They help when I need it.<eos> Speaking of... helping friends, a word of advice for both of you.<eos> Yeah? What's that?<eos> Jane.<eos> He's made a mess of things.<eos> He doesn't know when to leave well enough alone.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> No, I don't.
Okay, this clearly is not working.<eos> Wuornos, let me try.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I've picked a few handcuffs in my day.<eos> - You get arrested a lot?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I just had a boyfriend who was really into bondage.<eos> You getting a good look?<eos> - You know I'm not her, right?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Mr Rose, are you here?<eos> Naughty, naughty, Miss Fisher.<eos> Claude may not have secrets, but I might.<eos> Such as what happened to your tail light?<eos> Well, some idiot smashed it.<eos> They're lucky I didn't catch them.<eos> That's what happens when you park on the street.<eos> In front of the VAA Lounge.<eos> Why did you lie?<eos> I didn't.
Over here, Spall! (Grunts)<eos> Glad your timing's not off, Inspector<eos> Thank you, Collins.<eos> Sir.<eos> What's so important about that book, Mr Spall, that you'd shoot a man?<eos> You're out of your depth.<eos> Katz' killer is still out there.<eos> I didn't put it there.<eos> How did you know where it was hidden?<eos> I didn't.
We were listening to the wireless.<eos> Louisa was going to do so many wonderful things.<eos> Miss Fisher, detective, and my assistant, Miss Williams.<eos> Jimmy Creswick, station manager, 3JH, and my wife, Hazel.<eos> And this is Louisa?<eos> Yes, our Girl Friday,<eos> Miss Louisa Singleton.<eos> How awful.<eos> They said they'd get us.<eos> Who did?
Why didn't you tell me you were so ill?<eos> I'm not, Jimmy.<eos> It's just nerves.<eos> Thank you, Miss Fisher.<eos> I'll take her home.<eos> The doctor can see her there.<eos> No, please.<eos> I don't need a doctor.<eos> I need to finish the broadcast.<eos> No, you don't.
Poor Len.<eos> (Door opens)<eos> How undignified.<eos> MAN:<eos> Mrs Stanley!<eos> Oh, Chester!<eos> How is poor Birdie?<eos> Shattered.<eos> She thought Len was fighting fit.<eos> We all did.
Other do what their loved ones would've wanted.<eos> Well, what Megan would have wanted was to still be here alive.<eos> They said she committed suicide.<eos> Yeah. I know.<eos> That's what they said.<eos> So then what do you think happened?<eos> Yeah. If you care about her, get her sunflowers.<eos> She liked those.<eos> Hey, do you have a name?<eos> Yeah. I do.
I deserve to know about it.<eos> Hey, Jack.<eos> Hey, thanks.<eos> See you at the game.<eos> Are you under arrest?<eos> No, he's not.<eos> What the hell's going on here?<eos> Mitchell: While monitoring the residence, we came across Mr. Karsten and asked him to come in for questioning.<eos> Well, he declines to answer any questions at this time.<eos> Actually, he doesn't.
I'm gonna see what you've been up to.<eos> In the meantime, you stay in touch, or I swear, I will track you down, and I won't be so friendly next time.<eos> - All right, all right. - Get off my car.<eos> - Let go of me!<eos> - Hey, hey! Calm down, Connie.<eos> What's going on?<eos> When they offered me protection, I didn't think it meant house arrest.<eos> You're under a lot of stress right now.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - No, I do.
No, T.J., it's not like that.<eos> Look... She had to tell the truth.<eos> There's a new truth.<eos> Did she tell them about that, the new truth?<eos> Don't... don't... don't... Let's not talk about that.<eos> Don't talk about that with anyone.<eos> What happened to your eye, T.J.?<eos> I can take care of myself, Lainie.<eos> I know how to.<eos> Of course you do.
What's the matter, Bernie?<eos> You dodging the I.R.S. again?<eos> I've had one of those weeks.<eos> What is it that you want?<eos> Straight to business?<eos> I'm having a little trouble with my bank.<eos> They shut down the funding on the Streeterville project.<eos> Some 12-year-old girl told me the bank was concerned the zoning vote might get pushed.<eos> Not might...<eos> Did.
Actually, in fact, I think that we need to involve him more in our business.<eos> You do?<eos> Oh, that's terrific, because I've been thinking the same thing.<eos> Well, I'll see what I can get on the boyfriend.<eos> Probably just some poor jerk-off who doesn't know what he's getting himself into.<eos> Sara, I know you've been seeing someone.<eos> I know about the therapist.<eos> The office called to confirm your appointment.<eos> Actually, I think it's great.<eos> You do?
Are you all right?<eos> Well, after I, uh, got your text, I talked to Vic, and he says he didn't do it.<eos> You believe him?<eos> I want to believe him.<eos> I-I mean, I do, but, uh...<eos> He's been boxing.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> - No.<eos> - With my father?<eos> No, I didn't.
- Hello.<eos> And I believe you know that man.<eos> Papa...<eos> I heard Rebecca's sick.<eos> I saw the story on TV. I...<eos> What just happened?<eos> Miss Bingum, I've been shunned.<eos> In the amish tradition, we are baptized as adults.<eos> At that point, we become full members of the church and we cannot leave.<eos> But you did?
It didn't feel right.<eos> Speaking of things that don't feel right, why exactly is McNab no longer guarding that woman's door?<eos> She's refused our help.<eos> Apparently, she feels less safe with us.<eos> That's rough for the group.<eos> But in our defense, it is very difficult to break down a door, Chief.<eos> It's not like it looks on TV.<eos> That was solid oak.<eos> I'm pretty sure I dislocated my shoulder. - You didn't dislocate anything.<eos> - Yes, I did, Shawn.
Go to 2:20.<eos> 2:25.<eos> Stop.<eos> Now we know where she made her last stop.<eos> Evidence, O'Hara, sometimes comes in handy.<eos> I told you we didn't need a key.<eos> This isn't right, Shawn. Nope.<eos> Key or no key.<eos> Gus, we are on an island right now 'cause he didn't kill her and you know it.<eos> No, I don't.
See, in the hospital, you... you figure things out, and I know now why my head hurt.<eos> And I know the capabilities of humanity, and that's given me clarity.<eos> Great.<eos> Please, do tell.<eos> No, I'm done with that.<eos> See, I try to tell people, but they stop listening once you're labeled.<eos> I can still help you, man.<eos> I'm gonna find Elisa's killer.<eos> Oh, I know who killed her.<eos> You do?
Thank you, Deeks.<eos> You boys thinking of how you're gonna spend your $75 million?<eos> I was just trying to convince him that... there's a good chance Robin's still alive.<eos> Is there?<eos> I believe the correct answer was,<eos> "What $75 million?"<eos> I'm afraid the time for you playing stupid has expired.<eos> Songshaw Holdings? The venture capital firm that just wired ReduceQ $75 million this morning?<eos> That's a lot of money to find out what the, uh, line is like at Panda Express.<eos> We didn't...
Frida?<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Take some painkillers.<eos> Why did you do it, Linus?<eos> For money?<eos> I just wanted to show them. The guys.<eos> I would be in the gang.<eos> Show me who they are.<eos> Do it.
Yesterday.<eos> Our father. We ate Lunch together once a week.<eos> She was as usual.<eos> Can you sit down?<eos> I do not like you walk around.<eos> I'm not touching anything.<eos> You do not want people to like you.<eos> You've just lost your sister.<eos> Imagine if someone zegt That she did not like you.<eos> She did not.
- It's not over.<eos> - Saga, you have a visitor.<eos> - This is where you work? - What do you want?<eos> I came to say goodbye.<eos> I'm going home today.<eos> It has been... interesting.<eos> Being with you.<eos> Many people use the word "interesting" about things they really do not like.<eos> - What did I do wrong?<eos> - You did not do anything wrong.
What? You're into getting zip-tied now?<eos> No, I know who robbed us.<eos> But it's my problem and I can handle it.<eos> Hey, it's our problem.<eos> Let's get our shit back.<eos> - So who is this guy, anyway?<eos> - Massimo.<eos> - Druid Massimo?<eos> - You know him?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Stop!<eos> Federal agents!<eos> Stop!<eos> It's not here.<eos> Where's the toxin?<eos> Rasheed!<eos> Where's the toxin?<eos> What if he doesn't talk?<eos> He'll talk.<eos> They always do.
Tell him, Murray.<eos> She has a gift, this one.<eos> Fact... 16 of my setups led to marriage, which resulted in 37 children.<eos> I did that.<eos> I created life.<eos> She's like God.<eos> Trust me, dad.<eos> I know what's best for you.<eos> - She knows what's best.<eos> - The hell she does.
She shouldn't be afraid to speak her mind, you know?<eos> I mean, she should have a sensitive side, but still be a hard-ass.<eos> Oh! Sit up straight, honey.<eos> And I want her to take care of me.<eos> Cook, pick up my stuff, make me hot pockets. Mm.<eos> By the way, thank you for the hot pocket.<eos> All right, and I'm on the case for my sweet, handsome, delicious boy.<eos> You know you just described mom.<eos> What?<eos> I did n... oh, my God!
The tiki gods were on our side.<eos> Hey, Carter! You're still here.<eos> How much laundry do you have?<eos> Well, I lost the keys to my apartment and my dad has the spare.<eos> I'd wait in his place, but I lost his keys.<eos> Remind me never to hire you as a babysitter.<eos> Because you'd lose my kid.<eos> Not that I have one.<eos> Though I did do some damage in my day.<eos> No, I didn't.
Well, only if I don't take my trusty yellows.<eos> Do you have enough pills to last?<eos> Yeah, my... my dad just sent me some new ones, so I'm pretty good for a while.<eos> What?<eos> Y-you can't run away with me, Kip.<eos> What?<eos> I'm strong.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> - No, I know you are.<eos> No, you don't.
No, I'm just saying that a conflict of interest is a matter of law, and second-rate is a matter of opinion. Hmm.<eos> Who do you like better, Hemingway or Dan Brown?<eos> I'm not a good judge of literature, sir.<eos> Uh, who's Dan Brown?<eos> Da Vinci Code.<eos> Ah, okay.<eos> Well, I haven't read it.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> - And I really like Tom Hanks.<eos> - Who doesn't?
Is there some kind of Jail Upgrade Program I'm not aware of?<eos> Jesus!<eos> Look, I just wanted to make sure he was okay and it turns out ever since seeing me at the pool party he's had a lot of unresolved feelings about our break up and relationship.<eos> It was just really intense.<eos> It wasn't a fun night.<eos> He was crying and begging for me to give him a second chance.<eos> He can be a little dramatic and over the top sometimes.<eos> Why would you be stupid enough to date someone like that?<eos> Anyway, did you tell him that you can't get back together with him because you have a boyfriend?<eos> Of course I did, baby.
- What's going on?<eos> - I didn't mean to.<eos> I was just trying to do something great and then...<eos> Oh, my God! What is the matter with you? !<eos> This... this is exactly why I didn't wanna tell you.<eos> Because I knew that you would screw it up.<eos> No matter how great or funny or amazing you thought it was going to be, at the end of the day, I knew you were gonna hurt her!<eos> - That's not true. - Ben!<eos> Let's face it, you don't deserve her.<eos> So then who does, Danny?
That makes 'em crazy, and it gets the jealous going.<eos> So, if you want your chick to notice you more, just pay less attention to her.<eos> She'll come a-knockin'.<eos> - Hmm? Can I ask you a question?<eos> Did you date bad boys when you were growing up?<eos> I married one.<eos> - Why? - Why?<eos> 'Cause it was exciting.<eos> - So, the bad-boy thing kind of works?<eos> - Well, until it doesn't.
Lieutenant?<eos> Crane?<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> [IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]<eos> The imagination, is a powerful thing, Jenny.<eos> What you actually saw was likely an animal or a hunter.<eos> What we saw was a demon.<eos> Tell him.<eos> Did you see this monster, Abbie?<eos> Yes, she did.
And I'm not sorry for saying it, either.<eos> He insulted me roughly 56 times a day, and that's being conservative.<eos> I mean, you guys have no idea how many times it happened.<eos> - Dork says, "Hey."<eos> - Hey!<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm a huge supporter of animal rights, and I just think it's wrong to put a monkey in clothes.<eos> Which finger smells like butt?<eos> Which finger smells like butt, huh?<eos> Trick question.<eos> They all do.
Aw, come on. I owe you.<eos> The Pacers are in preseason, the Colts are in San Francisco,<eos> Brick just read our TV manual, and it turns out we got picture-in-picture.<eos> You know, I appreciate it, but I got to go.<eos> It's really hot in here.<eos> Yep-- turns out Mike wasn't as fine as he thought with Axl being gone.<eos> - Still here, dad. - Oh.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hey, you want to watch the game?<eos> No, I do not.
You know nothing about... anything.<eos> - So, I'm gonna tell you something ...<eos> - Jackie, Kate knows that she screwed up.<eos> Yeah ... no ... you screwed up.<eos> You ...<eos> I hope you can still be a grandpa after all of Bert's... this.<eos> I think Bert's "this" will be fine.<eos> I just wanted to do something to help, you know?<eos> I just wanted to be part of the family, and Pete gave me the chance, and I just ... I blew it.<eos> Yeah, you did, like...
But deep down here, in my Jackie heart, I know that it's not easy being a new stepmom.<eos> I guess what I'm saying, Kate, is, we're kind of the same, right?<eos> Free spirits ...<eos> the souls of birds in people bodies.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Well, t-thanks, Jackie.<eos> That's really sweet.<eos> But you don't need to let me go in. It's okay.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm not... letting you do anything, 'cause he wants you.<eos> - He does?
272.429)}Loan Loss Provision the bank will have to come up with an enormous loan loss provision amounting to more than 100 billion yen.<eos> Hanzawa found out that behind the investment failure there was actually a conspiracy to cover it up in order to qualify for the loan.<eos> It was imperative that Hanzawa resolve Iseshima Hotel's problem who should appear before him but...<eos> We will now conduct the FSA inspection.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Long time no see.<eos> FSA inspections were being carried out at all the major branches of Tokyo Chuo Bank nationwide.<eos> this was unquestionably 339)}FSA Inspection First Hearing Investigation the beginning of a battle with the Financial Services Agency.<eos> Do you believe in fate?<eos> I do.
A bit calmer now.<eos> How about you?<eos> It seems we have a lot to discuss after you're discharged.<eos> We can discuss it now, or we can just talk about something else.<eos> It's entirely up to you.<eos> Joining Hankmed was a very difficult adjustment for me.<eos> But you made it so much easier with your kindness and your compassion.<eos> In retrospect, I believe that's when my feelings began.<eos> I just never found the strength to tell you.<eos> Yeah, you did.
I'll help you, Katya, I'll never let anyone hurt you again.<eos> Somebody call an ambulance.<eos> Katya, Katya.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> She's gone, Jack.<eos> NOOO! Don't take her, take me!<eos> No, Jack!<eos> That won't bring her back!<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do!
How'd you start this thing, buddy?<eos> There's no key.<eos> It's easy.<eos> You span the two contacts with something metal.<eos> - What'd you use to do it?<eos> - Screwdriver.<eos> Hey. What's up?<eos> I thought only cops had badges.<eos> Nope.<eos> We do too.
Just be yourself.<eos> Well, he should be here any minute.<eos> So... you and Avery working together.<eos> Yeah. Kinda surprised myself with that one.<eos> But, you know, we'll see how it goes.<eos> So does Scarlett know you're here?<eos> Not that, uh... You need to ask her permission or anything.<eos> I... You know what?<eos> Forget I asked.<eos> She doesn't.
- Lots.<eos> He says some of his voices are consistent, some he hears only rarely or only once.<eos> Sometimes he hears dozens at a time.<eos> Which one told him about the murder?<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> He's plagued by auditory hallucinations.<eos> I mean, it's a wonder that he's even been able to cope.<eos> Clara, this guy almost certainly had something to do with it.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Yes, we do.
It's probably better if it's far.<eos> Well, maybe it's far enough.<eos> I'm headed out that way.<eos> C'mon.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You got something?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I'm bringing in a specialist to consult.<eos> - I don't want to put any pressure on you.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Who's that?<eos> That is Gabe.<eos> He's gonna kill you.<eos> You're enjoying this, aren't you? A little.<eos> But lucky for you,<eos> I'm in a "father-daughter reunion" kind of a mood.<eos> Don't ask me why.<eos> On the table, please.<eos> How do you know this is going to work?<eos> I don't.
Lanie just texted.<eos> There's no evidence of any drugs or sedatives.<eos> I'm sorry. It looks like we're dead in the water.<eos> No.<eos> Far from it. Guess what we found in Angelo's apartment.<eos> Angelo's birthday present to Emma.<eos> - I missed it before because it was wrapped.<eos> - You wanna guess what's inside?<eos> - I was... I was gonna have them guess.<eos> - Oh, I didn't...
Uh, a last minute thing came up.<eos> His secretary called to say he had a golf trip to Pebble Beach.<eos> You're alone, huh?<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> Did you know that today is Walt's birthday?<eos> Everyone is celebrating, without me.<eos> You noticed I'm not there either.<eos> Bet you regret kissing me.<eos> You kissed me.<eos> And yes, I do.
Nah, it's not our car.<eos> It's my car.<eos> Don't you forget that.<eos> Okay, your car.<eos> But you said this was something for us to work on together.<eos> Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking, gettin' this thing in the first place.<eos> These things are a pain in the ass.<eos> And I don't have the time to deal with something this unreliable.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I do.
It's the parents who shape the child.<eos> And your son is growing up in a wonderful home.<eos> - Die, scum!<eos> - No, no, no! Louder, like you did at the drive-through.<eos> Mom, Jay and I saw Death Wish.<eos> Amazing. Manny got in a fight at The Sound of Music, got kicked out.<eos> I've never been so proud.<eos> Well, I guess every household could use a little fine-tuning, huh?<eos> - Let me give you my card with my cell number on it.<eos> - Please. And what did I do with my wallet?
Rowan knows where I am.<eos> B613 always knows where I am.<eos> It doesn't matter where I go.<eos> I'm not the one who wants me to leave.<eos> Jake.<eos> You're safer if I'm here.<eos> You and I both know I'm already being defended.<eos> By the President?<eos> Does he know your father's command?<eos> Does he?
Over here.<eos> Good, Taylor.<eos> That's it!<eos> Yeah, keep going!<eos> Poor guy.<eos> It's a little chilly out.<eos> Are you cold, buddy?<eos> Oh, no, I'm good.<eos> I got the jacket.<eos> Yeah, you do.
60 people are dead because of you.<eos> 60 people are dead because you don't return my calls, Harold.<eos> If you want to save lives and catch the bad guys, pay attention.<eos> They're not going to make your deal.<eos> That's unfortunate.<eos> The next name on my list is an absolute snake.<eos> The train.<eos> How did you know?<eos> I know lots of things.<eos> But the train I didn't.
You injured my doorman...<eos> Forced your way into my club.<eos> Is there a reason why I should not kill you right now?<eos> You kill me, you kill Seth Nelson.<eos> You're...<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> We agreed the money was to be dropped off at a specified location.<eos> Plans change.<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
Let's go.<eos> Didn't know he was gonna be here.<eos> Mama, maybe we should go into the studio...<eos> Don't bother. I'm leaving.<eos> Just don't send him to do your dirty work.<eos> Nobody sent me to do anything.<eos> I was just trying to help.<eos> Don't take it out on him.<eos> Yeah, well, I think he knows better now.<eos> Too bad you don't.
Sit... down.<eos> I don't want to have to hurt you, Lowen.<eos> I need to ask you some questions.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> Is Tara divorcing me?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Yes.<eos> And taking my sons?<eos> The pregnancy...<eos> I didn't...
Yeah, no, she came home for breakfast.<eos> You know when she does that quiet angry thing - and you wish she'd just yell? - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah, she did that.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Anyway.<eos> - Get out.<eos> Yeah, the cuff doesn't come off till your uncle wants it to come off.<eos> The material is a titanium blend, essentially unbreakable, impervious to powers.<eos> If we knew the alloy, we could circumvent it.<eos> We don't.
And I...<eos> Ugh.<eos> I-I...<eos> It's no excuse.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You should be.<eos> But in a way, I'm almost glad I did, because we... we clearly have a lot to talk about.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, I guess...<eos> We do.
The what?<eos> The Paris party.<eos> Everyone who's invited puts in 50 bucks, and at the end of the night, someone's name is pulled from the hat, and that person gets to go on a trip to Paris with a friend, all paid for.<eos> Oh. Awesome.<eos> I've always wanted to go to Paris.<eos> How did I not know about this?<eos> Every fancy artist and media type will be there.<eos> Well, no wonder no one appreciates me.<eos> I don't even have my finger on the social pulse.<eos> Lucky for you, I do.
Says the guy with a photographic memory.<eos> Faith, Pendleton.<eos> We'll make it work.<eos> All right, see you out there.<eos> Boobs.<eos> This is so exciting.<eos> Oh, we're not going in that way.<eos> We're going in this way.<eos> I thought you knew people.<eos> I do.
Oh, I'm just grateful you're here.<eos> I didn't know who else to call.<eos> You must hate that I always lean on you.<eos> I don't hate that.<eos> So where are her parents?<eos> Did you call them?<eos> Maggie doesn't want them to know she's here.<eos> What could possibly be going on that she doesn't want her parents to know?<eos> I shouldn't say anything.<eos> Maggie doesn't...
You were just so patronizing.<eos> You were making all these sad clucking noises and... and acting like you were better than me.<eos> When clearly you think you're better than me... and more qualified.<eos> I guess I just didn't care about Harvard as much as you do.<eos> I'm not even sure it's my first choice, so I thought I'd give it to you.<eos> See... even saying it that way...<eos> If you weren't even sure it was your first choice, then why didn't you just tell me that...<eos> That you decided not to apply early...<eos> Instead of making me feel like you gave me Harvard?<eos> Because I did.
Well, I'll check it out.<eos> She's gonna be okay, Arastoo, okay?<eos> Just maybe not in the next few days.<eos> Or... weeks.<eos> Or...<eos> I get it.<eos> Leave?<eos> You can't leave.<eos> You think about leaving every day.<eos> No, I don't.
Diane!<eos> Hi!<eos> - Do you want to see my room?<eos> - I do!<eos> But first I want to say hello to your mother and brother.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you want a butterscotch?<eos> We keep them in this bowl by the door.<eos> Oh.<eos> I do!
She's getting in your head.<eos> Take her down! Nobody baby-talks me.<eos> Bring on the shots!<eos> Whoo! Yeah! And, of course, if I win, then I'll get my office back, and I can be called Dr. L again.<eos> Whoa! Yeah, bitch, bring on the shots!<eos> Another shot, please.<eos> Another shot, please.<eos> How are you doing this? I ate an entire loaf of bread before I came here tonight.<eos> Oh, so you knew we were going to do this?<eos> Nope, I just do that every night, dog.
Well, everyone has HPV.<eos> 75% of people have it.<eos> You're engaged, Mindy! You're engaged.<eos> Everyone's making fun of my so-called loser friends.<eos> At least they know to look out for a woman like you.<eos> They know to watch out.<eos> Well, Danny, come on.<eos> Ex-squeeze me?<eos> Okay, there's a word for women like you, right?<eos> No, we don't...
- Oh, yeah.<eos> My mom packed that for me.<eos> - No, I love scrabble.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you know how to play?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I love scrabble too.<eos> Who doesn't?
We ring this bell in honor of Bonnie, in remembrance for her.<eos> I'm not sure what else to say.<eos> Say that I'm not going anywhere, say that even though they couldn't see me I've been there the whole time.<eos> She says that she's not going anywhere, that she has been here all along.<eos> Bonnie has watched you have the summer of your life.<eos> ...the summer of your life...<eos> And I saw you happy, and I know you think now that you can't have a normal life...<eos> That you have to be here for everyone, but you don't.<eos> Everyone will find their way, so you are gonna repack your things, you're gonna go back to college, and you're gonna live it up.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong, Matt.
You told him that?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you want to know why?<eos> Why, you ask?<eos> You going to ask me why?<eos> Well, then ask... oh, I know!<eos> To teach this emotionally repressed and deeply passive young man to stand up for himself.<eos> And obviously, my methods are working.<eos> You lying, stupid jerk.<eos> Well done.
I don't know.<eos> I didn't want to be a cliche.<eos> Yet another professional Indian skee ball player?<eos> [Laughs] Right.<eos> [Gunshot effects]<eos> Now that's what I call shooting.<eos> Is this a hunting game?<eos> Yeah, it's fun.<eos> You want to play?<eos> Indeed, I do.
You weren't alone.<eos> Courtney makes me feel... needed.<eos> I'm sorry I can't help you.<eos> I feel awful.<eos> What do you want, Anika?<eos> What do you mean? What is the most important thing in all of this for you?<eos> I want Courtney to get better and... to be safe.<eos> How can Courtney be safe if you won't tell us what you saw?<eos> - I told you... - Detective Black is convinced that you remembered seeing the man who shot Courtney.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Being Darcy's sister doesn't change that.<eos> We don't know a thing about this girl.<eos> For all we know, she's working for Darcy.<eos> No, you would have picked up on it.<eos> Okay, Piper is just a scared runaway.<eos> What do you recommend?<eos> You've lost your mind.<eos> They deserve a chance to be reunited.<eos> Okay? Just at least think it through.<eos> I just did.
You think he's okay?<eos> He's fine.<eos> You know this how?<eos> Because he's our son and he's a survivor, and now he has something to survive for.<eos> He knows we're coming and we're not gonna let him down.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> I'm just...<eos> I know how easy it is to give in to the darkness.<eos> I didn't want you to...<eos> She didn't.
The letters to your girlfriend Lisbon.<eos> You know, it was pretty smart to send them to your carny friends and have them sneak them over to her.<eos> Just not quite smart enough.<eos> So I finally managed to hack through the firewall, and it turns out the cyber mastermind stealing credit card numbers is an 11-year-old from Minneapolis.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah. He was selling them to his friends so they could buy limited-edition sneakers.<eos> Did he get arrested?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We turned the information over to the Minneapolis P.D.<eos> Actually, they did.
- Is everything synchronized?<eos> - Yes sir.<eos> All is in order.<eos> It better be.<eos> - Mr. Edison you have my assurance...<eos> - I don't give a hang about your assurances.<eos> My assurance that I have utilized none of your patented technology.<eos> Let me be satisfied of that.<eos> Even if I had, your patents don't apply beyond the borders of the United States.<eos> Some of them do.
Barely get a chance to see Javier.<eos> He can take care of himself.<eos> Right, Javi?<eos> I know the prosecutor.<eos> She wants to put you up with a bunch of rival gang members.<eos> You'd be dead within weeks.<eos> He's getting nowhere.<eos> You don't want your mother to die, do you, Javier?<eos> If you know something...<eos> He doesn't.
Peter, I believe in you.<eos> You can do this.<eos> - Here's someone I hate.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - I hate Becca's fiancé.<eos> - Great, that's perfect.<eos> - He's a kindergarten teacher.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Who teaches kindergarten?<eos> And he does it in the inner city, no less.
No, no.<eos> (Panting)<eos> (Spits) Are you okay?<eos> (Panting)<eos> The cost of the game.<eos> He didn't even leave me a shilling for a pint.<eos> How rude.<eos> He took all of our money.<eos> Yes, but I'll figure something out.<eos> I always do...
How is she?<eos> I fear she's getting worse, Henry.<eos> But if I save magic...<eos> She'll live?<eos> Yes.<eos> But more than that, Henry.<eos> If you save magic, you'll save us all.<eos> But to do it, you have to truly believe.<eos> (Coughing)<eos> I do.
I'm looking for my son.<eos> - Wendy?<eos> - Do I know you?<eos> It's Baelfire.<eos> (Emma)<eos> - You two know each other?<eos> (Gasps)<eos> - Bae!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we do.
And it's nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> Neither one of us was cut out to be a father, m'boy.<eos> I regretted leaving my son the moment I let him go.<eos> I spent my life trying to find him, to get him back.<eos> And what did you do?<eos> You forgot about me.<eos> I never forgot about you!<eos> Why do you think I call myself "Peter Pan"?<eos> Don't think for a moment I believe it's because you care for me.<eos> But I do.
I was never a fan of the Three Stooges.<eos> I found them sweaty and clumsy and not very entertaining.<eos> To be clear, the Three Stooges is what I called Wilfrid's genitals.<eos> FRANK: Unless you are one, old people are funny.<eos> Yeah. I guess it's funny.<eos> It's a little simple.<eos> Simple...?<eos> Yeah. I mean, when you have as many as 27 followers, they want you to challenge them artistically and intellectually.<eos> - Oh, I thought you had 28.<eos> - I did.
You'll live long.<eos> I don't want to live a long life as an invalid.<eos> Not that kind of long life.<eos> I see people like that, I wish they'd just go.<eos> Like, " No need to hang on.<eos> Go ahead and die."<eos> "Just go!"<eos> No struggle, you'll just croak one day.<eos> Miya-san has so much energy.<eos> He really does.
I hoped I would get to go back to Scotland one last time.<eos> Your friends from Scotland will be there.<eos> Girls you've known your whole life.<eos> You're safer in French Court.<eos> You're nearly a woman, and Francis is nearly a man.<eos> It's time.<eos> You will wed young Francis, someday soon, for your faith, for your people, for Scotland.<eos> He will love you.<eos> I'm not sure that matters.<eos> It does to you.
Impressive.<eos> I suppose if there was ever an uprising that sent my line into hiding, I could always get by as a blacksmith.<eos> But I'd save you.<eos> And we could go to Scotland and rule there.<eos> That's a... that's a very kind offer.<eos> I hope I never have to take you up on it.<eos> Natalia.<eos> Did anyone see you come in here?<eos> No.<eos> They never do.
Charlie was paying me for my time.<eos> Couple hundred bucks here and there.<eos> And then he told me that he was gonna give 30% to that lady crook.<eos> Lena Silver.<eos> I went with him to all of his bucket crap.<eos> I took the videos of his lectures, cut them together.<eos> I deserved a percentage of the profits, too.<eos> But Charlie said no.<eos> Maybe he had a good reason.<eos> He did.
Look, I'm sorry to drag you into this.<eos> You know, the last thing I want to be in your life is some pain in the ass.<eos> It's too late.<eos> Vincent, it's not that I don't want you in my life, it's just that I don't know how to keep you in it because I don't even know what my life is anymore.<eos> I don't even know who my real father is now.<eos> It's like... everything's up in the air.<eos> And you don't need some guy who can't tell you the truth or remember anything.<eos> Doesn't mean I like it, but I get it.<eos> Do you want to remember me?<eos> I do, more than anything.
Miles?<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> It would help if you called me "Stu Redman."<eos> Bastard.<eos> "Redman."<eos> You tried to kill me.<eos> I could have you executed on the spot.<eos> War is hell.<eos> But you got bigger problems right now.<eos> We both do.
Are you really sure that Dahlia did those things?<eos> Yeah, we're, uh... we're certain.<eos> I mean, she left behind a trail of victims, so, yeah.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm not going to pretend I'm sad he's dead.<eos> My brother was a monster.<eos> That's why you ran when you saw him at the wedding, huh?<eos> You don't know the things he's capable of.<eos> Oh, we do.
I never should've left Gwen alone.<eos> It's not your fault, Emily.<eos> So-so you were in the Preservation Room when Witten attacked your friend, is-is that right?<eos> Yeah. That's right.<eos> Okay. Can you call the doctor?<eos> I really feel awful.<eos> Of course.<eos> What was that about exactly?<eos> Emily just told you that Witten locked her in the Preservation Room.<eos> Yeah, she did.
It came back positive-- for trace amounts of Vertigo.<eos> I never used Vertigo before in my life.<eos> You were exposed to it somehow.<eos> Vertigo's in play again?<eos> When the Count recovered from his OD on Vertigo, he was sent to Iron Heights.<eos> That got hit in the quake.<eos> He got out the same way the Doll Maker did?<eos> And just like with the Doll Maker, prison officials worked overtime to keep the lid on the escape.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> No, you don't.
Not with your...secret garden.<eos> Okay, that's it!<eos> You need to stay out of my life...<eos> And stay out of my secret garden!<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hi.<eos> So, I heard my mother told you not to come... to the par-tay.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, she did.
The whole environment is cooperating. But you can learn nothing.<eos> You must give his life to the room alone.<eos> Z'n vitale energie.<eos> That's all.<eos> In this story, I do not deserve admiration ... but what happened to me.<eos> Admirable is the decision taken by my parents.<eos> They had a belief which they have remained faithful.<eos> A child who does not go to school and grow up with greater freedom ... will have no rules, so they think.<eos> Often people think that I must have nothing of discipline.<eos> "How do you, as a free child about discipline?"
- Aw... Hey, why don't we all go on a double date?<eos> What are you guys doing tonight?<eos> Yeah. - Tonight?<eos> - Yeah. - Today's tonight?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Tonight... meaning changes every day, doesn't it?<eos> Come on, Schmidt. I'm sure he's got other plans. You've got other plans, right?<eos> Plans?<eos> Not me.<eos> I don't even...
It means a lot.<eos> I finally feel like I can breathe again.<eos> Good.<eos> What happ... What happened to him?<eos> Well, he got smoked by a bus while he was having a bake sale for cancer kids.<eos> For, for canc... for cancer kids?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - But he-he's, he's a great person.<eos> Bad things happen to good people all the time.<eos> Of course they do.
Shut your face!<eos> You should maybe give this guy, Artie, a call and see...<eos> No, that's too real.<eos> That's just way too real.<eos> Then why do you have his number in your phone?<eos> I just like looking at it.<eos> - But it has, like... a lot of fours in it.<eos> - No.<eos> You know, you know what I mean?<eos> No, I don't.
Look who I called.<eos> Hey, Jess.<eos> Shut your face.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, looks like you could use a new drink.<eos> Barkeep, can I please get a Shirley Temple with a finger of coconut rum and a lemon squeeze?<eos> I call it a Temple Grandin because it makes friendly and compassionate.<eos> I have a boyfriend.<eos> No, she...<eos> No, she doesn't.
I think it is.<eos> Hold the door.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hold the door please.<eos> Hi, cli...<eos> Hi, Mindy.<eos> Morgan.<eos> Mindy, you look like you've been working hard.<eos> Got any big plans tonight?<eos> I do, in fact.
If I had a boyfriend or a husband, he would have come and picked me up tonight and I wouldn't be in this situation.<eos> I'm never gonna find anyone.<eos> I just hope my parents don't mind that our blood line is gonna die with me.<eos> Family's so important to us.<eos> What about your brother, Rishi?<eos> Yes, yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Forgot about him.<eos> I forgot about him.<eos> Yeah, you did.
It was a blood diamond and we had to give it back to Africa.<eos> We gave it back.<eos> What are you gonna do, right?<eos> (Both) So...<eos> Let's, ah... we're gonna head up... upstairs.<eos> Okay, we'll see you later.<eos> Oh.<eos> Got to get started on baby number two, know what I mean?<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> I do...
So Chloe, how much do you know about your fiancée?<eos> (Cliff) Oh, my goodness, Dr. Lahiri.<eos> Wow.<eos> [Phone buzzing]<eos> (Both) Yes!<eos> [Phone buzzing]<eos> (Both) No!<eos> So Danny probably told you I was crazy, right?<eos> I would never say that.<eos> Yes, he did.
There are no credible studies that support precognition,<eos> - telepathy, or extrasensory perception.<eos> - Okay, so science says "no".<eos> But this woman knew impossible things.<eos> And why did she close her eyes?<eos> That's either random or totally important.<eos> Was she listening... or was she reading minds?<eos> I'm gonna go play with my phone now.<eos> Why does H.Q. want us to investigate these heists?<eos> They don't.
Okay, the clue must be in the bag.<eos> The clue must be in the bag.<eos> What's... it's just a bunch of pants.<eos> It's just a bunch of pants.<eos> You know, I'm surprised you want to copy my answers since I'm not even smart enough to be on your team.<eos> Well, why would you want to be on someone's team who you like to call a...<eos> I can't even say it in front of Sheldon.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You know exactly what I'm talking about.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Gonna peek down that ankle, tell you that.<eos> Meantime, get yourself over to UNIA.<eos> Boss man.<eos> What's shaking?<eos> Ain't seen you at service this morning.<eos> I ain't no church man. You know that.<eos> People jawing about that deacon.<eos> Eyeing me all hincty.<eos> Nobody know nothing.<eos> Somebody do.
With enough resources, we can tie it up for years.<eos> - And where is Tommy during all that?<eos> - With you.<eos> With them, a benevolent institution.<eos> Those are all possibilities.<eos> The Trenton Home for Friendless Children?<eos> I couldn't say what particular institution--<eos> Do you know what it's like there?<eos> - There's no point--<eos> - Because I do.
Yeah, but isn't it gonna be awkward hanging out with a bunch of women your mom's age?<eos> Wow, she's holding up great!<eos> - Sister!<eos> - Sister!<eos> You'll be at the rally today, right?<eos> We're holding a surprise fundraiser to help fight asthma.<eos> Although, we did tell all the people who have asthma, because surprise can actually bring on a pretty bad attack.<eos> Can my boyfriend come?<eos> Only if he has asthma.<eos> Sadly, he doesn't.
- No.<eos> Don't take it for granted.<eos> Not everybody gets to go to college, no matter how much money your family sets aside<eos> not if you got a grandma with a bus pass who plays the slots.<eos> Hey. You turned out great.<eos> I know.<eos> A... and I love working at Outdoor Man with my best friend, Mr. Baxter.<eos> But you're destined for bigger things than I am.<eos> Yeah, I don't know about that.<eos> I do. Okay?
i'd like to take this home for my husband.<eos> he'll be glad you made me look so happy.<eos> i was trying to make him look serious.<eos> i still can't read him.<eos> no one can.<eos> i can.<eos> he likes it.<eos> (diaz) nice job, boyle.<eos> you nailed it. here.<eos> of course he did.
He of the cloven hoof.<eos> Well, this is all news to me, Bob. But there's nothing here in your file that says anything about you being the Prince of Darkness.<eos> Although I did kind of skip over that you listed your emergency contact as Charles Manson.<eos> He's always home.<eos> Seemed like a natural.<eos> Okay, I got to go.<eos> I can't sit here anymore.<eos> Lacey, if Bob's making you uncomfortable...<eos> No, I just got waxed and my shorts are sticking.<eos> I did that.
Good-bye, Satan.<eos> Wait, this is amazing.<eos> I didn't sell my soul, which means Lacey really loves me.<eos> Hey, sorry I'm late.<eos> I just slept for 18 hours.<eos> I bet my friend that I could do ecstasy five days in a row and it wouldn't affect my life and I totally won the bet.<eos> Ecstasy?<eos> You said you were in love with me.<eos> You said my ass was adorable.<eos> Wow, I did?
She made you hard.<eos> You went soft!<eos> You're in love with that sorry witch.<eos> Bullshit. Bullshit is right.<eos> You're supposed to be ridding me of my enemies.<eos> Instead, they're mouthier than ever!<eos> Showing up on my doorstep, disrespecting me, digging up my enemies.<eos> When I plant a fat-assed cracker bitch,<eos> I expect her to stay planted, not come back up like goddamned ragweed!<eos> And that Fiona-- doing my Bastien like that.
What in the hell does you getting a tattoo have to do with Katrina?<eos> I'm going to be an engineer.<eos> And I'm going to make sure shit like that never happens again.<eos> I don't want to walk into some big meeting with a mayor or a governor and roll up my sleeves and have a little Saints logo or a... or a Wile E. Coyote or anything that's gonna make him think<eos> that I'm anything other than his knight in shining armor.<eos> I got one life, and I'm not wasting it.<eos> I think it's a pretty cool idea, Kyle.<eos> Thank you, Jimmy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, I do, too.
You not only brought him here, you sent him packing, which means you are one hot shit witch.<eos> Power like yours does not go unnoticed.<eos> Which means you've got a bull's-eye on your back, kiddo, and our biggest enemy is locked, loaded, and looking at you.<eos> Marie Laveau.<eos> My mother.<eos> But she's on our side.<eos> Fiona Goode has been on the same side her whole life: her own.<eos> Now, I don't know if you are the next Supreme, nobody does, but if she jumps to that conclusion, right or wrong, she will slit your throat just like she did to Madison.<eos> Nobody knows who killed Madison, not even Madison.<eos> She doesn't, but I do.
But I'm not Myrtle.<eos> What do you want from me, hmm?<eos> The only thing that you can't refuse me.<eos> The truth.<eos> Did you kill Madison Montgomery?<eos> M-Madison Montgomery... is alive.<eos> That wasn't the question. No!<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> But you know who did.<eos> Yes! I do!
Just show me the damn statement.<eos> Now what?<eos> I get an arrest warrant for Quinn.<eos> You sure you got a judge you can trust with that?<eos> Quinn liked to spread that money around.<eos> We made him a lot of it.<eos> Spent the last few days vetting judges.<eos> Narrowed it down to a couple.<eos> My statement, the evidence you got, and this whole thing comes down to blind luck.<eos> Do me a favor, Officer.
You care to take a stroll?<eos> There's someplace special I'd like to show you.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.<eos> Why not, Henry?<eos> I think you're lying to me.<eos> My family... they're here, on Neverland.<eos> I know it.<eos> What makes you so sure?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> No. It doesn't.
Well, don't think of it as lying.<eos> Think of it as... providing motivation.<eos> Motivation for what?<eos> Doing what needs to be done, for all of us.<eos> And I need to control that belief.<eos> What do you need him to believe in?<eos> Me.<eos> Now back to your cage.<eos> You really believe Belle can succeed?<eos> Yes, I do.
Get out.<eos> Well, now, that.<eos> Image number six: woman giving birth.<eos> It's 9:00.<eos> Where you been?<eos> Oh, I had to take the bus home.<eos> Fell asleep and missed my stop.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Did you know that Los Angeles has a Little Sri Lanka?<eos> I did not.
I mean...<eos> What's thoughtful is everything you do.<eos> Here, you know what?<eos> Look at this.<eos> Look, here's the... the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays.<eos> And the rose you left on my windshield... just because.<eos> Here's the-the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you.<eos> All 11 pages of it.<eos> Can't believe you saved all this stuff.<eos> Of course I did.
There are people who...<eos> Never mind.<eos> It's just...<eos> For years, I did illusions. Tricks, like the rest.<eos> And then this happens.<eos> It's real.<eos> Real magic.<eos> If I believed in such things, I would say it was a miracle. That this happened for a reason.<eos> I believe you've been chosen.<eos> You do?
So, what did you think of your first time skydiving?<eos> Honestly, I'd rather not think about it anymore.<eos> I thought what you did was incredibly brave.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, I-I suppose now's as good a time as any to tell you that, um...<eos> I may have misled you earlier.<eos> You see, when I gave you back the night-night pistol,<eos> I lied ... it's still an ounce off.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You do?
I love you, too.<eos> I- yes, director, I know that this is not the first time.<eos> Yes, sir, I do value my job, very much.<eos> Look, I will be on the next train.<eos> Mm-hmm. I'll be back tonight.<eos> Ok.<eos> Thank-<eos> Well, my boss found out I don't have food poisoning.<eos> I need to get back to Central City if I still want to be employed.<eos> Which I do.
What the...<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> You were injected with a strong-acting blood coagulant.<eos> You would have stroked out, ahem, but fortunately you had a very effective blood thinner handy.<eos> Warfarin.<eos> Better known as rat poison.<eos> Kid saved your life, Oliver.<eos> This is the point in a lifesaving emergency where you thank the person that did the lifesaving.<eos> You told him who I am.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Go do it!<eos> Yah! I got it!<eos> No, you don't have it.<eos> Help him.<eos> I got it.<eos> Do it like Graham did it.<eos> Do you?<eos> You do.<eos> I got it.<eos> Yeah, you do!
I have an important morning meeting with the kids from the math club.<eos> The nerds can wait. My son...<eos> Barry Goldberg... cannot.<eos> - Are you...<eos> Beverly Goldberg?<eos> - Oh, yes, I am.<eos> Tell me, what kind of educator stomps on the dreams of his students?<eos> Look, Barry's a good kid, which is kinda why I discouraged him from taking part in the show.<eos> See, some of the more high-profile students here can be very critical, if you follow me.<eos> I really don't.
The big finish.<eos> Damn!<eos> That'll break during the show.<eos> That was the greatest thing my eyeballs have ever, ever seen!<eos> - Do you want me to go again?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - We're going again!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Turns out, not everyone had mom goggles.<eos> Do it again!
Damn!<eos> That'll break during the show.<eos> That was the greatest thing my eyeballs have ever, ever seen!<eos> - Do you want me to go again?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - We're going again!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Turns out, not everyone had mom goggles.<eos> Do it again!<eos> Do it again!
Grace, what's going on?<eos> It's my Bible study from Campus Faith.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Uh, my firm.<eos> We have to work here a few days.<eos> Yes, that's right, Your Honor.<eos> Governor-Elect Florrick's office.<eos> Oh, hi, Patricia.<eos> I didn't know we had a meeting.<eos> We don't.
Excuse me.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Something we should know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Two more ISI agents are on the loose, and they have the thumb drive.<eos> Find 'em.<eos> Okay.<eos> 24 hours ago, you would have taken that shot.<eos> I didn't have the shot.<eos> Yes, you did.
Well, it is if no one's looking for you.<eos> The Romanian government wasn't even sure he'd ever left the country.<eos> Lots of war criminals stayed behind in Romania after Ceausescu was overthrown.<eos> They got generous pensions, luxury apartments for their service to the Republic.<eos> It doesn't help that there's still strong nostalgia for the Communist era back there.<eos> That's part of why Romania basically ignored its brutal past.<eos> Until now.<eos> Romania finally wants to bring charges against their war criminals.<eos> And they want us to deliver Zevlos.<eos> Well, now, they do.
- Hey.<eos> Kyle, there's peace in the middle east.<eos> They're saying maybe it's going to lead to peace all over the world.<eos> Everyone's really happy.<eos> You should be too.<eos> I am happy, Stan.<eos> I'm thrilled.<eos> Dude, we've been friends a long time.<eos> Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?<eos> I just do, Stan.
This is the Garden of Andros.<eos> and I'm sick of kids dressing up and having talks of betrayal in it!<eos> 70-inch television.<eos> That would be good.<eos> But 80% off a computer.<eos> Maybe I'll be able to snag both.<eos> sir.<eos> 273)}– I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> – I was just... looking at all these great things I can't afford. I know why you took this part-time job.<eos> You do?
Thanks.<eos> And keep it short.<eos> He's in real trouble.<eos> He defecated in a nice old man's garden.<eos> – Who's that?<eos> – It's me.<eos> Get outta here! I know you're pissed at me. You gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the Xbox is better for all of us.<eos> You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had. You weren't playing fair. Getting your dad to work at the mall wasn't fair.<eos> I didn't even know he was working at the mall.<eos> – You didn't?
Him Big Chief Need-A-Laugh.<eos> Well, I have got to unpack.<eos> Porter, my bags!<eos> All aboard!<eos> Next stop, Steubenville!<eos> Now passing Old Stone Face.<eos> Do they make tampons for your mouth?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I think this is really gonna be great.<eos> You do, do you?
We left Alex alone when she was 10.<eos> We didn't leave her.<eos> We forgot her.<eos> And when we got home, she was fine.<eos> - Physically.<eos> - Mm.<eos> Plus, she's still friends with that sweet 911 operator.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Making sure Luke knows what to do in case of emergency.<eos> Of course he does.
Okay, and remember, no eating in the living room.<eos> Aah! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!<eos> What did you do? What did you do? !<eos> Come on!<eos> You can't possibly think -- you shook this can so you could wear the outfit that I wanted to wear?<eos> That is exactly what I think!<eos> That is insane.<eos> You saw me take it from the refrigerator<eos> - and bring it to you.<eos> - Did I?
You know, one of those little head mirrors, that doctors wear.<eos> Ben, you are a doctor.<eos> - Have you ever worn one? - No.<eos> Because they stopped using them a century ago.<eos> What are they teaching you down there?<eos> Tuck wants to be a mad scientist tonight.<eos> He should have one of those little head mirror things.<eos> Well, I have a brain in a jar.<eos> But I wanna give him a costume, not a nightmare.<eos> What did he do to you?
♪ Then show me<eos> ♪ What you came here for<eos> ♪ Why don't we steal away?<eos> ♪ Why don't we steal away<eos> ♪ Into the night?<eos> ♪ I know it ain't right.<eos> He liked it!<eos> Uh, not so fast.<eos> I think the periods imply detached sarcasm.<eos> Of course they do!
A good and faithful man.<eos> A family man.<eos> How could she choose him over me?<eos> How could she choose that life when I offered her such passion?<eos> I'm coming, I'm coming!<eos> More people come to this door in the dead of night than during business hours!<eos> What kind of a woman would torment such a dear soul?<eos> What kind of a fool would refuse an offer of marriage from the man she loves?<eos> I didn't know you had refused.<eos> I didn't.
It was an ugly chair.<eos> You're better off without it.<eos> So I guess you were right all along.<eos> It was easier for me to focus on my physical pain than the breakup.<eos> I need to move on.<eos> So you admit it.<eos> I do know what I'm doing.<eos> To be honest with you, I never know exactly what you're doing, Katherine.<eos> Well, Stefan, sometimes...<eos> I don't either.
Frank.<eos> Welcome to One Police Plaza.<eos> Thank you for seeing me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> So, congratulations.<eos> Look, I won't insult you by saying I know what you probably think of me.<eos> I think you just did.<eos> That was an olive branch.<eos> Well, I've never met you, so I have no opinion of you.<eos> Oh, but you do of my position.
You don't see someone getting stabbed every day.<eos> I'll never forget it.<eos> Why don't you tell us what happened.<eos> I was inside the Laundromat across the street.<eos> Where exactly?<eos> Just inside the front window.<eos> And she was screaming "please, please," begging for her life, and he wouldn't stop.<eos> Shania... are you telling us that you actually saw<eos> DeShawn Williams stab Ella Martin?<eos> Yes, I did.
And I wish you would've told me you invited the press, you know?<eos> I would have changed my robe.<eos> You hear from Romano?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He reached out for me.<eos> Wanted to know if I needed any help.<eos> Offered to pay my lawyer bill.<eos> How do you like that?<eos> Wise guys get a lot of perks.<eos> Yeah, they do.
We have too many beefs all over town.<eos> It's jamming us up.<eos> We made a lot of enemies over the years.<eos> We got to do something about this, guys, okay?<eos> So I say we use Thanksgiving as an opportunity to squash some of those beefs.<eos> All right, guys, this is really coming together.<eos> It's looking good.<eos> You know... you know, this was the original meaning of Thanksgiving anyway.<eos> The Pilgrims and Indians had beef.<eos> So what did they do?
That's our thing.<eos> I'm Caroline, and this is Max.<eos> That's it.<eos> We don't have a thing.<eos> - So what drew you here today?<eos> - Oh, well, we're trend-chasers.<eos> When something new hits, we are on it<eos> - ... like sea salt on dark chocolate.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> We did pinkberry, dippin' dots, kale, quinoa, Kombucha...
You guys don't flinch or panic in captivity.<eos> Two ... a Waterfield 44?<eos> On a lit Professor's salary?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> And lastly, when I tell someone I've had some one-on-one time with an alien, they tend to be a little curious.<eos> Well, you're certainly more observant than most, Agent Coulson.<eos> So, you're the Asgardian warrior who stayed.<eos> Please don't tell anyone.<eos> I had no clue.<eos> Did you?
Demons.<eos> I don't know what it is.<eos> Do you believe in god?<eos> Honestly?<eos> - Not really.<eos> - Well, I do.<eos> And I know that he's punishing me, and I deserve it.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No one does.
I mean, if all you have is a first name, I don't even know where I'd begin.<eos> Anyway, this isn't the kind of thing that Sherlock and I do.<eos> Yeah, but you're great at this, right?<eos> You're great at it, and, Joan, I swear, I would never, ever ask you to help me with something so mortifying if I didn't think that this guy might really be the one.<eos> What you are describing is not a case, it is a wild goose chase, only at the end of a proper goose chase you get to eat a delicious goose-- in this instance, ur friend gets to find out that some sweaty Lothario<eos> Do you want to help me or not?<eos> You are a consulting detective, you are my partner.<eos> The work you are describing falls somewhere between photographing philandering spouses and finding a lost cat.<eos> I urge you to have some professional pride.<eos> I do.
Well, thank you, Sally.<eos> I'd appreciate that.<eos> (Mellie giggles) I've only told you about a hundred times,<eos> Mel, those tar heels of yours are never gonna make it to the sugar bowl until their boosters step up...<eos> Oh, stop. (Chuckles)<eos> Shall we eat?<eos> That sounds lovely.<eos> Does anybody mind if I say a few words first?<eos> Daniel Douglas, I don't think I've heard grace come out of your mouth in years.<eos> Sally does the honors at our home.
I don't play games, but clearly, you do.<eos> Uh, the second Voulez backdrop should go here.<eos> And I want lights here, here, and over the bar.<eos> - Nothing fluorescent.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Listen, I don't know how things are done in France, but you do have an assistant to handle this stuff.<eos> - Uh, clear this wall, please.<eos> - I'll get on that.<eos> Only I know what my father likes...<eos> And more importantly, what he does not.
Just you and me?<eos> And some beer and pizza and creepy guy's voice.<eos> Can we start drinking now?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> This is gonna be the best Thanksgiving ever.<eos> A boat, really?<eos> You pay property taxes on that?<eos> It was a gift.<eos> What-what did you say you do for a living again?<eos> Oh, I-I didn't.
Why didn't you call me?<eos> Didn't your friend tell you? I heard.<eos> - If you heard, then you should have called!<eos> Are you going to Korea right now?<eos> What did you want to tell me?<eos> Here. Give me your phone number.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> "Thank you." I said my thanks. "Bye".<eos> I also said my farewells.<eos> I did everything.
I made the black night, white. (metaphorically saying that she was up all night thinking about him)<eos> You were snoring.<eos> Snore...?<eos> Oppa, the room is dry!<eos> Tan, is his heart ready to come home?<eos> It's not like he left because he wanted to.<eos> Even if he's not, I'll make him.<eos> If it's three years, I've been cautious of Won enough.<eos> Do you even miss Tan?<eos> Of course, I do.
Congratulations.<eos> Strange isn't it? My heart still races when I see you.<eos> I hope you feel the same after you get married.<eos> Stay well.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Yes, Secretary Yoon. Did Won return to Korea?<eos> - He should be on the plane right now.<eos> - Oh I see.<eos> I heard that you've met my son.<eos> I did?
I can pick you up at noon.<eos> - Oh, hi!<eos> Joan, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hi. I'm Andy.<eos> I'm her Manny -- male nanny.<eos> Hi, I'm Gloria.<eos> This might just sound a little crazy, but I don't think Joan likes me.<eos> Oh, that's not crazy.<eos> She doesn't.
Ted, I need you to do this no questions asked.<eos> And as we both know, you owe me a "No Questions Asked."<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey. Listen, I need you to do something for me no questions asked, okay?<eos> What is it?<eos> Meet me at the corner of 53rd and 8th.<eos> Bring your drill.<eos> Marshall.<eos> What the hell?<eos> How did you...
We need to demonstrate how it violated<eos> - the warranty.<eos> - And no one's ever tried this before?<eos> No one's ever had Judge Davies.<eos> Look, he wants to rule for us.<eos> We need to give him something.<eos> Okay, warranty violation.<eos> Only problem?<eos> Lockhart/Gardner has the manufacturer's warranty documents.<eos> Of course they do.
You're thinking I'm making a huge mistake.<eos> What if you are?<eos> This isn't something you can just go back and undo.<eos> Why don't you wait a year, okay?<eos> Move into the dorms.<eos> I'm sure Pi can take care of himself.<eos> And if after a year you still want to move in together, I won't say a word.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> I don't know how this is gonna turn out, dad.<eos> None of us do.
It's the truth.<eos> Yes, it's the truth.<eos> Yes, it's the truth.<eos> Aunt Deb who raised Mary all by herself.<eos> That must have been trying.<eos> You don't know the half of it.<eos> She walked away from a record deal when that kid got thrown in her lap, you know that?<eos> She was a singer?<eos> You didn't know that?<eos> I did not.
He usually does Thanksgiving in DC, but two nights ago he decided he wanted to come here.<eos> Doesn't leave us much prep time, but... we'll be ready.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> We need to talk to you about one of your agents, Kyle Russo.<eos> Yeah, what about him?<eos> He was murdered yesterday.<eos> Why?<eos> We found his remains in a barrel just offshore this morning.<eos> - You got any suspects?<eos> - No, sir, we don't.
Eh. It's worth a shot.<eos> There, sent.<eos> All right, now you can show me the swing set.<eos> - Ooh. - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - I got it.<eos> I've got it.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
But how well do you know Aiden?<eos> I thought this was about my sister.<eos> Where did you meet him?<eos> We trained together.<eos> We're a lot alike.<eos> He lost his family, too.<eos> So I heard.<eos> What do you want, Jack?<eos> I wanna know that you know what you're doing.<eos> Of course I do.
You said that one first.<eos> I skipped it?<eos> I skipped it.<eos> Of course.<eos> Yes. So I did.<eos> [ Inhales deeply ] According to this...<eos> [ Telephone ringing in distance ] Lord. This is bad.<eos> "Until you rid yourself of lice, nits, and bugs," "the infected persons are not allowed back on school property."<eos> Well, that includes you.<eos> Oh, no, I don't...
My brother.<eos> You have to do what they say.<eos> They gave me a family.<eos> A man, a woman... a little girl.<eos> Oh, they must really like you.<eos> That is so fucked up, man.<eos> How do I get out?<eos> Like it's that simple.<eos> Actually, it is that simple.<eos> Or you don't...
I'm sorry, I got carried away...<eos> Nae, don't apologise for what you're good at.<eos> I wanted a son.<eos> Someone who would take on my business and make it flourish for his own generation.<eos> If I'd had the son I'd wished for, he'd have been just like you, Denise.<eos> Now, you put together a formal proposition and I'll consider it.<eos> It's a fine job you're doing, Edmund.<eos> It has to be said.<eos> Yes, so fine you know what's coming, don't you, Myrtle?<eos> I do.
But because his identity is not known, it must be in an unmarked grave.<eos> That's a pauper's burial.<eos> That man had money!<eos> An unmarked grave in an unknown land...<eos> I would not wish so solitary an end on anyone.<eos> Mademoiselle Clemence! If he's recently come from France, she may have encountered him on her journey.<eos> she may even have met him.<eos> Though perhaps it's not proper to show a woman a... deceased person.<eos> Oh, I feel sure Mademoiselle Clemence would be equal to the task.<eos> Don't you, Moray?
Previously on "The Mentalist"...<eos> Van Pelt found some coded files in Bertram's office.<eos> It looks like a list.<eos> Patrick.<eos> Kim.<eos> Thank you for this.<eos> I needed the company.<eos> Who doesn't?
I don't care about that.<eos> You ran away again, Jane.<eos> Not from the F.B.I. you ran away from me.<eos> Yeah, but I ran back.<eos> How was I supposed to know?<eos> I thought you were gone again forever.<eos> Okay, you're right.<eos> I-I'm sorry, Lisbon. I...<eos> I didn't think about you.<eos> Well, you rarely do.
I'll leave the accusations to the investigators.<eos> But I think it's obvious who had the motive.<eos> And whoever broke in left the silver and only took the files that could shine a light on our strategy and infrastructure for the Marcus campaign.<eos> - So you are accusing the Reston campaign?<eos> - No comment.<eos> - On it. - (Cell phone rings)<eos> What? !<eos> Liv?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
The tidal wave of new immigrants...<eos> They're not as likely to cozy up to Richie Rich and snow white here.<eos> - No offense.<eos> - None taken.<eos> Well, you better learn Spanish.<eos> - Rápido.<eos> - Please don't.<eos> Voters can always spot a phony.<eos> You can't be who you're not. How do you suggest we connect with them?<eos> You don't.
I cannot wait until you meet your maker.<eos> I cannot wait until you are charged for your lies!<eos> I'm done.<eos> What?<eos> What the hell do you mean, you're done?<eos> I got the one thing that you can't buy, Sally.<eos> A very essential possession if you're ever gonna be<eos> President of the United States...<eos> A set of balls. I got 'em.<eos> You don't.
Maybe you wanted to change our arrangement.<eos> Maybe you thought you could turn yourself in and, uh, find some new friends to protect you.<eos> - Maybe you plan to expose us.<eos> - No.<eos> What have you told, Ray?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Then what the hell are you doing here?<eos> My reasons have n-nothing to do with you.<eos> Well, I hope so.<eos> I really do.
He was there.<eos> Lab tests confirm the blood was Reddington's.<eos> Which means?<eos> As far as we can tell, he killed his captor and escaped.<eos> - Then why aren't you out hunting him down?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> I thought we were in the "cover our asses" business, in containment mode.<eos> That ship has sailed, Harold.<eos> Someone is surveilling us, and we don't know who.<eos> - Reddington does.
Step away from him!<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I think you're probably well aware of that by now.<eos> I know what you think you have in that needle.<eos> Yes, my son's future.<eos> Your cure is experimental.<eos> It could just as easily kill him.<eos> If I do nothing, he dies anyway.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Come back to reality, Cinderella, you're not the first.<eos> Classy...<eos> Lebrac, contributing is not about lending a hand in order to get what you want.<eos> No, it's about leaving your egotism aside and being useful to the community.<eos> Tell me, Emerson, what are you working on?<eos> A DVD player.<eos> Great, we'll watch DVDs.<eos> What movies do we have?<eos> - We don't have any.<eos> - Right. We don't.
Congratulations.<eos> That's the first step in becoming a real writer.<eos> I haven't talked to my family in four books.<eos> Oh, God, that's so sad. Mm.<eos> No, it's much better to be loved by millions of readers than six people who happened to fall out of the same vagina.<eos> Big family.<eos> Big vagina.<eos> Yeah, I just, you know, the thing is I... I kind of love my family.<eos> I thought you wanted to be a writer?<eos> Oh, I do.
He passed out as soon as his heart went into Pan.<eos> Is he breathing?<eos> Just hang in there, buddy.<eos> What the hell'd you do to him?<eos> Oh, I didn't do anything, Emma.<eos> It was Henry.<eos> He offered me his heart of his own free will.<eos> I'm gonna take it back from you.<eos> I don't think you have it in you.<eos> Rumplestiltskin didn't.
And his lungs are healthy, clearly.<eos> Well, what about a blood test?<eos> Or a chest X-ray?<eos> Is he a smoker?<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Look, it's obvious what the problem is.<eos> He's a crying baby.<eos> I paid for this?<eos> Actually, your insurance did.
He's never missed a Monday morning debriefing before.<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> He had a...<eos> Family emergency.<eos> His dad... came down with a surprise illness.<eos> That is surprising, especially since his dad has been dead for nine years.<eos> Yeah., it's been a real roller coaster for the family.<eos> Mr. Wen, a very important man once said that there are two reasons a man should risk his career, neither of which is covering for a best friend who is missing work to be with a girl he just met.<eos> - Who said that?<eos> - I did.
Are you trying to take me on a date?<eos> What?<eos> Me? Pfft.<eos> Mr. Moyer, your table is ready.<eos> How does she know my name?<eos> We should follow her.<eos> Did you steal an upstairs chair, man?<eos> - Does it look like it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, then yes, I did.
Yes, I'm fine.<eos> It was just...<eos> What is it? What happened when you touched it?<eos> I saw what needed to be done.<eos> Mom, a... are you gonna be okay?<eos> The important thing is, you will be.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> He has the...<eos> Curse?<eos> That I do.
Okay, look, I'll make it...<eos> I'll make it easier for you.<eos> Tomorrow, I'm gonna be hungry around lunchtime.<eos> And so I'm gonna come here, I'm gonna sit in that booth, and you're welcome to join me.<eos> And if not?<eos> I'll quit buggin' you.<eos> - Don't say it.<eos> - Say what?<eos> That I owe it to Neal to go on a date with him.<eos> You don't.
When all this is over, I promise, I'm finally going to be the mother you always wanted me to be.<eos> I love you.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why this was so easy.<eos> I'm sorry we didn't find a way to defeat Regina.<eos> That's okay.<eos> No.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I know how much you needed this, even if you didn't know why.<eos> I did.
- Yeah.<eos> So it's all gonna work out.<eos> Um, how do you feel?<eos> Do you feel...<eos> Do you feel okay about it all?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I feel great.<eos> Just gonna get the right one.<eos> 'Cause you know-- you know it's not that I didn't love it very much.<eos> I did.
Somebody ruined it!<eos> Who would do that?<eos> !<eos> Ay! Manny, how terrible.<eos> All your hard work.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> Let's go ride the rides.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Mom, I know who did it.<eos> Oh, you do?
Yeah, still in my mouth and throat.<eos> Well, what's that?<eos> Boy, it starting to get nippy, huh?<eos> You guys want to walk down to the duck pond?<eos> Um -- that sounds lovely.<eos> I'll get the gun.<eos> - Are y'all coming?<eos> - "Y'all"?<eos> - We don't say "y'all"!<eos> - Yeah, we do.
Stop!<eos> right?<eos> She'll keep it a secret.<eos> Right? Isn't that right?<eos> Humans lie without hesitation.<eos> Killing is the safest method.<eos> If you kill Nanase...<eos> I'll kill myself.<eos> Don't lay a finger on her.<eos> If you do...
That, uh, problem we had...<eos> It went away. Meeting's been canceled.<eos> - Good to hear.<eos> - So I'm ready to come home.<eos> - The sooner the better.<eos> - I'll make the call.<eos> Give me a bourbon, please.<eos> Neat.<eos> I thought you don't drink.<eos> I don't.
McAllister.<eos> - Well, I'm sorry that...<eos> - This McAllister is such a lowlife.<eos> All he does is mop up after Karsten's mess.<eos> His hands are so dirty, it's only a matter of time before he ends up behind bars, a real scumbag.<eos> Well I'm tired, Drew.<eos> I'm heading to bed.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I thought you wanted to hear about the case.<eos> I did.

Really?<eos> It's been lonely.<eos> How could you be lonely?<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't be, it's in the past.<eos> I feel like at last I might have found a home.<eos> Thank you, Hercules.<eos> Well, not thank you, but you know what I mean.<eos> Yes, I do.
I hit someone at school.<eos> I asked her not to tell you that.<eos> What?<eos> Who did you hit?<eos> Is he richer than us?<eos> You don't want to know why I hit him?<eos> Should that come first?<eos> Father must know already.<eos> He called me.<eos> Of course he does.
Because I like you.<eos> As if we live together...<eos> Good night.<eos> Morning.<eos> Do you know what time it is?<eos> I told you that I will be invading your privacy.<eos> I really meant it that I will be interfering in your affairs.<eos> I thought I told you to find something better to do.<eos> - I didn't hear that.<eos> - You did.
Stay with me.<eos> I miss you.<eos> You must be pissed.<eos> Very.<eos> Nice, that'll be fun to watch.<eos> I didn't come to Korea because of you. But you're one of the reasons.<eos> Are you still thinking about it?<eos> I have to go to class.<eos> Do you know where it is?<eos> - I do.
What do you have for dinner? You always look tired.<eos> You don't eat ramen do you?<eos> Why do you care about what I eat?<eos> You had ramen.<eos> It smells like ramen.<eos> Hey!<eos> Are you going to check my homework?<eos> You better not have wrong answers.<eos> You didn't have any questions?<eos> I didn't.
Tan says that he likes Eun Sang.<eos> He told me.<eos> Can you take care of that?<eos> What will you do for me?<eos> I may want something you can't give me this time.<eos> Take care of it first.<eos> That's a promise.<eos> What the heck?<eos> It really hurts.<eos> So why did you...
You could have called.<eos> You don't have to come to the kitchen.<eos> Kid! Water! Have you met?<eos> He's my son, Kim Tan.<eos> He's the second son of Jeguk Group.<eos> You know the maid that can't talk?<eos> She's her daughter.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - I've seen you a lot.<eos> - You did?
Listen to a song with me.<eos> I'm only sitting because I like the song.<eos> Do you like this song?<eos> You turned it on once. Yeah.<eos> Someone I loved passionately liked this song.<eos> You dated someone? When?<eos> Before coming to America?<eos> Who was it?<eos> I never said that it was a guy.<eos> So you didn't?
Why did you trust me, stupid?<eos> What if something happened?<eos> But you wouldn't.<eos> How do you know?<eos> How did you know I wouldn't hurt you?<eos> Why did you go to Young Do's hotel?<eos> Because of Joon Young.<eos> He said that he will drop the lawsuit if I went.<eos> - And you believed that?<eos> - I don't.
Bit of a bully.<eos> Alex made the mistake of trying to take Nina's cupcake, and she shoved it in his face.<eos> So Nina was a tough one?<eos> She still is.<eos> According to the doctors, she should have been dead months ago.<eos> She's a fighter.<eos> You did a wonderful job raising her, Burton.<eos> I would have liked to have been a part of it.<eos> But I'm glad she had you.<eos> She still does.
I'm gonna do it.<eos> Well, it sounds like you might soon be in the market for a look-alike dad.<eos> Dad, this just says "Business."<eos> Yeah. It's from a board game.<eos> The others say "Pleasure" and "Sex."<eos> Hey.<eos> Those are the carnitas that Edna made special for me.<eos> You don't want something eaten, don't leave it in the fridge.<eos> But... h...<eos> How did you...
Edna, why are you hiding?<eos> Eli, there is a chance I may not be legal.<eos> Wh-What kind of chance?<eos> 100%.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> You just let them take your dads away?<eos> No, no, no, we did everything we could.<eos> We said "Hey" And stuff like that.<eos> You don't even know where they took them.<eos> Sure we do, away.
With no suspect and a lot of work to do.<eos> Yeah. New bracelet?<eos> That is very observant of you.<eos> Well, it's why they pay me the big bucks.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're dying for me to say,<eos> "Thank you.<eos> That was so generous."<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yes, you do.

- Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - Oh, my God! Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - Don't fire him.<eos> - He's the menu guy.<eos> - I was just trying to make a difference.<eos> You did.<eos> At the beginning of the day, this guy had a job.<eos> Now he doesn't, so congrats on your victory.
Any new business before we adjourn?<eos> Yes, I have one-- the Pawnee Commons.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> The money for the Pawnee Commons, aka the greatest future park in the world, aka my personal dream project... Aka... Is currently in a discretionary fund.<eos> I'd like to move it to a lockbox, to ensure that it is used for that project.<eos> The thing is, Leslie, this kind of decision is-- it's not really up to you anymore.<eos> Because the voters, to use a technical political term, gave you the stanky boot.<eos> But we'll keep your money safe, baby girl.<eos> What, you think I'm gonna use it to put a new limestone shower in my office?<eos> Yeah, now I do.
(Exhales) Of course I do, Alice.<eos> Of course.<eos> Cyrus ran this way.<eos> Jafar's filthy guards... they all ran after him.<eos> Good.<eos> Then they'll have him apprehended in no time.<eos> That, my little dimwit, is precisely what we do not want.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> You tweedles never do... each one dumber than the next.
I have the bottle.<eos> Which I'll gladly relieve you of.<eos> Alice, there is no time to fight.<eos> There's only time to die.<eos> We need to leave.<eos> We have to leave! Now please!<eos> I'm telling the truth!<eos> I will never trust you.<eos> Neither will I.<eos> I do.
You and I are friends.<eos> If she doesn't like me...<eos> It's because of the kiss.<eos> That?<eos> That was nothing!<eos> So, you had a crush on me for, like, two seconds.<eos> And why would you ever tell her that you kissed me?<eos> Well, I said there was a kiss, that lips met lips.<eos> Whose lips lunged first, I cannot say.<eos> But you did.

Onto the street.<eos> Jumped?<eos> Ma'am, we're on the fifth floor here.<eos> I know.<eos> He must've used the fire escape.<eos> No, he didn't-- he jumped.<eos> Cat, I know you saw that.<eos> I was just attacked, Beth.<eos> I don't know what I saw.<eos> Neither of us do, really.

You don't know what goes on between two people in private.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> I translated it all.<eos> I know more about your relationship than you do.<eos> You don't even know him.<eos> Oh, my God, can you hear yourself?<eos> ! I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not a UN interpreter, I'm your friend.<eos> And as your friend, I'm telling you, you don't love Javier.<eos> You never did.
The Horseman of Death was there.<eos> Where?<eos> Revere told us of an enemy assailant who chased him on his ride into Lexington.<eos> He believed it was a cold-blooded mercenary for the Crown.<eos> But it was Death himself.<eos> He was after the manuscript.<eos> It must contain a secret about him.<eos> His weakness, or a flaw.<eos> Do you think that it was updated after you cut off his head?<eos> I do.
I don't see the curve!<eos> That's not an accessory, it's there to enhance the curves.<eos> Pose again.<eos> - Did you go to the PTA meeting?<eos> - I did.<eos> Do you know how much I spent there?<eos> - Do we have the next outfit ready?<eos> - Yes ma'am.<eos> Then you've seen Cha Eun Sang's mom?<eos> I did.
Well, it's just things are a little complicated right now.<eos> But...<eos> I-I really like you.<eos> I really...<eos> And... and maybe those things could change.<eos> Yeah, cool.<eos> Um... Well, you know, if they do, uh, you know where to find me.<eos> Oh, no, I-I don't.<eos> - How do...<eos> I don't. - Oh!
Oh, my God!<eos> Us girls were talking and we figured that since all of us obviously want to play the Virgin Mary in the nativity scene, we should all audition together.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Okay. I was just trying to be nice.<eos> I have a very low tolerance for nice.<eos> I may seem really cool and loving for a week or two, but then my body rejects it like a virus and I move back into my natural state of cruel, selfish insensitivity.<eos> The fact is, that between lady-man and his junk flapping around on stage, you probably passing out at some point during the audition, and the basic truth that there is no way they're going to let a Chinese girl play Mary.<eos> I think Tina's Korean.<eos> I would get that part hands down if I wanted it.<eos> But I don't.
Who's from Africa?<eos> Possible patient zero.<eos> Otherwise known as Santa Claus.<eos> Also otherwise known as Marine Captain Louis Boggs.<eos> Guy's played Santa Claus at military base parties for years.<eos> Recently returned from a special operation in the Congo.<eos> The Congo?<eos> And he's the only person who's been to every military holiday party in the last few weeks. Which means he's come in contact with nearly every kid at every party.<eos> What we don't know is how he came in contact with Grunfeld.<eos> Yes, we do.
- But we have some questions. - Okay.<eos> We suspect you've withheld some pertinent information about Matty and Bailey.<eos> Babe, I just found out earlier in the day, so now you know all that I know.<eos> So you don't need to wig out.<eos> We're not wigging, but rather wondering if Matty's reason for changing his mind had anything to do with another girl.<eos> - i.e. Jenna.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You know.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> Then, I do.
- So you don't like Matty?<eos> - I do.<eos> He's a great guy, but... Jenna, you are my only friend.<eos> And I would never, ever do anything to hurt you.<eos> So you turned him down to not hurt me?<eos> Of course.<eos> I had been in my own personal hell for so long that I had stopped believing in random acts of kindness.<eos> And there, right in front of me, was the greatest act of kindness I had seen in a long time.<eos> And thus, I was inspired to return the favor.<eos> - Do me a solid.
I crossed a line, and I betrayed you.<eos> I guess I took for granted that you wouldn't hold it against me.<eos> I take full responsibility for sucking.<eos> - Me too.<eos> - That's appreciated, but I'm talking about me and Jake.<eos> Jake, I screwed up.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> Sometimes my mouth starts moving before I can think about what's coming out of it.<eos> I don't know how to make it stop.<eos> [Chuckles] I do.
- Uh, it's just a funny video, sir.<eos> Well, show it to me.<eos> I could use a good rib tickling.<eos> I don't think you'll like it, sir.<eos> I wanna be tickled.<eos> Who wants to tickle me?<eos> Mr. Wen?<eos> Mr. McCormick?<eos> Potty Pavarotti?<eos> - How did you...
So tell me, Edwin... have you ever eaten something that's tried to kill you before?<eos> No, Will, I don't believe I have.<eos> It's sort of a Wonderland rite of passage.<eos> Here you go, father.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's not bad, actually.<eos> Not exactly a home-cooked meal, but... it will do.<eos> So... once you and Cyrus are reunited, what then?<eos> Do you have a way to get out of Wonderland?<eos> I do, actually, but one step at a time.
You're not going to remember any of this in two seconds.<eos> - Opa!<eos> What the F...?<eos> Yes!<eos> S'up s'up. You got the disease, Choga got the cure.<eos> Seriously, what the hell did you slip me?<eos> Man, you know Choga.<eos> I'm side to side, up and down the dial, yo.<eos> So tick tock, you wanna ride the dragon or what?<eos> No no, we already did this.
I think it is.<eos> Stop trying to have sex with Candice Pelling.<eos> Oregon! I am not.<eos> "Could probe deeper?"<eos> "Good"?<eos> "Excellent"?<eos> Tony, come on.<eos> Oregon, I am not looking to replace you.<eos> I loved you.<eos> I still do.
You sold your vote for a rec room ?<eos> No, I was gonna vote for it anyway.<eos> Farkus and I both agreed to cancel out each other's vote.<eos> - Mauer didn't know this?<eos> - Never asked.<eos> It's all 3D chess, Katherine.<eos> It's not my fault when people can't keep up.<eos> I need you to cover for me at the transportation markup today.<eos> - I've got a meeting.<eos> - No, you don't.
I thought you said she was the judge's favorite.<eos> She was.<eos> Oh.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - I will not have a woman who slept with my husband, and al... almost ruined my family, be rewarded with a seat in my son's cabinet.<eos> Does Peter know?<eos> I'm sorry, Jackie.<eos> I understand why you're upset.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
It means I'm... pretty cool, pretty gansta.<eos> Oh, we are happy for you.<eos> And, um, this is your comment from two days ago?<eos> "Zayeed is a terrorist "trained in Pakistan and sent to America undercover.<eos> Lotion my feet."?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's me.<eos> And how did you know this about Zayeed?<eos> How did I know it?<eos> I didn't.
Though I imagine my admiring gaze isn't why you summoned me.<eos> Lydia has evidence that could ruin me.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Just getting to see you so lovely is...<eos> It's worth the risk of being here.<eos> Rohan did an exemplary job, though it's likely a wasted effort as there should be no reason to activate this emergency beacon.<eos> May I?<eos> After our rocky start, who would thought we'd end up here?<eos> Truthfully, I did.
Get an E.K.G. and a crash cart.<eos> You look so beautiful.<eos> Aw! That's really sweet.<eos> But, uh...<eos> You're gonna be all puffy if you keep that up.<eos> Are you gonna get it together?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Callie's trying so hard to forgive me and to take care of me, and it's driving me crazy.<eos> - I thought you wanted...<eos> - I do!

Well, that's you in a nutshell.<eos> Whenever you were here, you wanted to go.<eos> Whenever you were gone, you wished that you were here.<eos> Cynthia...<eos> I know that I made it hard on you.<eos> Always being gone.<eos> I just want you to know... I'm sorry.<eos> You deserve better.<eos> You know, if you would've told me that a year ago... you would still be living in this house.<eos> I do now.
Yeah, I'm having a dad moment.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You know, when we looked into that wheelchair sports camp at the Y last year, we never followed up.<eos> I can give 'em a call.<eos> Dad, you get this sound in your voice, it makes me feel kind of helpless.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I mean, no matter how scary it gets, I'm not gonna let this thing beat me, right?<eos> I'm gonna keep fighting.<eos> Remember you said that?<eos> Yeah, that I did.
Really together, in a way that I never was with Elaine and you never were with Drew.<eos> And whatever comes, whatever challenges, we'll face them together.<eos> Well, that's what I want.<eos> I hope we can do that.<eos> We can.<eos> I promise...that I will never shut you out again.<eos> And I will never hide anything or have any secrets.<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
There's a live feed on channel 14 if you want to check it out.<eos> Great, now I got to hide from him, too.<eos> This Walden guy is gonna regret the day he stole my girlfriend.<eos> Oh, it's-it's not stealing. It-It's more like borrowing.<eos> Like-like renting a car.<eos> Yeah, but when you rent a car you know there's been other guys inside it, turning the knobs, playing with the seat, shoving stuff in the trunk.<eos> Okay, okay, maybe that's a bad analogy.<eos> But that doesn't change the fact that going over there to confront him is not gonna help anything.<eos> You got a better idea?<eos> Uh, I-I do.
Can you go get it for me?<eos> I will get it, but are you okay?<eos> Do you think I'm weird too?<eos> That's what you think, huh.<eos> Why does everyone in this school assume what others think?<eos> You were all raised wrong.<eos> None of you know how to even apologize.<eos> I will call you when I find it.<eos> - You have my number?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
It's getting colder everyday, and I know that you have no place to go.<eos> Didn't you think that it'd be difficult for me to see your mom?<eos> Would I stay warm at night after kicking you out? Or would I comfortably eat the food your mom makes me?<eos> Were you testing me for that or what?<eos> Look how bad your skin got.<eos> You know that Tan left home right? - I'm sorry.<eos> - It wasn't your fault.<eos> Anyway, where is he right now?<eos> Did he come to see you?<eos> He did, didn't he!
Yoon Chan Young and the rest of you.<eos> Open your textbooks.<eos> Yoon seems to have noticed.<eos> Yes, that's why I wanted to see you.<eos> Excuse me sir.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> - Do you know who he is?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I forgot to ask if he also had my pictures.<eos> Of course he does.
No, I always win some.<eos> So buckle up, Ghost Cop, we're not going home until we have 1,000 candies!<eos> But you heard the kid...<eos> None of the houses have candy.<eos> Wrong! He said none of the houses on earth have candy.<eos> Wexter!<eos> I know a house that has the best candy.<eos> To uni-planet!<eos> Axe Cop, I don't see uni-man's house anywhere.<eos> Of course you don't.
Wait, no.<eos> I'm serious, come on.<eos> It's like I said, we just work together.<eos> Look, it's not a big deal.<eos> We live on opposite sides of the country.<eos> It's not like we're exclusive.<eos> But you do find her attractive, right?<eos> Oh, all right.<eos> I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable.<eos> Sure you did.
Yes, he's recovering nicely.<eos> His partner's wounds, however, might take a while longer to heal.<eos> I'm sorry, Frank, I wasn't aware there was another officer injured.<eos> Well, a few hours before the shooting, his partner observed the shooter and thought he might be carrying a weapon.<eos> But fearing that a judge might rule his actions to be a violation of civil rights, he chose not to stop and question the individual.<eos> If you've come here to tell me that your men and women are handicapped...<eos> ...because they can no longer toss black men against the wall for no reason, you've come to the wrong person.<eos> Aw, cut it out.<eos> I know exactly where this is going, Frank.<eos> No, you don't.
Sounds to me like you're saying that you're the fancy big shot and I'm the guy looking for a handout here.<eos> That's not what I'm saying at all.<eos> Mick, just introduce me to the guy.<eos> Let me figure it out for myself, okay?<eos> Make the connection.<eos> Look, I got into this jam on my own.<eos> Danny, look at me.<eos> We're not talking about hanging some drywall for some extra bucks.<eos> You understand what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's already being taken care of.<eos> If he gets whacked, it's on me.<eos> Then I'm gonna be on you.<eos> FRANK:<eos> Over there.<eos> Those three.<eos> Why are we here, Frank?<eos> The one in the ball cap and the blue jacket.<eos> You see him?<eos> I do.
And I will always have your back.<eos> That is all.<eos> Ten-hut!<eos> When you were kids, did you know that Mr. Patrick was gonna turn out to be a criminal?<eos> No, I didn't know that.<eos> We were just friends.<eos> I knew.<eos> Oh, come on, Pop.<eos> 20/20 hindsight?<eos> Well, I did.
We were just friends.<eos> I knew.<eos> Oh, come on, Pop.<eos> 20/20 hindsight?<eos> Well, I did.<eos> Mickey Patrick was a born felon.<eos> Oh...<eos> Come on, Gramps.<eos> I didn't even how I was gonna turn out, much less anyone else.<eos> None of us did.
Well, you're not seeing it tonight.<eos> Well, no sign of Holly.<eos> You think she went off with that guy?<eos> Guys, it looks like we're spending Christmas without her.<eos> Wha...<eos> What are you guys doin' here?<eos> I have a visual on long legs.<eos> Over.<eos> I see you got my gift.<eos> - We all did.
You rang?<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah. This is obviously a test to determine who runs the new office, so I just wanna say, whatever happens, I hope you crash and burn.<eos> Dude, thank you.<eos> I hope you fall right on your face.<eos> Okay, so who do we got?<eos> Well, we have a nice lady, and... white Gandhi.<eos> Oof. That guy is so old, this news could literally kill him.<eos> - I don't want to kill white Gandhi.<eos> - (Scoffs) Oh, and I do?
Oh.<eos> Yeah. This is obviously a test to determine who runs the new office, so I just wanna say, whatever happens, I hope you crash and burn.<eos> Dude, thank you.<eos> I hope you fall right on your face.<eos> Okay, so who do we got?<eos> Well, we have a nice lady, and... white Gandhi.<eos> Oof. That guy is so old, this news could literally kill him.<eos> - I don't want to kill white Gandhi.<eos> - (Scoffs) Oh, and I do?<eos> - You do?
Uh, like the tension has moved out of your back and into my pants.<eos> I'm sure this is wildly inappropriate, but I'm very attracted to you.<eos> Well, I'm-I'm flattered.<eos> Uh-uh, it's just that...<eos> I'm dating your ex-husband.<eos> Boy, that was a weird thing to hear yourself say.<eos> I understand.<eos> Let me know if you change your mind.<eos> You do realize your hand is still on my ass.<eos> I do.
But you brought beer.<eos> You can't forage for beer.<eos> And that's a necessity.<eos> So this is Thanksgiving meal?<eos> 96 warm beers?<eos> We can do this.<eos> Guys, we've gotten soft!<eos> With our antibiotics and our sports creams.<eos> Do you think George Washington had a pet cat?<eos> Yeah. No. He didn't.
Please don't haunt us.<eos> Now, let's hit the road and get some freaking cheese steaks!<eos> Max, please take that down.<eos> It's so embarrassing.<eos> Nobody here knows anything about me.<eos> They didn't know me either, chicken.<eos> Hey, who you callin' chicken?<eos> Me. That was Antonia's nickname for me.<eos> - You know who I am?<eos> - Of course I do.
- So.<eos> - So.<eos> The study.<eos> Well, now with Jordan gone, I can confide in you that I think to write this story, I'm going to need to experience your methodology firsthand.<eos> So you want to be hooked up to the machine?<eos> Because that is firsthand.<eos> And feel free to use your second hand if needed.<eos> When I did a story on Tibetan monks, I spent a month in a monastery.<eos> When I did a story on kayaking, I went down the Colorado River.<eos> When I did a story on gang violence in South Central LA,
- You are?<eos> - Yes.<eos> No way.<eos> Why else would I work in this place?<eos> Because you're also not Hot Dog on a Stick material?<eos> Anyway, we're having a secret drag party here tomorrow night with a bunch of my cross-dressing friends.<eos> - You should come.<eos> - Oh, I would love to.<eos> But I got to work tomorrow night.<eos> No, you don't.
Gil and Renee Patterson were good, hard-working people.<eos> He was a bank manager, she was a nurse.<eos> If all these victims were targets, then what's the connection?<eos> Maybe they're not targets.<eos> Maybe they're surrogates.<eos> For who?<eos> So, um, apparently, a neighbor found the bodies when she came by and saw the door was ajar.<eos> Do the Pattersons have any next of kin?<eos> We're gonna need to talk to them.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Yes, I'm here.<eos> What does this jackass want?<eos> A floor-wide deep clean.<eos> Okay, I've got to go.<eos> I've got someone stuck underneath a food cart in the elevator.<eos> I feel really stupid right now.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Just...<eos> I just think I wish I hadn't given him a blowjob last night.<eos> - You did what?
Maybe.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay. - Just not at work. - Oh.<eos> - I mean, how about Delbert's at 7:00?<eos> I'm still on my diet, but maybe like some grilled vegetables and a protein.<eos> Oh, what exactly is... is that?<eos> Oh, your husband's raffle basket.<eos> You want these Indian hot buns?<eos> No one else does.
Yeah, well, let me worry about it.<eos> You stay on the outside.<eos> I'll go in the inside.<eos> Listen.<eos> Call Ben and Donnie.<eos> Tell 'em to meet me here at the shack a half hour before dawn. All right?<eos> - Soon as we get all secured.<eos> - Right.<eos> I'm gonna need an extra man to stay here with the boat.<eos> - l will.
I don't call that a distance when you keep tromping on my heels.<eos> - Why are you rubbing up against me?<eos> - What the hell do I need you for?<eos> But you are!<eos> - Are you afraid of getting lost?<eos> - There you go sounding off again!<eos> I'm not afraid of getting lost, but I'm a little nervous about crossing that river.<eos> It's all right for you, you can swim, but I can't swim one stroke.<eos> Will you shut up for at least a minute?<eos> No, I won't!
I should apologize.<eos> Listen.<eos> Who, in your opinion, had the motive for killing Garrone? For real and not for fun.<eos> - For real?<eos> I shall look at the issue in depth.<eos> But let me think about it a bit. And I'll call you as soon as possible.<eos> Alright?<eos> Goodbye.<eos> So, will my son be released, Sir?<eos> Yes, he will.
It's you, inspector.<eos> - Good morning!<eos> Already at work?<eos> - I got up early after a sleepless night.<eos> Worries?<eos> - The heat!<eos> People should leave this city.<eos> My gardener has already done so.<eos> Don't tell me you were just passing by?<eos> - I won't.
Now, he has the right to speak.<eos> Why did you do this Daniel?<eos> I love you, Manoela.<eos> Are you going to include me in the end?<eos> I love you.<eos> I do not want to be broken!<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because I'm asking for it.<eos> I do not want to hurt you, especially not you.<eos> But I will not!
Dear Sir, I wish to protest... [singing the melody to richard wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries"]<eos> ANNOUNCER: There now follows... [reads on-screen text]<eos> I'd like to talk to you tonight about a minority group of people who have no mental or physical handicaps and who, through no fault of their own, have never been deprived, and consequently are forced to live in conditions of extreme luxury.<eos> This often-ignored minority is very rarely brought to the attention of the general public.<eos> The average man in the street scarcely gives a second thought to these extremely well-off people.<eos> He quite simply fails to appreciate the pressures that vast quantities of money just do not bring.<eos> Have you at home ever had to cope with this problem?<eos> Or this?<eos> I know it's only human to say, "Oh, this will never happen to me."<eos> And of course, it won't.
THE KID HAS NO PEP<eos> You play defense now.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Stand still.<eos> I dreamed of a new move.<eos> You're the defender.<eos> In my dream, I just slipped by.<eos> will you do it with me?<eos> will you stand still?<eos> will you?
- You got any collateral?<eos> - Collateral?<eos> - Automobile, jewelry?<eos> - What is this, Chase Manhattan?<eos> You don't seem to comprehend the situation.<eos> You have to pay three percent a week every week.<eos> I know what I have to do.<eos> - Where are you gonna get it?<eos> - I'll get it.<eos> You will, huh?
Well, they were friends.<eos> - Did you see my present for you?<eos> - It was on my pillow.<eos> I'm going to be leaving very early tomorrow.<eos> - Will you take me?<eos> - No, I can't, Anthony.<eos> - Why do you have to go?<eos> - I have to do business.<eos> I could help you.<eos> Some day you will.
Partisans, Jews...<eos> I know very little about her life in this house at that time<eos> She died before the war ended<eos> I was in America and I came back to relieve the Fifth Army<eos> I've been living here ever since<eos> Professor we're going, I can't keep my eyes open<eos> - You coming Oonrad?<eos> I'd better get my blanket<eos> You know I am very disappointed, I was sure you'd fall in love with Simon<eos> Perhaps I will
What does that mean?<eos> - The Professor knows<eos> - Oh, he knows everything<eos> But how about telling me?<eos> The Professor said that I should change my life<eos> Oh is that all? Professor you don't know what you're asking<eos> Why what do you know?<eos> Stefano's major disaster in life is envy<eos> One day you must tell me darling, what that crowd's got that I should envy<eos> Yeah, well one day I will.
- Here.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Something else?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> Passengers for Lyons, boarding now.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Fasten your seat belts.<eos> Your Honor, I understand that a son wouldn't want to see his father in this kind of situation, but can't a father see his son?<eos> You will, Mr. Descombes.
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I was too scared myself.<eos> Enough now!<eos> Did you hear about the Russians?<eos> I never listened.<eos> I was too scared.<eos> Mischa!<eos> What?<eos> My parents will live with us.<eos> They certainly will not.
I'll go talk to Uchimoto, so don'tworry about it, okay?<eos> Move it!<eos> - Bro! - Listen to me!<eos> Don't get itchy triggerfingers until we have a clear answer from Kawada!<eos> Forgetthat bastard, bro!<eos> We can do itourselves!<eos> I don't intend to die withoutavenging Okajima's death!<eos> Kawada's a little strange!<eos> Don't geton his bad side oryou'll regret it later!<eos> I won't lastmuch longer!
- Ginger ale, please.<eos> Police!<eos> Drop it!<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> Move away from there!<eos> If you take the trouble to examine that gun, you'll notice it hasn't been fired.<eos> Anything you have to say, you can say at the station.<eos> I'm charging him under Section 473.<eos> - I didn't see your identity card.<eos> - You will.
- Yes, Marquise.<eos> There was a foul odor emanating from his person.<eos> A vulgar smell and yet very exciting ... which he knew how to get rid of.<eos> - Madam?<eos> - Please close the glass.<eos> A worker sweats.<eos> Tomorrow I want the car washed and buffed.<eos> As you wish.<eos> And make sure you wash it well.<eos> So I will.
It involves a debt I owe someone.<eos> Why do I always have the feeling that you're hiding something from me?<eos> - Oh, you've always felt that way.<eos> - Yes, and I always think you have.<eos> Harry I haven't told you everything in my life.<eos> But I haven't made a secret of that, have I?<eos> - No.<eos> - Well.<eos> Goddamn it, I'm getting too old for this.<eos> - Of course, I'll always...
What's happening?<eos> What's this?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Father, have mercy on us.<eos> Free us from worldly sins.<eos> Defeat Satan.<eos> Only you can do it.<eos> The castle is becoming an obsession for me too.<eos> Let's leave.<eos> We will, darling.
I want to speak to Don Vito.<eos> Hey, Pepe, stop that will you?<eos> My mother could play the harp and she's still trying to teach me.<eos> I said stop it.<eos> Here they are.<eos> Him, who's he?<eos> One of the Marsigliese's men.<eos> The Marsigliese's supposed to come in person.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He won't.
- No.<eos> I've got a schedule to keep.<eos> Glass Shop Windshields<eos> What the hell is that hooker doing at Greta's apartment?<eos> That's no hooker.<eos> She doesn't charge.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I just know.<eos> What if I don't want to?<eos> You will.
I suppose it ain't.<eos> She don't do as good when you're not there.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> Then lighten up, man.<eos> It happened before she met you.<eos> Besides, I can't hack it by myself.<eos> I'm only 11.<eos> Remember?<eos> Don't tell her I was by.<eos> I won't.
Married to him?<eos> No.<eos> How come?<eos> He had a rotten personality.<eos> Well- How about mine?<eos> What are we playin', 20 Questions?<eos> No, I'm just trying to get you to say something nice for once.<eos> I'm glad you're back.<eos> But it ain't gonna work.<eos> It will.
You're gonna hear them come through. They'll probably search the grounds.<eos> You just be real quiet until they pass by.<eos> - And I'll come back to get you.<eos> - They'll never find me.<eos> They'll never- They will never find us.<eos> Us?<eos> David, they might find you.<eos> No, no. I can hide. They'll never find either of us.<eos> - But what if they do?<eos> They won't.
Miriam and I are exactly the same size.<eos> David!<eos> Prof. Tilson.<eos> Give it up, sweetums.<eos> The professor wants Miriam to do it.<eos> So I'll let her... during the rehearsals.<eos> I really want you to come, Herman.<eos> When you see this play you'll see a whole new side of me.<eos> Well, you could stop off here and see the play... and go directly on to the plumbing convention.<eos> You will?
Don't you suppose she's ever seen a French postcard?<eos> You'll let those curtains down, or this is the last bath you'll ever...<eos> Get out of there.<eos> Say, what's the idea?<eos> What? Getting in that barrel.<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Maybe I'm going over niagara falls.<eos> Hey, you're supposed to rinse off with that gourd.<eos> Listen. You know we drink that water?<eos> Yeah, well, you won't this.
That's a... a bit of luck.<eos> Good luck, for both of us.<eos> The cards say we will be lovers.<eos> You are mistaken.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> Forbidden for me.<eos> Now you must go.<eos> But you do believe,... I mean really believe in the cards?<eos> They have never lied to me.<eos> Then they won't now.
I don't suppose you can wait here by yourself, can you?<eos> You hungry?<eos> Want a Nehi and a Coney island?<eos> - Ain't you eating?<eos> - I ain't hungry.<eos> You worried about going on the train?<eos> You'II soon be at your aunt's and all your troubles over.<eos> So, eat up.<eos> - She don't know me.<eos> - She will.
- How much money we got?<eos> - $837 and some change.<eos> 42 cents, I think.<eos> We're just outside St Jo.<eos> - So what? - So...<eos> It's a big town. We can do better than twenties.<eos> Y'all know that one, "Let's have another cup of coffee, " It's 1 0,30 Sunday morning in St Jo and y'all get to church now, OK?<eos> Here's the news, ln Omaha, President Roosevelt told the nation,<eos> Moze, what if he don't believe you?<eos> He will.
- Can I talk to him?<eos> At the moment, he's resting.<eos> Oh. Well, make sure you tell him I asked about him.<eos> YES.<eos> What do you want me to do about the urutu?<eos> Well, when it arrives, tell them to hold it, and we'll make some kind of arrangements to get it here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> And don't forget to tell David I called.<eos> - 4 won't, Kristy.
Take the shot.<eos> You not gonna send someone over?<eos> Look, look.<eos> McCoy, I get one, I'm gonna lose the other.<eos> Look, Serpico, that's Muscles' case.<eos> He's off for a couple days.<eos> - I can't cut in, Frank.<eos> - They're here now!<eos> - It'll keep.<eos> - No, it won't!
Me, too.<eos> Now I'm feeling better.<eos> But I won't be manipulated!<eos> Manipulated by whom?<eos> By Siskins.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I won't be intimidated!<eos> I can be just as pigheaded as Vollmer was.<eos> Vollmer wouldn't let private interests take over his computer.<eos> And I won't, either.
Well, why doesn't he come here, then?<eos> Who is this relative, anyway?<eos> Hi.<eos> My aunt is dead.<eos> Be strong. Be strong.<eos> Titta, no.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Titta, open up!<eos> - Open up.<eos> - No, I won't!
The director said that...<eos> What have you been telling Jerry Parks? What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Really.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> Don't you know he's a blackmailing, smut-peddling...<eos> No.<eos> You think he likes you.<eos> Nora, I simply won't listen to you.<eos> Oh, yes, you will. No, I won't.
It also foretold that it is the deeds of weak and mortal men.<eos> That may tip the scales one way or the other.<eos> Rachid!<eos> Sinbad!<eos> No!<eos> Oh no!<eos> And now, Sinbad...<eos> - A shield of darkness shall be mine.<eos> - I see no shield.<eos> You will.
-Why'?<eos> Why the third degree?<eos> -What's wrong with you?<eos> Me'?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Do you want to come with me?<eos> To wait for you in a hotel?<eos> -You might like it...<eos> You've never been to Stockholm.<eos> Will you some'?
Do not talk, do not talk, you will see when Thousand Masks finds out.<eos> So, you have been sent by those wrestlers?<eos> No sir, we have come, because the kid wanted to see the mummies.<eos> and how did you know they where here.<eos> We knew nothing, sir, this is the mine from hell, and Satan took the mummies.<eos> This is all very interesting, Professor, but I feel they will see the truth when they see, what they seek.<eos> We have said the truth, sir!<eos> I have no doubt, but things will become more clear to you, once you see, the mummies!<eos> we will say the truth!<eos> we will!
Hush!<eos> Good morning, Comrade Sergeant.<eos> Morning.<eos> How's Chetvertak?<eos> Sleeping.<eos> We didn't wake her.<eos> Right.<eos> Stay beside me.<eos> And keep your head down.<eos> I will.
We need the rest.<eos> What's that mean?<eos> It means more in terms of TV.<eos> Like what? I already agreed to the....<eos> Look, we've just started.<eos> So there's a chance.<eos> I can't think. Can't we talk tomorrow?<eos> I'll go along to Pasadena and we'll talk in the car.<eos> Let's work this out.<eos> We will.
- Oh, no, no!<eos> - It's the only way!<eos> I'll say that... that I couldn't find you.<eos> That... you've run away before.<eos> - That big cities frighten you.<eos> - But, Armando, where would I go?<eos> You wait right here!<eos> If this works, I'll be back by nightfall.<eos> - But what if they don't let you go?<eos> - Oh, they will. They will.
You mean you?<eos> Yeah. Why don't you tell your boys to just sit this one out?<eos> You love to make it happen, don't ya?<eos> You havin' any of it?<eos> Well, sir, you're a pretty old man.<eos> Yeah, I'm 30 years older than you are.<eos> Had my back broke once and my hip twice.<eos> And on my worst day I could beat the hell out of you.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You will.
Who was that?<eos> I don't know... how she gets so thin.<eos> Who?<eos> Zobaida the busty.<eos> and Karim dehydrated her.<eos> Play, play!<eos> I got it!<eos> Another great idea.<eos> It must work this time.<eos> It will.
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church?<eos> I do.<eos> Michael Francis Rizzi, do you renounce Satan?<eos> I do renounce him.<eos> And all his works?<eos> I do renounce them.<eos> -And all his pomps?<eos> -I do renounce them.<eos> Michael Rizzi, will you be baptized?<eos> I will.
Here's our chief guest.<eos> If he had been forgotten, it'd have been a gap in our great feast.<eos> Tonight we hold a solemn supper, and I'll request your presence.<eos> Let Your Highness command upon me to the which my duties are with a most indissoluble tie forever knit.<eos> -Ride you this afternoon?<eos> -Ay, my lord.<eos> is it far you ride?<eos> As far as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper.<eos> -Fail not our feast.<eos> -My lord, I will not.
That's going to be a saloon and gambling.<eos> Did you say you come up from Bearpaw to see me?<eos> Is there something I can do for you?<eos> Do you have anything to eat?<eos> I'm bloody starving.<eos> It took six hours to get up here in that flipping contraption.<eos> You'll have to forgive me. My kitchen ain't in operation yet.<eos> I could take you up to the restaurant if you're hungry enough.<eos> I'm hungry enough. I could eat a bloody horse.<eos> -At Sheehan's place, you probably will.
I had a mother and a father and a little brother and a lawn.<eos> Terrific.<eos> I was always going to art classes, and my mother was always going to the doctor.<eos> It was all right.<eos> Why'd you leave, then?<eos> Don't just go around leaving people for no reason.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> Well, you shouldn't.<eos> It ain't right.<eos> I won't.
I want you to be.<eos> You know if it depended on me, I'd be far from here right now.<eos> Oh, but we couldn't manage without you.<eos> That's what the police will also think.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You're safe with me.<eos> I killed no one.<eos> Again?<eos> It's difficult to forget.<eos> Ah, you will.
there are squirrels here, you know.<eos> but i did hear something.<eos> it could be just... what?<eos> i'll go and look. right.<eos> can you see anything?<eos> miles, be careful. right.<eos> where are you, dear?<eos> just a moment. unh!<eos> be a good boy, miles, and come back and finish your tea.<eos> that i surely will.
Those who do might not be that much happier.<eos> Brother Fung.<eos> I haven't been happy this past year.<eos> I torture myself daily.<eos> Only until now I can realise in my heart... that I have no more pain.<eos> Thank you for coming, we're honoured.<eos> -Please. -Thanks.<eos> Brother Lung.<eos> Do you think Fung will come?<eos> He certainly will.
Wen-tong!<eos> Let him go!<eos> He's too insensible<eos> Sister!<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I went for a walk, I needed to think<eos> He must have a reason<eos> Reason?<eos> Don't lie to yourself<eos> No, he won't...
- Sam, what's with that little kid?<eos> - What little kid?<eos> I mean, that little kid, whatever his name is.<eos> Darrin, why don't you get ready for lunch?<eos> I'll tell you later.<eos> You mean, Irving is going to join us for lunch?<eos> Yes.<eos> Maybe even dinner, with the outside possibility of breakfast.<eos> Don't tell me he's going to spend the night.<eos> - Okay, I won't.
Well, now what is that supposed to mean? - What, do I smell or something?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> My sister didn't mean anything.<eos> She's so used to her hospital routine.<eos> Well, I am going to make up my bed.<eos> Good night, ladies.<eos> I didn't mean that the way it sounded.<eos> There's nothing better than a good, hot soak. It really relaxes you.<eos> - Why don't you try it?<eos> - Well, maybe I will.
- Don't be silly.<eos> - I wish I could do something to please her.<eos> She's moody.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> Hey, she's enjoying the water.<eos> - You want to know something?<eos> If you lie down here... no one can see you.<eos> My, that's a fascinating piece of information. What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Why don't you try it and find out?<eos> All right, I will.
You have to be brave.<eos> Do you like stones?<eos> I do.<eos> I know a deserted place. I prepared a beautiful stone for you there.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> You have to come tonight. Will you come?<eos> -Will you?<eos> -I'll come.<eos> Will you recognize that stone?<eos> Yes, I will.
Be careful, Paul.<eos> Don't do anything... that you may be sorry for.<eos> I couldn't be any sorrier than I am now, Mr. Secker.<eos> I'm over here, Lucy.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Over here.<eos> You must be frozen.<eos> - Why are you dressed like that?<eos> - But I don't understand.<eos> - You will.
Welcome to my inn, sir.<eos> Your new wench.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She's only a serving wench, my lord, sir.<eos> Get some of your foul drink and bring her.<eos> Bess!<eos> What can I do for you, my lord?<eos> My girl, you don't want to spend the whole of your life... as a serving wench, do you?<eos> I have no wish to change my trade.<eos> Wishes or not... you will.
Somehow, Oona had the power to control Roderick to kill.<eos> Said he's not a man, but a spirit.<eos> Lord Edward!<eos> Maureen.<eos> Was it Roderick?<eos> I thought you said you had him chained up!<eos> - Bully Boy, are you...<eos> - But I did, my lord!<eos> - We must find him, Bully Boy.<eos> - We will, my lord.
You would understand me more completely.<eos> Blood ... tasty and good ...<eos> nothing quenches like it.<eos> He is young and strong ... enough kisses for all of us.<eos> Go back!<eos> How dare you touch him?<eos> This man is mine ...<eos> never come near him again.<eos> You have never loved ...<eos> and you never will.
Come on, give me the cap.<eos> Oh, your bloody cap.<eos> Right, now, listen.<eos> Get your coat and your bag and come here.<eos> Serves me right.<eos> Seeing stupid kids.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Come on, come on, get a move on.<eos> No, I won't.
Away with her husband.<eos> - Are they French too?<eos> - No. No.<eos> They gave me their apartment for the summer.<eos> You sure you're all right?<eos> Doctor, how long has this stuff been going on?<eos> Quite a while.<eos> Does anybody besides you know who the thing is happening to?<eos> - I mean, you know, who the nut is?<eos> And no one ever will.
Don't curse.<eos> We've got enough trouble already.<eos> - I wish them all dead.<eos> - Don't curse.<eos> - I will. - You'll die instead of the kids.<eos> I wish all of you dead so I'd be rid of you all.<eos> - Enough, don't make me mad.<eos> - What if you're mad?<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - I won't.
Although we were poor, at least there was some freedom.<eos> But now...<eos> No life!<eos> Incarceration!<eos> I'm a merchant's wife, married to the eminent merchant<eos> Zinovi Borisovich Ismailov.<eos> The ant drags along its straw, the bird builds its nest, the farm labourers pour out the flour but I alone have nothing to do.<eos> I alone am depressed, to me alone life is unkind, me, the merchant's wife.<eos> Will there be mushrooms today?<eos> Yes, there will.
Bring me some mushrooms.<eos> They're delicious mushrooms.<eos> You're really an expert, Katerina, at preparing mushrooms.<eos> Go along and get dressed.<eos> You're wandering around the yard almost naked.<eos> Go on...<eos> No, stop!<eos> My insides are on fire.<eos> Bring some water.<eos> I won't.
They've come.<eos> hello, there are few things I'd Iike to ask you.<eos> Come out for questioning.<eos> How is it? You must miss the outside world.<eos> Don't ask me that, of course I do.<eos> I'm going to get you out.<eos> What?<eos> Mister, do you really mean that?<eos> But only if you do as I say.<eos> Yes, I will.
It couldn't last.<eos> At least I met some brave people.<eos> It's almost noon.<eos> You must be hungry.<eos> If I don't find precocious potatoes, I will plant these, of course.<eos> But with the precocious, I'd gain 3 months.<eos> In early June, there would be leaves in my field.<eos> And then, flowers.<eos> Unless it frosts.<eos> It won't.
Don't forget to give me his address before I leave.<eos> Good God!<eos> - That's spare rib!<eos> - 1 kilo.<eos> If it fits in the suitcase.<eos> Don't worry, I will make it fit in.<eos> I also have two pieces of dried cheese.<eos> It will fit in too.<eos> - Not everybody likes it.<eos> - I will.
Be careful.<eos> Watch your step.<eos> - That is fabulous.<eos> - You might not believe me, but I think about your potatoes at night, when I can't sleep.<eos> It distracts me from my migraine.<eos> I think about them, too.<eos> Maybe too much, even.<eos> I want them so bad, I fear it will bring me bad luck.<eos> If only the wind turned to the North...<eos> Oh, it won't.
That bird is having a conversation with Tabitha.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Well, of course they're having a conversation.<eos> Isn't that why you taught the bird to talk?<eos> Tabitha, did you do a no-no to this bird?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Tabitha.<eos> Grandma said I can do anything I want.<eos> No one can give you permission to use witchcraft, except me.<eos> - But you won't.
- Come on!<eos> - You're the fatheaded beast.<eos> Quit shouting.<eos> Boy' somebody sure trained 'em.<eos> Which way?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I don't know where we've been and I've just been there.<eos> They can't follow us. We're safe.<eos> You really think so?<eos> I will if you will.
- Take Jess' horse with you.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Well, now, that's a lot more like it.<eos> You're as good as new, Jess, except for your neck.<eos> You won't be needin' my tender care anymore.<eos> You're free to go, Jess.<eos> Anywhere where the Mexican law or the Mexican Federales can't find you.<eos> Or any place north, where the American law or the American cavalry can't run you down.<eos> You're a famous man, Jess. Don't ever forget it.<eos> I won't.
A new chorus... At vassily's.<eos> And all kinds of...<eos> - what's the matter?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Steshka will again sing that romance about a willow tree.<eos> Elisaveta Mikhailovna sings that romance much better.<eos> which romance? That old romance?<eos> Yes, that old romance.<eos> will you sing for us, Elisaveta Mikhailovna?<eos> Yes, I will.
You denied yourself a tragic fate...<eos> Are you saying that a life of shame such as this... is inevitable?<eos> I didn't kill myself... because I wish to live in a manner of my own choosing!<eos> Had I known that I'd become my enemy's concubine I'd have killed myself back then!<eos> Your Lord deceived and murdered my father.<eos> To me, he can only be my enemy!<eos> 'Tis a world of kill or be killed... I am not bitter that my father was not fortunate in battle.<eos> Had your Lord not slain him, my father might have done the same to him.<eos> But even so, I could never become the concubine of my father's enemy!<eos> I will not! I will not!
"whose mutilated body was found washed up on the beach.<eos> "Open brackets.<eos> Tee-hee-hee.<eos> Close brackets." Read on, winthrop.<eos> We printed an apology, sir guy.<eos> And in what language was the apology written?<eos> Polish.<eos> Polish? It's gotta stop, winthrop.<eos> It will, sir guy.<eos> It will. It will, it will, it will.
Yes, I'm told she is a very good looking woman.<eos> Damned if I can find anything!<eos> - What's he looking for?<eos> You've been seeing Herr Beiber!<eos> - There's no law against that!<eos> Depends on who's side you're on!<eos> - I'm on Miss Kerrell's side!<eos> Which side is that?<eos> That's what you're here to find out, isn't it?<eos> - Oh, we will!
The balance of power of the entire Middle East is in jeopardy!<eos> And you seem powerless to stop this thing!<eos> - Mr. Breeze...<eos> The Beiber Organization must insist on discretion.<eos> There must be no hint of scandal!<eos> Or our shares will crash... That's your problem!<eos> If there's a traitor in our setup, I shall find him without publicity!<eos> No, I will find the traitor and I don't give a damn about publicity!<eos> For the last time, will you tell me how you know about Jane Kerrell?<eos> No, I will not!
I'll look in the closet and under the bed, too.<eos> OK?<eos> OK.<eos> - How many days has he been gone?<eos> - Six.<eos> I think you'vee lost.<eos> You're a fool.<eos> Take this off.<eos> Calm down.<eos> I will.
I'm not acting.<eos> Lie down and rest.<eos> How will you go on tonight?<eos> Go on, with whom?<eos> What a brilliant idea!<eos> Make a film about his absence.<eos> Why, in Paris...<eos> Who cares about Paris?<eos> ! Audiences here have to like it.<eos> They will.
Did you, now, lass?<eos> Well, with a bedside manner like that, Scotty, you're in the wrong business.<eos> When the record of this is forwarded, I'll be sent back, won't I?<eos> Oh, you will not!<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> This getting used to space travel, that takes some doing. And not everybody takes to it. - Did you?<eos> - Well, me, that's different.<eos> I was practically born to it.<eos> - I want to continue.<eos> - You will.
- But you did kill.<eos> No. Resisting us killed those people.<eos> We did not kill them.<eos> The price of your survival is too high.<eos> We only want the girl.<eos> You can't have her. You're entitled to your own life, but not another's.<eos> Life was given to me.<eos> It is mine.<eos> I want to live it out.<eos> I... will...
- Yes.<eos> I used to have money galore.<eos> I have nothing now.<eos> I'm taking it all back.<eos> I can't forgive you.<eos> Servants!<eos> Throw him into jail!<eos> I'll walk by myself!<eos> - Well, am I going to be your wife?<eos> - Sure you will.
No, why?<eos> Look for yourself. I underlined the part that says:<eos> "The leader and organizer is Mrs. Darrin Stephens."<eos> Well?<eos> Well, I must say Sam takes an excellent picture.<eos> Your wife is biting the hand that feeds us and all you can say is that?<eos> Come on, Larry.<eos> So Sam's all fired-up about something that's important to any mother.<eos> - It'll blow over.<eos> - Sure, it will.
Now to the sin ofmurder we must add sacrilege.<eos> Since coming to this town, I've sadly had to perform the burial of three men who have died violently.<eos> For the hand that slew Fred Carson and Stoney Burough, I sought the Lord's forgiveness.<eos> But for the limitless evil of him who slew Mace Jones, I ask for limitless punishment for he took a man's life in God's House.<eos> Let us pray, therefore, that heaven receives the soul of Mace Jones, and that the soul of his killer wander the darkness for ever.<eos> All men being sinful and Thou just, I pray You regard any score against Mace Jones as even.<eos> Strike it from Thy books and let him sleep. Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> I didn't hear you praying, Little George.<eos> You never will, either.
He was surely right that when there is danger it is the persons with a stake in the country, land, position, wealth that are best able to able to defend it.<eos> I am an old man, Airey and I've only got one arm to fight the war with.<eos> It won't be enough.<eos> Duberly says it's going to be war.<eos> He says the Russians will fight and the Prime Minister is faced towards peace, but carried towards war.<eos> Duberly says I can go with the army.<eos> I can go, Duberly says, as a wife, which I am.<eos> Isn't it exciting?<eos> - William wants to go.<eos> - Soldiers will.
All along I was convinced it was you.<eos> And when you turned up just now...<eos> - Isn't it ridiculous?<eos> - Yes, isn't it?<eos> We fly to London tonight.<eos> But first, we must go to the races.<eos> I have to pay off Mr Sobakevich.<eos> Don't stray too far, George. We might have to leave early.<eos> Before you go any further, I'm sure I don't have to tell you this, but you won't, of course, try to see<eos> Caroline again after today, will you?
And Tanith?<eos> - Upstairs.<eos> - Alone?<eos> No. Rex is with her.<eos> Mummy, would you come...? (Bell) Get out of this house, do you hear me?<eos> I want the girl and Simon.<eos> - Show him out.<eos> - I am leaving.<eos> I shall not be back.<eos> But something will.
I'd kill a worm in a second, but there's something different about you... - and I don't like it!<eos> I hate dogs.<eos> Dogs?<eos> So that explains all the cats.<eos> What did the dog find out?<eos> Any other dogs spying around?<eos> Where are they?<eos> That's what I want to know.<eos> Tell me and I'll take good care of you.<eos> You will?
Christ, you don't know what nothing is.<eos> I want to die. No, you don't.<eos> I want to die.<eos> I'll hold you.<eos> Henry, I want to die.<eos> I want to die.<eos> Let me hold you.<eos> You will, you know, someday.<eos> Just wait long enough, and it'll happen.<eos> So it will.
We'll never find him in this forest.<eos> He's probably halfway to Escondido by now.<eos> Come on, We're headin' home.<eos> Got to get better quick.<eos> You Will.<eos> I'll help you.<eos> You haven't see me, understand?<eos> Not until I'm better... or these coyotes Will be all over me.<eos> I haven't seen you.<eos> Nobody Will.
–That's nice.<eos> Have a good time.<eos> We were going to Florida next winter without the kids.<eos> Now they're going without me.<eos> OK, come on, boys.<eos> Good night.<eos> –One of us should stay.<eos> –It's OK.<eos> Suppose he tries something again.<eos> –He won't.
- I think it's original.<eos> As if he's...<eos> an explorer or something.<eos> I mean, I think it's an adventure.<eos> Come with me.<eos> - Well, gee, I...<eos> - Come on, live a little.<eos> I don't know if...<eos> We'll explore the torrential headwaters of the Lucinda River.<eos> All right, I will.
Looking for me?<eos> Are you sure you don't want me?<eos> God forbid!<eos> If we could get 115, say 11 0,000<eos> There must be a way!<eos> You're asking too much.<eos> I paid 100,000 for the house<eos> You paid too much.<eos> Will you give 1% for each thousand over 60,000?<eos> I will, for each thousand over 120,000
- Lucía...<eos> - Let him speak.<eos> - This is Lucia's chance and you won't stand in the way of a measure of collective benefit<eos> - and mainly for her.<eos> - Listen up, This is an action of the Revolutionary government<eos> Lucia is a victim of imperialism. She's going to learn to read and write, whatever you say.<eos> - But this guy won't stay in my house.<eos> - He's going to sleep there.<eos> - That's that. - He's going to sleep there.<eos> - No he won't, Ange.
My match will be played in 20 minutes.<eos> You'd better get started.<eos> - Did you check with Mellini?<eos> - Yes.<eos> The gold shipment is on schedule.<eos> It will arrive in about two hours.<eos> I will meet you back here after my match.<eos> Good luck.<eos> I hope you win.<eos> I will.
- Who is?<eos> Deela?<eos> is that who you're working for?<eos> At first I refused, but then I couldn't help myself.<eos> I met this girl. She's one of them.<eos> I've never known anyone like her.<eos> I showed them the operation of the ship. Bridge controls, life-support.<eos> She explained that they wanted to know.<eos> I didn't understand at first, but I do now.<eos> So will you, sir.
The handle.<eos> - Melford's nightmare.<eos> - Right on cue.<eos> It's time we re-examined these nightmares more closely.<eos> Here they are.<eos> I've made my decision.<eos> I've drafted my resignation.<eos> Before you deliver it, look through those.<eos> - I really don't see what good it'll do.<eos> - You will.
Do you want to tell me or do I guess?<eos> Aunt Clara?<eos> Endora? Uncle Arthur?<eos> Well, sweetheart, Aunt Clara did drop in.<eos> She was only trying to help.<eos> -It's kind of hard to explain.<eos> Well, she wanted to get someone to help me paint the house.<eos> Well, she just made one teeny little mistake voilà, Leonardo da Vinci.<eos> You're not gonna tell me that Leonardo da Vinci is here in our house?<eos> -Okay, I won't.
You're not kidding.<eos> Come on, Lar.<eos> I'll go up and send him down.<eos> I just don't want you to wake the baby.<eos> Say, you know what I was thinking?<eos> If we tie up the doctor, Hornbeck will be in this afternoon.<eos> Yeah. And can you imagine what a pill like this would mean to a business like Hornbeck Pharmaceuticals?<eos> Yeah. And for his partners.<eos> He doesn't have any partners.<eos> He will.
I knew you wouldn't, Bruno.<eos> I'm not afraid.<eos> Well, we didn't have much time anyway.<eos> Pretty soon Ralph, he'll be... ready to join Uncle Ned and Aunt Claire.<eos> And then you.<eos> We wanna stay here for ever and ever, Bruno, with you and Ralph and Uncle Ned.<eos> We will.<eos> I promise.<eos> For ever and ever.<eos> We will.
Bravo, Julius Octopus, as a reward... you can have a pass to go to Rome and see the circus.<eos> Circus?<eos> I'm going to the circus!<eos> I'm going to the circus!<eos> - Druid, tell me your secret.<eos> - The secret? Not on your life.<eos> This man must talk, get me the torturer.<eos> We'll see if he'll talk or not.<eos> - Talk!<eos> - I won't.
A determined enemy, no doubt.<eos> You have reinforced the listening posts?<eos> Yes, general.<eos> And the bomb room?<eos> It's been abandoned to avoid further attacks.<eos> New staging areas have been prepared.<eos> Logical.<eos> Very logical.<eos> I thought so.<eos> And so will the Americans.
I don't believe I've had the pleasure though I'm flattered you've heard of me.<eos> I have heard of you, but not as an expert on baccarat.<eos> I'm sorry you weren't told.<eos> Do you think that went unnoticed, Mr. Bond?<eos> I see everything that goes on at this table.<eos> - Nothing escapes me.<eos> - I'm quite sure it doesn't.<eos> But you know, we mustn't forget that: "The beggar who is sitting in the market place... "...is completely deaf...<eos> "...the mockingbird is concerned." Sorry, Mr. Bond, I don't get the connection.<eos> You will.
Darling, say good night to Mr. Brown.<eos> Scoot down.<eos> You took this out of my desk.<eos> I wanted the stamp.<eos> It's American.<eos> It's a new American.<eos> I always have your stamps.<eos> Not until you ask me.<eos> - If I tell your father...<eos> - You won't, will you?
And how many have you had?<eos> It probably runs into the three figures.<eos> This is the last.<eos> I don't want another adventure.<eos> Nor do I.<eos> Manuel guesses.<eos> But he says nothing.<eos> - Let me tell him.<eos> - I can't hurt Angelito.<eos> You won't.
Oh, God, I pray to God you don't hit me anymore.<eos> I'll do anything you say, but I can't take anymore.<eos> -You got your mind right, Luke?<eos> Oh, I got it right, Boss.<eos> Suppose you was to backslide on us?<eos> Oh, no, I won't, Boss.<eos> Suppose you was to back-sass?<eos> Oh, no, I won't. I won't. I got my mind right.<eos> You try to run again, we're going to kill you.<eos> I won't, I won't, Boss.
That would put you way ahead of most of the guys around here, wouldn't it?<eos> Better fall in and join them.<eos> It is true that I've been blessed with an insight into women that others don't have.<eos> And sometimes.... Sometimes I'm called upon to use it in our beloved Master's will.<eos> If women are your special province, why do you hate Major Reisman so much?<eos> There are 11 evil men out there. And they must be punished for their wickedness.<eos> This Major Reisman snatched them up from the brink of the pit and he cheated the Master of His vengeance.<eos> And you think that's what God wants, to punish these men?<eos> He will, Captain.<eos> He will. And Major Reisman too.
Well, Thornton, if that's the way you think, I don't want you.<eos> That's good enough for me...<eos> Fancy vest, go ahead and pull that rifle if you want to, but you better speak to your boss before you use it, 'cause he'll be dead before I hit the ground.<eos> Don't be a damn fool, Joe.<eos> Go over there where he can see you.<eos> I'll remember what you said, Mr. Thornton.<eos> You do that.<eos> Don't shoot no more, mister.<eos> Please.<eos> I won't.
He might not understand this arrangement.<eos> - I'm not sure I do.<eos> - I don't like this.<eos> - I didn't think you'd be crazy about it.<eos> Humor me.<eos> I just want to keep up appearances for a while.<eos> - Nothing to get sulky about.<eos> - You can't move me around like furniture.<eos> I might not come back.<eos> Sure you will, Frank.
A typical passive indolence of indolent people.<eos> Ah, I can't believe it's all true!<eos> How long can we stand it?<eos> How long, beyond faith and hope, can we stand it?<eos> Until when, beyond patience and love, can we stand it?<eos> Until when, oblivious to fear, beyond childhood and adolescence, can we stand it...<eos> What does your death prove?<eos> The triumph of beauty and justice!<eos> They will learn!<eos> They will!
See, she won´t listen to me.<eos> Why doesn´t her father talk with her?<eos> We´re divorced.<eos> He doesn´t... lt´s not wrong to...<eos> When your marriage breaks up, life doesn´t end, does it?<eos> Please talk to her, Sir.<eos> I´m frightened for her.<eos> You never know what sort of trouble she can get into.<eos> Please.<eos> All right, I will.
well, people change.<eos> - They don't always turn out the way you hope.<eos> - Oh, I know. You should see my baby pictures.<eos> Tell me something. What insurance company handles your jewelry?<eos> Acme.<eos> This Kosterman goes big.<eos> We're carrying close to 400,000 on his wife's jewelry, 100,000 on his daughter's.<eos> You got an up-to-date list of all the job jewelers in Miami?<eos> Uh, look, Tony, if there's anything hickey here, I'd like to know about it.<eos> You will.
- Then I borrow you. - There you are. Francoise will borrow you.<eos> - Do you mind eating caviar?<eos> - Do you like galas?<eos> Please, could you ring for the butler?<eos> The only thing wrong with this part of the world... is there's not much of a sunset.<eos> How can a week pass so quickly?<eos> We made the mistake of enjoying ourselves.<eos> Don't go tomorrow. Just don't.<eos> Let's not talk about it. Let's not.<eos> All right, we won't.
- Vodka and tonic.<eos> - Same for me.<eos> Make it two.<eos> Neely, I have some good news.<eos> You're following Tony Polar in the club here.<eos> - Oh, Lyon!<eos> - Neely, how wonderful.<eos> You'll have to build an act fast, because I exaggerated a bit.<eos> - I told Frank you already had one.<eos> - I will. I will.
They wait until them Indians is all finished, then they come back, and bring me here.<eos> Here you go, Dutchy.<eos> Thanks, Will.<eos> Least I can do after you killed all them Indians.<eos> Are you one of the men, his friends, who left him to the savages?<eos> - We surely did.<eos> - You call yourself a man?<eos> You call yourself his friend and then you do this to him.<eos> If I were you, I'd never speak... I would never speak to them again.<eos> Maybe I won't.
Well, I do not know if I can arrange it, but I will speak to him.<eos> This is your last chance.<eos> Use it.<eos> Too many more shocks, and you'll be here forever.<eos> Well.<eos> What seems to be the trouble, Mr Kroll?<eos> I...<eos> I don't want the machine.<eos> But you won't talk to us.<eos> I will.
I wanted you.<eos> Dr Cherlotov is being released in about 15 minutes.<eos> We can't wait until morning now.<eos> The border closes at midnight.<eos> Can you pick him up at the prison?<eos> Yes.<eos> You take Karen to his laboratory.<eos> Make sure she waits for him.<eos> - Did you get the passports?<eos> - No, not yet, but I will.
He went to her hotel several times.<eos> Then there was the villa, of course.<eos> Let me show you just how loyal your dear husband is to you.<eos> They look quite at home together.<eos> Would you like to know the date, the place?<eos> Look.<eos> I've wasted enough time.<eos> You shouldn't have interfered.<eos> You'll pay for this.<eos> You will.
- It's not the same.<eos> - The same?<eos> You've changed things.<eos> Little things.<eos> This rubbish...it's not mine.<eos> This should be gilt, not silver.<eos> Don't try that line with Number Six.<eos> He has a strong sense of territory.<eos> - He won't be shaken on possessions.<eos> - No, he won't.
You have experience.<eos> I'll have you removing bullets.<eos> Can we manage?<eos> We have to!<eos> A handful of Japanese soldiers are pitted against all of China.<eos> It's no easy war.<eos> The wounded will increase we're badly undermanned here.<eos> You'll have to work twice as hard. If not, good men will die.<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> We will, sir!
How is Abdo?<eos> Abdo is at the Chores<eos> - What?<eos> Why did they take him for?<eos> - For nothing, I looking for him<eos> They don't know what to do anymore, don't worry.<eos> The situation will change soon<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I didn't understand<eos> You will
At Mrs. Hind's inn<eos> Quickly, hide the bags<eos> Quickly Abou Ragheb.<eos> Let your muleteers take the mountain road<eos> It seems we were under surveillance<eos> God be with you!<eos> We are going.<eos> Do you want anything else?<eos> Don't forget the sesame cookies at the next delivery!<eos> We won't
Freedom.<eos> A feeling of being alive.<eos> But what can I do?<eos> So?<eos> I seek thrills.<eos> There are lots of tourists in Paris and I am all alone.<eos> I'd like to be in Étretat.<eos> I don't want to be alone.<eos> No, no, I don't want to.<eos> No, I won't.
I've been looking for you.<eos> The Rag Committee asked me to deliver these. - Thank you.<eos> - You will come I hope?<eos> Tomorrow night.<eos> It's going to be quite mad, a rave.<eos> Anything can happen and probably will. Great fun.<eos> They certainly do, don't they?<eos> Bury and forget.<eos> - Anything can happen.<eos> - And probably will.
Yeah, honey, but she put her finger on the entries at Aqueduct.<eos> On a horse in the first race named Princess Jennie.<eos> Darrin, you're not gonna start that again.<eos> Well, as long as it was yesterday's paper, let's just take a look and see.<eos> First race at Aqueduct was won by Dirty Arnold beating Princess Jennie in a photo finish.<eos> - There, you see?<eos> - I see.<eos> Unless Princess Jennie didn't win because she didn't have a bet on it.<eos> Darrin, will you please...?<eos> Will you please...?
Abbot Liao Kung is here, sir<eos> Second Master wants you to greet him<eos> Keep an eye on him<eos> Don't let him out of your sight<eos> I understand<eos> Don't move!<eos> It's hot.<eos> Can I borrow a fan?<eos> I said don't move!<eos> I won't
The pay is better than in journalism and to tell the truth it's more serious.<eos> - They tried with you too?<eos> - Yes, but I couldn't do that to you.<eos> - Thank you, Paulo. - Don't be stupid. It's a normal thing.<eos> Why are you bringing these gentlemen?<eos> To spare the cost of a funeral wreath.<eos> I'll leave you one while I take care of Mario.<eos> Maybe afterwards you won't need my gentlemen.<eos> - And you know where Mario is?<eos> - Tonight I will.
Bronsky is a scoundrel.<eos> What time is it?<eos> 6:25.<eos> At 7, you'll be free... maybe earlier.<eos> Do you still love Paulo?<eos> Don't talk about that!<eos> I want to tell you once again. I love you.<eos> I want you to be happy.<eos> I know. But you're not going to die.<eos> I will.
- Ready to move at short notice?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But I must have approval of the details of your plan.<eos> - That's our business.<eos> - It's our money.<eos> Meet me here tomorrow, same time, up on the roof.<eos> We've got what we wanted.<eos> The operation has begun.<eos> - Begun? My client hasn't approved.<eos> - He will.
How can you not want to hold her and take care of her?<eos> God.<eos> The embarrassment.<eos> Okay.<eos> If you're so keen on this bloody thing, then you have it.<eos> Free. Gratis and for nothing.<eos> With none of the attendant pain or discomfort.<eos> Instant families!<eos> Yes, all right.<eos> I will.
- No, it isn't.<eos> I do care.<eos> More than I can talk about.<eos> But that isn't getting us anywhere, is it?<eos> I want you back, Pat.<eos> I'm gonna be driving again soon.<eos> - I need you with me.<eos> - No, no.<eos> I've told you, Scott, I can't do it. I can't live like that.<eos> I won't.
Put your hand down.<eos> Relax.<eos> Aren't you ashamed?<eos> Answer him!<eos> You refuse?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Are you crying?<eos> Are you unhappy?<eos> Come on, smile.<eos> You won't, huh?
Clay, while you were away...<eos> Darling, let's not look back.<eos> Let's take it from here, huh?<eos> All right.<eos> I've missed you so.<eos> I've been so lost lately.<eos> I needed to see you, to be close to you again.<eos> I guess I needed to feel needed.<eos> Don't you ever doubt that you're needed.<eos> I never will again.
Are you gonna stay in here?<eos> For a while.<eos> Mommy, what's die?<eos> To die is to go away.<eos> To go away where?<eos> To another life.<eos> Would you be there?<eos> Some day.<eos> I don't want to die before I wake unless you're there.<eos> But you won't.
- Aye, but for the King?<eos> What about my secretary, Master Cromwell?<eos> Cromwell.<eos> He's a very able man.<eos> But?<eos> Me rather than Cromwell.<eos> Then, come down to earth.<eos> Until you do... you and I are enemies.<eos> As Your Grace wishes.<eos> As God wills.
Somehow I thought it would be nice if it was of some use to you.<eos> But it's terrible, isn't it?<eos> Sheer exhibitionism.<eos> Elisabet, I want you to forgive me.<eos> I like you so much, you mean so much to me.<eos> I've learned so much from you, I don't want to part as enemies.<eos> You don't want to forgive me.<eos> You're too proud!<eos> You won't lower yourself because you don't need to!<eos> I won't, I won't...!
the day will come... ..when you'll not have to ride in the dust of others,... ..when everyone will know who you are."<eos> "There'll not be a train or a village robbed that people will not say... ..'The one who robbed from us was el bandido Luis Emilio Delgado."'<eos> And just when I was about to amount to something, this had to happen.<eos> What will people think of me when they find out I was shot for killing one man?<eos> One stinking little man.<eos> I have killed a dozen in a single day.<eos> More!<eos> there is no justice.N<eos> - What if they don't find out?<eos> - But they will.N
How kind of you to come all this way.<eos> As you Americans say, the wild horses could not keep me away.<eos> - This is General Peterson.<eos> - How do you do?<eos> - Monsieur.<eos> - And this is Major Anthony Nelson...<eos> - Monsieur.<eos> - ... alias, Rembrandt.<eos> But if this is a joke, I do not understand it.<eos> Oh, you will, Monsieur Millay. You will.
I don't think I can make dinner, either.<eos> There's someone important arriving in town and I have to show this person around.<eos> "This person"?<eos> Jeannie, let's get it out in the open.<eos> Now, this - This person I'm gonna show around is a girl.<eos> A very pretty girl.<eos> A princess.<eos> This is official business.<eos> I don't want you to get jealous and cause trouble.<eos> Oh, of course I will not, master.
You give yourself up, Holman.<eos> You've been a Jonah since the day you come aboard.<eos> Captain!<eos> Looks like nationalist soldiers this time.<eos> Repel boarders.<eos> Get Holman up to the flying bridge.<eos> Underjust and equal law of nations, we demand you give up murderer Holman to people's justice.<eos> Under the just law of nations, you people are pirates.<eos> I will not parley with you.<eos> We will!
You will take your seats one minute after the house lights go down.<eos> At first intermission, you'll be taken through the pass door backstage by the baggage master of the company.<eos> He will know you, because he has your seat numbers.<eos> Well, is he one of your men?<eos> No, but he wants to defect, too, so we're going to give him a little help.<eos> Here it is.<eos> You'll recognize him.<eos> He has red hair which is not his own, and his name is Hugo, but don't give him that money until after you've landed.<eos> Listen, if we don't get a chance to see you again...<eos> You won't, mister.
You're talking about changes that were brought about by man himself.<eos> But Zontar isn't human, so your argument just doesn't hold water.<eos> Incidentally, revolutions, plagues and wars have also resulted in a number of regressions.<eos> What about the Dark Ages?<eos> No. No, you're not very convincing.<eos> You'll be convinced, Curt.<eos> He wants you on his side.<eos> And you actually think that I'd condone this reign of terror?<eos> That I'll swear allegiance to this Zontar?<eos> Well, I won't.
It's all right now.<eos> Just take it easy.<eos> I remembered.<eos> But it's true.<eos> There will be a reception at our house tonight.<eos> Gustavo will sign the bill for the construction of the new Centre of Culture.<eos> It's a project which my mother has sponsored.<eos> - But I will denounce Gustavo.<eos> - But they'll never believe you.<eos> David, they will.
I don't know, Dan.<eos> I'm the best, but the day he makes a televised speech...<eos> We can't wait.<eos> Can you pull it off if Barney tampers with the TV camera and microphone so you don't have to make the speech?<eos> Yes.<eos> Barney, can you wire all that in one day?<eos> Plus rig a fireworks display right in front of the hotel?<eos> Dominguez's headquarter?<eos> Well, not unless I had all day to crawl around undisturbed.<eos> You will.
You can't.<eos> I'll activate the force field.<eos> Return to your section.<eos> He had a mean look.<eos> I had to freeze him. I like happy looks.<eos> Aren't you coming in?<eos> That wasn't nice.<eos> You'll be sorry.<eos> You wait, you'll be sorry you did that.<eos> You will.
Take another step, you'll die.<eos> Then we'll both die.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't want to...<eos> Don't make me.<eos> Don't make me.<eos> I want to go back.<eos> Please.<eos> - l want to live!<eos> - You will.
- What's your first name?<eos> - Jeannie.<eos> Jeannie. Well, I'm certainly glad to meet you, Jeannie.<eos> How do you feel now?<eos> I never felt better in my life.<eos> I owe Aunt Pauline a big favour.<eos> Excuse me, please.<eos> - Don't go away.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I will not.
Two.<eos> Three.<eos> Four.<eos> Five.<eos> Yes, I think she'll sleep for about forty-eight hours and when she wakes I want absolute peace and quiet for her, d'you understand?<eos> - Are you sure she's alright? - Oh yes, she's alright.<eos> She can go down to my house in the country.<eos> My wife will look after her.<eos> Yes, it's a very fine thing. - Yes, and take care of her won't you!<eos> - Indeed I will.
I completely forgot to give you this.<eos> Your husband brought it from Japan.<eos> This pill will make you get pregnant.<eos> - Take it now.<eos> - I can take it later.<eos> You don't understand how much I want to see my grandchild.<eos> Take it, will you?<eos> - Mother...<eos> - Take it, please.<eos> - Okay, I will.
Split four ways, you know.<eos> It's still 10 million each.<eos> I've got my eye on an Aberdeen Angus.<eos> I've always wanted to cross one with my Holstein Friesian.<eos> You'll be able to cross an Aberdeen Angus with a cottage loaf.<eos> Aye, and have plenty left over for scrumpy.<eos> More than you'll ever be able to drink.<eos> Fair enough, then.<eos> - And if they don't pay up?<eos> - Oh, they will.
I don't want to see your cock anywhere near me.<eos> Why would I want my cock anywhere near you? Why would you want to be involved in a threesome with me?<eos> this client doesn't. that client, the new client.<eos> Do you want to do this? ! No.<eos> But I will. For you.<eos> Anything for you, my love.<eos> Well...<eos> Yes?<eos> Here you go. Make shit happen.<eos> Oh, I will.
Do you know what a will is, old chap?<eos> Money.<eos> No, Yuri, just this.<eos> Your daddy has all the money.<eos> Can you play it?<eos> I thought all the people in this part of the world could play the balalaika.<eos> You don't live here, do you?<eos> No, we live in Moscow.<eos> That's a long way from here, but you will like Moscow.<eos> - Won't he?
But this time, I forgive you.<eos> Madam, I appreciate your kindness and let me place this trifle upon your wrist.<eos> I agree, Sir, if you promise to leave immediately.<eos> You have my assurance, Madame.<eos> This is the spy, Sir.<eos> Hang him!<eos> My lord, I'm just a poor farmer who wants to go home.<eos> You're a spy from Allenberg.<eos> I don't want to be hanged!<eos> He will not ...

So he was.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> - So he was.<eos> - You realize I'll have to report that?<eos> - Let's hope you do.<eos> - If it's true.<eos> - You know it's true.<eos> Yes, Harris, but would you tell the Commandant that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will. I will.
You won't even tell the girl?<eos> If she can trust you with her love, if they can trust you with their faith why can't you trust them with the truth?<eos> Did you take a look at them out there?<eos> A good look? Do you know what they felt?<eos> What I feel right now?<eos> The trust in their eyes means more...<eos> You think I want to see in their eyes what I see in yours?<eos> I earned their respect, and you want me to...<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't.
Mr. Potts, you take Riago and pick up his trail.<eos> I want that man back.<eos> It ain't my job, Major.<eos> I didn't sign on to go chasing after no homesick soldier boys.<eos> It's mine.<eos> All right, Sergeant, you find him.<eos> Beg your pardon, sir... but what'll they do to Pvt. Hadley when they catch him?<eos> What?<eos> Son, it'd be our good luck if he killed him.<eos> But he won't and the Major will.
Take your stations.<eos> Everybody.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Tell all the officers to assemble in the salon at once.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> The point we spoke about. It's here, and I need you as a witness.<eos> Now, go on.<eos> Things are falling apart.<eos> Keil can't do it.<eos> I will.
I do.<eos> She...<eos> She has made up her mind to kill me.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's say she has.<eos> You walked into this.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> You asked me before if you would ever see your children again.<eos> I'll tell you the truth.<eos> You won't.
You sneer at us, because you're in a chapel! But come join us out in the graveyard.<eos> At your service. But tomorrow!<eos> I can see you're nervous, my son.<eos> And it's not surprising.<eos> Last night, wicked spirits were up to terrible mischief.<eos> The goats were bleating.<eos> Devils may assume various forms, my son.<eos> They somehow stay away from me, Father.<eos> I can see you still have faith, but I 'm worried you won't be able to keep it.<eos> I will, I will.
You pretend to be an engineer, so he doesn't hit you.<eos> You're scared of that twat?<eos> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Fight.<eos> No smoking on the premises.<eos> - Well, well.<eos> - Well what?<eos> Good boxer.<eos> We'll take care of it.<eos> So invite her, she's over there.<eos> We will, just like that.
Well, of course.<eos> I'll take you in to see him in a minute.<eos> He's been in his study all day. How do you do?<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> It's quite all right.<eos> Please, will you come with me?<eos> There's something I'd like to show you.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> It's, uh, it's a good likeness, if anybody would want such a thing.<eos> I-I'm sure someone will, Ben.
We can have a nice drink. I'd like to do it in private because I may have to scream and throw things.<eos> - I feel we should be alone for that.<eos> - Oh, a sense of humour. Michael!<eos> I've been looking all over for you! You're the only one that can help me.<eos> - Our Father...<eos> - Who is that woman?<eos> Never mind who I am, but you're in great danger.<eos> Never mind?<eos> I demand an explanation! - Don't lose your temper!<eos> - I will...
We shall leave at once, Sire.<eos> Meantime, I'll wrestle with the problem of this war.<eos> There is something important, Sire.<eos> If you are able to defeat Saladin in this battle, can you hold the city, hmmm?<eos> Win the battle, lose the war.<eos> The greatest fear we have.<eos> We've come so close.<eos> I must see Jerusalem. I must.<eos> - I must.<eos> - You will, Sire.
Yes, as one of the Daughters of the Gods!<eos> Dalek Supreme<eos> You have failed to get back the Core of the Time Destructor.<eos> We shall get it back.<eos> You show too much trust in Mavic Chen.<eos> Mavic Chen is hungry for power.<eos> We have offered him more power than he has ever thought of.<eos> He will return to us the Taranium Core.<eos> Supposing he fails?<eos> He will not.
What about me?<eos> - You can find somebody to replace me.<eos> - Oh, sure, just like that, huh?<eos> Well, maybe not that easy.<eos> You think not?<eos> Well, let me tell you that no one is indispensable.<eos> - That's what I said.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Well, don't you ever forget it, either.<eos> - I won't, Larry.
- Let's hide in there.<eos> It's too narrow, and we've eaten so much.<eos> That's all because of you!<eos> - There they are!<eos> - Hold it!<eos> Why were you in your way to Daot?<eos> To pay him a visit!<eos> He's our grandfather!<eos> - I won't tell you the truth!<eos> - You won't?
Anybody there?<eos> No, nobody.<eos> I had no doubt that you'd be my ally.<eos> Certainly, my dear Etik.<eos> Well, to our success.<eos> To success and trust.<eos> To trust.<eos> Give me the key, then.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> Yes, you will!

Science without conscience is the soul's perdition.<eos> How did you handle it? Classically.<eos> Introduction:<eos> Christianity versus atheism.<eos> Science that's not integrated into the soul...<eos> Disintegrates the body.<eos> Bravo, 29 on 30.<eos> We have to go.<eos> What if he doesn't like my face?<eos> -He will.
We haven't had a martyr in the family since the Salem trials.<eos> What did you do to what's-his-name, besides bruise his ego a bit?<eos> - Isn't that enough?<eos> - Nonsense.<eos> It isn't nonsense.<eos> He thought my ideas were witchcraft.<eos> - Well, weren't they?<eos> - No!<eos> But he doesn't believe me.<eos> He never will.
- Your ideas were no good.<eos> - I don't think that's very nice.<eos> I'm don't mean that your ideas are no good or that you don't have...<eos> You know.<eos> - I know what you mean, I understand.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The only thing that's important is that I love you.<eos> And I love you.<eos> It seems ridiculous that a can of soup could ever come between us.<eos> Nothing ever will again.
And I want him to like my mother.<eos> What sort of mother do you think he'd prefer?<eos> Lavender and old lace?<eos> Pioneer stock, perhaps?<eos> Old World?<eos> New World?<eos> Well, I suppose I might as well get it over with.<eos> Yes, I'll come.<eos> And I prefer the natural you.<eos> And so will Darrin.
- Knew I'd what?<eos> - Help him with his baseball.<eos> - Not if his mother doesn't...<eos> - But, Darrin...<eos> Samantha, he's not our son.<eos> Well, if we ever do have a son and I get the silly notion baseball is dangerous I certainly hope someone will see to it that your son doesn't miss the Junior League tryouts tomorrow afternoon.<eos> I am playing golf tomorrow afternoon.<eos> I'm not.<eos> - Samantha, will you please...<eos> - Yes, I will.
My loyalties are to the king, his daughter and his ship.<eos> That sounds very honourable but how does that fit in with your arrangements with Mansuh?<eos> As long as he looks for the bell, the ship and girl are safe.<eos> I see.<eos> - And what are your plans for me?<eos> - King Harald must decide.<eos> So until he finds us, we fight the same battle?<eos> We do.<eos> That is, of course, if he ever does find us.<eos> He will.
After all these years, he could remember such things.<eos> No, to Major Pike, it's as if the last six years never existed.<eos> - When are we gonna get to that?<eos> - Tomorrow.<eos> Start with Lisbon, bring you right up to date.<eos> See you then.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, thanks, Walt.<eos> Well, Herr Schack, I'm sorry I don't remember you yet.<eos> Oh, you will. You will.
Let's ask Shashanka to sing it.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Surely somebody else.<eos> Joydev, let's have the song now.<eos> What's on your mind,<eos> Mr. Dreamer?<eos> England?<eos> Why should a great man like Roy have to die in England?<eos> Thousands of miles away, in Bristol? So few Bengalis can see his grave there.<eos> But you will.
We had been defeated at Razo de Catarina.<eos> I carried Lampião on my back.<eos> Ezequiel!<eos> Levino!<eos> Antonio!<eos> All your brothers are dead, Lampião.<eos> Of your race, you alone are still alive.<eos> The souls of your friends are wandering alone.<eos> I broke everything and nothing has appeared.<eos> Nor ever will!
Enough.<eos> Stop everything.<eos> Are you listening?<eos> Idiot.<eos> And you, drive faster.<eos> Now's not the time to slow down, stupid.<eos> Run after me, stupid!<eos> All that, for what?<eos> Because you believe you'll stop me?<eos> Nobody will.
Under no circumstances will I permit such a thing.<eos> There is no precedent.<eos> Don't use long words, inspector. They don't suit you.<eos> If you don't wish to be of assistance, that's your affair. I'll go higher up. - Higher up?<eos> - I presume that even you acknowledge the existence of a superior.<eos> - The foreign secretary, for example.<eos> - I would like to point out...<eos> - A friend of my brother.<eos> But don't bother about it, inspector. I'll go and see him myself.<eos> - It will not...
"I am a thief and a hypocrite<eos> "and I beg forgiveness<eos> "for all the filth I've burdened you with<eos> "in this dirtiest of towns<eos> "on the dirty face of the earth. "<eos> Say it.<eos> Matt!<eos> Matt Weaver!<eos> - Don't move, doc.<eos> - I won't.
- You name the day!<eos> I have witnesses this time!<eos> Let's see your witnesses!<eos> Joseph! He cut my branches.<eos> You saw it, no?<eos> You agree?<eos> Perfect!<eos> A servant! Servants don't count.<eos> We'll see about that, you scoundrel!<eos> Oh, no, we won't!
They're meeting behind the dairy at 12:00.<eos> Now you're running amok.<eos> You can't go around suspecting everybody.<eos> Sometimes I'm not even so sure about you.<eos> Me?<eos> I'm scared, Barney.<eos> I'll tell you, I'm scared.<eos> I'm married to the prettiest girl in town... and she's gonna leave me one of these days.<eos> I just know it.<eos> - She will?
Roger, I thought I told you to go away.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Why?<eos> I must have left the boat untied.<eos> It's gone.<eos> Well, that's just like you.<eos> And I can't swim either, remember.<eos> I... suppose you'll just have to stay then.<eos> But just don't talk to me.<eos> All right, I won't.
We're ghosts of our former selves.<eos> Only Mitsuko remains healthy.<eos> It makes me wonder.<eos> Perhaps it's wiser to leave her.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Yes, let's!<eos> No!<eos> You're only saying that to get her for yourself.<eos> I'd rather die!<eos> In that case, neither will I.
How innocent you are.<eos> However, I am disposed to temper justice with mercy.<eos> So I will leave it up to you, Francesca.<eos> One must die.<eos> Which one?<eos> One is my father.<eos> The other, the man I love.<eos> You promised me entertainment... but I never hoped for this.<eos> Can such eyes ever have known sin?<eos> They will, Alfredo.

- He said you needed rest.<eos> Nothing else?<eos> - No, why?<eos> - You know why.<eos> What he said only confirms what I've known all along.<eos> There's nothing wrong with you.<eos> You won't let them take me away, will you?<eos> - Take you away?<eos> What on earth for?<eos> - You won't?
I was wrong!<eos> I was wrong to meddle!<eos> Take it off!<eos> You became a demon!<eos> Stay that way!<eos> Please take it off for me! I'm asking you!<eos> All right, but will you do everything I say?<eos> I will! I will! I will!<eos> Exactly as I say?<eos> Yes! Yes! Yes, I will!
I guess I'll do that.<eos> Goodbye, Odile.<eos> - Goodbye, Pierre.<eos> -Another token, please. - One more?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - l'm going out.<eos> - Will you lunch here?<eos> - No, I won't.
About hundred american dollars a piece.<eos> - And we will share?<eos> - Just like brothers.<eos> We will drink to it, amigo.<eos> Amigo, who would have thought the night we got out of jail... that we would be here like... a rich man, heh?<eos> But I knew.<eos> You remember, the time with a rope almost around my neck<eos> I said that my luck had changed<eos> We donn't have the money yet.<eos> But we will. Tomorrow or the day after.
- Sweeten your tongue, at least."<eos> Later!<eos> Raghu!<eos> Look at this...<eos> Sunder isn't here.<eos> "He knows, doesn't he?"<eos> Of course.<eos> He's been telling everyone.<eos> Why hasn't he come then?<eos> He will.
Well, he takes it for granted.<eos> But, Edgar... as far back as I can remember... in grammar school, in Mrs. Pritchard's class... you know, when I sat in front of you?<eos> I wished that I had had long pigtails so you could stick them in the inkwell.<eos> Did you really?<eos> I'm not gonna marry Leonard Crawley.<eos> Of course, he'll never understand anyone turning him down.<eos> Especially for you.<eos> You... You mean you'd take this... instead of all that?<eos> But, Louisa, I've got... nothing.<eos> I'll...
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT, I WANT TO TALK TO HER.<eos> ...DAVID.<eos> I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.<eos> DADDY?<eos> OH, DEAR, I THOUGHT THAT WAS ALL ENDED.<eos> IT IS, MOTHER, I DIDN'T...<eos> ANNE.<eos> NOW, ANNE, YOU KEEP AWAY FROM HIM.<eos> (men arguing)<eos> I WILL, MOTHER.
There is an improvement.<eos> Except for one serious case, all Daleks in section 2 have shown signs of recovery.<eos> Then our position is clear.<eos> For us, the drug is a poison.<eos> And radiation is still necessary to us.<eos> Essential.<eos> I want a complete survey of our stock of nuclear materials.<eos> I want an estimate of the amount of waste matter from the nuclear reactors.<eos> -We'll never get through.<eos> -Yes, we will.
More than anything, I want to see things grow again.<eos> I want to be a part of it.<eos> It's a nice idea.<eos> Do you come from the country?<eos> Yes, my family have always been associated with land.<eos> - Where do they live?<eos> - They live a long way from here.<eos> Well, I can't stand talking here all day.<eos> See me before you go, David.<eos> I will, Tyler.
Don't lie!<eos> Earth is gone.<eos> Earth never existed!<eos> Michael!<eos> Halt, Michael!<eos> Michael!<eos> I'll get to him.<eos> - Through the air shafts.<eos> Will it work?<eos> - It will. - But...
Do you know what I hate the most?<eos> Those who use others as if they were mere tools.<eos> I see.<eos> - You're much more than I feared. Much more dangerous.<eos> Do with me as you will.<eos> - Do as I will?<eos> Now, it's time for seduction, eh?<eos> - Kyoshiro-sama...<eos> - Didn't you say that you'd never sell your body?<eos> - I will not.
No, I won't listen.<eos> Sneeze, and the roof blows off blow your nose and the house caves in.<eos> What do they want from me...<eos> Elizabeth, speak to them!<eos> Tell her, Elizabeth you are giving us this chicken house.<eos> That's the solution!<eos> I know what we will do!<eos> We'll give you enough money you can buy a chicken house on the surrounding land.<eos> I'm sure Andre will agree...<eos> Won't he, Elizabeth?
Go and look for Dorbeck.<eos> He knows everything.<eos> I admit it.<eos> I'm nothing without Dorbeck.<eos> Dorbeck knows everything.<eos> Dorbeck, come out of there.<eos> He's here?<eos> Is he being kept a prisoner here too?<eos> I'll find him.<eos> Oh yes, I will.
Everyone knew it.<eos> Everyone, except us.<eos> It's a crying shame.<eos> You're in the register of debtors.<eos> They are going to seize our furniture.<eos> Till last night, he lied to me.<eos> He was talking about inflation, grapefruits.<eos> I said nothing because I didn't want you to worry.<eos> I hoped I could solve it before you...<eos> And I will!
But I don't care about them.<eos> I get rid of them easily!<eos> I can't live without talking freely.<eos> I would do anything to make you happy.<eos> I said anything!<eos> And what do I ask in return?<eos> Just your love.<eos> You should never doubt my love for you.<eos> But I want to be sure you will love me forever.<eos> Sure. I will.
Matt, I think we'd better be moving along now.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't want to go just yet, Father.<eos> Not yet.<eos> I'd Iike to stay here for a bit with you... and get it clearer, if you have no objections.<eos> No, I have no objections.<eos> please stay.<eos> Matt, I've never ordered you... to do anything in your whole life, have I?<eos> But I'm asking you now to come home with me.<eos> will you?
Leave the boy alone.<eos> He's not like the men who come to your house.<eos> This boy is a saint.<eos> Only respectable and important people come to my house!<eos> That one who's ringing now, do you know who he is? The son ofthe Labor Minister Rusconi!<eos> A fine thing. Members ofcongress come to my house too!<eos> Imagine that.<eos> Even Tommasi, the pasta producer.<eos> I see you eat Tommasi pasta.<eos> I won't anymore.
Calm down, we'll fix it.<eos> It's too late.<eos> He's put brilliantine in his hair.<eos> He took his cassock off.<eos> It's time to put an end to this.<eos> Where's the window?<eos> Calm down. - Mr. Rusconi.<eos> - Pleased to meet you. Don't you know? Umberto studied all the time.<eos> He even read at night. You know he could have become Pope?<eos> He will, he will.
They live in a big place by the sea.<eos> Their dwellings are made of wood and stone and are fastened to the ground.<eos> They have built a tall mound of earth.<eos> That mound will guide us to where we will avenge our chief.<eos> -How is Black Eagle?<eos> -With me, as violent as ever.<eos> Only Ixchel can touch him.<eos> You look tired, Ixchel.<eos> -Because of you I understand he will live.<eos> -I will.
Who'll come?<eos> - Me! Me!<eos> But those sticks, they're made of wood. Don't be so silly.<eos> Frightened?<eos> Of course I am.<eos> Who wouldn't be?<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Who'll mind the little ones?<eos> - Piggy will.
[ Chicken Clucks ] -For 15 years I've searched for a formula... to stabilize nuclear power.<eos> -You mean, you've found it?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -How ?<eos> -Here.<eos> -Not before breakfast, professor.<eos> -No, no. This is the stabilizing factor.<eos> This, our mysterious,explosive and stable wine of Grand Fenwick.<eos> -I don't believe it.<eos> -Oh, you will.
Hello ?<eos> The Americans will never forgive us for this. You realize that, hmm ?<eos> Never !<eos> Hello !<eos> Why does he have to choose this unearthly hour ?<eos> 8:00 in the morning !<eos> Hello ? Are you there, you moonstruck monsters ? No good.<eos> Not a sigh.<eos> -You ask me they'll never come back.<eos> [ Prof. Kokintz ] Oh yes we will.
- We need the money for the flat.<eos> - I don't want to go back to typing.<eos> - I can't accept that.<eos> Well, obviously you do despise me.<eos> I kissed Prokosch, yet you still dither over doing the script.<eos> I turned down the job so you'd change your mind about me.<eos> Don't touch me. I don't love you anymore.<eos> I can never love you again.<eos> Even if I turn it down, you'll despise me?<eos> - Yes, I will.
He should be here in... I'd say half an hour.<eos> Who?<eos> Who? I'd like to know who.<eos> I told you, Archimedes.<eos> I am not sure. All I know is that someone will be coming. Someone very important.<eos> Pin feathers.<eos> Fate will direct him to me so that I in turn may guide him to his rightful place in the world.<eos> And you say he will arrive in half an hour?<eos> Well, we'll just see.<eos> And you will, Archimedes, you will.
- No, they're wrong.<eos> And I'll show them just how wrong.<eos> We better leave now.<eos> He needs rest.<eos> James, I'll order the bandages removed tomorrow.<eos> Bandages?<eos> Yes. I hardly noticed them.<eos> Hardly noticed them at all.<eos> - You'll get your chance again, James.<eos> - Yes, I will.
It's still going on, what... what is... oh...<eos> Harmon, what's going on with you?<eos> Leave him go.<eos> I want him to go to bed.<eos> Go to bed, harmon. Raymond, you tell me what's happening to him.<eos> Quiet, leave him alone!<eos> What is it?<eos> Sit down, flora.<eos> But i want to see him.<eos> You will.
Sorry I can only pay you in food.<eos> We're out of work anyway.<eos> Besides, if you paid us, we'd owe you if we didn't hit coal.<eos> You definitely leaving in the morning?<eos> Catching the first bus.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> The boardinghouse in town.<eos> Something'll work out.<eos> The old hick hasn't caught on to us yet.<eos> But he will.
- Well, bye then.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Quiet.<eos> Are you here for long?<eos> - 18 days.<eos> - Keep on sweeping.<eos> - Not days, shifts.<eos> - lt's the same.<eos> - Come see me.<eos> - l will.
They've just brought flippers and masks.<eos> They'll sell them now.<eos> Why do we need them?<eos> Have you read the book?<eos> Have you seen the film?<eos> "ln the world of silence"?<eos> - l have.<eos> - Go buy them.<eos> - l won't be able to get them.<eos> - Of course you will.
- Take them.<eos> - On the second floor?<eos> - l don't need them either.<eos> - What?<eos> - l don't need them.<eos> - Why were you in the line then?<eos> - Everybody was.<eos> - l'll take them back!<eos> - That's good.<eos> - l will!
The pores should be larger.<eos> And he needs a little more hair, thicker.<eos> He needs a 1/8 inch mole behind the lobe of the left ear.<eos> Report back to duplication immediately and have the corrections made.<eos> You can still alter your decision if this is against your circuits.<eos> My circuits are unoffended.<eos> I suppose it takes courage to submit to a thalamic transplant.<eos> As an unadapted R-34, he has no fear circuits.<eos> Consequently, he doesn't need courage.<eos> He will before long.
Do you hear me?<eos> Father, I love you.<eos> You who are in the netherworld.<eos> I have offered you my hair.<eos> I have sacrificed it to you.<eos> Look at my fingernails.<eos> I scratch my cheeks.<eos> I was certain I would find you here.<eos> Are you waiting for your brother the courageous Orestes, to come in defense of his father's tomb?<eos> -He will.

Aren'tyou a brave soldier!<eos> Some brave commander!<eos> I'm only afraid of spiders.<eos> Nothing else?<eos> Vassiliev!<eos> Have you seen Captain Kholin?<eos> He went that way with the doctor's assistant.<eos> Walk the trunk!<eos> You said you're not afraid of anything.<eos> Well, I will.
Sigurd!<eos> Jack.<eos> Jack!<eos> Sigurd, come here, quick!<eos> Your imp stands between me and the throne of Cornwall.<eos> Where is he?<eos> You have great magic powers.<eos> Find him yourself.<eos> Yes.<eos> I will.
Just for a while.<eos> Come on.<eos> I won't hurt you.<eos> You still have your protection.<eos> Come.<eos> I guess I was tired.<eos> - I feel much better.<eos> - I knew you would.<eos> - Let's hope this will work.<eos> - It will.
- You've taught her so much this week.<eos> - Not enough.<eos> Obedience isn't enough.<eos> Well... she learned two nouns this morning.<eos> Key and water.<eos> - But not...? - No.<eos> Not that they mean things.<eos> It's still a finger game to her.<eos> No meaning.<eos> But she will.
So he went to Captain Bligh and asked to be married.<eos> Well, I had seen Bligh every day for more than a year. And that was the only time I ever saw him laugh.<eos> Midshipmen.<eos> Be a dull navy without them.<eos> Now get that slut off my ship.<eos> He didn't have to put it to the boy like that.<eos> The old pig.<eos> His shadow don't fit his shape, not by a damn sight.<eos> Well, expect it to grow horns.<eos> You will, Quintal.
What do you mean?<eos> Just that... prove it. Take me down to the crypt and show me his body. I can't.<eos> Because you know it isn't true.<eos> - No! - Yes.<eos> Why else do you think you've avoided it?<eos> Because you're afraid... afraid that this fear... is nothing more than a trick of your mind.<eos> I'd give anything to find out if that were true.<eos> All right, then take me downstairs.<eos> All right.<eos> I will. No.
You'd have wept to see the way they turned out to pay tribute. Three of them.<eos> The mortician, the gravedigger and me.<eos> Well, when I'm buried, I won't much care who comes to the funeral.<eos> I was commenting on the fairest flower that grows within the human heart:<eos> The only gratitude I expect is my paycheck. Twenty dollars' worth.<eos> - That satisfies you?<eos> - Well, I guess that's all I can hope for.<eos> According to my contract, it is. come on, let's get moving.<eos> - He don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - He will, in time.
Yeah, well, we made a little bargain last night, remember?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Well, I will live up to my end of the bargain after I have put on my face.<eos> The face I face the world with, baby.<eos> Will you open the curtains, please?<eos> There something out there you're afraid of?<eos> Oh, no, ma'am.<eos> The thing I want most in the world is out there.<eos> This town belonged to me once.<eos> And will again.
- They'll never find you behind this wall.<eos> - You can't mean it. You can't mean it!<eos> Haven't I convinced you of my sincerity yet?<eos> I'm genuinely dedicated to your destruction.<eos> Help! Help!<eos> What kind of a man are you, anyway?<eos> Make love to my wife and doesn't even talk to me!<eos> It's an excellent jest, sir.<eos> We'll have many a good laugh about it in the future. I will.<eos> I will. God...
Oh, Mr Shayne.<eos> What a pleasant surprise.<eos> Erm, are you stopping at the same motel we are?<eos> Don't press your luck.<eos> Kiss his feet! Did you drive up with anyone?<eos> Yes, a plucked chicken.<eos> Oh. Maybe the four of us can get together later for a drink.<eos> Oh, honey. You're blowing the whole thing.<eos> - Hang up the phone.<eos> - I will not.
Gee, you're a terrific lawyer, Jerry.<eos> How come you're so bashful?<eos> - Didn't you understand one word I said?<eos> - Sure!<eos> As a juror I'd give me five years.<eos> - I'm not kidding.<eos> Need someone. - Let go!<eos> - Need someone. - Or what?<eos> Let me go or I'll yell.<eos> - No, you won't.
over.<eos> Gibraltar Red Easy.<eos> This is Snooper One.<eos> We have reached objective.<eos> Let's bug slowly.<eos> Black smoke. Grass burning everywhere.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Talk English.<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> will you?
I like you this way.<eos> Don't mess with that guy!<eos> So how are all those kids--<eos> The ones who ain't starved to death...<eos> What's your hero been saying about me?<eos> Did he tell you that a man kills?<eos> What about when peace comes?<eos> When the war ends?<eos> Raymond said maybe it not end.<eos> It will one day.
Don't leave me. I'm begging you.<eos> Your presence comforts me.<eos> If we get out of here, if I'm cured, I want to go to Lourdes with you.<eos> Promise me you'll go. You will, won't you?<eos> I promise.<eos> We'll prostrate ourselves at the feet of the Virgin, because she's the one who'll get us out of here.<eos> Don't talk too much.<eos> Don't excite yourself. It can do you serious harm.<eos> When we get to Lourdes, I want you to buy me one of those washable plastic Virgins.<eos> You will, won't you?
We'll leave you now<eos> AbdGod will explain your escape tomorrow<eos> I'll go to Cairo.. anything happens, we meet at my home<eos> Need anything else?<eos> Go to Abdel Moneim Sq. on Monday at 12<eos> Meet Nawal and tell her I'm okay<eos> Alright<eos> Don't call my dad before I travel<eos> - If I travel, that is<eos> - You will
Nothing's happened.<eos> For heaven's sake, I tell you it's nothing.<eos> Come pick me up, will you?<eos> And hurry.<eos> If you're meeting someone, there's a little hotel nearby.<eos> Why did you come out here?<eos> No reason. I just happened over this way.<eos> Come here.<eos> How strange. It hasn't changed at all.<eos> It will... very soon.
I guess, of course, I don't really know anybody but rats.<eos> Except, of course, Fred here.<eos> You do think Fred is nice, don't you, Sally?<eos> For you, I hope he is.<eos> Give me a kiss goodbye.<eos> Goodbye, Uncle Sally.<eos> Till next week.<eos> Goodbye, Uncle Sally.<eos> Goodbye and don't forget to send that book, eh?<eos> I won't.
- I promise, Rodrigo.<eos> Open the gates! It's the King!<eos> My lord, the King!<eos> Forgive me, my Cid.<eos> - Forgive me! - No!<eos> My King kneels to no man!<eos> It's not easy for a man to conquer himself.<eos> You have done that.<eos> - If only I could live to see Spain at peace.<eos> - You will. You will!
What Jack Tarling says.<eos> That Lyne...<eos> Please try my number once again?<eos> That he deals with drugs.<eos> - I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Still no answer.<eos> - Let it ring longer.<eos> Let's assume, he doesn't believe me.<eos> He will!
You remember Adrims, don't you, Helga?<eos> When I was a kid, he used to come up here. You gave him money.<eos> He used to give me a quarter and say it was my share for being a good little boy.<eos> I never liked him.<eos> Why did you give him money, Helga?<eos> I forgot you can't answer, can you?<eos> You sorry we came back from Denmark?<eos> This place hold unpleasant memories for you?<eos> Do you want to go back?<eos> Maybe you will someday.
In order for Warren to continue the masquerade successfully... he had to get rid of three people. The two who knew of the deception:<eos> Alfred Adrims, who had become a Justice of the Peace... and Helga, who had become a burden to him.<eos> And then Miriam... the real heiress to the estate. And so, Warren created Emily... a homicidal maniac who did his killing for him.<eos> Well, that's just about it.<eos> I won't keep you any longer.<eos> You're now a very rich young woman, Miss Webster.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Karl, now that I'm rich, it won't make any difference, will it?<eos> Yes, it will, Miriam.
Do what he says, come on, upstairs.<eos> Do you gentlemen care for a drink?<eos> -None for me.<eos> Let's play.<eos> -By all means.<eos> Thought we came here to play pool?<eos> I don't play pool, I play billiards.<eos> It's my house, my game.<eos> You don't have to play if you don't want to.<eos> -We won't.
She told me.<eos> I can't let you take her, Bren.<eos> I won't.<eos> Look, Belle.<eos> Missy'll be safe with me.<eos> Nothing bad will ever happen to her while I'm with her.<eos> I promise that.<eos> But it won't last, Bren.<eos> She's so young, it can't.<eos> It will.
Give him a fat lip.<eos> Okay, so park there.<eos> Hope Mr. Webster won't get angry.<eos> I assume full responsibility.<eos> I am his employer.<eos> All right, Mr. Webster. Hear this!<eos> It's been brought to my attention that you're guilty of unbecoming conduct.<eos> You have embarked on this course without my knowledge or consent.<eos> My father, the commodore, would not brook insubordination.<eos> By thunder, neither will I!
I do not know.<eos> "I'll say goodbye before you go.<eos> We are starting now.<eos> Has a long way ahead.<eos> - Think of me once în a while.<eos> You bet. I will miss him.<eos> Listen... If you are tired of here go to Morrel.<eos> It's a small place...<eos> There is almost nothing there, but... - One can live quietly.<eos> - I will, boy.
You got a free dance for the señorita?<eos> Well, sir, excuse me, but...<eos> But this is our dance, don't you remember?<eos> Oh, wonderful.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> - Will you have some?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - Hey, that's a good idea.<eos> - I thought so.<eos> - Will you...?
Tell me the truth.<eos> I heard you brought her 30 ryo.<eos> How did you get the money?<eos> Where did it come from?<eos> Tell me the whole truth.<eos> Tell me, Namie!<eos> Yes.<eos> Madam's late.<eos> Maybe she won't come here anymore.<eos> She will.
What type is that?<eos> Vulture, sir.<eos> Jackals.<eos> They prowl around looking for a good company that's having a little difficulty buy it up for practically nothing, and then they start pulling it to pieces.<eos> Close the plant down, spin it off for a tax loss.<eos> They throw a whole community out of work just to make a fast buck.<eos> I'd sure hate to see one of those ruthless characters get his fat destructive hands on Austen Plastics.<eos> Your opinion of Mr. Cash McCall is a matter of complete indifference to all concerned because you've never even met the man.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> But you will.
I know. The dead should keep quiet.<eos> Then let me be dead for good.<eos> I can't stand it anymore!<eos> I don't dare look at myself.<eos> I can't touch my face for fear of feeling the furrows and crevices in my skin.<eos> It feels like rubber!<eos> Calm down, my dear.<eos> Trust in him.<eos> I'm sure he'll succeed.<eos> He never will.
- I bought it for when he comes home.<eos> - Why couldn't you leave it alone?<eos> - I just fancied it.<eos> Couldn't you leave it alone?<eos> It wasn't for you.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> I feed you, don't I?<eos> Don't think you give me all that much money every week.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - I won't.
Never you mind, baby. You're too innocent.<eos> She just looks at a man, and right away he starts... scraping sand with both feet.<eos> Look at Tom Healy.<eos> He doesn't know whether he's coming or going.<eos> Thinking she'll marry him.<eos> Why should he marry her when they already go to...<eos> Tut-tut.<eos> He'll never have any peace until he does marry her.<eos> And he knows it.<eos> And neither will she.
You're so sweet.<eos> Nothing too good for the future Mrs Winthrop.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> Madeline, I'll have no scrawny woman in my home.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Madeline, get ready to leave.<eos> - I want to, Philip.<eos> Then you will.
He confuses material things with the spiritual value of the revealed word.<eos> Why do you bewilder this child?<eos> Does right have no meaning to you, sir?<eos> Realising that I may prejudice the case of my client, I must tell you that right has no meaning for me whatsoever.<eos> But truth has meaning, as a direction.<eos> But it is one of the peculiar imbecilities of our time that we place a grid of morality upon human behaviour, so that the action of every man must be measured against an arbitrary latitude of right and a longitude of wrong in exact minutes, degrees and seconds.<eos> Howard, do you know...<eos> Do you understand what I'm talking about?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Maybe someday you will.
And if you don't recognize her - she's ours for eternity!<eos> Mommy!<eos> Three!<eos> That's my mom!<eos> Mommy, mommy, wake up!<eos> Let's go to freedom.<eos> Freedom or bondage - it makes no difference, no difference.<eos> No, I won't let her go! I won't!<eos> I won't let her!<eos> - I won't!
if you came along with me.<eos> What for?<eos> Well, to tell your side of the story.<eos> Or rather Lucille's.<eos> I'm sure you want to keep her out of it as much as possible.<eos> I want to keep her out of it, period.<eos> That's why I sent her away to her aunt.<eos> But she can't be kept out of it.<eos> Next to Jean, she'll be the Prosecutor's chief witness.<eos> Oh, no, she won't.
But I can't push it from the outside.<eos> But that's where you're gonna push it from.<eos> Every casino's got a motor that generates power for the tables and cages when the cable fails which happens quite often.<eos> The motor kicks in, and they're back in business.<eos> Except they won't on account of you, Tony.<eos> What happens if you cross the wires that operate lights with the cage doors' wires?<eos> When the motor kicks in, instead of the lights going on the doors click open.<eos> It's as simple as that.<eos> But I have to study the main switch box in each casino.<eos> Oh, but you will, you will.
No, I'm not.<eos> The only other time I saw you cry was the first day you came here.<eos> Those were very different tears.<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, David.<eos> David.<eos> It's strange what goes through one's mind at a time like this.<eos> All I can think of is...<eos> I've never known what it's like to awaken from sleep and find you beside me.<eos> And now I never will.
You know, if you had untied my hands, they might have thought they were surrounded.<eos> [Chuckles] Let's get out of here.<eos> Cigar?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> You know, I think if I had to face life without cigars, whiskey, women, steak and cards, I'd much rather they take me out, string me up.<eos> There's an unpleasant thought... getting hung.<eos> The word is "hanged."<eos> Which is what ain't gonna happen to me.<eos> I've been shot 11 times, broke out of more jails than you can count, had a rope around my neck twice, so... don't worry about me.<eos> I won't.
Noble Romans... fiighting each other like animals!<eos> Your new masters, betting to see who'll die fiirst.<eos> Drop your swords.<eos> I want to see their blood right over here where Draba died!<eos> When I flight matched pairs, they flight to the death.<eos> I made myself a promise, Crixus.<eos> I swore that if I ever got out of this place... I'd die before I'd watch two men flight to the death again.<eos> Draba made that promise too.<eos> He kept it.<eos> So will I.
You will not have eternal rest until you fulfill that agreement.<eos> Remember that well, Dr. Jacinto Aldama.<eos> Leave him, Doctor, I beg you.<eos> I don't understand. What agreement was that?<eos> One among doctors and totally scientific.<eos> The one who dies first must find the way so the other one could go and come back from the other world without dying.<eos> Without dying? You are asking for something impossible.<eos> For science, the impossible is always within the realm of the possible.<eos> In my condition as a mortal, I want to know for myself what is beyond death.<eos> And I will, Dr. González.

I'm a trout man, but this is a new wrinkle I'm gonna try.<eos> They do it a lot down in the bayou.<eos> The idea is to get a great big long pole and a 10-pound line.<eos> Just drift along a high bank in a boat.<eos> Then you see that great big old bullfrog in a crevice, and you float this along in front of him and that old tongue snaps out.<eos> You got frog's legs for supper.<eos> I'll be darned.<eos> Keep it.<eos> Try it sometime.<eos> Thanks. I will.
Waiting. Shoot anything that moves and pick up anything that doesn't.<eos> You know something, I'm gonna take that advice, especially on the first count.<eos> Turn up the volume, Sam.<eos> Well, come on, Iris.<eos> You take the microbe count and radiation.<eos> I'll work on the atmospheric composition, temperature.<eos> Keep a sharp lookout, Sammy.<eos> Anything moves, yell.<eos> You know, it's so quiet out there, if anything does move, I'm gonna jump right out of my skin.<eos> Something will.
- Why?<eos> - I have to.<eos> Even before the war, things weren't working out.<eos> I was jealous of her. And now--<eos> Be quiet!<eos> I don't want to, you understand?<eos> She's young and pretty.<eos> She'll find her happiness, right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She will.
I love you as you are now.<eos> But that other Scott, I... Well, it was a nightmare.<eos> I couldn't stand that again, I really couldn't.<eos> Even if you don't take me back - and I want you very, very much - I'm through... drinking.<eos> Yes, but how... how can I be sure? How can I believe?<eos> How can I know?<eos> Test me. Don't just take my word for it. Test me.<eos> You have been at it all day.<eos> You must stop now.<eos> Yes, I will.
Well, yes.<eos> It's not exactly stolen money.<eos> - You reckon?<eos> - It's stolen from thieves.<eos> I'm not stuffing my pockets with money from the black-market.<eos> Well, I think it should find its way back there.<eos> I want to feed and clothe my family.<eos> Not with 400,000F!<eos> It's not a question of numbers, you said so yourself.<eos> And I won't all this money from a kid like Antoine.
- Yes, sir.<eos> How's Anne?<eos> And Mrs. Hardesty, of course?<eos> They're fine. Fine.<eos> The truth is, Mr. Hardesty you may not want me to come over to the house. When you hear, at least.<eos> I don't wanna continue with the FBI.<eos> No?<eos> Well, that's very interesting.<eos> I don't wanna continue and I'd appreciate if you wouldn't try to talk me into it.<eos> No, I won't.
I will not take the coach in the morning.<eos> I came to make this my home.<eos> And I will do it.<eos> In 6 weeks, this could be a ghost town, with no-one left in it.<eos> I'll be here!<eos> I'll plant ghost wheat and raise ghost cattle.<eos> - And watch when I build my ghost house!<eos> - With ghost money?<eos> I will get some money.<eos> Somehow I will.
But I...<eos> No, listen to me.<eos> All right. I'm listening.<eos> When my bills are all paid, I want everything that's left to go to...<eos> Sarah Jane.<eos> Of course.<eos> Mr. Steve?<eos> Yes, Annie? Find her, Mr. Steve. Find her.<eos> I will. You may be sure.<eos> I will.
- When did Fue disappeared?<eos> - Yesterday night.<eos> And you don't know where she is?<eos> Did you searched for her?<eos> Where did you search?<eos> Fue...<eos> Fue...<eos> Granny...<eos> We will find her.<eos> We will, sis and I.
But I'm respected.<eos> The guilty get jailed.<eos> I'm proud of my profession.<eos> You are...?<eos> Civil servant.<eos> A super civil servant!<eos> Tell him what you do.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then spit it out.<eos> I will!
The WO said you were a good soldier.<eos> But they're watching your every move.<eos> I won't run away never!<eos> You mustn't run away!<eos> Come back to me.<eos> Guard post, all is well!<eos> I duly take over.<eos> Don't forget your promise.<eos> You're coming back to me alive!<eos> I won't
I'd almost forgotten they existed.<eos> In holland, you can't celebrate Whitmonday without a pierement.<eos> Even this Whitmonday.<eos> Good luck!<eos> -Do you want me to wait?<eos> -please.<eos> Perhaps you better come inside.<eos> We may be some time.<eos> -It's not safe to leave the car.<eos> -As you will.
gentlemen, I have something of importance to tell you.<eos> My son and Mijnheer Keyser came over this morning with Maj. DiIIon.<eos> They're here at the request of Mr. ChurchiII and the netherlands Legation in London.<eos> They want to prevent our diamonds, particularly our industrial stocks... from falling into enemy hands.<eos> Are you suggesting we send our diamond stocks to england for safekeeping?<eos> Yes, gentlemen.<eos> You must decide whether to send them to england with my son... or overland to Paris or switzerland.<eos> The other alternative is to keep them here for the Germans.<eos> How do we know the Germans will take the city?<eos> Amsterdam will faII within a few hours.
- Hold this piece of junk.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> Take this.<eos> Don't get mad, all right?<eos> Isn't it a beauty?<eos> - It is pretty.<eos> - But you owe me 110 bucks.<eos> Sad, little birdie?<eos> Hasn't he come yet?<eos> But he will.
Not in death, but just in sleep. The fateful prophecy you'll keep.<eos> And from this slumber you shall wake, when true love's kiss the spell shall break.<eos> For true love Conquers all<eos> But King Stefan, still fearful of his daughter's life, did then and there decree that every spinning wheel in the kingdom should on that very day be burned.<eos> So it was done.<eos> Oh, silly fiddle-faddle.<eos> Now, come have a nice cup of tea, dear.<eos> I'm sure it'll work out somehow.<eos> Well, a bonfire won't stop Maleficent.<eos> Of course not. But what will?
- What happened? What happened then?<eos> - I don't remember after that!<eos> Stop that this minute. Stop that noise.<eos> Sister, get out and don't come back until I call you.<eos> I can't remember.<eos> - I can't remember!<eos> - It's all right.<eos> - Don't worry, it's all right.<eos> - But I have to, I want to!<eos> Then you will.
Fingernails grow. So does hair, and the formation of calcium in the bones continues.<eos> Life is not merely a matter of breathing and a beating heart.<eos> - We've come a long way.<eos> - We got a long way to go.<eos> Perhaps. And perhaps not.<eos> We now know that at the peak of terror... The Tingler is a solid mass extending from the coccyx to the cervicals.<eos> If one could stand the pain without screaming... or otherwise releasing their tension until they died... an autopsy would give us a Tingler we could work with.<eos> The advancement of human knowledge is fine, but dying for it...<eos> If that's your attitude... we'll have to find someone else who's willing to die for science.<eos> And eventually we will.
No babbling. Come and drink!<eos> A perfect night to have a festival!<eos> Count on us, if you want to avenge your father.<eos> Your houses are intact.<eos> Your people are still alive.<eos> I lost my father.<eos> Ascanius already said to me, "Welcome back, Glaucus.<eos> Take up your sword and avenge your father!"<eos> "My Praetorians have failed."<eos> But I will not!
He didn't.<eos> We're gonna keep on looking for him, Steve.<eos> If he's in trouble, I think I know where he'd go.<eos> I'd be obliged if you'd let me go after him, Brick.<eos> I've been with that old man for 38 years.<eos> I love him too.<eos> Will you wear your gun?<eos> All right, Steve.<eos> Wait for me.<eos> I will.
I should be taking lessons from you.<eos> Raymond? Did you tell her about Elsa?<eos> - Elsa?<eos> - Oh, Raymond.<eos> I don't think I knew that Elsa was coming when I asked Anne.<eos> Anne said she'd think it over and... Oh, dear.<eos> Raymond? Which room is Anne going to have?<eos> I thought I'd give her mine.<eos> - I'll sleep in the bathhouse.<eos> - I will.
- It isn't Albertine...<eos> Yoga.<eos> Hindu philosophy.<eos> I wasn't aware that yoga was part of your examination.<eos> All those discussions about your paper on Pascal and how difficult Spinoza was for you.<eos> Cecile, have you actually done any studying at all?<eos> In the end, it's your own affair if you fail your examinations but it is another matter when you lie to your father and to me.<eos> Why did you lie?<eos> I really don't understand you at all.<eos> And you never will!
That crummy, no-good...<eos> Mrs Graham, can't we spend our precious time at something more constructive?<eos> You're right.<eos> I should be thanking you instead of fighting with you.<eos> All I ask is complete honesty between us.<eos> That's a deal.<eos> Now then, you state that on the evening of March 9, you were at home with your husband and baby.<eos> But in your testimony to the grand jury, you said your husband couldn't be found.<eos> - Don't you believe me?<eos> - A jury won't.
Leave us in, pops.<eos> We wanna see Babs.<eos> Go home. Ain't you kids got nothing better to do?<eos> Your mother wears army shoes.<eos> - Hi, Peg.<eos> - I saw Bobby this morning.<eos> - How is he? - Wonderful.<eos> He'll be walking soon.<eos> I've gotta see him take that first step.<eos> - You will. You will.
Old fool, do you know the cost of your last musical party?<eos> The cost?<eos> We have to spend money.<eos> Khoka is my only son.<eos> Am I going to cut down on his sacred initiation?<eos> My prestige depends on it.<eos> But... mortgaging in order to pay the singer!<eos> This girl is exceptional.<eos> Her beauty, her voice... you'll know when you listen to her.<eos> No, I won't.
From today on, there's only one correct side.<eos> Rubbish!<eos> You can go from one side to the other.<eos> Both sides are good!<eos> - Will you take Drewnowski with you?<eos> - Of course.<eos> He's a great guy. Climbing the ladder.<eos> I'll make a man out of him.<eos> - Will I be a director one day?<eos> - Of course you will.
I know, but that doesn't make it any easier.<eos> I don't know how to govern.<eos> Don't even try to learn how, Franek.<eos> There is so much suffering and injustice, so many tears in this country.<eos> Everyone carries his own burden.<eos> Learn to understand.<eos> What's there to understand?<eos> German.<eos> Did you find them?<eos> No, but we will.
Ever since her father had me fired from my last job.<eos> Naturally, he objected to a Mexican show clerk as son-in-law, so you had to put him out of the way.<eos> - Naturally!<eos> Just because he speaks gilded, that don't make him innocent.<eos> You can show motive, but don't you need a bit more?<eos> - We'll get it.<eos> There's my coffee.<eos> Didn't you bring me any doughnuts or sweet-rolls?<eos> You'll have to put him on the scene of the crime.<eos> - We will.
Colonel, when you have a free moment I'd like to tell you about the latest nightmare I've had.<eos> They're busy for the moment, tell me now.<eos> Well... it concerns a dark café a small table, a bottle of wine.<eos> And a burning candle?<eos> And that candle's burning lower and lower.<eos> Pretty soon it's going to burn out.<eos> Well, maybe if we hurry, we can find that dark café before it's too late.<eos> Good.<eos> - Now, don't go away.<eos> - I won't.
Why don't you give me a call some...<eos> You can't do that either, cos I'm getting marr...<eos> You're getting married?<eos> Yes, I am and I'm very late.<eos> What time was it?<eos> Four minutes to five.<eos> Goodbye, Ken.<eos> I really hope you find happiness, and if you're ever in need of anything, like someone to love, don't hesitate to call me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
I ain't no hurrying man.<eos> You just lucky it ain't some crazy young rooster gonna be sharing this here coop with you.<eos> Put my bags in there.<eos> I brung you a present. Some old Doc Calloway's soothing syrup.<eos> Guaranteed to give you the don't-care look.<eos> If you feel like it, help yourself.<eos> Say, you sure are put together real nice, ain't you? Soft and white.<eos> Oh, you gonna bring a right pretty price from one of them dandy's in New Orleans.<eos> You know, I'm kind of glad this is gonna be a long trip. They'll never own me.<eos> And you won't either.
The soft talk, the confidences.<eos> If I am ever lucky enough to deliver him to the hangman it will be you who helped put him there.<eos> Why didn't you go on your way north?<eos> Why did you jump the boat at Pointe du Loup?<eos> Why did you stay on as Hamish Bond's woman denying freedom to be the mistress of a slave holder?<eos> If you hadn't, much might be different now.<eos> Maybe he'd have a friend somewhere who'd be helping him to live rather than wanting to see him die.<eos> But I guess all the fires of retribution are not in the hereafter.<eos> You've suffered and so has he.<eos> And I always will, with him or without him.
There's no roof.<eos> We'll fix the roof.<eos> We'll furnish the supplies.<eos> I don't know what I can get, but it'll be a lot better than you'll find along the road.<eos> But a hundred children...<eos> We'll help with them too.<eos> How about it?<eos> Will you stay?<eos> Oh, I don't think so.<eos> Will you?
To what depths she can sink!<eos> She cannot give strength. Then take away my shame!<eos> I can't sacrifice my children!<eos> He will return.<eos> He is alive.<eos> This won't remain.<eos> A woman's duty is motherhood.<eos> Thank God you came to me. Otherwise your sweet kids would die.<eos> The goddess has returned my husband She will also return my children.<eos> - She will.
In the trunk.<eos> I still wanna know. Where's he been hiding you?<eos> Well. I work in town at the bank.<eos> Dad talks a lot about his squadron commander.<eos> Yeah? What does he say?<eos> He calls you Casanova with wings.<eos> Look, we better get off on the right foot.<eos> - I'm Jim to those who know me well.<eos> - Well. I don't know you well.<eos> - You will.
I guess I'll have to go, aRer all.<eos> Your helmet is ready, Senor. Ty it.<eos> You put it on.<eos> Feels nice!<eos> I'm like a bird in a cage, only seeds are missing.<eos> Sit down on the stump.<eos> I'm sitting.<eos> No, Senor, I used to go hunting with you. I know how heavy a hand you've got.<eos> - Put the helmet on.<eos> - l will, but later.
- Shall I shake the ship out for a standby?<eos> - Not much shaking out to be done.<eos> But ready underwater search gear.<eos> If this spook is a U-boat, he might pull the plug, and we'll have to go after him.<eos> - Who's the senior radarman, Andrews?<eos> - That's me, sir.<eos> You track the target.<eos> Any turn or change in speed, no matter how small, don't miss it.<eos> I'll stick on him, don't you worry, Captain.<eos> All right, I won't.
So does the license clerk.<eos> You folks are as good as married right now.<eos> Here ya are.<eos> That's all right, sir.<eos> I'm an old air-force man myself.<eos> Is that why you brought me here?<eos> To get married?<eos> Well, they can't deport the wife of an American citizen.<eos> But you'll get into trouble if you marry me.<eos> Sure, I will.
I'm more afraid of our jets.<eos> Why?<eos> You better stop dropping down a little.<eos> What for?<eos> At this altitude, you'll be showing up on the Soviet radar net in less than five minutes.<eos> What about it?<eos> Your radio transmitter's on the wrong frequency.<eos> So I can't identify myself if they intercept us.<eos> They won't shoot if we lower our landing gear.<eos> Oh, yes, they will.
Observe, please, they're on the front of his head and not on the side like reptile or fish eyes.<eos> Yes.<eos> This little fella already has stereoscopic vision. maggie:<eos> He certainly looks silly.<eos> Not a very nice way to talk about one of your ancestors.<eos> One of my ancestors?<eos> Homo sapiens junior.<eos> Very, very junior.<eos> At this moment, he can't make up his mind whether or not he should become a real monkey.<eos> But you will.
- I won't.<eos> - You're going to fall down.<eos> - No, I won't.<eos> - You'll rip up the blackout.<eos> - It's a blanket.<eos> I'm going to call the militia.<eos> I'm sick of the blackout.<eos> Give me the blanket.<eos> - Let go. You'll fall.<eos> - No, I won't.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.<eos> - He's very handsome.<eos> - So what?<eos> - Aren't you jealous?<eos> - What?<eos> - Aren't you jealous?<eos> - I haven't got the time for it.<eos> I won't have much time either when I go to the architecture college.<eos> You'll never pass the entrance exams.<eos> - I will!
It was raining where I was.<eos> Cats and dogs.<eos> - And mud, I see.<eos> - Yes, I must brush that off.<eos> By the way, one of your girls has been telephoning.<eos> Really?<eos> Which one? I mean... What do you mean?<eos> She had a twangy voice and refused to give her name.<eos> - Never heard of her.<eos> - You will.
The charge is cowardice in the face of the enemy.<eos> You have your orders, gentlemen.<eos> Let's carry them out.<eos> But Lieutenant Roget killed Lejeune on that patrol... and then blackmailed me into keeping quiet about it!<eos> - That's why he picked me!<eos> - Corporal, I understand your feelings.<eos> But that has nothing to do with the charges you're being tried for.<eos> - Don't you believe me, sir?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> But who else will?
It sure is.<eos> Nellie, she's all right now. She's just fine.<eos> Thank God.<eos> What a disgrace, disgrace!<eos> Don't talk that way. Nobody's ever gonna know but the three of us.<eos> People find out.<eos> They always find out.<eos> Nobody will find out as long as you don't say a word.<eos> Understand?<eos> -No, I won't. -Good.
He's blubbing again.<eos> Perhaps I love her.<eos> Perhaps!<eos> Listen, you greasy cuckold.<eos> Love is nothing but lust and cheating and lies.<eos> It hurts all the same.<eos> Love is the blackest of all plagues.<eos> But you don't even die of it, and usually it passes.<eos> No, mine isn't passing.<eos> Of course it will.
Well, maybe you'd like to keep the cab and go on to Maxim's?<eos> Well, as long, as you say, the food is good.<eos> Hi, Jake. Hello, Jake.<eos> You're coming to the dancing, aren't you?<eos> - Yes, you must come.<eos> We're all going.<eos> It's at the Rue Sainte Geneviève.<eos> Yes. Sure.<eos> - And bring your friend.<eos> - Yes, I will.
She said, "I've given up such a lot.<eos> I've had such a happy life with the British aristocracy."<eos> Pretty funny, don't you think?<eos> Brett.<eos> Dear, dear Brett.<eos> Jake, just out of curiosity, are you drunk?<eos> No.<eos> I see. Well, I am.<eos> Why don't you try to get some sleep, Mike?<eos> I will, old boy. A little later?
Grigory, take the horse.<eos> You wild devil!<eos> You almost trampled me with your horse.<eos> Stepan all packed and ready?<eos> - What's it to you?<eos> - Can't I ask a question?<eos> Yes, he's ready.<eos> So what?<eos> So you'll be left a grass widow?<eos> Yes, I will.
When something's left in the glass, it's like a knife in my heart.<eos> You, Mikhail, are like a calf in those matters.<eos> And I know about drinks.<eos> There's such a wine - you hardly take a cork out, and it's all foaming, like a rabid dog.<eos> That night I fell from my horse three times, as if I was blown off.<eos> A glass of such wine is great on an empty stomach.<eos> How are you?<eos> Oh, there's too much to tell.<eos> - Will you come?<eos> - I will.
Don't worry...you won't die<eos> Pull yourself together<eos> I don't want to die<eos> You shouldn't worry like that<eos> What is it, Akiko?<eos> I want to start all over again<eos> I want to lead a new life...a better life<eos> Akiko!<eos> I want to live!<eos> Of course you will.
- Since now.<eos> Any questions?<eos> Yeah, I got a question: Why?<eos> Because I trust him, Pinky.<eos> - Any other questions?<eos> - Nope.<eos> Okay, Shep.<eos> Well, now, I just guess we'll have to wait and see how he works out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That we will.
I've been keeping an eye on your progress. I've spoken to Abinash-babu about you.<eos> He's far ahead of the average student.<eos> We have high hopes for you, you know.<eos> For our part, we'll provide you with every means to advance in your studies.<eos> But if you really want to be a good student, you'll have to work hard.<eos> In particular... you'll have to improve your English.<eos> Do you like to read?<eos> I don't mean textbooks. Books about travel, or the lives of great men, or books about science, written in simple language.<eos> If I give you books like that, will you read them?<eos> Of course he will. Good.
I'll miss your hugs.<eos> I'll miss your kisses, Daddy.<eos> You're so big and strong.<eos> See my effect on girls?<eos> Goodbye now, sweetheart. - Take care of Mommy?<eos> - I will, Daddy.<eos> What have you got for me, Aunt Monica?<eos> Let's see if you can guess.<eos> Thanks, Sergeant. Darling, when you see Daddy in Washington... will you have him come and pay me a visit?<eos> Sure, I will.
He didn't forget.<eos> Lou promised to take him to a movie.<eos> - The albums? - Yeah.<eos> - Daddy, your albums are here.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Thank you, Lou.<eos> - Don't mention it.<eos> - Can I borrow him for a couple hours?<eos> - If you promise to bring him back.<eos> I will.
Yeah?<eos> I want to see one of these bodies.<eos> All right.<eos> You're going to bed, and you're staying with her.<eos> Put on your clothes. We'll go to Jack's first.<eos> Got any coffee around here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You'll find some in the kitchen.<eos> He doesn't believe me, Beck.<eos> He will.
- It's all right.<eos> I just couldn't sleep somehow.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> Would you like more coffee?<eos> No, I guess not.<eos> Nice of you to offer, though.<eos> I'm just nervous and restless.<eos> I'll be all right.<eos> - Go on back to bed.<eos> - No, I won't.
Oh, dear, yes, he was.<eos> Very pretty in face.<eos> When I think of Tom<eos> I think about a night<eos> When the earth smelled of summer<eos> And the sky was streaked with white<eos> And the soft mist of England<eos> Was sleeping on a hill,<eos> I remember this<eos> And I always will.
Edward, coming here?<eos> "Edward"?<eos> You call him this?<eos> We are old friends.<eos> I knew him in London before I was married.<eos> When they're here, I'll take opportunity of expressing my opinion of thieves who would try to steal my country.<eos> I will show them who is barbarian!<eos> Well, what is this face you put on?<eos> My guess is that you will not fight with your distinguished visitors.<eos> - I will not?
- Do you know this part of the country?<eos> - No. It's a coal-mining region, the Borinage.<eos> There exist no more miserable people on the face of the earth... than the miners who live there.<eos> If you really mean what you said about wanting to help the unfortunates... here's your chance.<eos> "The heart that seeks God...<eos> "has more storms than any others.<eos> "Life is a struggle here below.<eos> "Yet out of our sufferings...<eos> "God teaches us higher things.<eos> "He wills..."
- You know, I had you figured all wrong.<eos> - Thanks a lot. It's nothing.<eos> Forget it.<eos> - Oh, I won't forget it.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - I won't forget it.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - I won't forget it!<eos> - Forget it!<eos> I won't!
So much worrying.<eos> I'm just a bundle of worries.<eos> Has Sugiyama gotten a raise?<eos> It's hard to get a 1 ,000 yen raise.<eos> No electric cushion for me then.<eos> You won't need it.<eos> It's warm out.<eos> Well, I'm going.<eos> Sure you won't take anything?<eos> Maybe I will.
Sleep here.<eos> It's our reunion.<eos> Stay here.<eos> I haven't any more bedding.<eos> You don't need any.<eos> Remember that time we slept in a barn? On the hay?<eos> That's right. It was warm too.<eos> Don't go away.<eos> Stay with us.<eos> All right, I will.
When I left, I announced in ringing tones... that wild horses couldn't drag me back.<eos> - Here, let me help you.<eos> - Do me a favour.<eos> Don't ever help me do anything you wouldn't help a two-armed man do.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Do me another favour?<eos> - I'll try.<eos> Don't ask me what battle of the war I lost my arm in.<eos> The question makes the hairs stand up on the back of my neck.<eos> All right, I won't.
But why?<eos> What's the sense of killing him?<eos> What's the point?<eos> In a way, I'm glad.<eos> I'm glad it's out in the open.<eos> I'll be rounding up strays for a few weeks.<eos> There's a stage leaving Mesa around the first.<eos> Cinch will put you on it.<eos> I'd go down on my knees if I thought it would help.<eos> It won't.
Come in.<eos> Sapsal, listen to this.<eos> Attention, we're looking for a place to land. Attention, we're looking for a place to land.<eos> She's looking for place to land.<eos> Don't turn the receiver off.<eos> We will land near you.<eos> -Come in.<eos> -C-Come in.<eos> -Don't turn the receiver off.<eos> -We won't.

Ah, here comes accuracy herself.<eos> Excuse me. I need some rest.<eos> Aren't you feeling well, Lady Chatterley?<eos> Just tired, it's nothing.<eos> You will eventually make me like those potions, Mrs. Bolton.<eos> That would be a great success, Sir Clifford.<eos> I have a headache. I'll go out for some fresh air.<eos> Won't people talk if you come here every evening?<eos> No one knows.<eos> - They soon will. - Why?
- Maybe if you and Aron went in together...<eos> Aron ain't got nothing to do with this.<eos> This is my deal. I'll get the $5,000.<eos> What're you gonna do, borrow it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> If you can borrow $5,000... I know a farmer who's got over 800 acres.<eos> - All right. What do we do?<eos> If we can guarantee him 5 cents a pound... and make him a seed loan, he'll plant beans.<eos> So will a lot of other farmers.
Why are you reading it? You said critics are idiots.<eos> They know as much about opera as I do about growing beetroot.<eos> Listen to this, Clement.<eos> "Despite his best efforts, he failed to outshine Eric Walter's flawless technique<eos> - and unique, unrivalled timbre."<eos> - Now you care for reviews!<eos> No, I'll keep it.<eos> Lohengrin tonight?<eos> Yes, but you can't sing after staying up all night.<eos> I will.
We'll just have to be more careful next time, all of us.<eos> Careful?<eos> I can't be careful.<eos> When I walk into a courtroom, I've gotta win.<eos> I've always had to win.<eos> What do you think got me out of that slimy little block where I was born?<eos> Sure, your father helped, but I'd have gotten out anyway, even if I had to crawl on my hands and knees.<eos> I was a fighter when I was a kid.<eos> And I never stopped fighting.<eos> I never will.
And Demps, all 5,000 of them are strung out from here and Texas.<eos> There they be!<eos> Who brought them in?<eos> - Steve Miles, from the Sabine.<eos> Yeah, you know him?<eos> Yeah, I know him.<eos> Who's he got with him?<eos> Well, there's Tom Quitman, Concho Perez. He's got Yaqui Neal and Mublin, right in point.<eos> But I don't know the others.<eos> - You will. - Yeah?
Well?<eos> So you came here to collect.<eos> Just how far would you go to keep a foreman?<eos> Well, I might even marry him.<eos> Oh, slap the trying lion, on his rump.<eos> By the way, when you see Strap, when you tell him he's no longer foreman.<eos> - I'm not gonna do that.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Cause I won't be seeing him.<eos> - Of course you will.
That's when I knew I was hooked.<eos> There was a 40 pound monkey on my back.<eos> The only way to get along with a load like that, is to keep getting a fix.<eos> Don't.....<eos> I'm one of the lucky ones, Molly.<eos> I kicked it and I'm not too far hooked to kick it again.<eos> I've had my last fix.<eos> Tell me something.<eos> Do you think those bobby-soxers' will really go for me?<eos> Yes, they will.
Not like this one.<eos> There.<eos> Come along.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> Oh, Lord.<eos> - Pretty?<eos> - Right beautiful.<eos> Did you ever see anything like it?<eos> Never have.<eos> Never will again, most likely.
- All right.<eos> Two months and ten days, right?<eos> How's it feel?<eos> - Same as for everyone.<eos> Tell me.<eos> You'll find out.<eos> It won't happen to me.<eos> Sure it will.<eos> - I just know it won't.<eos> - It will.
It's yours!<eos> The Texans are there and this city will never be the same.<eos> Listen, guys.<eos> I do not want see one sober man.<eos> - It is here, Sam<eos> - Well, Clint.<eos> How long will you stay in Wichita?<eos> There is no rush.<eos> The cowboys will not leave that when they will have more money.<eos> Or when you will more alcohol.
You unfortunately are not in a high place.<eos> I don't propose to allow an accidental birth to keep me out. I do not propose to accept obscurity.<eos> I don't know what you propose, George, but it may be some time Before the world recognizes your superiority.<eos> There are other worlds, Mr. Thurlow.<eos> The Colonies, France, America. Worlds of opportunity. Where a man can go as far as his abilities will take him<eos> And no questions asked about his father. I promise you it will be a good investment. I'll pay you back tenfold.<eos> Pay me back?<eos> For what? The passage money.<eos> Surely you will lend it to me.<eos> Surely, I won't.
I want you to have it.<eos> -I couldn't think of accepting it.<eos> A watch is the last thing I'm going to need.<eos> I'd like to think of it marking the kind of hours only a young girl can have, exciting hours.<eos> You'll make me very happy if you'll accept it.<eos> Well, if you put it that way.<eos> I can't thank you.<eos> I've never met anyone like you, yet I shall remember you for the rest of my life.<eos> I'd rather you remember it's only a possession and so, not worth very much.<eos> I will, always.
He ain't all right with me.<eos> Who is?<eos> Take it up with the Kid, I'm still riding behind him.<eos> Doors are made to knock on.<eos> I'm knocking.<eos> So it's the Johnny boy, huh?<eos> What if it is?<eos> I don't like it.<eos> Why don't you tell him?<eos> I will.
Matsue, give your father plenty to eat<eos> Don't fill up yours it's too big<eos> I want a new lunch box with a lily on it<eos> - Buy me one<eos> - I can't get up yet<eos> When you do get up<eos> Who's going to pay for it?<eos> Wait until your father earns some money<eos> - I'll buy you one<eos> - You will?
I should have neither hatred nor affection for anyone, and yet, I'm fond of you.<eos> I can't help it.<eos> Your path will be painful.<eos> You will hate yourself because inside you will scream at the vulgarity here.<eos> But I regret leaving you.<eos> A real regret.<eos> I pray to God this night so that he inspires me of the means to help you again.<eos> Go.<eos> I don't hate you, Julien.<eos> And I never will.
What sort of trouble?<eos> When your friends are in trouble, you don't ask why or what.<eos> You help them.<eos> Ask anybody you like.<eos> For the next 6 months, I'd like you to consider this your home.<eos> And what if one of my friends should be a woman?<eos> How would Mrs Esmond feel if I brought a woman into the house?<eos> Ask anybody you like.<eos> Don't worry...<eos> I won't.
There's no Christmas in the army, Captain.<eos> There are always slip-ups during a change in command. The men get a little loose.<eos> - I know I'm leaving them in good hands.<eos> - Thank you, General.<eos> Take me to headquarters immediately.<eos> You'll have those men turned out on the double.<eos> Sergeant, take the short cut.<eos> That's not the way back to headquarters.<eos> You know and I know that, but the General doesn't.<eos> At least he won't for about an hour and a half.
Hunting? We don't need no meat.<eos> Maybe not. What we need is a way out of here.<eos> You're wasting time.<eos> There ain't but one way out.<eos> - That's through Skagway.<eos> - Not if you go along the river.<eos> I met an Indian the other day, a Chilkat.<eos> He claims a trail all the way to Juneau.<eos> Yeah, but did you see the trail?<eos> I will today.
Lena, is it all going to be... wasted?<eos> What's wasted?<eos> Well, this evening. My performance.<eos> All my preparations.<eos> Oh, Lily, we sent the letter to that agency in Chicago. That's all we could do.<eos> If your mother doesn't come, don't be too disappointed, will you?<eos> Well, what else could I be?<eos> If she were here tonight, my performance would be like Mr Halley's comet streaking across the autumn sky.<eos> If she wouldn't come back for this, I suppose she'll never come back.<eos> Maybe she will, maybe she won't.
Well, don't you get it?<eos> Donovan's brain is sending out thoughts.<eos> All I have to do is use my brain to receive them.<eos> Oh, naturally.<eos> Very simple.<eos> Darling, will you do something for me?<eos> Will you go into town and get back issues of magazines and newspapers?<eos> I want every article that has anything to do with Donovan.<eos> Every possible detail of his life.<eos> Will you, baby, please?
Darling, will you do something for me?<eos> Will you go into town and get back issues of magazines and newspapers?<eos> I want every article that has anything to do with Donovan.<eos> Every possible detail of his life.<eos> Will you, baby, please?<eos> Hey, you sober enough? Will you drive her?<eos> I'm beat. I want to take that shower you sold me on and sleep.<eos> I'm tired of this space-patrol junk.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Darling, will you, please?
He's about 25, sandy hair, blue eyes, should be crying in his beer.<eos> - Would whiskey do? - Just as good.<eos> Try him.<eos> What's this? Nothing.<eos> I do not know The axioms and fables tell<eos> Faith was a bloodstain Where a hero fell<eos> Or was it a jungle Where two children trod,<eos> Looking for violets Angleworms and God?<eos> Don't try and understand that, Roper. That's a poem.<eos> I won't.
I don't want you to go back to Holmes.<eos> I don't want to, either. But I am.<eos> There's nothing else for me to do.<eos> It's no good with us, Milt. It could never have been any good.<eos> Hiding, sneaking. It had to wear out.<eos> Good-bye, Sergeant.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - It ain't good-bye, it's...<eos> We'll see each other again, somewhere.<eos> Of course we will.
That I found them again.<eos> - So you'd lost them?<eos> - Yes, at the theater.<eos> The theater?<eos> I made that up so I could sell them.<eos> You were saying?<eos> I've gotten a bit lost in all your stories.<eos> My husband gave them to me as a wedding present.<eos> Can you forgive me?<eos> Not right away, of course, but one day you will.
FAN 3: I'll be back later, Miss Stewart.<eos> FANS:<eos> Now, let's get to that hoofer you hired and the limping he calls dancing.<eos> Darling, I pay ellis a fantastic salary and you wouldn't give him a minute's help. Yet you'd spend an hour with those kids. And what do they do?<eos> -The're just the audience.<eos> -They?<eos> A hundred of those kids couldn't scare up the price of one ticket.<eos> Ten years from now, they'II buy a thousand tickets.<eos> None of us will be here 10 years from now.<eos> The theater will.
- Yes, the prince of Wales.<eos> Oh, I had it all once- royalty, champagne, flowers.<eos> I remember my opening night and how excited I was.<eos> I looked in this very mirror.<eos> I wish I knew then what I know now.<eos> I came up overnight.<eos> Overnight I was forgotten.<eos> Won't be that way with you.<eos> Who knows?<eos> No, it won't.
You didn't hesitate to get married now.<eos> - Are you going or not?<eos> - He isn't.<eos> - No.<eos> - Quiet.<eos> I'm the authority, I'll decide.<eos> You're the eldest, right?<eos> - You don't want me to go.<eos> - No.<eos> Then, I won't.
And now, perhaps you'd better get your arms.<eos> I'd deem it another favor, ma'am, if you'd do what you can for Jones and Harris, my shipmates.<eos> For instance, Harris might be very useful to you for an odd day's work.<eos> He's a fine gunner's mate.<eos> I'll keep them in mind.<eos> And now I suppose it's goodbye, Mr. Hawke.<eos> Keep an open eye while you're sailing with Captain Roc.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> I will, indeed.
Go, Taro.<eos> I don't want to go without Grandad.<eos> I'll come soon after.<eos> I won't go unless Grandad comes too.<eos> Taro!<eos> Taro, you go first and Grandad will follow.<eos> It's a lie!<eos> Good boys do as they're told.<eos> Go with her.<eos> No, I won't.
You mean he hasn't got an understanding heart.<eos> Yes, that's it exactly.<eos> He's not the way you are at all.<eos> Female race is always cheesing up my life.<eos> - Girls love you.<eos> - I'm king of the wild horses.<eos> Honest, I like you.<eos> - Listen. You ought to quiet her.<eos> - She'll stop.<eos> - She won't.
- I will do it. The next time.<eos> Sure, you will.<eos> And when you come back, you'll stand them on their ears.<eos> When I come back, chérie, you will fall. For me.<eos> All right, get him in there.<eos> Lets get started.<eos> Get a move on.<eos> Oh, Brad.<eos> Flyers have fallen before.<eos> They will again.
Bread and butter!<eos> And you know something, Peter?<eos> I'm never telling another story - not even to myself.<eos> I've told my last story, Peter.<eos> Especially to myself.<eos> Cobbler, stick to your last.<eos> If any man ever learned his lesson and learned it good, it's me.<eos> - I think you'll go on telling stories.<eos> - No, I won't.<eos> - Yes, you will.
Why split with Kane?<eos> Why a two-way split?<eos> A guy living big all the time like me needs dough.<eos> - So long, sucker.<eos> - Drop it, Tony.<eos> Right in front of you.<eos> Kick it over here.<eos> Move back. Back up.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> - You will.
What did you do then?<eos> I tried to get back to dancing, then I collapsed with rheumatic fever.<eos> Did you ever see this young composer again?<eos> Yes, five months later. After I came out of the hospital.<eos> I saw him from the gallery of the Albert Hall.<eos> His symphony was played there.<eos> It was a great success.<eos> Of course you're in love with him.<eos> I don't even know him.<eos> You will.
How's your business?<eos> I think the current economical situation will continue till autumn.<eos> Yes?<eos> A guest for you, Mr Satake.<eos> - For me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Please excuse me.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Tell Taeko to come to Oiso sometime.<eos> I will.
- Are you kidding?<eos> Just asking.<eos> You know, this sniper thing is driving me crazy.<eos> There's some things I understand and some things I don't.<eos> If a guy blows his top and sticks a knife into somebody, on the spur of the moment, that is, I understand it, so does the law.<eos> It's second degree.<eos> And if a guy decides to knock off his wife and spend six months figuring out how to do it, I understand that, too.<eos> That's first degree.<eos> - But this thing I don't get.<eos> - You will.
I want to write tonight.<eos> - Of course not, darling. - Thanks.<eos> I'm terribly sorry you had to leave a patient for no reason.<eos> It's no harm done.<eos> He won't miss me.<eos> It's that young veteran I told you about.<eos> - The one who won't talk? - Mm-hm.<eos> After two weeks, he still comes in every day. He sits down, can't talk.<eos> Why does he come to you if he won't let you help him?<eos> He will eventually.
With me it's the same.<eos> I'll speak to your parents tonight.<eos> No, Tom. It will cause deep trouble.<eos> - You must not. - It causes trouble already.<eos> You have not acted like my brother.<eos> I told you that she is a maiden, and yet you came here.<eos> I want her for my wife.<eos> I will do all the things expected of a husband here.<eos> I refused Nahilzay once.<eos> I will again.
Where did you get that dress?<eos> Oh, this?<eos> It's just a little old thing Jared rummaged for me in a chest.<eos> Jared, eh?<eos> So he rummaged it for you in a chest, did he?<eos> Well, take it off.<eos> Oh, were you taking it to someone?<eos> How awful of Jared not to tell me.<eos> But, after all, she won't know, will she?<eos> I will.
Same difference.<eos> Franzi, will you please stop playing? (MUSIC STOPS)<eos> (MUSIC STARTS) FRANZI: Just this one, darling, it's so lovely.<eos> I wish I could go to bed.<eos> So do I.<eos> It's almost 3:00, Franzi.<eos> Tough, take a pill.<eos> I've lived on pills ever since I came east.<eos> That's 10 months.<eos> I won't anymore.
Are you bored?<eos> Do you tire of money so easily that you're bored?<eos> I can't, I... Go away then, take a trip.<eos> Go to Palm Beach, Sun Valley, go anywhere, you're rich.<eos> You should anyway, there's still some of that charm school paint sticking to you that needs scrapping off.<eos> Well, I guess that's all there is to do.<eos> Go away, I mean.<eos> Do you think I should?<eos> By all means.<eos> Okay, I will.
You mustn't remarry.<eos> - You mean that?<eos> I had to say something to get Noriko to marry.<eos> You're amazing!<eos> Such a gentleman. I'm so moved.<eos> Don't worry, you won't get lonely.<eos> If you do, I'll come.<eos> I mean it. Good.<eos> You'll really come, Aya dear?<eos> I certainly will.
Nothing.<eos> Jacques, I've memorized the first scene.<eos> I'd like to do it for you.<eos> I've got such ideas about the part.<eos> For my entrance, I'm going to wear a sumptuous black velvet suit.<eos> Period, of course, you understand...<eos> Pamela, remember, it's not clothes that will make this part.<eos> I know, darling, I know.<eos> Young Sarah must have sincerity and sensitivity.<eos> And she will.
- ...who are victims of the slums.<eos> - With pictures in three-color process.<eos> You've got something there.<eos> It's a wonderful idea.<eos> I know Wynand will okay it.<eos> You know that this Enright House is a great building.<eos> Perhaps one of the greatest.<eos> Ellsworth, what are you after?<eos> I daresay nobody knows what I'm after.<eos> They will, though.
- Why?<eos> Don't you know why?<eos> Yes. Because you won't conform.<eos> They'll drive you down again.<eos> Stone quarry's all you can expect.<eos> - I got out of the quarry.<eos> Do you think the Enright House is your beginning?<eos> It's your death sentence.<eos> Has any other client come to you?<eos> They won't.
That's right, Father.<eos> You'll never know, will you?<eos> Catherine. Dr. Isaacs said you'd better come now.<eos> Your father is very low, miss.<eos> He wants you, miss.<eos> I know he does.<eos> Too late, Maria.<eos> Yes, miss.<eos> Tell Lavinia I'm sorry we missed her.<eos> - I will, Aunt Elizabeth.
I, uh, drilled a hole in my bedroom floor when I was a kid.<eos> So I could look down into the living room.<eos> But how did Mom get you fired?<eos> Oh, I sold her a train, and then when she brought it back I didn't do something I was supposed to.<eos> A little electric train?<eos> Red and silver?<eos> - With a whistle and a...?<eos> - Oh, you saw it, huh?<eos> - Yeah, but don't tell Mom.<eos> - Oh, I won't.
Well, I'll go.<eos> Take me.<eos> After dinner.<eos> What if they come back?<eos> Lucas should have thought of that before killing white!<eos> Come and eat.<eos> Good evening.<eos> You're early.<eos> The Gowrie are not there yet.<eos> Maybe they will not.
Why did not you tell me the truth... That night in jail.<eos> You would have believed me?<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> My received.<eos> They do not see it.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> - They see it.<eos> - They do not notice it.<eos> They see it as I see it.<eos> And they always will.
Come on.<eos> Who was it?<eos> - Don't lie!<eos> - It's always that kid of yours.<eos> - Steady, steady.<eos> - Well, sit still, then.<eos> - Shirley!<eos> OK, I'll go.<eos> - That'll do, that'll do.<eos> - No, it won't.
Has he told you the answer of the riddle?<eos> No, but... I know someone who can get it.<eos> - Will you? - Who?<eos> - Tell us. - Who?<eos> Semadar.<eos> Semadar?<eos> Of course!<eos> Yes, by Dagon, she'll tell or I'll ring the answer from her throat.<eos> I'll pay no forfeit to that Danite clown.<eos> Yes, you will.
- I'll camp in the Valley of Sorek.<eos> - Yes, mistress.<eos> They'll camp by the pool at the temple ruins.<eos> Why did the soldiers leave?<eos> Maybe they're looking for us.<eos> Jebus will run off the camels after dark. While we shear the owners.<eos> They might shear us.<eos> You worry more than my little mother. Come on.<eos> Don't cry out.<eos> I won't.
So you're the great Smith. I don't know about that.<eos> Glad to hear it was nothing serious.<eos> Well, thanks.<eos> Heard a lot about you, Smith.<eos> All of it good, I hope.<eos> Good? Well, according to President Bucks, you're practically a legend.<eos> He just sent me a wire.<eos> He seemed pretty happy about the way you handled the Barton business.<eos> You can tell him the score on the Bartons is still two down and one to go.<eos> I certainly will.
People...<eos> Nikos!<eos> Kostas!<eos> Mitropoulos!<eos> Come get him out of here!<eos> Why this internal strife?<eos> I am the leader of the universe.<eos> You are the leader of the universe.<eos> - I will lead the people.<eos> - You will.
His cab fell in the river with him.<eos> He got a disease under the water, a fear.<eos> He can't stand being cramped in a small, dark space.<eos> He should have thought of that Before he began committing violations.<eos> We'll let him ride up front in the open. Come on.<eos> So your mother won't read it in the paper.<eos> Oh, please, Mr. Morse.<eos> Mary, what took you so long to answer?<eos> Has my brother called yet?<eos> Well, he will, the dumb mule.
Goodbye, then.<eos> Bye.<eos> Are you tired?<eos> So-so.<eos> I have to go to work.<eos> On Sunday?<eos> Yes, I work in a team.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Will we see each other again?<eos> Yes, we will.
In fact, I think they'd like to buy.<eos> It'll come pretty high.<eos> Money's no consideration with this customer.<eos> - Tell him he can pick it up tomorrow.<eos> - I thought you said it wasn't finished yet.<eos> It'll be finished.<eos> It uses an image fixer and then projects by ordinary incandescence.<eos> This is the best television projector I've ever seen.<eos> - Let's hope that your customer thinks so.<eos> - He will.
To-night we hold a solemn supper sir, and I'll request your presence.<eos> Let your highness command upon me.<eos> Ride you this afternoon?<eos> Ay, my good lord.<eos> We should have else desired your good advice in this day's council;<eos> but we'll take to-morrow.<eos> Is't far you ride?<eos> As far, my lord, as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper.<eos> Fail not our feast.<eos> My lord, I will not.
Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides, with twenty trenched gashes on his head, the least a death to nature.<eos> Thanks for that.<eos> Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all; all, as the weird women promised.<eos> And, I fear, thou play'dst most foully for't.<eos> Thou play'dst most foully for't:<eos> yet it was said it should not stand in thy posterity, but that myself should be the root and father of many kings.<eos> Is't far you ride?<eos> As far, my lord, as will fill up the time 'twixt now and supper.<eos> Fail not our feast.<eos> My lord, I will not.
As I said, it's small pickings in this town.<eos> Now, here's a couple of hundred bucks and some extra.<eos> I think that'll square us for your trouble.<eos> Yeah, that's better.<eos> You see, every time Jefty leaves town... he gets drunk and brings somebody back.<eos> Oh, he does?<eos> Does he know you're going to all this trouble?<eos> No, but he'll find out it's for the better, and so will you.<eos> - Supposing I don't want to go?<eos> - Yeah, but you will.
It might be rather exciting.<eos> Driving at night always is, but driving with you and Phillip now might have an additional element of suspense.<eos> You were right, Phillip.<eos> Those books were tied clumsily.<eos> He's got it.<eos> - He's got it! - Phillip!<eos> He knows. He knows. He knows.<eos> All right, Phillip. Easy.<eos> I'll take care of it. He knows!<eos> No, you won't.
- Give me that key.<eos> - You can't do this to me!<eos> Nobody's ever done it! Nobody! Nobody!<eos> Would you please stop it and give me that key?<eos> Please, if you love me at all, don't do this.<eos> Henry, I beg you. I promise you, I'll talk to Dad.<eos> I'll do anything, anything you want, only don't leave me!<eos> - Don't go away!<eos> - Give me that key.<eos> No, I won't!
- You can't do this to me!<eos> Nobody's ever done it! Nobody! Nobody!<eos> Would you please stop it and give me that key?<eos> Please, if you love me at all, don't do this.<eos> Henry, I beg you.

Yes, your grace.<eos> The seige is lifted.<eos> The people of Bergamo are free.<eos> Escort the countess back to the castle.<eos> Yes... She killed him... with his own dagger.<eos> Killed the man who had fallen in love with her.<eos> Some say she did it because he was the enemy. Some say she was afraid of herself, for she too, was falling in love.<eos> Still, others claimed that she killed him because she couldn't bare the thought of any other woman putting her arms around him.<eos> But that's a lie, sir. A malicious lie. Don't you believe it<eos> - I won't, Luigi.
Tell Mattie the first big dough goes to get her man out of jail.<eos> - Tell here that or she won't come.<eos> - Oh, I'll tell her for sure.<eos> Well, so long, fellows.<eos> I'll try to get back here with Mattie before tomorrow night.<eos> Hey, big brother, stay sober.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yeah, you.<eos> Oh, I won't touch a drop. Not a drop.<eos> Of course, he won't.
- That's true. The other was four years ago. - Yes.<eos> - Just a little unfortunate.<eos> - I don't know what you're implying. - The surgeon and I were both exonerated.<eos> - Obviously.<eos> I'm not suggesting for a moment...<eos> Natural causes, cardiac failure...<eos> it might happen to any of us.<eos> - The fact remains, people talked.<eos> - They generally do.<eos> - They will, in this case.
- Come to my place.<eos> - Your place?<eos> I mean my store.<eos> I need a dynamic, good woman.<eos> It's a good opportunity.<eos> An excellent opportunity.<eos> Excellent?<eos> Excellent.<eos> You should think it over.<eos> I will, Mr Roland.
That's up to the jury.<eos> Mr. Walters, if you were a judge and this man realized this young girl was unfortunately in love with him and agreed to help her get over him...<eos> -...wouldn't you be inclined to be lenient? -l would.<eos> -l think I'd drop the charges.<eos> -Exactly what I'd do.<eos> What do I have to do?<eos> You'll see Susan as often as we deem proper.<eos> As soon as your fatal fascination wears off, you're free to go on your way.<eos> -And what if it doesn't wear off?<eos> -lt will.
-This is the last call!<eos> -Hi, Mr. Nugent.<eos> -Where have you been?<eos> I've been trying out your super jalopy.<eos> Hi, Susan.<eos> Hi, Jerry.<eos> Now remember, Dickie, you've got to win me that cup. Good luck.<eos> -You going in the race? -Yep.<eos> -May the best man win.<eos> -He will.
I've never fought an angel, but take off your coat and put up your dukes.<eos> Why do you want to fight me?<eos> Because you tried to steal my wife, my child, the love that belongs to me.<eos> Don't you realize that as an angel... I could destroy you with a bolt of lightning?<eos> I don't care.<eos> Julia means more to me than my life.<eos> I'm not gonna lose her.<eos> Then I have news for you. I'm going.<eos> I'll accept that when I see it.<eos> No, you won't.
They pray all day like the monks you invited last year.<eos> I am going to give them this house to make a school and a hospital for the people.<eos> But you know nobody here wants a school. And I'm sure they don't want a hospital.<eos> How do they know what they want until they try it?<eos> The people have all kinds of diseases.<eos> - They have ringworm...<eos> - They don't mind having ringworm.<eos> Then they ought to mind and it will all be free.<eos> It was free last time and nobody came.<eos> They will this time.
- I don't see how you can, Madge.<eos> - Why not?<eos> The place is plenty big enough for us both.<eos> Please, honey, I'm begging you.<eos> - I tell you, you can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Why are you dressed up?<eos> - Because I'm expecting Bob any minute.<eos> All right. That's all right. I can hide in the bedroom.<eos> - No, you won't.
I was sort of hoping we could look around a little more.<eos> Well, you can stay if you like.<eos> I can get home by myself. I'm sure Ms. Putnam will be only too glad to drive you home when she's through with you.<eos> I'm sorry we have to rush off like this, Harriet.<eos> That's all right.<eos> I understand.<eos> Drop in sometime, when you're driving by.<eos> You haven't seen anything yet.<eos> I'll do that, and don't forget about Mr. Henty.<eos> I won't.
He chose a fine bull for tomorrow, a beauty.<eos> He's got horn this wide and a red gleam in his eyes and a neck just like a...<eos> - Like a bull, I'm sure.<eos> Where is Mario?<eos> Well, he's resting, maestro.<eos> Yes, he wants you to be very proud of him tomorrow.<eos> If he wants me to be proud of him tomorrow you better get him away from those musicians tonight.<eos> You know everything, don't you, Father?<eos> No one has ever put over anything on Maestro, never.<eos> And no one ever will.
Wait.<eos> I never ... realized pain could be so ... sharp.<eos> You let me phone Kathy. She'll know a heart man.<eos> - What time is it? - Oh, it doesn't matter.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Come back and hold my hand.<eos> - Sure, sure.<eos> Will she die, Pop?<eos> Will she?
- Oh, Danny, that's not so easy.<eos> What is that's any good?<eos> We'd have to have a place to give it in.<eos> The music shop.<eos> I know Mr. Dobson will say yes. He's wonderful about things like that.<eos> Oh, we'd have to have someone important come to see it.<eos> People whose opinions count, you know, like critics and so forth.<eos> - We'll get them.<eos> - If we could only get that board of trustees.<eos> We will. We three and Nick.
Why, Nick, did you hear what I said?<eos> Did you hear me? About her I noticed.<eos> That's the one. That's the one, I tell you.<eos> - I gotta find her.<eos> - How?<eos> Well, if she's a Brooklyn nurse she's gotta be in Brooklyn.<eos> - But maybe she ain't here. - She's gotta be here.<eos> And believe me, I'll find her.<eos> I'll bet you the Brooklyn Bridge I find her.<eos> Sure you will, Danny.
And do me a favour.<eos> Take note:<eos> Go to Barata's house.<eos> Do you know who he is?<eos> No, sir.<eos> - Do you know where he lives?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Well, tell him I can't go.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I will.
Connie, I want you to hear this, too.<eos> I braced Ed Burma, and got him cold.<eos> I ain't sorry.<eos> I figured you did.<eos> I came up here to help you. But all I've done is put them all on your trail.<eos> That would have to come some time.<eos> All I'll remember is that you did come.<eos> I'll be waiting for you.<eos> Hope you come back.<eos> I will.
Shortening in just right too...<eos> And dough rolled just enough.<eos> Jeff, how would you like to have a dollar<eos> For every biscuit you've made?<eos> I'd take a nickelof grass and I'd own the place.<eos> Not that I'd want to.<eos> Not anymore. Not now. It's too crowded.<eos> A man needs elbow room.<eos> I won't even come inside your kitchen until you ask me to,<eos> Honestly, I won't.
And yank 'em out by the roots.<eos> Oh, no. No, I meant could you dig them up<eos> And plant them around the house<eos> So that we could have some shade?<eos> It would be lovely to fence in the whole yard.<eos> Fence?<eos> We'll do it, mrs. Brewton-<eos> All the ornery trees you want.<eos> We'll do it. Won't we, boys?<eos> Uh, sure will.
Your work takes you away so much.<eos> I'm not complaining, darling.<eos> But she'd be someone to talk to.<eos> Women like to talk a lot.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> They could be settled before the baby comes.<eos> That'll be in april.<eos> I'll have mine in may.<eos> You'll what?
His dad gets the hump as soon as he speaks.<eos> We could at least talk to him.<eos> Johannes?<eos> - What's wrong? - Nothing.<eos> - Has someone been mean to you?<eos> - Why?<eos> You're leaving soon.<eos> You only have a few weeks left.<eos> - I'll never get to leave.<eos> - Of course you will.
You should have thought of that before you came to the jail and started something you couldn't finish.<eos> I didn't think you'd be fool enough to do it. -No?<eos> Well now you're learning something about human nature.<eos> When a bloke gets put away for 15 years he doesn't curl up with a good book.<eos> He gets bitter. He gets a pain in his guts!<eos> He wants to lay his hands on the double crossing swine who put him in.<eos> Next time you want to play with fire use a matchbox instead.<eos> This time you're gonna finish what you started. Or we're both going down together.<eos> You can't drag me into it.<eos> I won't!
Thank you, sir.<eos> The light switch is here somewhere, if my memory doesn't fail me.<eos> Okay, Langford.<eos> I'll do it anyway.<eos> I'll get an annulment.<eos> I don't need anybody's--<eos> Didn't Langford tell you?<eos> There's no such thing as annulment in Argentina.<eos> Then I'll get it anyway!<eos> I will!

Good?<eos> Why I can hone a razor in just...<eos> Thank you, Your Majesty.<eos> Our carriage is outside.<eos> We'll wait two minutes.<eos> If you can't make it, France will always be grateful.<eos> Good luck.<eos> But, Your Majesty!<eos> Shall we proceed, Your Grace?<eos> No, we won't.
After all, I'm smart, Anzelmo.<eos> You think I'd bring him down to that dump if I were on my own? - You think I'd send him to you?<eos> - Sit down and listen.<eos> I was about to give Mr. Taylor a message for Larry Cravat.<eos> - Then you do know-<eos> - I said listen!<eos> This is what I want you to tell him.<eos> That even two million dollars is of no use to a man in the electric chair.<eos> Suppose he doesn't understand the message.<eos> - He will.
Aren't you glad now you missed that circus train?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Where can I reach you, Sam?<eos> The Gable Hotel.<eos> And, you will do that for me, won't you, Walter?<eos> - I'll try my best.<eos> - You do that.<eos> And here's hoping you win that election.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - I will. - What?
All he wanted was for me to get his girl out of gaol.<eos> - His girl?<eos> - That's what he said he wanted.<eos> - What do you think he wants?<eos> - What he can get.<eos> He's a gambler, a sharp shooter, an angle boy.<eos> They come through my office by the hundreds.<eos> Couldn't you see blackmail in his eyes?<eos> I haven't your experience with criminals.<eos> You will...
Nothing.<eos> Maybe you'd teach me this waltz.<eos> Sorry, I'm promised for every dance.<eos> - I'll wait till tomorrow.<eos> - Tomorrow?<eos> That's when we go riding.<eos> Really, you're impossible!<eos> You take so much for granted.<eos> I don't even know that I like you.<eos> You will, Ma'am.
But we'll manage.<eos> And to think that you're Daniel's fiancée!<eos> Yes.<eos> He said he went to see you after leaving the station.<eos> - You weren't too surprised?<eos> What happened?<eos> Nothing, I must have seemed strange to him.<eos> I thought we'd meet before his return.<eos> I couldn't tell him.<eos> I will.
At least they'll give me a square deal.<eos> - You want me to call them? - You heard me.<eos> But I'm warning you ...<eos> If I'm pinched, I'll swear you were in on it. I'll say that you helped me.<eos> - If I fry, I'll get even with you.<eos> - You wouldn't dare, you're chicken!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Then try it and see. Call them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay I will.
No.<eos> Three beers.<eos> That'll be 6 bits.<eos> I don't think I can change this, sir.<eos> That's all right. Keep it.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> - Why three beers?<eos> - We're gonna have company.<eos> I don't see anyone.<eos> You will.
I hit her.<eos> Unfortunately, I didn't remember my ring.<eos> Get out of the way, Mr Stanton!<eos> I'm gonna kill him!<eos> He murdered Stella!<eos> I'm gonna kill him!<eos> Let's go.<eos> You gotta forget it, Pop.<eos> No, I'll never forget Stella.<eos> You will.
I'm always telling him so.<eos> I shall go through Debrett carefully tonight and draw out a list of all the eligible young ladies.<eos> -With their ages?<eos> -Only slightly edited.<eos> I want it to be a suitable alliance. I want you both to be happy.<eos> I shall save you the trouble of looking, Lady Narborough.<eos> I have already chosen her, if she will have me.<eos> -I don't believe it.<eos> -Gladys, darling. Will you marry me?<eos> Of course I will, darling.
- Thanks.<eos> My picture's in the paper.<eos> He recognized me.<eos> We've got to go.<eos> Quick. We can't pack.<eos> Listen, when you left the mountains, you must have passed through New York.<eos> Wherever you came from, wherever you went, you must've been in a railroad station.<eos> You must have heard Edwardes ask for tickets to somewhere.<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> - You will.
At 4:45?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> There's a train leaving in an hour.<eos> We can make connections for Gabriel Valley.<eos> I know what I have to do.<eos> I can't go on endangering you.<eos> - I know about last night.<eos> - Nothing happened.<eos> But it will.
I don't remember ApoIinário, nor the guitar, nor the tax collector.<eos> But Sequeira came to Lisbon for two months and told your father he saw you more than once with a woman.<eos> - What? Me?<eos> What a scumbag!<eos> - At what time does your train leave?<eos> - What for?<eos> It's just that I can't leave town right now.<eos> But I want you to slap that schemer twice for me.<eos> Don't lose your temper, Eduardo.<eos> Yes, I will.
Look, I've no time to waste.<eos> You won't talk?<eos> You won't even try to convince your friend?<eos> You can save him from tortures that you can't possibly imagine.<eos> I can very well imagine them.<eos> But it's useless.<eos> Do you, yourself, believe that he'll talk?<eos> Don't worry. He will.<eos> Believe me. He won't talk.<eos> He won't.
Will you get out of here?<eos> I'm sorry, Judge. A thing happened.<eos> It's his bugle blowing.<eos> The police want to throw him into a state institution.<eos> How do you like that?<eos> - I read an ad here about a room to rent.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> If you sign the papers and Teddy commits himself, we can get him to Happy Dale.<eos> It's a wonderful place.<eos> You will?
Now will you give me my chalk?<eos> Try that again and I'll put you on solitary confinement, you would-be Frankenstein.<eos> Don't profane his name with your dirty lips.<eos> He was a genius in whose footsteps I will follow when I get out of here.<eos> "When you get out."<eos> If I have anything to say about it, you'll never get out.<eos> But I will.
Well, cheerio.<eos> Good night, all.<eos> Good night.<eos> That does it.<eos> Two half-and-halfs and a pint of bitters.<eos> There you are, Neddy.<eos> Yours, if you want it.<eos> Where's a chap can play a game with me and make it worth my while?<eos> I'll play you, Ned Towle.<eos> You will, will you?
- No, Mr. Skeffington, I'm staying.<eos> - All right, then.<eos> I dropped in tonight on an impulse.<eos> I was really on my way to see Arnold Hanlon.<eos> Arnold Hanlon?<eos> Wasn't he the district attorney?<eos> He still is.<eos> I don't think I'm going to be able to take this standing up.<eos> Maybe we'd all better sit down.<eos> - Won't you, Mr. Skeffington?
Oh, Georgie?<eos> Would you phone Janie, and tell her I can't see her?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Goodbye, Fanny.<eos> Will thou pledge thy troth to him?<eos> In love and honor?<eos> In faith and tenderness?<eos> To live with him and cherish him?<eos> - I will.
Please take me with you, even to Europe.<eos> I won't be any trouble. I promise.<eos> - Fanny.<eos> Fanny.<eos> - Please, Daddy. I promise.<eos> Well, darling, there are wonderful schools in Switzerland.<eos> And mountains.<eos> Oh, Daddy, please speak to Mother.<eos> - Maybe she'll say yes.<eos> - She will, darling, she will.
And that is the history of the Princess Ananka... the story of a disastrous love which started more than 3,000 years ago... and has endured through the centuries... to bring tragedy and death into the lives... of everyone connected with the opening of her tomb.<eos> And now, ladies and gentlemen, follow me to the next room.<eos> I'll tell you all about the exhibit which dates back to the 13th dynasty.<eos> Almighty gods of Egypt... forgive us, the Priests of Arkam... powerless now to prevent the gaze of these heretics resting upon her.<eos> May the reclamation of her body absolve us... from any laxity that may have been ours.<eos> This is the Hour of Death.<eos> The forces of evil stand at the threshold.<eos> A man shall die tonight in this, the murder...<eos> Did you ever meet a killer, my friends?<eos> You will tonight.
Thank you, Malvolia.<eos> -A beautiful holiday.<eos> -Thank you, dear.<eos> -And you, Edwina.<eos> -Happy holiday.<eos> Nail polish?<eos> I only put it on this morning.<eos> She's meeting a boy, Miss Sims.<eos> Does your mother know?<eos> Not yet, Miss Sims. But she will.
- Anyone else?<eos> - Yeah, Matrac.<eos> He got two Messerschmitts. He didn't get the third one.<eos> It was for his kid's birthday.<eos> We couldn't make it.<eos> My comrades,<eos> I can think of no more fitting last words for our friend than those which he himself wrote as his last words and wasn't able to deliver.<eos> "My dear son,<eos> "today you are 5 years old, and your father has never seen you.<eos> "But someday, in a better world, he will.
Good night, Tony.<eos> Come here.<eos> You're a swell guy, Tony.<eos> Go away.<eos> Well, she finally hit one.<eos> Now don't drop it.<eos> Bowl it.<eos> It's no use, Bill.<eos> I'll never learn.<eos> Sure you will.
I was getting you a ticket on the plane this afternoon. It leaves at 4:00.<eos> - Can you make it?<eos> You took that job, didn't you?<eos> See, I figured this way you wouldn't get your feet wet.<eos> Yeah. That's right.<eos> - That's what you wanted, wasn't it?<eos> - You want me to go, don't you?<eos> - Yes, I want you to go.<eos> Help her get on that plane, will you, Cricket?<eos> I sure will, Harry.
- Oh, you feel persecuted.<eos> About the cliff at Windward, Stella... what did you feel as you ran toward it?<eos> I didn't feel anything.<eos> I was sad in the house.<eos> Was it as though some will were directing you... - a will stronger than yours?<eos> - The sea sounded loud and beautiful.<eos> - I just went in that direction.<eos> - In fact, you don't quite know.<eos> - I want to see my grandfather.<eos> - You will in time.
- The money, too?<eos> You might as well keep it.<eos> I don't see how that can be traced.<eos> - What about the watch?<eos> - Do exactly as I tell you. Please.<eos> Otherwise we might as well give ourselves up now.<eos> We can't afford to overlook one detail.<eos> We've got to think of everything in advance.<eos> - Remember that.<eos> - I will.
I'm afraid for you so much I do not think of me.<eos> Pilar told me that I'm to go with you, after the bridge. That you'll take me to the Republic. - You and Pilar will have horses.<eos> You'll be safe with Pilar.<eos> That leaves 3 horses for the others.<eos> But I go with you, not Pilar.<eos> I came on foot with the old man and shall go the same way.<eos> - No!<eos> Pilar says no one will get out alive without a horse.<eos> But if Andrés gets through, there will be no bridge, will there?<eos> Will there, Roberto?
Nor you, either.<eos> Come.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> See you soon.<eos> Goodbye, Roberto.<eos> Take much care.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Don't cry.<eos> No, I don't. But come back to me.<eos> - I will.
That's very generous of you.<eos> I think she should have a good time.<eos> You know, nothing serious, but I think she oughta have some fun once in a while.<eos> She will.<eos> Is he our commanding officer?<eos> Sure.<eos> One of the greatest flyers that ever lived.<eos> Sure. We got 'em all up here.<eos> These guys know I'm up here?<eos> They will.
Don't let yourself be snowed under at Valley Forge.<eos> Good luck.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Now please go.<eos> All of you.<eos> - Stepan, I'm frighten.<eos> Monkey.<eos> Thank you, sister.<eos> Goodbye, son. Remember all this, well.<eos> I will.
How can I produce it when I haven't got it?<eos> But you have.<eos> You'll observe that on the train you had contact with a little British agent named Grayson.<eos> He gave you something, where is it?<eos> But I hardly even noticed the man.<eos> I wouldn't even had remembered him if I hadn't seen his picture in the paper.<eos> He disappeared or something.<eos> He's dead Miss Pattridge.<eos> Now will you tell me what I want to know? But I can't.<eos> You won't.
Harry, am I insane?<eos> Could I have shot through Alucard and killed her without hurting him?<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> Well, I shot right through him.<eos> I shot right through him!<eos> Kay screamed and fell, and he just stood there.<eos> Just stood there, staring at me.<eos> Just staring at me.<eos> You don't believe that, do you?<eos> Nobody will.
Yes, Miss Hedy.<eos> There's something I have to tell you, Mr. Gruber.<eos> What would you like to confess?<eos> I'm actually engaged.<eos> What does "actually" mean?<eos> Either one is engaged or one isn't.<eos> My parents would like me to marry the neighbors' son... as would his parents... and since he's a fine person--<eos> He would too, and you, the obedient daughter... will marry him, and live unhappily ever after, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No, you won't.
You'll score 500 points at most... and you're behind by 1 ,000.<eos> - Now what do you have to say?<eos> - I didn't plan on that.<eos> Who doesn't plan for everything sees his plans go awry.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Just a figure of speech.<eos> At any rate, we're now tied.<eos> Sir Bruce...<eos> I have a big favor to ask you, and you may not refuse.<eos> Then of course I will not.
Women and children, line up.<eos> Life vests will be handed out on the steps.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the ship's crew has ordered a lifeboat drill.<eos> Please put on your life jackets and go up on deck.<eos> Please follow the orders of the crew members immediately.<eos> And please hurry.<eos> - Is it really just a lifeboat drill?<eos> - Please get a life jacket immediately.<eos> - Won't you tell me the truth?<eos> - Yes, I will.
"I must make my stand.<eos> I can do nothing else.<eos> God help me.<eos> Amen."<eos> We had seen the evil coming every day, more and more.<eos> But that festival was the symbol of the end.<eos> It hit Kurt hard.<eos> It doesn't pay in money to fight for what we believe in.<eos> But I wanted it the way Kurt wanted it.<eos> I always will.
You weren't big enough.<eos> - Mama, know what?<eos> - What?<eos> We are not the only deers in the forest.<eos> - Where did you hear that?<eos> - Thumper told me.<eos> Well, he is right.<eos> There are many deers in the forest besides us.<eos> Why I've never have seen them?<eos> - You will, sometime.
Ueda's really small, isn't it, Father?<eos> I thought it was bigger.<eos> Well, Kanazawa's much bigger.<eos> It's the largest city on the Sea of Japan.<eos> You don't like this town?<eos> Why?<eos> I'm thinking of settling here.<eos> So we're moving here?<eos> Will you teach junior high here?<eos> No, I won't.
- Well, I don't pretend.<eos> Well then, what are we talking about?<eos> Well, for instance, right now.<eos> I suggested we walk down here.<eos> - All right, what's wrong with that?<eos> - Right away you thought...<eos> - What? - Well, all the time I only wanted to tell you my idea.<eos> Go ahead and tell me.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I will.
- Hello, Anna.<eos> - Hello, Bobo.<eos> - So long, you two.<eos> - Good-bye.<eos> Good-bye, Nutsy.<eos> Good-bye, Bobo.<eos> Good-bye, Anna.<eos> - Thank you, and come back.<eos> - Anytime.<eos> We will, won't we, Doc?
Guns.<eos> Funny how the sound carries with this east wind.<eos> Mr. Miniver's not back from Dunkirk, I suppose?<eos> No, he's not back.<eos> Neither is my son.<eos> They've been gone five days now.<eos> - Oh, they'll be back, ma'am. You'll see.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'll be very glad to see.<eos> - You will.
And I can't think of a better place.<eos> The Bois de Boulogne, with the stars and the swans.<eos> The swans have been eaten by now. - Oh, Pat, we're late.<eos> What if we're seen?<eos> - What if we are?<eos> I wish you'd stop being so gay and romantic and American about this.<eos> - We've got to get you out of France.<eos> - Mike, aren't you in love with me?<eos> Don't answer that.<eos> I won't.
We got a guy.<eos> Better scatter.<eos> Go down the corridor and through the iron door.<eos> It will take you to the music hall. We'll go this way.<eos> You must go, go at once, before Henry catches you here.<eos> See here, I thought you wanted to make the old boy jealous.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> He's threatened to kill you on sight.<eos> Oh, I say, you don't think he'd go that far, do you?<eos> Of course he will.
Well, I don' t know what to think.<eos> The one that went for young George this morning, I told him to his face he was behaving like a German.<eos> Now, listen, Mrs Collins, you remember that scarecrow in my field signalling to the Germans?<eos> Made a proper laughingstock of meself, didn't I?<eos> - You certainly did.<eos> - Yes, but this is quite different.<eos> And quite as ridiculous.<eos> Well, once bit, twice shy. I'll be trotting along.<eos> We'll let sleeping dogs lie, If you get my meaning.<eos> We will.
If I were you, I'd forget her.<eos> Who?<eos> I can't even remember who you're talking about.<eos> I'm talking about someone...<eos> - who's not good enough for you.<eos> - Beat it.<eos> Go on.<eos> Go home!<eos> Say... don't you ever tell her what I said.<eos> I won't.
I appreciate it indeed.<eos> But even if we hold the castle...<eos> I won't ask jobless samurai to help us.<eos> You're jobless, too, since you were expelled.<eos> It'll be a disgrace to us.<eos> But--<eos> Think over what I said to you carefully, Monza.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> No!<eos> I will!
I won't ask jobless samurai to help us.<eos> You're jobless, too, since you were expelled.<eos> It'll be a disgrace to us.<eos> But--<eos> Think over what I said to you carefully, Monza.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> No!<eos> I will!<eos> No!<eos> I will!
A question.<eos> Wherever we are... we want to avenge our lord.<eos> Can we?<eos> Of course.<eos> As we remember our lord... we can't forget Lord Kira is alive.<eos> We can't let him live on.<eos> I'll join you!<eos> Please let me sign with blood!<eos> Me too!<eos> I will!
I don't know.<eos> I may go back there.<eos> I ought to be hearing from him any day now. Are you crazy about him, Velma?<eos> I guess that lets me out.<eos> But we can still be friends, though, can't we, Roy?<eos> When will we see you again?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I'll be walking in a few days.<eos> You simply must come back to see me walk.<eos> Of course he will.
- You know your scriptures, boy.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Then you know that what's been done before can be done again, for you.<eos> Do you believe me, Huw?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Good.<eos> You will see the first daffodil, out on the mountain.<eos> - Will you?<eos> - Indeed I will, sir.<eos> Then you will.
Good-bye.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'll see them to their car.<eos> Gloria, I had nothing to do with this.<eos> That girl forced me into it.<eos> Have you a handkerchief?<eos> Handkerchief?<eos> Yes.<eos> But don't cry, dear.<eos> I won't.
Yes, I promised that. ─ Look.<eos> Louisa .. how did that happen? She did it. ─ Who?<eos> ─ That woman in London.<eos> She didn't give us enough food, either. ─ "Discipline" she said.<eos> Louisa used to cry all night.<eos> I didn't.<eos> She couldn't discipline me.<eos> We'll be alright here though, won't we with Miss Fiske .. she won't beat us.<eos> No darling, she won't beat you.<eos> No one will again, ever.
You'll never, never know That you've got a friend<eos> You'll never know How good a book is<eos> Till you read it<eos> You really, really do, yeah<eos> You'll never know What a kind word can do<eos> Till you said it You need to say it<eos> But if you say it<eos> You and I could find romance<eos> But, honey Till you take that chance<eos> You'll never, never, never ever
Good morning.<eos> Get!<eos> Good morning, Harold.<eos> Morning, Miss Zan.<eos> What does your papa write from Baltimore?<eos> - He writes that he feels better.<eos> - That's good.<eos> Write him my greetings and tell him don't worry about the brass.<eos> I'm keeping his name fine and clean.<eos> Thanks, I will.
Leo, you're one of the people who bore me.<eos> I'm getting too old to want to be bored.<eos> I'm just getting so I hate it.<eos> You take your nerves out of here and go upstairs and take a warm bath.<eos> That will be good for you.<eos> A nice warm bath.<eos> We agreed you were to stay in your part of this house and I in mine.<eos> This room is my part of the house.<eos> - Please don't come down again.<eos> - I won't.
They won't try to stop us.<eos> - We'll get along.<eos> - I think so.<eos> Then too, I say to myself: Things may change.<eos> I agree with Alexandra.<eos> What was a man in a wheelchair doing on a staircase?<eos> - I ask myself that.<eos> - And what do you answer?<eos> I have no answer.<eos> Maybe someday I will.
Go on, get out all of you!<eos> What do you think this is? Go on, get down to that paper.<eos> Oh, Roger, I'm afraid I'll drown it.<eos> Oh, now, darling, take it easy.<eos> I could drown in that much water.<eos> Now, little peanut... your Uncle Applejack's gonna give you a nice bath.<eos> Give me that wash rag.<eos> I'll never be able to do that.<eos> We'll have to give her back.<eos> Sure you will, darling.
Make it fast.<eos> My time's valuable.<eos> Link would never give me that much.<eos> Why, you've got him eating out of your hand.<eos> You know, I'm a softy myself when it comes to women.<eos> Forget about the money. I'll take this instead.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Link would find out.<eos> Not unless you tell him.<eos> And you won't.
Hey, where does he get off, asking you to call him?<eos> A gent never forces himself on a lady.<eos> Oh, Gil, what are you so sore about?<eos> - You took me home last night, didn't you?<eos> - Well, the body anyway.<eos> Listen, Red, I've got something to suggest.<eos> I seen it coming from a long way off.<eos> - You want me to quit, for instance.<eos> - Yeah, for instance, I do.<eos> Yeah, and for instance, I won't.
Oh, no, not me.<eos> I don't feel like gambling tonight.<eos> Here, Geoff.<eos> You go down and double it for me.<eos> All right.<eos> - When did they put in this flight of stairs?<eos> - Try holding on to the banister, darling.<eos> Oh, now, Geoff.<eos> Sheila, I got something to ask you tonight something important so don't drink any more, will you?<eos> - All right, I won't.
Elsa, there's something I must know. -You do love me, don't you?<eos> I know we both try to be loyal to Geoffrey by hiding our real feelings but now he's coming back and we can't go on pretending.<eos> You do love me, don't you?<eos> Oh, Perry, I've tried so hard not to, but I do love you.<eos> -l knew it.<eos> -But I'm still engaged to him.<eos> We must tell him when he gets here. I must tell him, it's my responsibility.<eos> When he knows how we feel, he won't stand in our way.<eos> -Suppose he doesn't understand?<eos> -He will.
He's in love with you.<eos> You know, he's quite impulsive and he seems to be taking this pretty seriously.<eos> I was very stupid about it and I lost my temper completely.<eos> Now, of course, I could kick myself.<eos> But I don't want him to be hurt more than necessary, you know?<eos> You needn't worry, Geoff.<eos> I shan't be seeing Perry in any case.<eos> Father is being sent to Chukoti and, of course, I'll go with him.<eos> And Perry will soon forget.<eos> Yes, of course he will.
They think there's a force coming to support us.<eos> I'm terribly sorry, sir.<eos> Thank heaven I missed you.<eos> Yeah, lucky for me, you were aiming at me.<eos> Good morning, gentlemen.<eos> I'm more than pleased with the brilliant success of your expedition.<eos> Congratulations, Major Vickers. Major?<eos> Why, thank you, sir.<eos> -l haven't seen it in notice yet.<eos> -You will tomorrow.
That was it.<eos> The flames all around me.<eos> The theater on fire!<eos> And someone locked Gravelle in his dressing room.<eos> Who?<eos> You know.<eos> Tell me. - Anita?<eos> Anita?<eos> - If you tell them I've come back, I'll-<eos> No. No, no, I won't.
Of course not, silly.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Come sit down.<eos> Now all of the obstacles have been cleared.<eos> We're alone, just you and me.<eos> He might do something.<eos> There's no need to worry.<eos> I'm not afraid of whatever he may do as long as I have your love.<eos> You'II stand by me, won't you?<eos> You will, right?
I told you.<eos> I'm just me.<eos> But who is that?<eos> I've often wondered.<eos> You know, the other day when you walked home with me I got to wondering what I wanted you to think of me in case I should ever happen to see you again.<eos> What did you decide?<eos> I decided I should probably never dare to be just myself with you.<eos> Not if I cared to have you want to see me again and yet, here I am, just being myself, after all.<eos> alice, I'd Iike to see you pretty often, if you'II let me.<eos> will you?
That's what I always say to alice, but she never can see any good in herself.<eos> She always sees good in everybody else, no matter how unworthy they are but she always underestimates herself.<eos> Can you fix this?<eos> Look.<eos> Do you think it looks all right?<eos> Fine, perfect.<eos> Dang it.<eos> Anyway, it lets some air in when it bulges.<eos> You mustn't tell alice we've had this little chat about her because she'd be just furious with me.<eos> No, I won't.
What a relief it will be when Vronsky goes back to his regiment, eh?<eos> Won't you relent?<eos> Won't you dance the mazurka with me?<eos> Where is Kitty?<eos> She's entirely surrounded by admiration.<eos> Do you insist on making my evening a total failure?<eos> Kitty, will you dance the mazurka with me? -No.<eos> -It's better you do. Otherwise, it'll look....<eos> All right.<eos> I will.
It's still Toby, isn't it?<eos> I guess it's human nature to fight for anything we love, isn't it, Annie?<eos> I guess so.<eos> But we don't always win.<eos> No, we don't always win.<eos> Here's something I should have given you a long time ago.<eos> Oh, I know what you must be thinking of me.<eos> Oh, I'm only thinking of one thing, Jeff.<eos> We've got to find him.<eos> We will.
If I had, I'd still be safe.<eos> Loving you is the only decent thing I ever did in my life.<eos> Even that was a mistake.<eos> - You sent for me, sir?<eos> - Take Miss Portland to her cabin. - Keep a close watch until further orders.<eos> - Aye, sir.<eos> Well, he's out of it anyway.<eos> He finished the game the way he played it. Yeah, tough.<eos> He didn't yell "no dice" when they rolled against him.<eos> I won't either.
Regi.<eos> Yes?<eos> Will you come out?<eos> I wanna talk to you.<eos> No, not tonight.<eos> I'm very sleepy.<eos> But this is our last night.<eos> Yes, I know. Please come out.<eos> I won't sleep if you don't.<eos> Of course you will.
In there.<eos> - Who is that man?<eos> - The man you're looking for.<eos> The greatest man in Judea sleeping in a stable?<eos> He was born in a stable.<eos> Master, the horses are ready.<eos> Old man, I'm going to Jerusalem to see Pontius Pilate, the governor of Judea.<eos> - He didn't believe me.<eos> - Who would?<eos> He will someday.
Come on, Claude.<eos> We'll go down and root them out.<eos> Claude, dear, I know you have the heart of a lion, but if you want to see your poor, old mother die of heart failure, you go down into that cellar.<eos> Oh, I won't do anything to hurt you.<eos> Indeed, Claude will not accompany you into that cellar.<eos> If anything should happen to Claude, you know very well it would kill my poor mother.<eos> How can you be so selfish?<eos> Oh, wait a minute, Dad.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> Oh, no, you won't, dear.
All right, Dad.<eos> I'll meet you in the hall.<eos> We'll drive down together.<eos> All right, dear.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me, dear.<eos> Don't forget to pay the rent on the way to the office.<eos> Oh, no, I won't.
I feel it incumbent upon me, sir, to see if that coincides with Mr Floud's wishes, sir.<eos> Never mind Mr Floud. He can stay here.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> I think I should speak to Mr Floud, sir.<eos> I won't be kicked by a servant, English or otherwise.<eos> Are you still going to harbour the ruffian?<eos> - He's an anarchist.<eos> - He's an assassin.<eos> I fail to see anything funny about it, Mater.<eos> You will! You will!
It was stolen?<eos> Mistress, you should be more honest.<eos> It was a large sum of money, 60 ryo.<eos> Who'll believe you?<eos> Such a swindler!<eos> What?<eos> What do you mean, a swindler?<eos> It's a swindle!<eos> I'll give you back, so just shut up.<eos> Of course, you will.
Come here!<eos> "False alarm."<eos> You shot off a lot of steam, didn't ya?<eos> I'm a false alarm, am I?<eos> I didn't write it, sir. Man on the paper did it.<eos> I... I tried to stop him from printing it.<eos> Yeah, I guess a lot of guys think I'm a false alarm!<eos> Who's gonna write the rest of these articles?<eos> I'm supposed to, but I'll call the whole thing off.<eos> Not now, you won't!
Let them wait. I want a moment all alone.<eos> But... No, put your arms around me.<eos> Hold me close to you.<eos> I'm frightened of something.<eos> Frightened?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I love you so much.<eos> And that frightens you?<eos> Nothing must happen to you, my Caesar.<eos> Nothing will.
Don't cry.<eos> She'll come back to you.<eos> Give her a little time.<eos> A few hard knocks, and she'll come running back to her mother.<eos> That's what mothers are for!<eos> She'll remember that you're here to turn to.<eos> No, Miss Bea.<eos> I've lost my baby.<eos> She won't ever come back.<eos> Of course she will.
Goodbye.<eos> - Oh, John, what are we gonna do?<eos> - Gosh, I don't know.<eos> Your mother says I'm a crook, and your father thinks I tried to double-cross him.<eos> - I'll probably never see you again.<eos> I'll be way out in California.<eos> How can I?<eos> Listen, I'm going out there too, the first money I get saved, if it's only bus fare.<eos> - You'll forget all about me.<eos> - No, I won't, honey.
You too, Mildred.<eos> Get your things. - Get in there.<eos> - We have to be up early in the morning.<eos> There's no room in the tent for you, dear.<eos> You'll have to curl up before the fire in the easy chair.<eos> - This one?<eos> - No, the deck chair.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Don't forget to put wood on the fire before you go to sleep.<eos> - I won't, dear.
- I won't, dear.<eos> - And no more drinking!<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Good night, dear.<eos> Isn't that music lovely in the open air?<eos> Yes, it is, dear. Yes, it is.<eos> Possibly a couple of Gipsies.<eos> Gypsies.<eos> - Don't forget to put the wood on the fire.<eos> - I won't, dear.
Oh. Well, come on, sit down.<eos> Tell me about yourself.<eos> Remember when we were going to set the world on fire<eos> - with our scientific discoveries?<eos> - Yes. Say, Max, whatever happened to that serum you were working on last time I saw you?<eos> That's what I came to see you about.<eos> Another two months and victory will be mine.<eos> Of course in the meantime, I...<eos> In the meantime, you want me to lend you some money.<eos> Yes. Will you?
Come on, Beverly!<eos> There he goes past Gallant Madam!<eos> Come on, Beverly!<eos> Come on, Beverly!<eos> A close second.<eos> Now can I have a hot dog?<eos> Eleanor, I wouldn't say anything to Jim about... Well, about what we've been talking.<eos> You know, he wouldn't understand.<eos> And anyway, it's just between us.<eos> All right, I won't, Blackie.
A little rye, Phelps.<eos> I'm dead.<eos> Anything you want, Sadie, ask Finnegan for it. Anything.<eos> - You think I could have some coffee?<eos> - Certainly, miss.<eos> Fix a little drink for the lady.<eos> - She's ordered coffee, sir.<eos> - Oh, anything she likes.<eos> - Now don't go away, Sadie.<eos> - I won't.
We pass "I Loved An Artist. "<eos> Well, I hope so.<eos> Meeting's adjourned.<eos> Keep up the good work, my child.<eos> It all seems so hopeless.<eos> Why you, a minister, sitting on the committee and dealing with all this muck?<eos> It may seem strange, but I'm in a position to be more helpful to you and the magazine on the committee than off.<eos> But I still don't see.<eos> Never mind, my child.<eos> You will.
- I'm fine.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> - You're coming along better than I am.<eos> - I hope you're not seriously hurt. - No, just a scratch.<eos> I've forgotten it.<eos> - What a delightful toy.<eos> - That's Asta's Christmas present.<eos> I got word from Wynant this morning.<eos> So did we, I mean, Sherlock here.<eos> - Darling, will you...
Thank you.<eos> Will you sing something for us?<eos> Well, if you don't mind, I'd rather not.<eos> We could tie Droopy up.<eos> Just the same, l-I don't think--<eos> We don't expect you to amuse us for nothing, my man.<eos> He doesn't want your money.<eos> Come on, sailor.<eos> Well, I don't know. l--<eos> Of course he will.
- You're Pauline's fiancé, are you not?<eos> Not yet, Your Highness, but I still have hopes.<eos> - Well...<eos> - And this is Mr Phil Cummings.<eos> - She's a darling.<eos> - She's the finest lady I ever met in my life.<eos> Except you and your mother.<eos> - Thanks, Dad.<eos> Don't drink too much tonight.<eos> - No, I won't.
Well, when you become stage director we'll open in your apartment.<eos> But right now, it's Philadelphia.<eos> Of all the cities in the United States, he would pick Philadelphia.<eos> All right now, listen to me.<eos> We open at the Arch Street Theater tomorrow night.<eos> Why don't you stop that?<eos> Peggy. Getting a kick out of it?<eos> - Of course, you?<eos> I don't know. Do you suppose anybody'll even know I'm in the show?<eos> I will.
Looks like a young war around here.<eos> Lost two men to that killer before.<eos> We're not taking any chances.<eos> - I'm gonna ask you to do something.<eos> - Shoot, what is it?<eos> If you see Danny before this is over, give him a chance to speak first.<eos> - That hoodlum, why?<eos> - For your own sake.<eos> - I don't get you.<eos> - You will.
My country could have no greater tribute than Your Majesty's curiosity.<eos> In honoring your great men, we elevate ourselves.<eos> The Lord Treasurer is waiting, Your Majesty.<eos> I can't see him.<eos> He says it's very urgent.<eos> -Tell him I don't want to see him. -Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> Well, Countess?<eos> The Queen can't see you, Your Excellency.<eos> You mean she won't.<eos> She won't, Your Excellency.
I tell you, she plays beautifully.<eos> Anything!<eos> You'll hear for yourself after dinner.<eos> You'll play for Waldow, won't you, my dear?<eos> - If you like it. - Ah!<eos> There's a wife for you!<eos> Yes.<eos> And dance!<eos> Y-You haven't danced with her yet, have you, Waldow?<eos> You will!
Well, I'll tell you why.<eos> Because our folks have got enough worry without us bringing them more.<eos> But don't you realize all of you are making a bad matter worse?<eos> If you have no address or no one to be responsible for you the law won't let me be lenient.<eos> Why don't you youngsters come clean?<eos> Tell me the whole story.<eos> Let me be your friend.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> Sure.<eos> Will you, Tommy?
That's the first time you've ever done that.<eos> - Ain't the first time I felt like doing it.<eos> I don't mind telling you I've wanted to do this for a long time.<eos> - We're all set now, Venus?<eos> - All set now. - Yeah.<eos> Please do.<eos> Don't you want to make me happy?<eos> - Yes, but I don't know what to say.<eos> - Just say yes, dear.<eos> Will you?
Oh, Annie, Annie, come in here, dear, and congratulate your sister.<eos> She's going to get married.<eos> To Bill?<eos> Yes, dear.<eos> Oh, gee!<eos> Annie!<eos> Ruth gets the best of everything.<eos> Can't you wait a little while, Bill?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Sure he will, won't you, Bill?
- Hello, Nayland.<eos> I brought Terry along.<eos> Have you heard anything?<eos> If I knew anything, I'd tell you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sit down. Sit down, Sheila.<eos> I'll be with you in just a moment.<eos> Sheila, you've got to be very brave.<eos> Oh, Nayland, I won't believe my father's dead.<eos> No, no, no, neither will I.
Remember our first?<eos> We thought it was our last.<eos> You never can tell.<eos> Four glorious weeks.<eos> So many happy hours.<eos> And there's so many more, too.<eos> Aren't there, Dan?<eos> Of course, dear.<eos> We mustn't miss one of them.<eos> We won't, dear.
Sit down.<eos> You're gonna stay for a while.<eos> - Well?<eos> - Can't get a thing on him.<eos> A blind alley wherever we go.<eos> Gaffney turned yellow and is hiding out.<eos> - What about Lovo?<eos> - He's as scared as Gaffney.<eos> It's Camonte but we can't prove it yet.<eos> - We will.
Marcus!<eos> I intended to see you sooner.<eos> Oh, Marcus.<eos> I couldn't understand why you didn't.<eos> I was called to the palace.<eos> And then this banquet's been raging since noon.<eos> Marcus, I told you last night... my life means more now than...<eos> Suddenly everything changed.<eos> I wanted to live.<eos> You will, Mercia.
It was horrible.<eos> I couldn't believe it.<eos> But why should you go, too?<eos> Didn't you hear my promise that I would follow him?<eos> You must live, Mercia.<eos> No, Marcus, I must follow them.<eos> Then if you die, I shan't live either.<eos> You must live.<eos> If only because someday you may know what I know now.<eos> I never will, not without you.
Oh, yes, you will, my dear Oh, yes, you will, my dear<eos> You'll wear garters And you'll like it, too<eos> Oh, no, I won't, my dear Oh, no, I won't, my dear<eos> I'll wash behind the ears But, no, I won't, my dear<eos> Oh, yes, you will, my dear Oh, yes, you will, my dear<eos> You'll eat spinach But you'll wear garters, too<eos> Oh, you can't carry a tune You can't carry a tune<eos> All you are good for Is to sit and spoon, spoon<eos> - Oh, no, I won't wear garters<eos> - Oh, yes, you will, too
- Oh, there must be something.<eos> Here, here you go, young lad. There.<eos> This is the last mail I deliver anyhow.<eos> - What?<eos> - Tomorrow I change uniforms.<eos> - You're going in the army?<eos> - Yes, I was called.<eos> I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.<eos> I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months.<eos> - It will, though.
I maintain, after many years of comparative analyses, that primitive moon-rock contains more gold than the earth's mountains.<eos> One day, the first spaceship will fly to the moon, to bring its gold back to the earth!<eos> Laughter, gentlemen, is the argument of idiots against every new idea -!<eos> The progress of the world will not fail due to learned ignoramuses lacking in fantasy whose brains work in inverse proportion to their calcification -!<eos> Professor - I've decided to go...<eos> But not without me, Helius - not without me -!<eos> Now your idea will triumph after all, Professor...<eos> Naturally Windegger will go along?<eos> What -?<eos> Windegger won't -?
We go all the time.<eos> - That was it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Why did we go past it?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> Just follow Londet.<eos> They get right to it. I just noticed there aren't any subtitles.<eos> I sort of get the gist of it anyway.<eos> She's so pretty.<eos> Why would she..?
- I'm comin' in. - Come on.<eos> You know what?<eos> There used to be this old farmer that lived round here... with a BB gun.<eos> - Sure hope he's moved away.<eos> - Yeah. Me too.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Get out... There's somethin' flicking' around my...<eos> - Those are minnows. - Those are what?<eos> - Minnows. They won't hurt you.<eos> - They'd better not.
You'll be escorted back to the Allied military mission.<eos> Out of harm's way?<eos> Sir I could leave the Germans some very nasty surprises.<eos> Thank you, sergeant.<eos> I think we have had enough surprises.<eos> Captain Lescovar, see that these gentlemen have an escort of two men.<eos> If those chaps had just half the equipment of the Jerries I could've made that dam look like a Swiss cheese.<eos> It's absolutely sickening.<eos> Do you think the Jerries will have that gear we need in their supply dump?<eos> Of course they would.
Don't give me that.<eos> Tomorrow all the papers'll be talking about you just like in the good old days. How I wish.<eos> But the bookies are giving 10 to one odds, you know what that means.<eos> Would you believe my brother's betting $50,000 on you?<eos> $50,000?<eos> Your brother's loco, you better get him to the nut house right away.<eos> Yeah, I know, he's been that way for years.<eos> I'm the guy they gotta watch.<eos> Would you please make an offering for the orphans?<eos> Would you please, an offering please?
No one told me anything about it.<eos> Have a look over there and you'll see why.<eos> Now, Blackavar.<eos> The new officer, sir, he's gone.<eos> Bigwig?<eos> He's wounded Sherbil and taken a crowd of the mark with him.<eos> I'll blind him. I'll blind him!<eos> - Bigwig, where's the bird?<eos> - He'll be here.<eos> He'd better!
Weigh anchor tomorrow? No.<eos> We'll stay dockside for two more days.<eos> I prefer to set sail on the Sabbath.<eos> Seems the Christian thing to do.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Slater.<eos> -Do you know what Sitafa said today?<eos> -How would I?
You must swear you'll never tattle about this.<eos> -l swear.<eos> -On the Bible.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Here it is.<eos> My old Bible.<eos> Now kiss your little finger and swear.<eos> I swear.<eos> If you ever tattle, you'll be damned to hell.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't never, Missy Anne.
Traveling comes naturally to number three, as he's a licensed airplane pilot.<eos> Welcome, please, Enormous Genitals!<eos> Guard number one, you're out on your first date, it is too late to see a movie.<eos> What do you propose to do?<eos> Well... First, we walk on the beach to the moonlight.<eos> Then I play love songs on my guitar.<eos> And the next morning...<eos> Butkus!<eos> Guard number two, if I were asleep, and you were my alarm clock, how would you wake me up in the morning?<eos> I wouldn't.
- How long?<eos> - Until you die, properly.<eos> And it'll take long?<eos> Seconds, minutes, years. What do I know?<eos> - It mustn't be like that. - Yes, Jenny.<eos> It must be exactly like that.<eos> - Opening this door makes no difference.<eos> - Your logic is impeccable.<eos> - Do you know what's in there?<eos> - How would I?
Unzip the suit, unsnap the rear panels, hook up the boots, and attach the life support system.<eos> Then snap up the mask, buckle the gloves, zip up the suit, snap up the rear panels.<eos> Presto, change-o.<eos> - Any questions?<eos> - Is somebody gonna help us?<eos> How we gonna know we got it on right?<eos> Simply look for these tell-tale signs:<eos> Profuse bleeding of the gums, hair falling out, and intermittent blindness.<eos> - Wouldn't stop my father's gas.<eos> - Nothing would.
Why don't you eat with us?<eos> Just this once.<eos> Don't you like us?<eos> I don't like the way you order people around and expect them to obey.<eos> That was some blow!<eos> Philippe!<eos> Your girlfriend won't eat with us.<eos> - We made reservations.<eos> - You shouldn't exclude us.<eos> - We'd rather not.
I love you on television.<eos> I love to watch you shave.<eos> But they were football players.<eos> All football players are faggots.<eos> Closet queens.<eos> I heard details.<eos> I won't annoy you.<eos> I'll always admire you, if only from afar.<eos> Someday I'd love to shave you.<eos> Really, I would.
You want that mitre!<eos> Yes, it's true... and I do get money from England.<eos> But having an English alliance has made France richer too.<eos> They say money has no religion. Money is Protestant, so 4 Catholic heads must fall.<eos> But they won't.<eos> Then please accept my resignation.<eos> You've never threatened that before.<eos> And it takes guts. I'm afraid you'll accept!<eos> You'd give up the mitre?<eos> Unwillingly... but I would.
SOME HOTSHOT BROTHER.<eos> ARETHA, PLEASE.<eos> WHERE WERE YOU WHEN HE NEEDED YOUR HELP?<eos> WHAT KIND OF HELP?<eos> THERE'S NOTHIN' YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW EXCEPT FOR TO FIND THE TIME TO COME AND BURY HIM, AND COLLECT HIS STUFF AND SPLIT!<eos> ARETHA, NOW--<eos> AREN'T YOU GONNA STAY?<eos> NO, HE'S NOT GONNA STAY,<eos> HE WOULDN'T DIRTY THAT SHOESHINE IN THIS COW PASTURE.<eos> WOULD YOU, MR. DUKE JOHNSON?
SHIT, MAN, HE JUST NEVER GOT CAUGHT BEFORE.<eos> WHAT IF I TOLD YOU I HAVE WITNESSES?<eos> NOW, I'M NOT DRAWING ANY CONCLUSIONS.<eos> WITNESSES WHO'VE TOLD ME THAT CORNBREAD COULDN'T HAVE COMMITTED ANY CRIME.<eos> THAT THEY ACTUALLY SAW HIM P DRINKING A BOTTLE OF PO IN A GROCERY STORE AT THE TIME.<eos> SO THAT-- THAT MEANS I'M LYING, RIGHT?<eos> OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, LARRY.<eos> I'M SURE YOU DID WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS RIGHT.<eos> MAYBE I'D HAVE DONE THE SAME THING.<eos> OH, WOULD YOU, BEN?
After dinner, Giovanna. After dinner.<eos> Hello, Franco.<eos> Hello, miss.<eos> No bra...<eos> - Well, Franco, have you done your homework? - Of course.<eos> This is good.<eos> There's a mistake here.<eos> You used the perfect instead of the pluperfect. - You see it?<eos> - I see, I see.<eos> Who wouldn't?
That is what you want, i know it... that we go on with the mission, and right now.<eos> But you knew me better than them:<eos> You would never have entrusted me with the purse.<eos> Sing something.<eos> Yes, but what?<eos> Anything but a church song.<eos> The grass no longer grows<eos> The bee no longer flies<eos> The mouth no longer kisses<eos> But I would like
Only our strength and will.<eos> We do not need guards with Hsi the brothers at his side.<eos> We have seen the reaction to my speech the University.<eos> Nobody believed in me except you, my friend.<eos> In the mountains of Transilvania the legends vampíricas has much strength.<eos> Almost feel terror, is something of tangible.<eos> But here until I need evidence.<eos> And would unite themselves to us if we had this evidence?<eos> Yes, if the expedition could be done ...<eos> Yes, of course I would you.
There's one peeping at you down there.<eos> Oh, not really.<eos> My husband... Will he come back?<eos> - What else do you know about him?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> But I know everything about you.<eos> One look and I know it all.<eos> - Then perhaps you'd like to tell me.<eos> - "Perhaps you'd like to tell me."<eos> Perhaps I wouldn't...
Run.<eos> I'm thirsty<eos> The last of your former smokes<eos> The best one<eos> You threw them away, didn't you?<eos> What are you staring at?<eos> I can stare at you as much as I please, woman<eos> Think I'm staring at your ass?<eos> Big deal!<eos> As if I would
We killed him last night.<eos> Tied him to the car and...<eos> Dragged him.<eos> Right.<eos> This is gonna take some thinking.<eos> You better come with us, maybe.<eos> Take a ride with the Pharaohs. Huh?<eos> No.<eos> Listen. I'd really like to, but I... I've got to...<eos> I'd rather... I'd rather...
Passenger Pivert.<eos> Would M. Pivert, come to the information counter!<eos> - They're here.<eos> - Arkoum, Slimane and Pivert.<eos> Division chief!<eos> Good timing. They just paged Pivert.<eos> Block the exits and let's go!<eos> But, careful, he's a killer!<eos> Please, Mlle, try again.<eos> Would passenger Piver...
Buy one of those, uh, big houses. You know, out in Beverly Hills someplace.<eos> Get a record company for her.<eos> Set her up in the recording business.<eos> If her records don't sell, you buy 'em.<eos> OK?<eos> I'll be out when I can.<eos> I gave her the best.<eos> I never really made her happy, Rufus.<eos> I'd like to pray for her.<eos> I really would.
- It's gorgeous.<eos> It's so... It's really bright, is what it...<eos> Oh, goodness.<eos> Oh, I have it all over me.<eos> Here. I got it.<eos> Chicken.<eos> Behave yourself.<eos> - How pretty!<eos> - I like that one.<eos> Well, who wouldn't?
He didn't tell you what she did?<eos> He didn't mention her.<eos> Priests are pretty tight-mouthed then?<eos> That depends.<eos> -On what?<eos> -The priest.<eos> I mean, what if a person came to you, you know, that was a murderer or a criminal of some kind and they wanted some kind of help?<eos> Would you have to turn them in?<eos> Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice, I'd say no.<eos> -You wouldn't? -No, I wouldn't.
Where you going?<eos> The bank.<eos> Today is Labor Day.<eos> Why?<eos> You closed all banks?<eos> I go to the office.<eos> Jacques, went to his office, the other day ...<eos> You wasn't there.<eos> I mean, the address gave me wasn't there.<eos> What a girl like you would in an office?
Come, it's almost midnight.<eos> The alcove is in that gazebo and in that crystal magic place, you'll love Aziza<eos> It'll start soon, and the cockrow'll announce the end.<eos> From the Queen's balconey, a master of ceremony will give the results, step by steps.<eos> Are you agree with the rules, Rajih El Malouk?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'd like to add a condition.<eos> A condition?<eos> Wich one?<eos> I'd like in between each...
Cold up here.<eos> What brings you up so high?<eos> Griz.<eos> Avalanche took the cabin.<eos> Lost my mule.<eos> We swum out of it.<eos> But no matter.<eos> Weren't no griz left anyway.<eos> Would you happen to know what month of the year it is?<eos> No, I truly wouldn't.
Poor you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Why turn me down?<eos> I thought you liked me.<eos> So?<eos> I'm not in love, thanks.<eos> But I'm suffering.<eos> please, as a favor.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> As if I would.
It was all right.<eos> I was born and went to school.<eos> Hmm. That's good.<eos> I had a mother and a father and a little brother and a lawn.<eos> Terrific.<eos> I was always going to art classes, and my mother was always going to the doctor.<eos> It was all right.<eos> Why'd you leave, then?<eos> Don't just go around leaving people for no reason.<eos> I wouldn't.
Put it in a box and tie it with a ribbon.<eos> Now who's depraved?<eos> Alright, Romeo, what about your wife?<eos> All she wants to do is eat.<eos> Then you've got something in common.<eos> Hey, where's Tony?<eos> Isn't it time for the second show?<eos> He's in the dressing room getting ready.<eos> Having trouble?<eos> With these things, who wouldn't?
- I'll buy that.<eos> - Samantha, you should encourage him.<eos> I do!<eos> I've been after him for weeks to paint the kitchen.<eos> Well, that is not exactly what I had in mind.<eos> Do you know what a woman would give to have a portrait like that?<eos> Darrin, I think that's a subtle hint setting you up for something.<eos> - It is?<eos> - Like your painting her picture.<eos> - Would you, Darrin?
Yes, once more.<eos> -I don't want to. -Yes, you do!<eos> I want to go home. Don't even think about it!<eos> -Just sit down and ride!<eos> -Don't tickle me!<eos> Let's go!<eos> This time it'll be better.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> You won't mind if I go out for a while?<eos> I would.
- The little one with the big... boobs.<eos> - Yeah, I know. Yeah.<eos> Well, anyway, I... I wasn't gonna fool around out here because I got these... I got these three girls that I'm engaged to back home.<eos> And you wanted to be faithful.<eos> Baby, you are 7,000 miles from home.<eos> Well, anyway, I took her out last night and I... I failed.<eos> - You mean she wouldn't put out?<eos> - She wanted to, but it was me. I couldn't...<eos> - Oh, you couldn't...<eos> It wouldn't...
You can't cart them off 100 miles, expecting them to attack without rest.<eos> I trained these men.<eos> They'll do what I tell them to do.<eos> We hadn't realized you were so popular with your troops, general.<eos> I'm not.<eos> They'll do it because they're good soldiers.<eos> And because they realize, as I do, that we can still lose this war.<eos> Then I think I can speak for Field Marshal Montgomery.<eos> He'd say you're asking the impossible of your men.<eos> Of course he would.
Look, I read somewhere, a famous psychologist once said that if your kids see you pat your wife on the fanny and she looks like she likes it, then it gives them a healthy attitude towards sex.<eos> That was for Ginny's benefit, was it?<eos> Right!<eos> Virge, if you're feeling so fatherly, why don't you go upstairs and fix the curtain rod in Andy's room?<eos> Consider it done.<eos> There are some new developments.<eos> I don't know how important they are yet.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> Hi, Andy.<eos> - Dad, I wouldn't...
- I say he's a mouse.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> We'll see.<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> I'll give him until midnight to withdraw his ultimatum.<eos> If he does, he's a man.<eos> If he doesn't, he's a mouse.<eos> You... You wouldn't dare!<eos> - Permanently.<eos> - You would.
If you want, I'll get rid of the kid for you. I can take him back.<eos> -No, I'll take care of it.<eos> What's so urgent you had to tell me?<eos> I won't speak in front of him.<eos> Saddle my horse, please Raymond.<eos> As you wish, Miss.<eos> -Was it your father who sent you?<eos> -No. I came because I don't understand anything.<eos> So, you have to explain it to me.<eos> Would you?
- You didn't? - No.<eos> Then where is he?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Now, Mother, let's be calm about this.<eos> I am calm.<eos> I'm positively serene.<eos> It's you who are all stoked up.<eos> Mother, Darrin's gone, and somebody's got him.<eos> Who'd want him?<eos> Now, who would...
It was Quinquin, not Léon, who called you, wasn't it?<eos> Why do you think?<eos> To kill you.<eos> Now, listen carefully.<eos> You'll get him to meet you where I say.<eos> And you'll go.<eos> So he can kill me?<eos> No, to offer him a job worth 2 billion.<eos> And he'll listen?<eos> For that money, anyone would.
- You're right. I am an S.O.B.<eos> Oh, boy. This kid's fantastic.<eos> He runs! He runs! And he runs for hours and hours.<eos> He doesn't care. He swims in any kind of weather.<eos> Oh, boy. I'm tellin' ya, I don't know where these kids get the energy.<eos> You ever see these Ivy League kids?<eos> They all look alike — skinny shoulders, sneakers.<eos> I don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> I — I think that Dickie... would like to be alone with the young lady.<eos> Oh, sure. Who wouldn't? I would too.
We must thank you for your good work, Master Witchfinder.<eos> Thank you, Magistrate, for your aid.<eos> - Witchfinder!<eos> - Greetings, Stearne.<eos> Is that all you've got to say after leaving me there with Cromwell's men?<eos> Well, I provided us both with the opportunity to escape.<eos> Only you did and I was captured.<eos> Fortunes of war, Stearne.<eos> You know me well enough to know that I wouldn't hesitate to fire and kill you.<eos> Aye, you would that.
- I'm sorry, Mother.<eos> - No, darling.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I've never done one like that before.<eos> - It was a fluke. - Honest.<eos> Well, shall I serve again?<eos> Uh...<eos> - Why don't we swim instead? - Oh, yes!<eos> - I mean, if you'd like to.<eos> - I would if you would. - Gertrude!
Clown!<eos> Do your worst.<eos> Explode them.<eos> Not polite to point.<eos> A thing of beauty.<eos> Destroy it forever!<eos> Sir, the Blue Meanies are coming!<eos> Not here, young Fred.<eos> They wouldn't dare.<eos> They would!
Compared with my life, Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl.<eos> Nothing ever happens to me.<eos> I feel like an old splintered drumstick.<eos> I'd jump into the River Mersey, but it looks like rain.<eos> Nothing ever happens to me.<eos> Puss, puss, puss.<eos> Hey, pussy.<eos> Here, pussy.<eos> Would you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a yellow submarine?<eos> - No, I would not. - Oh, yeah.
I may have certain designs on the mare.<eos> In that case you have priority.<eos> That's settled then.<eos> So you've bought the Baron's mare?<eos> You tricked him.<eos> Thanks to you I won a wager with auntie.<eos> We've only come to see this race.<eos> Don't let us down, my beauty.<eos> You must win.<eos> If you would...
- Yes.<eos> Oh, nothing. Hm.<eos> It would be different if they looked alike. Doubles.<eos> I mean, that's been done before.<eos> But swapping psyches, I ask you ...<eos> Anyway, I know an old Etonian when I meet one. I can promise you, that chap in there is no gentleman.<eos> One thing is certain.<eos> They don't believe us.<eos> Well, let's be fair.<eos> Would you?
- You mean, is that really true?<eos> - Yes, that's really true.<eos> Oh, Mom.<eos> Joey, I want to ask you something.<eos> How deeply are you and John in... No, I have no right to ask.<eos> How deeply involved?<eos> Do you mean, have we been to bed together?<eos> I don't mind you asking me that.<eos> We haven't.<eos> He wouldn't.
OK.<eos> Put it back.<eos> I hit Ceece once. Not like that, with a four-pound T-bone steak.<eos> He half killed me. Then we made love.<eos> Living with him...<eos> Lawd-a-mighty, the way he went at life.<eos> Like he wanted to live it, minute by minute.<eos> There was this... secret ambition he had.<eos> You'd never guess.<eos> Nobody would.
Any scars?<eos> Moles?<eos> Marks?<eos> Would you like the sordid details?<eos> Anything.<eos> Is that how you get your kicks?<eos> She had to be a contortionist.<eos> I guess you know why we're really here?<eos> You know we wouldn't have come this far just to arrest two-bit check chiselers.<eos> Would we, Dick?
But why do you ask?<eos> I don't want to do anything you might disapprove of.<eos> I trust you in everything.<eos> You mean a lot to me, you've been such a help.<eos> The same announcement also said that Bolkonsky's in the army again.<eos> Do you think he'll be able to forgive me one day?<eos> Or will he always hold it against me?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think he has nothing to forgive.<eos> In his place, I would...
Only that you're still alive, Senator Townsend.<eos> Everyone will find that out when the time is right<eos> - and not before.<eos> - And when will that be?<eos> When we have wiped every Communist from the face of this earth.<eos> R.J., call the police.<eos> Tell them you have the escaped convicts.<eos> And you might also mention that you were forced to kill them when they broke into your house.<eos> You wouldn't want to kill us with the entire country watching,<eos> - would you, Senator?
Sam.<eos> The baby is crying.<eos> She probably wants her bottle.<eos> Okay, I'll be a good father and get it myself.<eos> Darrin, the baby is crying.<eos> She had me up and down all night long.<eos> So would you mind if just this once I gave her her bottle by...?<eos> You wouldn't?
It ain't funny. C.P.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> I told you before. I'll tell you again.<eos> Ballinger. lt was no joke.<eos> The lady meant it.<eos> That's what these damn fools are laughing at. if you really wanna know.<eos> It isn't me they're laughing at?<eos> Hell no. C.P.<eos> It'd be dangerous for any man in this room to be laughing at you.<eos> Now. wouldn't it. C.P.?
- None of you has?<eos> Because you gentlemen represented the railroad.<eos> - We did?<eos> - And lost the case.<eos> Suppose we get back to the Hinkle case.<eos> - You should bone up on negligence.<eos> - We've seen the hospital report.<eos> - Discouraging, isn't it?<eos> - We don't accept it at face value.<eos> - I wouldn't either.
Radiant as in some dream come true<eos> Now Venus will seem tame<eos> Helen and her thousand ships will have to die of shame<eos> You're so lovely<eos> Frighteningly lovely<eos> That the world will never seem the same<eos> I'm lovely<eos> Absolutely lovely<eos> Who'd believe the loveliness of me?<eos> I would.
Well, that's too bad.<eos> - As a matter of fact...<eos> - No, as a matter of fact, you're wrong.<eos> His death did nothing but serve the cause of mankind.<eos> He was a fool, a sadist, a functioning pathological pervert.<eos> You mean he actually...<eos> Oh, but I do.<eos> Oh, he was grotesque in all ways.<eos> I mean, can a soul be atrocious?<eos> Well, I'd never...
Best hot dog I ever tasted.<eos> Soft.<eos> Like down.<eos> What kind of color is that, baby?<eos> Grape Yum-yum.<eos> Look at this.<eos> - Banana Beige.<eos> -Oh, no.<eos> Would the young lady like to slip one on for size?<eos> - Would you?
Now, let's see.<eos> Yeah, this ought to do it.<eos> What are you doing, master?<eos> I am putting my uncle Jeff and my aunt Susan in a crystal ball.<eos> Abracadabra, Zelamizoo You're uncle Jeff and auntie Sue<eos> It works.<eos> That's really great.<eos> You'd never think they'd been dead for 20 years, would you?<eos> - No.<eos> - You certainly wouldn't.
You really want to know?<eos> The first full moon.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We're 50 miles from the nearest town... and I don't care to play tag in the dark with your friends.<eos> Just where do you suppose we're gonna sleep?<eos> That answer your question?<eos> Your own little sex wagon.<eos> You gonna lock me in?<eos> - Lf you don't run away.<eos> - Wouldn't I?
I have to get home.<eos> It's our 25th wedding anniversary tomorrow. I've never missed one.<eos> What's in there?<eos> That's the god of fertility.<eos> I meant to leave it for them.<eos> They won't need it.<eos> It would make a nice present for Lady Rutland.<eos> We already have four children.<eos> They're practically grown up.<eos> She wouldn't...
Monsieur could have a Muscadet.<eos> Is that dry or sweet?<eos> - Rather dry.<eos> - I'd prefer something sweet.<eos> A Sauternes, then.<eos> - Is that sweet?<eos> - Very sweet.<eos> - Too sweet?<eos> - A demi-sec, perhaps?<eos> No. I'd rather a demi-sweet.
But why do you ask?<eos> I don't want to do anything you might disapprove of.<eos> I trust you in everything.<eos> You mean a lot to me, you've been such a help.<eos> The same announcement also said that Bolkonsky's in the army again.<eos> Do you think he'll be able to forgive me one day?<eos> Or will he always hold it against me?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think he has nothing to forgive.<eos> In his place, I would...
I couldn't see around her with 40 pounds of her over my head.<eos> - I could just hold on and pray.<eos> - She was rich and you passed it up? Not exactly.<eos> Things happened to ...<eos> alter the course of true love.<eos> Somebody else liked my singing.<eos> This other girl was half as big and twice as pretty.<eos> One night I sent Toy to bed. I told her I had to shoe a horse.<eos> - At night? Who'd believe that?<eos> - Toy would.
I hope his death will not involve us, my lord<eos> And, when?<eos> It's already begun, sir<eos> Already?<eos> I heard you resigned. Why?<eos> Sorry. Excuse me<eos> Trying to kill Kiyokawa?<eos> Whose order? Matsudaira?<eos> Higher up? - Want to stop me?<eos> - I would
You mean I got to spend the night in this dump?<eos> They just opened a brand-new motel here.<eos> He wouldn't like it.<eos> It stinks. How can you say that?<eos> It's got all the modern conveniences.<eos> Didn't you hear what happened? A skunk got into the air conditioning.<eos> I don't care where I sleep.<eos> Just find me an empty pool table.<eos> I'm sure Mr. Spooner would be glad... to put you up for the night.<eos> Wouldn't you, Orville? Me?
You do?<eos> Why do you think I got married? To get away from her.<eos> Oh, so that's the reason why you married me.<eos> Not the only reason.<eos> I also love you.<eos> Oh. Here are some pictures from our honeymoon.<eos> Honeymoon?<eos> Boy, was that ever a flop.<eos> I wouldn't say that.<eos> Oh, you wouldn't?
Schnell, Schell! The light!<eos> - Miss, aren't you coming down?<eos> Why not?<eos> Ill take you to the shelter.<eos> No, there are people there.<eos> People will see me.<eos> It's dangerous here.<eos> We're close to the port, a military target.<eos> - I don't want a bomb to fall on us.<eos> - If only it would!
Radha too?<eos> Or Radha only?<eos> I don't know... but I'm going!<eos> " - But of course, you won't"<eos> "Leave her alone.<eos> For her, it has" just begun.<eos> Let it happen<eos> What better a match for Radha?<eos> "Now, how would I know all that?"<eos> - How would you?
What about those influential parties that wanted Clouseau on the case?<eos> Whatever they do to me now... it is not half of what he has done already.<eos> Besides... I feel certain I know who is behind those influential requests.<eos> - Ballon.<eos> - Ballon?<eos> It's obvious he was having an affair with Maria Gambrelli.<eos> Most likely.<eos> At first I couldn't understand why anyone... would want a man like Clouseau to be in charge of a murder case.<eos> Especially a case of this importance.<eos> - But why would Ballon?

Why not?<eos> Well, I don't think Tegana's the kind of man who goes for a walk just because it's a nice night.<eos> I think he goes because he has a reason to go.<eos> - Susan, why would he lie to Messr Marco?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> He's an important man.<eos> He's a special emissary of the great Mongol leader who has been at war with Kublai Khan.<eos> Tegana is to arrange a peaceful settlement between them.<eos> Would a man like that lie about walking in the desert?<eos> No, no he wouldn't.
You looking after my camera? Of course.<eos> It's a bit complicated, though. However, I did manage to take those pictures<eos> - at Wonderland for you. - Good.<eos> What do you want them for?<eos> It's for a friend of mine. He's gonna open a little arcade...<eos> Hey, it's somewhere out near where you live. - Manchester? - That's right, yes.<eos> I was a little busy, otherwise I'd have done it myself.<eos> Anyway, I thought you'd like to see really how a professional's camera worked.<eos> All right, I'll believe you.<eos> Thousands wouldn't.
They know nothing, they think it's a hot water system.<eos> - We really must tell them soon.<eos> -Father will explode.<eos> He's against space. Father-<eos> - I wonder you would mind if I took some more pictures.<eos> -Take as many as you like.<eos> -So sorry.<eos> Right. Now.<eos> [ Camera Shutter Clicks ]<eos> Actually, would you--
Now, don't be insolent.<eos> All I want is a little information about Mr. Hector and that old lady.<eos> You'll get no information out of me.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Are you hiding something?<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> - Now, let me get on with my work.<eos> - Now, calm down, Hillman.<eos> I think that old lady is trying to make trouble for Mr. Hector.<eos> - She'd better not.
Unless you don't want to put your handwriting to a felonious transaction.<eos> - Don't be silly.<eos> - It's not so silly.<eos> You know the state of my account better than anybody.<eos> They could easily prove it.<eos> Then I'll join you in jail, won't I?<eos> Be kind of a pleasure, wouldn't it?<eos> I'm afraid your youth and innocence would get you off, though.<eos> Could always say you acted under superior orders.<eos> Oh, I never would.
Or I'll reportyou to the Commander, and you'll bring it to us on your back.<eos> Come on, stop it.<eos> He'll give us a boat.<eos> Am I right?<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go have a look.<eos> You stay here and rest up.<eos> Wow! What a knife!<eos> Listen, Galtsev, would you give it to me?<eos> I would, Vanya, but...
- Chase fish for feast.<eos> You like go?<eos> Go ask him.<eos> Go on.<eos> I'll ask him.<eos> - There.<eos> Now, you see the new roots.<eos> - I beg your pardon, sir.<eos> Almost like little veins, aren't they, stretching down into the earth?<eos> - Would you just...
Yeah.<eos> Is that clear to you, Inspector?<eos> - Probably.<eos> - Of course it's clear.<eos> Wraps the whole thing up, doesn't it?<eos> Now, Gridley, it's been said that there will always be an England, and I'd like to do my part to keep it that way.<eos> How would you like an assignment back in the States?<eos> Would I?<eos> Would I?<eos> We would.
After we danced.<eos> Can I have a drink of water, please?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Where did all this happen?<eos> In his room.<eos> It's on the top floor.<eos> It's got a private stairs and a front door and everything.<eos> I'd like to live there.<eos> Would you, darling?
Warn the hospital.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And you'd better round up as many foresters as you can find.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, Captain!<eos> Captain Hammond!<eos> There's an old trapper's hut further on.<eos> This boat must have come from there.<eos> Captain Hammond, sir!<eos> No, I wouldn't.
That's what all these loony laws are for, to be broken by blokes like us.<eos> You might cop it one of these days.<eos> Perhaps you won't be so cocky, once you settle down.<eos> - I shan't be doing that for a while.<eos> - There's naught wrong with married life.<eos> I'm married.<eos> Went into it with my eyes open.<eos> Married life's all right if you're good to each other and not too bossy.<eos> I believe you, then.<eos> Thousands wouldn't.
That's Wichita whisky.<eos> Aged four minutes. Not long enough to cure whatever's in it.<eos> - I know, but I need it.<eos> - So do I.<eos> My own little baby. My own little baby getting married!<eos> Charlie, he said yes!<eos> Now tell me truth, girl.<eos> Do you love him, Rachel?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Wouldn't any girl?
You have been very ill, mr. Ellington. You've suffered delirium.<eos> Oh, now don't tell me you didn't hear that.<eos> Honest men make unconvincing liars.<eos> I'll find out eventually, you know?<eos> What do you mean? Just what i say.<eos> The police will be very interested to learn that you people are keeping a man in prison here.<eos> I tell you, there is no man! All right, just forget it.<eos> Mr. Ellington... yes?<eos> Would you really go to the police?<eos> Would you?
Have you told jimmy yet?<eos> I tried tojust now.<eos> Hey, lovely, you've got to tell him.<eos> Oh, you've done wonders with it, son.<eos> Now, what's the time?<eos> You've got plenty of time yet.<eos> Oh, we had lots of fun, him and me, bein' alive, you know, just bein' alive.<eos> That's enough for an old girl like me, chewing' the cud and havin' a nip of what you fancy.<eos> Wouldn't do if we was all like that, would it, mate, eh?<eos> Would it, mate?
- Compliments, for example.<eos> Although they have the same curiosities, that need looking at.<eos> As you say: "they need looking at".<eos> Lucette... remember, no hanky-panky.<eos> Oh no, M. Tiercelin, we're not talking about that.<eos> Mind you, at the end of the day... I could, perhaps, just like any other man... although not for much longer at my age.<eos> How old are you?<eos> Already too old to confess.<eos> - I wouldn't say that.<eos> - And actually, nor would I.
- Know what, Maggie?<eos> That I've gone through this horrible transformation.<eos> I've become hard and frantic and cruel.<eos> Are you planning on meeting Big Daddy's plane?<eos> I get so lonely.<eos> Everybody gets that.<eos> Living with somebody you love can be lonelier than living entirely alone when the one you love doesn't love you.<eos> You can't even stand drinking out of the same glass, can you?<eos> Would you like to live alone?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
I'm no virgin, but my record is still clean.<eos> You'll know the beginning by reading my passport and the rest by taking me in your arms.<eos> Simple, isn't it?<eos> Do you know what you want?<eos> Yes. Actually I do.<eos> You know you're no piece of cake.<eos> - Don't do that again.<eos> - Why not?<eos> You'd strike?<eos> Really? Would you?
Yeah, so have I.<eos> But I've got mine with my daughter, though.<eos> Mrs. Delafield?<eos> Yes. My name is Gideon,<eos> Inspector Gideon of Scotland yard.<eos> Oh, dear. What have I done now?<eos> Won't you come in, Mr. Inspector?<eos> Oh, thank you. Would you like a drink? Or is it a case of "not on duty, ma'am"?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> Not at all. I'd, uh...
Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Johnny One Note. Always criticizing officers. Always turning down promotions.<eos> Why do you insist on staying a private?<eos> Guilt, I guess.<eos> Dr. Freud would say I'm punishing myself... because I'm staying out of combat.<eos> Because I'm letting Noah Ackerman do my fighting for me, if you wanna personalize it.<eos> Well, then get into it.<eos> I'd rather be guilty than dead.<eos> Go on. See Sam.<eos> You would, too, wouldn't you?
That ain't no way to talk to a man who saved your daughter from making an awful mistake.<eos> I came down here to offer you a chance to ride out of Sundown.<eos> The sheriff is willing to let you leave town.<eos> You mean Kimbrough's willing, don't you?<eos> I can't much blame him.<eos> You go on back and tell Kimbrough we're staying.<eos> Be reasonable, man.<eos> Save your life and ride out of town.<eos> You'll be better off than when you rode in.<eos> How would we?
- I wish I could believe that.<eos> - You've got to believe that.<eos> - Don't you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Give me time, Clarice.<eos> I'll learn.<eos> - Oh! I'll be late for my show!<eos> - Oh, look, can I see you again?<eos> - If you like.<eos> - I would.
Hogan, this can be a black eye for the whole United States Army.<eos> Understand?<eos> It's our patriotic duty to keep this quiet.<eos> We've got to get that PW back in the PW ward without the PWs knowing where he came from.<eos> Hogan, this man has never been in the mortuary.<eos> - Understand?<eos> - Sir. That means falsifying my records, sir.<eos> No, no, not falsifying the records.<eos> No, no, you simply...<eos> You would...
But she's my mother.<eos> There's nothing I can do about that.<eos> You don't have to tell me any more, Norman.<eos> Please, Allison, I've gotta tell somebody.<eos> She won't let me have friends.<eos> She makes me tell her 10 times a day how much I love her.<eos> She's afraid she'll die alone in a poorhouse.<eos> And marriage.... Marriage, she says, is misery. And a woman can only cause me trouble.<eos> Oh, Norman, I can't believe it.<eos> Nobody would.
Be good to my kid sister.<eos> Yeah, she's had a lot of trouble for a kid.<eos> Susie has her girlish secrets, but in her heart of hearts... I imagine, Dallas, she fancies you in an uncommon way.<eos> Now, how 'bout you?<eos> Not just, uh -<eos> Well, not just tomcatting around, I hope.<eos> - J.J., Steve is not -<eos> - Now, take it easy, Susie.<eos> Steve wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern, would you?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Father long mobilized?<eos> No.<eos> He was hiding but Mitka Korshunov betrayed him.<eos> Even relatives turn against each other, nowadays.<eos> - He's no relative to us.<eos> - The beast, real beast.<eos> Killed Granny Koshevaya and the children.<eos> That was his revenge to Mishka.<eos> And nobody stopped him?<eos> Who would?
I'll never dive into anything deeper than a swimming pool.<eos> Or, if that makes you nervous, I'll stick to very dry martinis.<eos> Not funny?<eos> I didn't think you'd listen.<eos> There's something else.<eos> Tonight, when Sam was driving me home we hit one of those men, not a mile down the road.<eos> We hit him hard, ran over him.<eos> We must have killed him.<eos> I'd like to find out.<eos> So would I.
- No!<eos> He's right.<eos> I only have to look at you to understand.<eos> You still smell of perfume.<eos> I forbid you to talk to me outside the office.<eos> I hate you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Well, silly thing?<eos> I love you too much to accept being abandoned.<eos> I'd rather...
I mean, you've done a lot of thinking.<eos> Brooding, my father calls it.<eos> You can call it that, too.<eos> I'm not sensitive.<eos> I know that when tragedy hits hard... the mind is apt to come up with a lot of far-fetched ideas.<eos> Like this?<eos> In other words, you don't believe me.<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> - What about your uncle?<eos> Would he?
I'm dead beat.<eos> Good.<eos> I was dead beat ten minutes ago.<eos> I wanted to keep digging until you gave up.<eos> Gives me the creeps.<eos> What?<eos> Come on. Let's get Harry and pop him in.<eos> With hasty reverence.<eos> Would you like to say a few words, Captain?<eos> That I would.
─ Just keep driving. I'll show you.<eos> That's good, because somehow, we're going to put it back.<eos> Oh we are?<eos> What do you suggest? Going to Michaels and telling him we overlooked it?<eos> That we accidentally picked up $80,000.<eos> ─ I don't want any part of it.<eos> You wanted it as much as I did.<eos> It was written all over your face.<eos> Alright, maybe I did in a way.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Do you wanna get yourself a gun?<eos> I don't think I need one.<eos> - What's that tag on your coat?<eos> - The man who brought me here put it on.<eos> I'm looking for my dad.<eos> - What's your dad look like? - I don't know.<eos> I was just a kid last time I saw him.<eos> Would it be all right if he looked like me?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> It would.
Incidentally, what did the captains decide to do about the Scotswoman?<eos> They put her in my keeping.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Then perhaps you could return these to her.<eos> I have a venture for you on the Shark. Oh?<eos> When?<eos> In about two weeks.<eos> Oh, I know you've taken a rich spoil, but... Would it interest you a little more if you knew that I was going to be aboard her myself?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it would.
- He does not.<eos> - He does. If you ask me, he's jealous.<eos> - Jealous?<eos> Yeah, I think he has a crush on you.<eos> Turk, don't be silly.<eos> Doc's nice to me.<eos> It's just little things he does, like fixing my breakfast. He's nice to everyone.<eos> - He ever make a pass?<eos> - No, Doc'd never get fresh.<eos> - He'd better not.
I don't think Mr. Grady spends much time in the lurch.<eos> Maybe you could do it in your spare time.<eos> A fellow like you, how long would it take?<eos> Two or three nights a week, I'll bet.<eos> He's right, Marty.<eos> I know you don't need the money.<eos> But you'd be doing me a favor.<eos> Grady's an old friend of mine.<eos> I'm sure he'd make it worth your while.<eos> Wouldn't you, Grady?
They've got another name and another life.<eos> It looks to me like that's the way she wants it to stay.<eos> Will you tell me what name she's going under?<eos> So as I can write to her.<eos> Nope. I won't tell you that either.<eos> Looks to me like you're taking quite a lot on your own responsibility, ain't you, Mark?<eos> I'm doing what I think is right, Jimmie.<eos> And I'm hoping I can make you see it that way too.<eos> How'd you like to see that street out there full of gunplay?<eos> I'd rather not.
Too bad you missed him.<eos> That sounds like Wes McQueen.<eos> You'd have been $5000 richer.<eos> Looks like I had an expensive morning.<eos> Where'd he jump you?<eos> About 8 miles back, right after we left the canyon.<eos> I wanna thank you, Mr. Rogers, for what you did.<eos> You're a brave man.<eos> And if ever you find yourself up around our way, The Rancho Del Sol, We'd be mighty glad to see you.<eos> Wouldn't we, Julie Ann?
-He's a nice fellow.<eos> I congratulate you.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> You're a very lucky girl.<eos> Did you find that he was very attractive?<eos> Yes, I thought so.<eos> But don't try to change him.<eos> Don't you go putting him on any diet.<eos> -Would you say he was fat?<eos> -I wouldn't, no.
A sawmill, there were two associates.<eos> And one of them was flying wood.<eos> Perhaps every night.<eos> He had seen me.<eos> And I understood he would not stop there.<eos> I heard a mule happen.<eos> It is for you?<eos> Who was that?<eos> You saw the driver of the van!<eos> He too would not in there.
Now I'm going to make you hear and give me an answer.<eos> I wanted to save you this, Laurie.<eos> I never wanted you to care for me so. I tried to keep you from it when I could...<eos> And I only loved you more for it.<eos> I know I'm not good enough for you, Jo... but if you love me, you can make me anything you like.<eos> Laurie, I wouldn't change you.<eos> You should marry a lovely, accomplished girl who adores you. Someone who would grace your beautiful home... and give you the sort of life you really want.<eos> I loathe elegant society... and you hate my scribbling... and I can't get on without it.<eos> I know we would quarrel.<eos> - No, we wouldn't.
But you were going away without telling me. I would never have seen you again.<eos> Please come back.<eos> - I couldn't intrude.<eos> You have guests. - But they're just my family.<eos> My sister's come home.<eos> She's married to that boy I told you about. Herr Laurie?<eos> Yes, and it's the first time we've been together in a long time.<eos> Please, Jo. Just one moment before...<eos> I have a wish to ask something.<eos> Would you...
The recipient of these letters was murdered.<eos> For police vai very interesting.<eos> "Ted, dear.'m Hysterical.<eos> The other day I told my mother we and it was horrible. Does "<eos> How to get it?<eos> Darby wanted to lend money.<eos> I did not think the cards were worth something ... But he could not ... I offer nothing more ...<eos> A kind of bail.<eos> You could say that we Luckily he was murdered. Because the cards now ... worth more than the loan.<eos> How would Mr. Nagel:
- He can look after himself. Don't worry.<eos> - Did he say anything about me? Tell me!<eos> - Oh, the usual things. - Is something wrong?<eos> Did you tell Calloway about Harry?<eos> - Of course I didn't. Why should he help me?<eos> The Russians will make trouble for him.<eos> - That's his headache. Oh, Anna! - His?<eos> Why are you lying?<eos> - We're getting you out of here, aren't we? - I'm not going.<eos> You'd...
Is this guy a Frenchman? No.<eos> Name's Holzman. Genuine product.<eos> 'The city itself is some 15 miles off 'by way of the Autobahn. 'When you get there, you wonder how you can call it a city.<eos> 'Berlin, capital of the Third Reich, 'focal point of the rise and fall of a dictator 'is today a monument of ruins.<eos> 'Cities like Hiroshima have been obliterated. 'But no other city so mighty as Berlin has fallen so low.<eos> 'Less than four years of wind, rain and sun 'has left a drab, colourless, dead city in its wake.<eos> 'This was one case where justice 'had made the punishment fit the crime.<eos> 'Berlin, capital of a world 'that was to revolve around the Reich Chancellery, 'around a leader who stood on a balcony 'and said it would last for 1,000 years.'<eos> We are going to see each other again?<eos> We'd better.
But I thought you crossed the street immediately, Mrs. Lukash?<eos> We were so shocked, we just stood there for a moment.<eos> Then as we started to cross the street toward Father Lambert...<eos> And he passed close to you as he ran, Mr. Callahan?<eos> Why, he practically knocked me over.<eos> If I knew why he'd been running, I might have hung on to him.<eos> And you were a little frightened, Miss Neilson?<eos> I was scared to death, but I saw him run down the street till he disappeared in the shadows.<eos> Then on the basis of your experience in ballistics, Mr. Johnson, and your experiments with this weapon, you would say that this bullet came from this weapon.<eos> I would, positively.
Fault?<eos> Oh, we're both responsible for all our good things and all our bad.<eos> You don't really believe that, do you?<eos> No.<eos> Mostly me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Always?<eos> Mostly.<eos> Then I don't suppose you would want to marry me again, would you?<eos> No, I wouldn't, darling.
- Conceição..."Ceição".<eos> - Yes, Mr Barata?<eos> ...get a glass of water, please.<eos> - With ice?<eos> - Cold water!<eos> Good idea!<eos> And bring a bottle of Port and lots of sugar, it makes a great refreshment.<eos> - Yes, Mr Anastácio.<eos> - Would you like some too, girls?<eos> - Of course they would!
Oh, it's lovely.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - That's an anchor, for fishing.<eos> We should catch scads of them here.<eos> Oh, I see one, it's a monster!<eos> Oh, no, it's me.<eos> Isn't that silly?<eos> My own reflection.<eos> I wished I could swim. I'd love to go in.<eos> - Would you?
How did I know she'd ever show up?<eos> I didn't.<eos> What stopped her from taking a boat to Chile or Guatemala? Nothing.<eos> How big a chump can you get to be? I was finding out.<eos> And then she'd come along like school was out... and everything else was just a stone you sailed at the sea.<eos> - I didn't know you were so little.<eos> - I'm taller than Napoleon.<eos> You're prettier too.<eos> - Did you miss me?<eos> - No more than I would my eyes.
There isn't anything you can do.<eos> We have to wait till the doctor comes.<eos> His fever seems to be down a little.<eos> - Quit worrying.<eos> He'll be just fine.<eos> You'll need a doctor yourself if you don't rest.<eos> - I'm not a bit tired.<eos> Nobody can do two things at once without getting worn out, except me.<eos> Run along, recess is almost over.<eos> - Yes, I'd better.
Just what I was thinking.<eos> Oh ho, I needed that.<eos> - Now? - Now we can tell each other the truth.<eos> The entire truth.<eos> Who's going to speak first?<eos> Very well, I shall begin.<eos> As you know, Mr Owen's saying that I was responsible for the death of one Edward Seaton.<eos> It's perfectly true.<eos> He was an innocent man on trial for his life.<eos> I'd nothing against him.
What do you mean, "take it"?<eos> The problems that never stop coming,<eos> Helen's having a baby... I must have 10,000 francs, little sister.<eos> 10,000 francs? Where do you expect me to get it?<eos> Ask Aunt.<eos> I don't dare go myself.<eos> It's a fortune!<eos> But for her, it's nothing.<eos> You know her.<eos> She never would.
- Even in a room full of people.<eos> - Why daisies do you suppose?<eos> 'I don't know.'<eos> And then, there are other things.<eos> She believes doctors have questioned her.<eos> She believes she's followed when she's out shopping. And that's not new.<eos> It began in Paris.<eos> The first year.<eos> I believed her then.<eos> Why wouldn't I?
I need some air.<eos> If everybody will please keep your seats.<eos> Please sit down.<eos> I just wanna tell you one thing.<eos> I've seen a lot of brave men in my life - that's my business.<eos> But what that kid just done took real courage. You get me?<eos> Now that he's shot his mouth off, you might as well hear the rest of it.<eos> There's six of us and we've got 15 cents between us and we're from Guadalcanal and no fooling!<eos> - I'll be over in a few minutes.<eos> - You'd better not, dear.
You know?<eos> You don't, eh? No.<eos> Get on with it.<eos> You couldn't hit a barn door with a dead cat.<eos> Oh, I can't?<eos> I could... No.<eos> I'll bet you five quid.<eos> Five quid?<eos> And where would he get five quid?<eos> Yeah, where would he?
Do you want to keep them all to yourself?<eos> Besides, I'm no hero. I've had the mumps.<eos> I'm immune.<eos> I wish...<eos> Let me wish this time.<eos> I wish that I was 17.<eos> What are you doing sitting in that holy of holies as though it were yours?<eos> I'm getting it used to being just another chair.<eos> - Can I wake her up?<eos> - You'd better.
You can have anyone you want.<eos> -Suppose l want to marry a poor guy?<eos> -What for?<eos> Well, you marry a rich guy for money.<eos> What would you marry a poor guy for?<eos> -What?<eos> -For love.<eos> Do you love her?<eos> Well...<eos> Well, who wouldn't?
- You've never met him.<eos> But he doesn't want this state to have a good administration.<eos> Father doesn't want any state to have a good administration.<eos> - But he's out to get me particularly.<eos> I am a pretty good judge of character... and I don't think you're really a bad girl.<eos> - You're very young.<eos> I'm older than you'd guess.<eos> I don't think you ought to go back to that father.<eos> I'd rather stay with you.<eos> You really would, wouldn't you?
- What did you say you were captain of?<eos> I didn't say a word about it.<eos> How wonderful it is meeting a silent American again.<eos> All my husbands were foreigners.<eos> And such chatterboxes.<eos> I could hardly get a word in edgeways.<eos> - They make a handsome couple, don't they?<eos> - Pardon? My sister and your brother.<eos> It'd be nice if something came of it.<eos> Oh, yes, wouldn't it?
Just a little.<eos> I was just taking him for a walk.<eos> There isn't much room on the boat.<eos> - You have a boat?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> The water must be beautiful on these moonlit nights.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I've never seen it.<eos> - Would you like to see it?<eos> - Oh, yes, I would.
I see.<eos> Is she in?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She doesn't answer either.<eos> I don't understand it.<eos> I left them here just a minute ago.<eos> Are their keys in the box?<eos> No, but people sometimes take them with them.<eos> Would you like me to have Miss Pennington paged?<eos> Oh, yes. Would you, please?
Come right in.<eos> I am tickled to death to have callers.<eos> I rarely see anybody except the neighbors... and they are mostly my relatives, some kind or other.<eos> But you must be frozen.<eos> Going out this time tonight with no coat or anything.<eos> Well, you see... uh, they're eloping.<eos> Eloping?<eos> Oh, how romantic!<eos> It takes me back to the time when I wanted Hiram to elope with me.<eos> But he wouldn't.
If he did, he'd be more careful about it.<eos> Yeah, he'd make the rich people loosen up and lend us farmers some money.<eos> Mr. Payne don't care nothing about what you think about that.<eos> Mr. Lester, why don't you go on up to Augusta and get work in the mills?<eos> In the mills?<eos> Why, I wouldn't work in them darned mills.<eos> That's a place for women.<eos> Winding string on little spools and things like that.<eos> No, sir, not for me.<eos> I wouldn't...
Three handsome sweethearts<eos> - And one is the son of a<eos> - One is the son of a<eos> - One is the son of a<eos> - One is the son of a<eos> A farmer!<eos> A farmer?<eos> A farmer!<eos> He gives me butter and carrots<eos> And onions no other farmer would
Good night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Just a moment.<eos> You're an honest, serious, intelligent young man, aren't you?<eos> Well, Mrs. Prentiss, I do try to be serious and, honest, yes.<eos> Well, I've been keeping an eye on you, and mind you... mind you, I'm a very good judge of human nature.<eos> And I consider you entirely trustworthy.<eos> You're very kind, Mrs. Prentiss.<eos> Would you like to earn $500?<eos> Of course! Who wouldn't?
His own son?<eos> Why wasn't it?<eos> He doesn't care about him.<eos> He'd do the same thing to any of us.<eos> But to sit here and let them pull his own son to pieces because of a few cases of ammunition-<eos> Are you blind, man?<eos> You think he doesn't care?<eos> Well, I know he does.<eos> Well, I suppose if it were your son, you'd sit here, too, like a dummy.<eos> You would not-
Don't you remember?<eos> The Schwarnbassles are coming for dinner. Or was it the Basslechwassels?<eos> Or whatever their name is?<eos> Some other time, aunt Martha.<eos> Thanks, just the same.<eos> Terry, have you any plans for the future?<eos> ─ I don't believe in the future.<eos> I've never had a plan in my life.<eos> If I had one I wouldn't know what to do with it.<eos> No .. you wouldn't.
I think it's a shame.<eos> You little rebel, you.<eos> Here, you just have some of these ham and egg...<eos> Ham and...<eos> Oh, enough of your quarrelling.<eos> I'm sick and tired of it.<eos> Oh, here's one of those delightful fragments by Gertrude Smun.<eos> Would you like to hear it?<eos> Would you like to hear it?<eos> Oh, yes, I would, dear.
You went back on me, Jones!<eos> You placed me in a very difficult position!<eos> This morning, j.G. Instructed me to raise your salary.<eos> Oh, he did?<eos> Oh, thank you, Mr. seaver.<eos> Yes, but he also gave me instructions to fire the next employee who came in late.<eos> And you're both people, Jones.<eos> Now, what am I going to do?<eos> I can't raise your salary and then fire you. That wouldn't make sense, would it?<eos> No, sir. It wouldn't.
Enjoying yourself?<eos> I shouldn't have ate pie and salami.<eos> - Oh, let me get you some bicarbonates.<eos> - I just had some.<eos> Don't help me none.<eos> Honey, how about a prologue honeymoon?<eos> - I'll sign now.<eos> - We'll make love in 40 cities.<eos> And then start all over again. If Apollo signs.<eos> Well, he'd better.
I wish Father were here.<eos> I'm afraid he isn't having such a merry Christmas as we are.<eos> How do you do?<eos> I wanted to thank you.<eos> We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present.<eos> What's the matter? Are you sick?<eos> Just a little cold, but grandfather's made me stop indoors for a week.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> Can anybody come to see you?<eos> If they would.
There's a wife for you!<eos> Yes.<eos> And dance!<eos> Y-You haven't danced with her yet, have you, Waldow?<eos> You will!<eos> Y-You'll dance with Waldow, won't you, my dear?<eos> - If he likes.<eos> - Of course he likes!<eos> - Of course.<eos> Wouldn't you, Waldow?
I'm not asking you to do a thing you don't want to do.<eos> You're only asking me to sacrifice my job to become the goat for reform movement.<eos> That's not the idea at all.<eos> What I want you to do is to be a man.<eos> You know what conditions in this school are now.<eos> You know how badly you need the money from this bond issue to correct them.<eos> And I know you feel the way I do.<eos> You'd like to see things improve.<eos> You'd like to see these kids given a chance.<eos> Wouldn't you?

It'll be soon now.<eos> In the bedroom.<eos> All yours?<eos> Well, I hope so.<eos> How do you like it?<eos> It's lovely.<eos> Go on, take a good look.<eos> Why don't you take your hat off?<eos> You know you're going to stay a while.<eos> Well, I'd better.
I need money desperately. It's no exaggeration when I say it's a matter of life and death.<eos> Well? I need $2,000.<eos> I'm not a money lender.<eos> But I think you'll lend it to me.<eos> What makes you think so? Did you know your wife's real name was Mary Keaton and not Mary Bernard?<eos> I did.<eos> But you didn't know that as Mary Keaton she served a term in the reformatory for grand larceny, did you?<eos> I think you'll lend me the money now, won't you, Mr. Kirkwood?<eos> You wouldn't want me to sell that story to the newspapers, would you?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
