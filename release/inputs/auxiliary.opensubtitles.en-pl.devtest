I'm asking so I can defend you.<eos> Yes. There's people that can vouch for it.<eos> What they didn't know is that he was beating me, because I covered up for him again and again.<eos> I just couldn't take it anymore.<eos> Why stage the crime scene?<eos> - I exaggerated it.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I knew no one would believe me.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Because I do.
He doesn't want any of you near this case.<eos> But not me, right?<eos> You know, at least tell me you've made some headway on the suspect front.<eos> - You're all garbage.<eos> - You mean all them, right?<eos> Not me?<eos> I-I'm still good, right?<eos> Find everyone who knew Jill and Steve and see if anyone witnessed the abuse.<eos> We believe her?<eos> For some reason, I do, yes.
- No. - Are you stupid?<eos> I'm over all the secrets.<eos> We should know better at this point.<eos> So let's just get an answer once and for all.<eos> Spit it out.<eos> You're gonna want to lie to us, but I'm warning you we know a lot more...<eos> Wes stole the key to the storage locker because this guy Bruno told him you went there the night Rebecca disappeared.<eos> So we unlocked it to see if her dead body was in there, but... We just found cash.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You do?
She pulled me into her car, asked me to help take you down.<eos> What did you tell her?<eos> That I'd be an idiot to believe anything she says.<eos> She's persistent.<eos> Got to give her that.<eos> - You hear about Philip? - No.<eos> They released him after questioning.<eos> They have his DNA at the crime scene.<eos> They need to arrest him.<eos> Well, they didn't.
What about Catherine and Caleb?<eos> Um, should we tell them that we found him?<eos> So they can confront him and do something stupid?<eos> No.<eos> We say nothing until we know more.<eos> Which means no pillow talk with your boyfriend.<eos> There's this, too.<eos> She made it for your birthday and asked me to hide it.<eos> No, my wife did not make this.<eos> She did.
- I disagree.<eos> Then let's go to trial. It starts in a few hours.<eos> Five years.<eos> Six months, two years probation.<eos> Four years minimum security. Prussian blue.<eos> You wore that same color the first night of our honeymoon.<eos> Two years, or we walk.<eos> Did you wear that for me? What do you say?<eos> Do we have a deal?<eos> You did, didn't you?
Thank you for taking care of him.<eos> Anytime.<eos> Please talk to me.<eos> You should be helping Laurel prep Dale.<eos> Can I at least explain to you my version so you can hear it from me instead of Sinclair, who I assume is the one that told you?<eos> - It doesn't matter who told me.<eos> - It does. Look, I made this stupid video at my parent's lake house.<eos> We threw a party, everyone was drinking, a bunch of people went upstairs.<eos> Four guys took one girl upstairs, so don't you dare say you didn't know what they were going to do to her.<eos> I didn't, though.
And I'm more than willing to go down for my cause.<eos> I've been a teller at Barnaby Bank for five years.<eos> Know how much banks made in 2014 from overdraft fees?<eos> $35 billion.<eos> Barnaby alone made off with $7 billion.<eos> Well, that is reprehensible, but you know what's worse?<eos> A man was murdered because of your ATM hack.<eos> I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.<eos> That's why I mailed you guys the photo of the shooter.<eos> Yes, you did.
An hour later, it was deleted.<eos> But it would take another hacker years to find Raven's patch amongst a half million lines of code in the bank network.<eos> Unless the hacker knew exactly what to look for.<eos> I know who did this.<eos> I used a sequence of code another black hat taught me.<eos> Who?<eos> Jackson.<eos> Jackson Richmond, your ex-boyfriend?<eos> But you cut off all contact with him when you started working the Cyber Crime Division.<eos> I did.
Jackson Richmond!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Jackson Richmond, you're under arrest for cyber bank fraud.<eos> You set me up?<eos> But I did it for us.<eos> There is no "us."<eos> Suspect is in custody.<eos> I'm sorry you had to do that.<eos> I know he meant a lot to you.<eos> He did.
- Game time.<eos> I fear that you've become vulnerable.<eos> You know that FBI Agent Nolan and her alliance with the Detective Brown and his relationship with the new Player... all your troubles started when he came on board.<eos> Now, these things don't just happen.<eos> Someone's coming after my House.<eos> It would seem...<eos> death by a thousand cuts.<eos> Tell me about Alex Kane.<eos> How did you recruit him?<eos> I didn't.
I'll do it.<eos> Don't be ridiculous!<eos> You also know it doesn't make sense.<eos> Yes, if I could call another doctor like you, I'd try.<eos> But there isn't!<eos> If I didn't have a conscience like before, then sure. I'd have left Yeo Jin to die in your hands! I'd say I'm not responsible!<eos> But things have changed for me, too.<eos> I have conscience now because of you.<eos> I can't let her die when I know better!<eos> Then what do we do?
Wow.<eos> (chuckles) I've been waiting a long time for this.<eos> Frank Reagan coming to me hat in hand.<eos> I don't wear hats.<eos> Well, the price for my cooperation is a civilian oversight position with your department's training program.<eos> You're overplaying your hand, Reverend.<eos> Am I?<eos> You wouldn't give up a finger of your grip to save your own son?<eos> I don't have power.<eos> The office does.
I made dinner.<eos> What is it... boiled bunny?<eos> 'Cause you sound crazy.<eos> Okay, I feel like a hostage.<eos> But like a reverse hostage where the kidnapper just follows me everywhere and won't leave my damn house.<eos> You know what they call that?<eos> Marriage.<eos> And it gets hard, but you don't just leave.<eos> You don't just stop.<eos> You do.
I need to see both tumors up close.<eos> And then I'll decide.<eos> You have to?<eos> In order to make the best choice, the right choice, or we risk losing them both.<eos> And we're racing the clock, so I need to take them now.<eos> Wait, wait! We...<eos> They don't have names.<eos> We're not letting them go before we name them. ♪ All our memories, they're haunted ♪ ♪ we were always meant to say goodbye ♪<eos> She looks like an Emma.<eos> She does.
He'll be dead by then.<eos> Nat, where are you going?<eos> NICU.<eos> Baby Doe's sats are in the 70s.<eos> - Put him on ECMO.<eos> - That's a last resort.<eos> I'm sorry, but I need this tank.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I have no other option.<eos> You do.
And I didn't get it.<eos> Look, Frankie, I'm not stupid.<eos> I'm not gonna invest all our money or... or quit my job.<eos> I just...<eos> I think there's something with this idea.<eos> And how many other chances are gonna come along?<eos> You know what?<eos> If it's really important to you, you should do it.<eos> I support you completely.<eos> I don't.
- No, no.<eos> I am in college now.<eos> I can't just go running to my Mommy and Daddy to fix things.<eos> I have to handle this Holly thing on my own.<eos> How?<eos> Well, I think by living in my car, I am sending a pretty strong message.<eos> I have a better idea.<eos> If she's gonna be in your face with her boyfriend, you're gonna be in her face with your boyfriend.<eos> - I don't have a boyfriend.<eos> - You do now, girlfriend.
You're too smart to be talking this stupid, Sherlock.<eos> If you really love that broad, you figure out what the problem is, and you do something.<eos> Hey, it's the kid!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Not you again.<eos> I'm looking for Detective Slaughter.<eos> - Yeah, he's...<eos> - hey. Victor told me that if I ever got into trouble to find you.<eos> He said that you'd look out for me.<eos> He did?
So from now on, I'm gonna personally see to it that you got someone looking out for you... that you got a cool role model.<eos> You mean Mr. Castle?<eos> No.<eos> Me.<eos> Really?<eos> You bet.<eos> First thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use my pull to get the mayor to ask the D.A. to reduce your sentence down to probation.<eos> You've got that kind of clout with the mayor?<eos> Hell no.<eos> Castle does.
Did you hear that?<eos> Can you imagine the amount of pain you've caused this poor woman?<eos> My mom's house.<eos> You're in my house.<eos> It was clever of you to use her love of sweepstakes to bring in a RAT-ed computer so you could watch her.<eos> Socially engineering and spying on your own mother?<eos> It doesn't get lower than that.<eos> Now, now, Avery Ryan.<eos> You have no idea who you're dealing with.<eos> Actually, I do, Dante Wilkerson.
Tristan must have shut them down.<eos> He chained the stairwell, too, locked us out.<eos> There should be an emergency ladder inside the elevator shaft.<eos> It's not opening.<eos> Get the hydraulic spreader.<eos> I can try to hack the elevator, get in electronically.<eos> No, we don't have time for that.<eos> We're gonna get to Tristan the same way he got to Isabel-- over the Internet.<eos> Please, you don't want to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.
Let me see.<eos> Um...<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Okay, so according to this, she's still in C.T.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, okay, good, good.<eos> Great.<eos> Is there anything else I can do for you?<eos> Y-you got jell-o here, right?<eos> We do.
The boat. That's her name.<eos> Dr. Savetti, this was nobody's fault.<eos> His heart just finally gave out.<eos> There was someone he told us to call. Yeah.<eos> His friend.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> You need to take care of the body.<eos> Get him to the morgue.<eos> He shouldn't have died alone.<eos> He didn't.
Even yours.<eos> I may not understand your gift, but I have experienced it.<eos> The night they tried to burn you at the stake, you came to me in what I thought was a dream.<eos> You told me about a ritual you did to bind us together.<eos> That's how I found you.<eos> It worked?<eos> Since then I've been sensing things you've sensed and feeling things that you've felt.<eos> I wanted to bring us closer.<eos> I'm sorry, I had no right to do it.<eos> No, you didn't.
I won't lose you.<eos> But you cannot keep me in a cage, even one built with love.<eos> Did you really sign away your claim?<eos> It was the only way to end the war.<eos> Well, I quite like the new banners.<eos> Who needs the English lion anyway?<eos> Our bags are packed and our carriage awaits.<eos> We're going to Paris.<eos> I didn't know we had plans for Paris.<eos> We didn't.
This is their lives, Will.<eos> Mine, too.<eos> And I won't throw that away.<eos> You think this is just a job to me?<eos> A fancy office?<eos> Blomfeld showed up at Wally's.<eos> Dash was there.<eos> How?<eos> - How did he find him?<eos> - He didn't.
Especially now.<eos> Didn't Carter tell you she came to see me?<eos> We had a little chat about school.<eos> You didn't.<eos> I did.<eos> See, one of the lessons of motherhood I did learn is the importance of truly seeing your child for who they are.<eos> Carter's never been an academic, she's never going to be.<eos> So why not end the charade and just let her start living the life she's so capable of.<eos> You had no right.<eos> In the eyes of the state, and more importantly, our daughter, I do.
A friend.<eos> How am I supposed to trust your judgment when you bring around a friend like that?<eos> Someone who gets into fights and breaks bottles and could get us shut down?<eos> He's not a bad guy, he's just going through a rough time.<eos> His judgment's a little impaired.<eos> I don't care about his judgment.<eos> I care about yours.<eos> Which in this case was nonexistent.<eos> I know, look, I...<eos> No, you clearly don't.
Oh, hey, Bishop.<eos> We need a little female perspective.<eos> Although Tim is bringing quite a bit to the game.<eos> Not today, Tony.<eos> You two figure it out.<eos> You okay? Everything back to normal at home?<eos> Jake is safe.<eos> That's all that matters.<eos> Well, that's not the only thing that matters.<eos> You do, too.
You decide to stay.<eos> You decide you need me, then you decide you don't.<eos> You decide we can talk.<eos> You decide we cannot.<eos> I don't want to talk because I know what you're gonna say!<eos> You're gonna say you love me but...<eos> - You don't know what I'm going to say!<eos> - I'm pretty sure I do.<eos> - It doesn't matter!<eos> You don't!
Would you like to come with us, Sylvester?<eos> You're family.<eos> We'll see you soon, Walter.<eos> Sorry for discounting your plans for Megan as science fiction.<eos> You didn't want to lose her.<eos> Neither did we.<eos> Good night, son.<eos> D-Did I, uh... did I ever tell you about the time that, uh,<eos> Megan pulled the fire alarm to get me out of trouble at school?<eos> No, you never did that.
Okay, so you're saying there was no hard feelings afterwards?<eos> I'm not saying that.<eos> But when we left that arena, any feelings that I had-- they stayed there.<eos> - What about, uh, the rest of your folks?<eos> Can you account for them?<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> Look, nobody on my team would let some thin-skinned ex-con or his wide-eyed little brother get in the way of a $50 million payout against Manny Garcia next year.<eos> We're way too smart for that.<eos> You're acting like the kid doesn't stand a chance.<eos> He doesn't.
Hey. You remember when I told you about my grandparents?<eos> How much I admired their love for one another?<eos> Yeah. Well, what I didn't tell you was how things started out between them.<eos> The day after their wedding, my grandfather was drafted into the Japanese navy and spent the next three years on a ship while my grandmother waited without any word from him.<eos> And neither of them ever stopped believing they would be together.<eos> And you know the rest.<eos> They were married for 60 years, had five children, plenty of grandchildren.<eos> I want the same for us, Kono.<eos> You just have to believe.<eos> I do.
You've got a really progressive P.C. dad<eos> Who knows all about this stuff, okay?<eos> Go ahead. Ask me anything.<eos> I just don't understand how it's decided.<eos> Ah, well, you see, it's a combination Of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences.<eos> No, I mean, like, what makes the Asians decide Who they're gonna make gay?<eos> The Asians?<eos> The Asians decide who's gonna be gay?<eos> Uh, uh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, they do.
You know, a lot of people think that Asians decide Who's gay and who's not.<eos> But it isn't all Asians.<eos> It's just specifically the Japanese, okay?<eos> What?<eos> Why do the Japanese make some people gay and others not?<eos> Well, it goes back to World War II<eos> And atrocities that happened in China called<eos> The Rape of Don King.<eos> Well, you sure know a lot about this.<eos> Yes, I do.
Obviously you two were close.<eos> Moving from one foster home to another, we learned that we that we could only count on each other.<eos> Now I've got no one.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> What's up with you?<eos> You've been checking your phone the entire time, like a teenage girl.<eos> Yeah, I'm texting with Martinez at the NSA.<eos> There's been chatter about an impending terror attack near where Jake is.<eos> I thought Jake couldn't tell you where they were sending him?<eos> Well, he didn't.
You figured he was doing it for one of them.<eos> That lead pan out?<eos> It led us to the cabin of a woman on Fiddler's Neck.<eos> By the time we arrived, it was deserted.<eos> She must have seen us coming.<eos> We pulled DNA from the residence and sequenced it.<eos> This allowed predictive facial reconstruction of three people.<eos> A female and two males, twins.<eos> Now, none of these matched any genetic records in the database.<eos> But a fourth sample did.
Yeah.<eos> What about him?<eos> We need to lose him. Now, while Blomfeld's busy.<eos> - We?<eos> - I'll go first, through the women's locker room.<eos> If he follows, let me know.<eos> Pick me up out front.<eos> You got a stalker.<eos> So there's a Space Blue leaving D.C. to Barcelona in two hours. We don't have passports.<eos> Now you do.
No, you can't be here.<eos> The buyers are on their way.<eos> - Buyers?<eos> - Blomfeld's selling them to a third party.<eos> Get dressed.<eos> I need to get you three out of here.<eos> What about them?<eos> Put them in.<eos> What do we do when they wake up?<eos> How about they don't?
Sir, can you tell me about this in more detail?<eos> About what could have happened... Look, I want to help Siras..<eos> ..and I will do what I can.<eos> But I can't rock the boat too much.<eos> _BAR_t's okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello, sir.<eos> Who? - Deepu Sebastian...<eos> Dr. Islam must have spoken to you.<eos> Yeah...he did.
Thank you, sir. Oh.<eos> But I can't read Marathi!<eos> _BAR_'ve a translated version as well.<eos> But it is very poorly translated.<eos> I was thinking... I should translate it myself someday.<eos> So you can give me that cOPY. sir.<eos> No... this is a souvenir.<eos> Okay...thank you.<eos> In that case, can I get an autograph,<eos> No, _BAR_'_BAR__BAR_ do it with my pen.
Then...<eos> Where is your family?<eos> I have a family.<eos> - Where? My family is in Nagpur, and I live here.<eos> You can stay here when you bring your family.<eos> Take your luggage and get out.<eos> Why?<eos> If the others living here are 'familiesﬂ.<eos> ..did I bother anyone?<eos> No, you didn't.
Take your luggage and get out.<eos> Why?<eos> If the others living here are 'familiesﬂ.<eos> ..did I bother anyone?<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> But you _BAR_led.. That you're a family.<eos> -I lied?<eos> Yes.<eos> Didn't you take security fees?<eos> - Yes, I did.
If the others living here are 'familiesﬂ.<eos> ..did I bother anyone?<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> But you _BAR_led.. That you're a family.<eos> -I lied?<eos> Yes.<eos> Didn't you take security fees?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> Didn't you take a deposit from me?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Vacate the room.<eos> - Why should I?<eos> Rasca_BAR_...ba§~~~<eos> Who do you think you are?<eos> What?<eos> Did I pick a fight?<eos> Or trouble you?<eos> What do you think you are?<eos> - What are you saying? Why did you take security fees?<eos> - I did.
Oh, you followed him?<eos> Where?<eos> - Culmore.<eos> - Culmore?<eos> That's not the best neighborhood.<eos> What was he doing there?<eos> I don't know, I never found out.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Everything I do rubs him the wrong way.<eos> You don't?
Then I need this report to come out.<eos> He'll pin it on Landau?<eos> Definitely.<eos> Landau and Peter.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> He'll pin it on Landau and Peter.<eos> Peter Florrick? Yes.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> But Peter had nothing to do with the hack.<eos> Yes, he did.
He was worried about his wife losing, so he set it up.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> This is good, Eli.<eos> You wanted to hobble the governor, right?<eos> Well, this will knock him out.<eos> Right. So Thursday, right?<eos> You want him to drop the bomb just after Landau intros Peter?<eos> Forget everything that you've ever heard or seen on television.<eos> Attempts to manipulate the data output are futile.<eos> So what do I do?
_<eos> - Where's Tyler?<eos> - Oh, he's picking up his girlfriend.<eos> I can't believe I'm saying that.<eos> I can't wait to meet her.<eos> Do you remember when he used to say that he wanted to marry me?<eos> - No. - Well, I do.
We're just, um...<eos> You know, this is-is new for us.<eos> I mean, we-we can't believe that our little boy is dating. Mom.<eos> You remember when you used to want to marry me?<eos> - Those were...<eos> Sorry... good times.<eos> Um, okay, so... to boobs.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did I just say "boobs"?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, you did.
Keep your mouth shut about all this.<eos> The quantum computer.<eos> It's like meeting Elvis.<eos> If that's what sent the ransomware, let's just smash it and end this.<eos> No, if we do, the ransomware will stay embedded in the Fed's server.<eos> It'll keep running, and before we know it, our economy collapses.<eos> Our only hope is to slow the quantum down so that I can upload my anti-code to shut down the ransomware.<eos> Now, to do that, we need to insert a mirror to reflect back one of those lasers on itself, so that we can reduce the quantum's power from four qubits to two.<eos> We'll have to drill through the Plexiglas while maintaining the vacuum seal, 'cause if the seal breaks, the computer collapses and the ransomware survives.<eos> How do you do that?
- Nothing?<eos> I got a surfboard today.<eos> But nothing about you and Tandy going to a park to try to get his sperm to fertilize your egg?<eos> I mean, you told me it was just about having sex.<eos> Todd, you have to understand the circumstances.<eos> I feel like I'm gonna be sick out of both ends.<eos> I mean, you can have a baby with a guy that you've known for, like, three days, but you can't have a baby with the man you love?<eos> Look, I came to my senses. I changed my mind.<eos> You don't just change your mind about having a baby.<eos> I did.
Our data predicts he will strike again this year, and that he'll take two more victims in the next 72 hours.<eos> That is, unless you can stop him.<eos> The bet.<eos> Can Alex Kane stop The Norseman from completing his ritual before midnight, October 31st?<eos> Well, we're about to find out.<eos> Wanna get out of here?<eos> I could go for a swim.<eos> But I don't have a suit.<eos> No.<eos> Neither do I.
Osteosarcoma.<eos> It involves the frontal and the occipital bone.<eos> It's locally very aggressive.<eos> It's a lovely tumor.<eos> It's almost cute.<eos> Just plopped there.<eos> "Hello."<eos> He's waited 18 months for this kidney.<eos> We finally have one, and now he has cancer?<eos> - What if he didn't?

Yeah, their pumpkin ravioli never disappoints.<eos> This has been really nice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We somehow managed to finish our meal without actually...<eos> - Talking.<eos> Right.<eos> - ... Talking.<eos> Do we need to, though?<eos> I-I want to.<eos> If you do.
Australia.<eos> Retract.<eos> And you'd guess wrong.<eos> New Zealand.<eos> A common mistake.<eos> Seattle when I was 7, then med school, fellowship.<eos> The Middle East for a long time.<eos> Prepare to make a large aortic purse string.<eos> Why?<eos> Just do it.
Okay.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> But just tell me...<eos> Do we hate him?<eos> We hate him.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> We hate him.<eos> So, um, how'd it go last night?<eos> Ugh.<eos> It didn't.
'Cause I'm your sister?<eos> Yes.<eos> Or because I'm your "sistah"?<eos> No.<eos> This is exactly what I was worried about.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you think you did?<eos> I don't think I did anything, but I think she thinks I did.<eos> Amelia, use your words.<eos> Did what?
Or because I'm your "sistah"?<eos> No.<eos> This is exactly what I was worried about.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you think you did?<eos> I don't think I did anything, but I think she thinks I did.<eos> Amelia, use your words.<eos> Did what?<eos> Sided with Wilson over her because she's black.<eos> Which I didn't do.
I... I don't know!<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I would tell you!<eos> - I would tell you.<eos> Please.<eos> - Shh...<eos> - Please.<eos> - I told you...<eos> - We had to try.<eos> - Did we?
Yeah, but he also swore this was the year he'd be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin.<eos> Well, I'm gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked.<eos> I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself.<eos> So, um... should I get under the covers with you?<eos> All right.<eos> Why are you shaking?<eos> Are you cold? I'm just, um... really nervous.<eos> Why? Well...<eos> I've been waiting for this for so long, I've just... built it up in my head. I don't know what to expect.<eos> Neither do I.
The groom took a bad turn.<eos> Well, you report back when you know anything.<eos> Go get the food, candidate.<eos> Good thoughts.<eos> Good thoughts.<eos> Hey, what happened?<eos> Increased inflammation in his airway.<eos> Not uncommon for inhalation injuries to get worse before they get better.<eos> That's why we're keeping an eye on him.<eos> Hey, Becca, how you doing?
So, do you remember Rick Lindgren?<eos> We used to do pro bono work for the ACLU back in the old days.<eos> So, he's in private practice now, and he does work occasionally with guys like you... People who work for military contractors or law enforcement... so... I told him about your situation.<eos> Dad...<eos> I told you that in confidence.<eos> I don't know what... Why would you do that?<eos> I trust him, Brian.<eos> Rick thinks that there's a way for you to get out of this contract with the FBI.<eos> let's see, basically, I started by... __<eos> I did those things.
You tired?<eos> Why don't we swing by McSorely's on the way home?<eos> " Rm buying, " Why not?<eos> - I need your help, man.<eos> Now.<eos> I don't know what happened.<eos> It was that drug, man.<eos> It started on the basketball court and... and I don't know what happened. It was like... It was like I smelled him on Alicia.<eos> - When did you see Alicia?<eos> - I didn't.
I am in a celebratory mood.<eos> Oh? Good day in court?<eos> There's nothing better than a good cross.<eos> You?<eos> Well, that was $1 million. Yeah.<eos> Things are clicking. I like when things click.<eos> You're okay in the bonus room? Yeah.<eos> Feels like old times.<eos> Want to get laid?<eos> Do you?
No need to be a backseat doctor, Doctor.<eos> I have done this many times before.<eos> Aren't we brimming with confidence.<eos> And my work here is done.<eos> Bravo.<eos> Ah, Jethro, you're just in time for Mr. Palmer's unveiling. What's going on?<eos> As you can see, I've been running a-fowl.<eos> Oh, it's classic.<eos> You have something for me?<eos> We do.
I know.<eos> It's just I didn't even know anything terrible happened until afterwards.<eos> And that... that kind of made it worse.<eos> I'm sorry, I should have told you.<eos> Stop, this isn't about me.<eos> This is about you and you can tell me anything.<eos> You know that.<eos> I know.<eos> You know how much I love you, right?<eos> I do.
We have olives and brownie mix.<eos> No offense, but I'm not eating your brownies.<eos> Carter, hey.<eos> Please don't put Ben's name on that list, Jared.<eos> Whoa... what are you talking about?<eos> I know you made a deal with the DA and I know that would involve putting Ben on that list.<eos> Stop.<eos> I'm not giving up Ben.<eos> Jared, I know you agreed to the deal.<eos> Yeah, I did.
You couldn't flavored it up a bit for him?<eos> The quality of all the meals has really gone downhill here since someone's boyfriend offed my chef.<eos> Poor Don E. Has been reduced to eating pepperoni pockets.<eos> That's much better.<eos> Thank you. And I guess I should thank you for saving my life too, huh?<eos> You may want to wait a couple weeks. See if you still feel grateful.<eos> So, we'll be taking that tainted Utopium now.<eos> Yeah, some bad news on that front.<eos> You said he knew where to find it. No, he...<eos> He does...
It's all right, Dad.<eos> You don't have to make... No. Give me an hour, okay?<eos> Don't you love it that I can still fit into your jeans?<eos> Nope. Listen, I was thinking it might have been a mistake for me to come here today, so I should probably leave.<eos> Oh, no, don't go.<eos> So you want me to stay? I just mean, where could you possibly go?<eos> - You're wearing lady jeans.<eos> - Oh. You think this is my first time wearing lady jeans in public?<eos> Plus, my ass looks amazing in these.<eos> Bang! It actually does.
Hurry!<eos> It's really hot up here!<eos> Hold on! We're coming!<eos> Aah! Please hurry!<eos> Get that ladder up!<eos> It's too hot!<eos> Stay right where you are!<eos> Don't move!<eos> I'm gonna throw him to you.<eos> No! Hey, hey, don't do that.
Isn't that enough?<eos> Forgive me for caring.<eos> And you're right.<eos> It should be enough, since all your tests turned out normal.<eos> Blood work, EKG, PET scan, CAT scan,<eos> Okay then.<eos> Blood work, EKG,<eos> I got to get to work.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Uh, and no, you don't.
Thank you, Tony.<eos> I owe you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> We're good.<eos> Why do I concern myself with the health of someone who does not even bother to lock his door?<eos> Well, then quit concerning yourself.<eos> Ensign Ryan sends her undying gratitude.<eos> And I put a replacement steak in your fridge. Nice New York strip, actually.<eos> Didn't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, I kind of did.
One minute we were fighting, and the next minute, I'm on the floor with a colossal headache,<eos> Lori's next to me, Jared's dead.<eos> Everything in the middle is a blank, Crash.<eos> I mean... do you think...<eos> - What?<eos> - Do you think I killed him?<eos> No, no way.<eos> Crash, I might have...<eos> I can't remember anything.<eos> Carter, you didn't.
- Oh, Max.<eos> - It happened really fast.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.<eos> I did, so start accepting that now.<eos> No, I'm not gonna let you do that.<eos> I have to tell the truth.<eos> What good is that gonna do anybody?<eos> You have your whole life in front of you.<eos> You have Ben to take care of.<eos> No, I don't.
I hope you're right.<eos> I can't believe you're choosing Lori over Max.<eos> I'm not, Taylor.<eos> I love Max, I would do anything for him.<eos> Carter, what... what if the shoe was on the other foot and you asked him to cover for you?<eos> He would do it.<eos> That's not the point, Taylor.<eos> Look, this thing is never gonna be over until he tells the truth.<eos> And Max is not gonna be able to live with himself<eos> - if he doesn't.
I work for the district attorney,<eos> I'm only loaned out to you.<eos> You find it yet or not?<eos> I got it.<eos> I got it.<eos> What's up? Did the cops on the scene take a statement from an eyewitness other than the victim's wife?<eos> Depends.<eos> Is the victim's wife a drug-addled, thrice-collared prostitute?<eos> Uh, no, she's not.<eos> Then, yes, they did.
It's a nick, perimortem.<eos> Damage consistent with that of another gunshot.<eos> Must have been a through and through.<eos> The exit wound would have been extremely close to the ilium.<eos> Have Hodgins swab it.<eos> It may provide clues to the actual murder site.<eos> Hey, I just got off the phone with Sebastian Kohl, who said he left some stuff on my porch because he was in the area. Who's Sebastian?<eos> Uh, shouldn't you be working?<eos> He's a gorgeous, smart, very successful photographer who does not live anywhere near me.<eos> However, Cam does.
It's what IA can prove.<eos> Drop everything and get Detective Deeks out of this mess.<eos> Francis Boyle was an LAPD veteran of 19 years and Detective Third Class when Deeks was assigned to him as a partner.<eos> He's got a lot of reprimands and complaints in his file.<eos> Well, he came through to him the department at a time when accountability wasn't considered important.<eos> This is Boyle's former partner, Detective Bruce Steadman.<eos> He's still on the force.<eos> His docket isn't much better.<eos> The police department split them up, hoping it would reduce the problem.<eos> It didn't.
Really?<eos> Is that all you got left, Deeks?<eos> You're about as defiant as my eight-year-old.<eos> Wow. You have kids?<eos> Whew. Did not see that coming, Mommie Dearest.<eos> Hey, uh, quick question-- are we sure this coffee was made this week?<eos> We found new DNA evidence that places you in the hotel room where Boyle was killed.<eos> Well, that makes sense, since I stayed there for a week while my house was being tented.<eos> We can play this however you want, but you're not going anywhere until you tell me why you killed Boyle.<eos> I didn't.

Did not see that coming, Mommie Dearest.<eos> Hey, uh, quick question-- are we sure this coffee was made this week?<eos> We found new DNA evidence that places you in the hotel room where Boyle was killed.<eos> Well, that makes sense, since I stayed there for a week while my house was being tented.<eos> We can play this however you want, but you're not going anywhere until you tell me why you killed Boyle.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Then who did?<eos> Not my case. I'm so confused by this.<eos> Isn't it your department's job to find the killer?<eos> We did.
Help him!<eos> Why aren't you helping him? ! Rosie, help!<eos> Look, he's hurt!<eos> Please, you have to help him!<eos> Dr. Rosewood, the gentleman you administered medical attention to several months back is filing a civil suit against you in the coming days.<eos> As your lawyer, I'm suggesting you collect affidavits from as many colleagues as you can and prepare to settle.<eos> In the words of Teddy Roosevelt, it is only through labor and painful efforts, by grim energy and resolute courage that we move on to better things.<eos> By better things, I mean chief ewing is stepping down from the department at the end of the week.<eos> Do I have an emotionally charged speech that lays out how great this man was during his 20 years as chief? No.<eos> I don't.
What's in there?<eos> Our dead guy was an undercover cop.<eos> Place reminded me of my crash pad back when I was undercover.<eos> The instructors always taught all of us ghosts,<eos> "You've got to keep a badge on hand in case you have to identify yourself "when a bust goes down."<eos> Something that dangerous to your cover has got to be hidden.<eos> That is when I learned that the sink trap is pretty much foolproof.<eos> Your party girl Caley bought the victim's legend hook, line and sinker.<eos> She had no idea he was on the job.<eos> Well, someone did.
Well, it's secure.<eos> Compliments of tar...<eos> As long as I use anonymizing software to route my traffic, I'm invisible.<eos> This won't be fast.<eos> Got to go to the profile page for each individual employee.<eos> We don't have that kind of time.<eos> Well, there's no work around.<eos> We don't have enough info on him to narrow him down.<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe we do.
Most of my conversations with Dad consist of awkward silences.<eos> - I have no place to live!<eos> - I don't know how to skip.<eos> I'm graduating in a year and a half, and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life!<eos> Mouthwash doesn't work on me. - Ugh!<eos> Okay, Dad, choose.<eos> - Yeah, Dad, who's it gonna be?<eos> Mike had to do something he never had to do in his whole life... pick between his two sons.<eos> So, he did the only thing a father could do in that situation.<eos> He didn't.
Yes, Doctor.<eos> You know what they say about dashing in the snow --<eos> Head over heels you go.<eos> Very good, Doctor.<eos> George!<eos> - George!<eos> - Sir.<eos> Is this your doing?<eos> Sir, he remains a viable suspect.<eos> No, it does not.
The blackout could be the Chernobyl of the power grid.<eos> Okay, I know that we can't divulge stuff, but I didn't know we'd moved on to spinning each other.<eos> I'm just giving you what the White House's official position is.<eos> Okay, let's try this:<eos> If it was us, was it in response to what happened on Air Force One?<eos> Solar flares happened on Air Force One.<eos> I was read in to that one.<eos> I know about the malware.<eos> Well... but not who was behind it, because we didn't know.<eos> And we do now?
We're not married.<eos> I thought you had a kid together.<eos> We do. Oh.<eos> Another?<eos> Yeah, another, both of us.<eos> Come on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't understand why she'd do something like that without telling me.<eos> Really? Really?<eos> You don't?
Well, I mean, it can't come as a total surprise, right?<eos> So?<eos> So I'm just saying maybe we could've seen this coming.<eos> We have a child together.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> You could always go back to Helen.<eos> She still loves you.<eos> I'm certain of that.<eos> No, she doesn't.
My children still don't speak to me.<eos> But you, man, you... everybody just lets you go, no matter how hard you try to blow it up.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> What do you have that I don't?<eos> - I'm sorry about the glass.<eos> - Don't leave like that, man.<eos> Don't leave like this. Just say something.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> Say that you understand.<eos> Well, I don't.
- Back out.<eos> I... Are you fucking him again?<eos> I knew you'd ask that.<eos> - Well, are you?<eos> - No. No, I'm not.<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> You have to trust me, Noah.<eos> I want to do this for myself.<eos> I don't want to be a doctor.<eos> No? You don't?
You staying out here and commuting to the city.<eos> It's just... I...<eos> That wasn't the deal, Alison.<eos> You were coming out here till Labor Day, helping fix the place up, and then come home. Yeah, I know.<eos> - That was the deal.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> - Well, I want you to come home.<eos> I want to raise Joanie together.<eos> I want to get married.<eos> Do you?
- Yeah.<eos> Of course, don't you?<eos> Come on, Alison.<eos> I love you.<eos> You love me.<eos> We got a kid together.<eos> Let's stop making things so difficult for ourselves.<eos> Let's get married and settle down, be happy, be normal, raise a family.<eos> Isn't that what you want?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
- So why do you stay?<eos> - The money.<eos> - I need your help.<eos> - Name it.<eos> My battalion chief is in legal trouble, some woman accusing him of assault.<eos> It's obviously a set-up, and we're pretty sure that Maddox is behind it.<eos> Her name is Serena Holmes.<eos> I need to find out if Maddox is paying her off.<eos> I don't know anything about it.<eos> - I honestly don't.
You've been cleared of any wrongdoing in the Donovan case. Whoo-hoo!<eos> You don't seem very relieved.<eos> Well, I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> And, then, what's gonna happen to Marcus Donovan now?<eos> Judge ordered a new trial on the murder charges.<eos> So there's a chance the son of a bitch could stay behind bars?<eos> Unfortunately, the case is thin, and in light of Reid's actions, I think a conviction is highly unlikely.<eos> Which means a murderer is free to start killing all over again.<eos> Those bastards have no right!<eos> Unfortunately, Sid, they do.
The cops came last night when everything went down.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure, did they look for the guy who tried to sell to him?<eos> Yeah, they were.<eos> Okay, well, did they find him?<eos> Ben, I know it was you, I saw you.<eos> All right, well, you saw wrong.<eos> Oh, please, Ben, you were with him at the party, and you were dealing.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't sell to Seth.<eos> Ben.<eos> I didn't!
I'm gonna go.<eos> Hey.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Yeah, what's going on?<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Away.<eos> Look, Carter, I know you're not gonna believe...<eos> Ben, I know you didn't sell Seth those drugs.<eos> You do?
If you're looking for Carter, she's not here.<eos> No, we came to talk to you.<eos> There's nothing left to talk about, especially not to a cop.<eos> So what, you're just gonna run?<eos> That's your big plan?<eos> Worked for you, didn't it?<eos> Ben, let us help you.<eos> No, you can't help me, all right?<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
And I can make sure that your name is plastered all over that case.<eos> The only proof you have of my connection to anything is that I attended those parties.<eos> No, because Carter can testify otherwise.<eos> So it's the word of a taxpaying business-owner against a high school dropout, yeah, I'll take my chances.<eos> Plus, you're law enforcement.<eos> Your own kid's involved.<eos> You wouldn't take the chance lying to the DA.<eos> Did Carter ever tell you I kidnapped her?<eos> Twice.<eos> Yeah, she did.
Anything for you, sweetie.<eos> Bye.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> I thought I had it all under control.<eos> I know you did.<eos> I guess I didn't want to need anyone.<eos> Carter, I understand you wanting to take care of yourself after everything you've been through.<eos> It's really tough to need people.<eos> But I do.
Nothing.<eos> Just came down to see how you're doing.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Mmm. What you working on?<eos> Well, I confirmed Baltimore Forensic's finding.<eos> The DNA on the needle does belong to Joy Vanatter.<eos> And then I ran the residue from inside the barrel through Major Mass Spec, and it's black tar heroin.<eos> It's a very cheap low-grade form of the narcotic.<eos> That's weird, 'cause Cheech said that Vanatter was using, um, high-grade heroin.<eos> He did.
Um, but I'm gonna be working late.<eos> All right, we'll play it by ear then.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Charming place.<eos> McGarrett brought the concept of rendition over from the military.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Our interrogation tactics, however unorthodox, do yield immediate results.<eos> Huh, where's the interrogator sit?<eos> We don't.
Come on, I could use a hand.<eos> When were they discovered?<eos> About an hour ago. Ship's captain found the bodies, called Port Authority.<eos> This was an execution.<eos> They're all part of the same crew.<eos> What do we know about the ship they came in on?<eos> Arrived a couple hours ago. Originated from Shanghai.<eos> We checked the manifest-- four containers are missing.<eos> How'd they get past security?<eos> They didn't.
Yeah, Kono, you locate that rental car?<eos> I did, and I was able to get an address off the GPS.<eos> Tracked back to Waiwai Nui Pawn Shop in Chinatown.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Send it through to me, okay?<eos> Good work.<eos> You, you're coming with us-- you're gonna pick out all the items you stole.<eos> Five-O, anybody here?<eos> Looks like, uh... somebody likes cats.<eos> Who doesn't? Huh? Who doesn't?
No, no, you won't talk to her.<eos> You're never even gonna meet her. It's Max, by the way.<eos> Oh.<eos> Max. Hold on, what?<eos> You sure about that?<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Max just said the pawn shop owner died four hours before Katie Dawson.<eos> Doesn't make sense.<eos> If Kaelani already had the camera, why would he go back and kill Katie?<eos> He didn't.
Whatever. Especially you.<eos> Let's stay on point.<eos> We need somebody on the inside, somebody to get Intel and prints.<eos> Danny, you make the most sense.<eos> No.<eos> What do you mean, "no?" No! I'm not gonna do it.<eos> It's ridiculous, first of all.<eos> Second of all, even if I did do it, uh, nobody's gonna buy me as a stuffy economics professor.<eos> Oh, no. I don't know.<eos> Oh, you don't?
It seems Una and Danny Ball had themselves a little party.<eos> Who's Danny Ball?<eos> He's the hotel's resident crooner.<eos> It was a regular thing, apparently.<eos> Yeah...<eos> This is the 999 message she tried to make at 7.18.<eos> MAYOR CRYING And by the time we'd traced the call, the body had already been found.<eos> Where's this singer?<eos> I need to talk to him.<eos> No, you don't.
You going so soon?<eos> Yeah. Sorry.<eos> Glad you like your bracelet.<eos> Apparently, they're all the rage.<eos> I saw a picture of Justin Bieber wearing one.<eos> Oh, I like Justin Bieber.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I thought you liked it?<eos> No, I-I do.
What'd you find?<eos> A patch... pretty crude, hastily done.<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> It's embedded in the photo-tagging software<eos> It was altered so the word "animal" could never appear in a photo tag.<eos> Why would they do that?<eos> To hide something?<eos> Plaintiff has a motion to compel?<eos> Diana:<eos> We do.
You've told me already.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I've got cancer, darling.<eos> Is it serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you get it because of worrying about me?<eos> I was just unlucky.<eos> But the important thing is that, having you back, I feel so much better.<eos> I thought you'd taken your own life.<eos> We both did.
What did you think was going to happen?<eos> Not that!<eos> I'm going to the police.<eos> Leah.<eos> Leah!<eos> They'll laugh at you.<eos> Do you want them to laugh at you?<eos> Leah!<eos> That was when I decided he had to pay.<eos> And he did.
Shame.<eos> No, I'll look after them.<eos> I can ask Geoff for the PM.<eos> Watch out for the...<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> Why did they mention Mum?<eos> I thought you were avoiding me.<eos> Did you kill her?<eos> Mummy?<eos> Well, did you?
They're happy for me to lead.<eos> Thanks.<eos> He had his phone with him.<eos> Yeah, there's no service here, though. I checked.<eos> D'you tell Annette if you're working all night?<eos> Course.<eos> She'd think I was down the pub otherwise.<eos> Or out with my fancy woman.<eos> Which I wouldn't be. Obviously.<eos> Nothing to do with me.
Just you and Issabella Martinez.<eos> No.<eos> What have you done with it?<eos> What?<eos> The cocaine.<eos> I don't know!<eos> OK... Doc.<eos> I'm going to cut you some slack.<eos> Let's say you didn't know anything about the drugs being smuggled in.<eos> I didn't.
Well, actually, erm...<eos> What?<eos> Look. The night it happened. We...<eos> Yes?<eos> We'd just met at the salsa club and...<eos> It was late when we left.<eos> He walked me home and...<eos> We got close, and...<eos> He stayed the night?<eos> No, he didn't, but...
Yes, he said she was a passenger on a recent flight he'd piloted.<eos> Was that true?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Were Dr. Portnow and Ms. Van Gaal on a flight together?<eos> I don't believe so.<eos> You don't believe so?<eos> Didn't you check it?<eos> I did.<eos> So don't you know it not to be true?<eos> - I do.
But I'm not going to do that today.<eos> You took an oath to render an impartial verdict, based on the law and the evidence.<eos> Each and every one of you violated that oath.<eos> - Judge!<eos> - Save it, Matan.<eos> As a matter of law, I find there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction here, so I am vacating the jury's verdict and entering a judgment of acquittal.<eos> Come.<eos> Mrs. Florrick.<eos> How else can I help you?<eos> What you did up there...
- 100 crunches a day.<eos> - That's how you do it.<eos> - Adagio, Andrew, adagio.<eos> I don't want everybody feeling too good about themselves.<eos> Ha ha. My apologies, Maestro.<eos> Gentlemen, I take back everything I just said, but may I tell you, sir, your performance tonight was magnificent.<eos> Oh, thank you, Andrew.<eos> Thank you. I'm so pleased that you're putting a nice, fresh coat of paint on this old vessel.<eos> Oh, you know how it is.<eos> - I do.
Anthony.<eos> And you are?<eos> Lucy's father.<eos> Lucy?<eos> I know Eddie's taken my daughter.<eos> And I know he wants Jules Hope but that's not gonna happen.<eos> You're with Jules Hope?<eos> You better star making sense.<eos> Now, I don't know where Eddie is.<eos> No-one does.
Well, I certainly didn't do it.<eos> Where did Brendan get all this shit from?<eos> He's going down for something that he would've never ever fucking did.<eos> Oh, what about me?<eos> Why would he say this about you then?<eos> You tell me.<eos> He was over by you that night.<eos> That night he came over, we had the bonfire and he was home by 9:00, 'cause Jodi called me at 9:00, and I was in the house already.<eos> So you're telling me when he got off the bus, he didn't come over by you with an envelope from out of my mailbox?<eos> No, he did not.
You were only in the well for three hours.<eos> * Want to give you one more beso... mwa! *<eos> Seriously? Listening to your own music?<eos> You know what? I actually don't hate that song anymore. * Baby, don't say adios *<eos> Hey, there, dance party!<eos> Come on! Let's go, guys.<eos> * 'Dontist * I'm getting serious now.<eos> * It's the ladies screaming out "Basta Boys" * Oh, no, she didn't!<eos> Oh, no, she didn't.<eos> Oh, yes, she did.
Really, probably more important even than the closings.<eos> Because by the time they get to that point, um... it's gonna be a matter of arguing for a few of them probably.<eos> I think most of them will probably have already decided.<eos> So we want to get 'em early.<eos> Just get 'em thinking that there's another side to this they have not heard.<eos> All they've been hearing, for what, 15 months, is, you know, Teresa Halbach was burned. Bones were found on Steven Avery's property.<eos> Which is a horrible fact.<eos> But what they don't know is that there's evidence those bones were moved.<eos> And so...<eos> And neither does the media.
Had I thought of it, yes, sir.<eos> Would it have been fairer to give that to Mr. Wiegert or Sheriff Pagel?<eos> Same answer. Yes, sir.<eos> And before you went rummaging through Steven Avery's bedroom, once, twice, three times, whatever it was, for hours, would it have been fairer to Steven Avery if someone other than a person who had been deposed in his lawsuit had done that search?<eos> No, sir, I don't think it would've been.<eos> [Kratz] At least around here, maybe not in Milwaukee, maybe not in Brookfield, maybe not in Madison, but around these parts, if you're gonna suggest that a cop is crooked, you're gonna suggest that a cop committed crimes, then you better have something other than "Your elbow was on the table."<eos> And in this case, to suggest that these police officers planted evidence with nothing, that is, with not one shred, at least anything that I've seen, that approaches evidence, I think is absolutely deplorable.<eos> [Steven on phone] I'm in the same situation that I was before.<eos> There's a couple of 'em wanting to nail me.<eos> And the other ones didn't.
Correct.<eos> The report that you filed makes no mention of the Toyota key?<eos> That's correct, sir.<eos> Were there things that you did not want to commit to paper in a report?<eos> No, sir.<eos> While we're on Steven Avery and your reports about him... that phone call, the phone call where a detective from another law enforcement agency told you you may have the wrong guy in jail?<eos> Yes, sir?<eos> Did you ever write a report about that?<eos> No, I did not, sir.<eos> Well, actually you did, didn't you?
Even the top dog sheriff has to sign a log like this, right?<eos> You should, yes, if you're going by that checkpoint, yes.<eos> Well, unless you were eluding the checkpoint in some way, you would really have to sign in, wouldn't you?<eos> Correct.<eos> All right, so the log shows that Lieutenant Lenk signed out at 10:41 p.m. - on Saturday, November 5th. Correct?<eos> - Yes, if this is all November 5th.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, if you take a minute and look through there and show me where Lieutenant Lenk signed in.<eos> Do you see an entry that Lieutenant Lenk signed in anywhere on that log on November 5th?<eos> No, sir, I did not.
I was gonna raise fish.<eos> Me and Steve.<eos> That's why I put this building up.<eos> And I made those tanks, I made my own farms.<eos> I just wish that, you know, he could...<eos> [Strang] There's nowhere that Steven Avery will be able to go to get his reputation back if he wins this trial.<eos> He didn't commit the rape he did 18 years for.<eos> We know he didn't commit the rape he spent 18 years in prison for.<eos> Where did he get his reputation back for that?<eos> He didn't.
- OK, who did?<eos> - Probably Steven.<eos> - No, not "probably." Who did?<eos> If you know, you need to tell me.<eos> You were over there.<eos> - Steven did.<eos> - Did you see him do it? - Yeah.<eos> - No, honestly, yes or no, did you see him do it?<eos> Don't lie about it. If you did, good.<eos> If you didn't, good.
This shit is ridiculous, man.<eos> Come on.<eos> This place is...<eos> Do you do a lot of recording down here?<eos> Nice little hangout spot.<eos> Very cool.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Told you, Harper.<eos> - Yes, you did.
- I don't wanna go with you. - You're sorry, that's bullshit!<eos> That's right. I wanna stay here with my kids. That's what I'd rather do.<eos> Would you stop using your kids as an excuse?<eos> I know you have to stay here with your kids!<eos> You're acting...<eos> You have this immature life.<eos> You have no responsibility!<eos> I have an immature life!<eos> I have an immature life. You don't know what it's like to be a parent.<eos> No, I don't!
I have you and your brother.<eos> We are in a dangerous situation.<eos> You're my responsibility.<eos> Are we ever gonna see them again?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I hope so.<eos> How much longer are we gonna be here?<eos> Not long.<eos> We're...<eos> I don't...
I'm not even gonna be here next year.<eos> I'm a senior.<eos> I should be having fun.<eos> Nice nails.<eos> Yeah, some girl did that in sixth period.<eos> You planning on keeping them?<eos> Until it comes off, I guess.<eos> Last summer it was the earrings, and now the nails.<eos> You got a purse to go with all that?<eos> A lot of guys do that.
You're a pretty good mom yourself.<eos> I'll take that.<eos> Tyler has a playoff game on Saturday...<eos> ...and I think that for the very first time, he won't actually be completely dreading it, thanks to you.<eos> Tell your... His father the more he works with him, the more he's gonna get confident the more he's gonna belt the ball anytime he gets up there.<eos> Yeah, well, his dad's not really into working with him, you know because to do that, he'd have to show up, which he's just not good at.<eos> You gotta show up for your kids.<eos> It should be boring how reliable a parent is.<eos> It's funny to me that some people don't get that.<eos> You do!
Big time! Look at you!<eos> Mom's not home.<eos> This is my dad.<eos> Mark.<eos> Yeah. Who are you?<eos> Jim!<eos> The cool guy from the safari.<eos> Do you wanna "bowl" me a few pitches?<eos> I'm sure your father wants to do that with you.<eos> No, he doesn't.
What do you hope to achieve, Mark?<eos> Well, I wanna be the best in the world.<eos> I wanna go to Worlds and win gold.<eos> I wanna go to the '88 Olympics in Seoul and win gold.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> Are you getting the support that you need?<eos> What do you mean, sir?<eos> Well, you know how the Soviets support their wrestlers.<eos> I do.
If you're sure it's no trouble?<eos> Of course it isn't.<eos> Is it, darling?<eos> Not at all.<eos> - Oh, yes, that is good.<eos> - So, erm...<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - Do bears even have names?<eos> - Of course we do.
Alex it's very important you understand what's happening.<eos> This is real.<eos> It's not a dream, it's not drugs, or anesthetics.<eos> I know I'm dreaming, because I can feel all of this.<eos> Alex, Amputees can often feel their missing appendages. It's called Phantom Limb sensation. What do you mean amputee?<eos> What the hell did you do to me?<eos> Alex you need to relax.<eos> Take this off of me now. Alex you need to relax<eos> I need to get out of this thing.<eos> What did you do to me?
What did you say?<eos> We work for Antoine Vallon.<eos> My hand, man!<eos> Where is Antoine Vallon?<eos> I know you remember me, Jerry.<eos> Where's Vallon?<eos> Wait! If I tell you where Vallon is he'll kill my wife and kid man.<eos> Your wife left you in 2019 after filing charges on you for domestic abuse.<eos> And you don't have a kid.<eos> But I do.
This... park business seems to be picking up speed.<eos> Now that Rockefeller's thrown in with them, they're making real offers.<eos> - They'll be coming to us next?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Rockefeller's $5 million behind them.<eos> We're not interested.<eos> Well, I was asking your husband's opinion, Mrs Pemberton, not yours.<eos> Easy.<eos> Well, I don't want you to worry about it.<eos> Well, I do.
Right here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The first of our dozen.<eos> - You want me to take that?<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> I got it, Mr Vaughn.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's perfect, George.<eos> - How do you know it's a boy?<eos> - I just do.
You lived your life, even though it pissed me off.<eos> I'm proud of you, kid.<eos> Gin.<eos> - That card was up your sleeve.<eos> - No, worse.<eos> For eight days, Henry Altmann never got angry even once.<eos> Except at the very end, when he told death to go fuck himself.<eos> And then he turned his thoughts to things that pleased him... and sailed away.<eos> No one expected Sharon Gill to go back to her old life.<eos> And, indeed, she did not.
I mean, The Man Up Show?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> You've listened to it, right? It's asinine.<eos> No. You were his boy.<eos> And as far as he was concerned, the sun rose and set on you and your siblings.<eos> Judd.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> But I do.
Y'all don't want to do that.<eos> Get off of me.<eos> Jesus, thank you.<eos> Come on.<eos> You didn't follow one rule.<eos> I did follow rules.<eos> I told you don't touch nobody.<eos> It looked bad at the end, but you have to admit that for a second I had it under control.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Yes, I did.
I need to get rid of this clown.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> My fault.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I didn't expect that to happen.<eos> Hey, I got a clue, didn't I?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Wait.<eos> He never entered the building of mine.<eos> I saw the whole thing from my surveillance camera.<eos> His own man shot him in the back and left him for death on my doorstep.<eos> A cold blooded setup. Your full of shit.<eos> Now get down on your knees.<eos> - Get down on your knees!<eos> - Damien. - There's a problem. - What?<eos> The number didn't come through?<eos> No, it did.
- We've been very bad, you know.<eos> - Mmm. - We're going to get a terrible report.<eos> - Mother won't be surprised.<eos> - She thinks she has a very odd daughter.<eos> - Not odd.<eos> Just interesting.<eos> I've never known where I fit.<eos> Does it need to be a place?<eos> Well, I don't know what to say to the pair of you!<eos> No, really, I don't!
- Needs great harmonies. - I don't want to sing the song.<eos> I'm not...<eos> Everything is awesome<eos> Everything is cool When you're part of a team<eos> Everything is awesome<eos> When we're living our dream<eos> Quick, let's go.<eos> Everything is awesome<eos> Hmm, I thought you didn't like that song.<eos> I don't.
But you... he would have loved.<eos> Lian, I...<eos> He's been out there for hours.<eos> With the right people by his side he will hold the peace.<eos> You sound like one of those priests that blessed us as we marched off to war.<eos> The ghosts you really see them, too?<eos> And what do they ask of you?<eos> - Mine don't talk.<eos> - They don't need to.<eos> And if they did?
No, but why does this upset you? Well, because it's upsetting.<eos> I mean, here she is... shouldn't they be happy that she's getting someone who's achieved something in life?<eos> I mean, after all, she's not getting any younger.<eos> And why does she act like this?<eos> You know, Pegeen and her transformation is like this orgy of spending and spoiling. And I'm out of money. I'm just...<eos> Simon, there's desperation in your voice.<eos> Well, I'm out of money, I can't act anymore, and what am I going to do?<eos> How am I going to keep her?<eos> You shouldn't have to buy Pegeen's affection.<eos> What if I do?
So, Milo, you hear about your wild and crazy sister?<eos> Are you... He doesn't know?<eos> Your wild and crazy sister has been taking...<eos> Give me a drumroll.<eos> Come on, drumroll. Come on, louder.<eos> Scuba diving lessons.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Doesn't that sound like fun?<eos> Yeah, if you like scuba diving, yeah.<eos> I do.
He'd destroy me now.<eos> And you've beaten Bobby.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> Bobby has problems.<eos> So did Mozart.<eos> He might crack.<eos> Bobby won't crack.<eos> He will explode.<eos> Bobby, Bill's here.<eos> Ah. Hey, Bobby, how you doing?
You got to go.<eos> Hey, Bob.<eos> How you doing? Nice to see you.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> Say hi to Nadia.<eos> Don't forget to stitch her up when she stabs herself, okay?<eos> Tossing the missing piece of the One-Armed Man around like a ham... and the front door's open!<eos> He didn't see anything.<eos> But he could've.<eos> But he didn't.
- Disgusting!<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> I get the point.<eos> Clara.<eos> What does he look like?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Was it awful in the mental hospital, Clara?<eos> - How should I know?<eos> - I assumed you were mentally ill.<eos> - You did?
Well--<eos> Doug, what are we gonna do about this?<eos> Well I think it best we leave it in the capable hands of the Woodbury P.D.<eos> They seem to have things under control.<eos> Now if you'll excuse me, I've got some business to attend to.<eos> [ Fonda ] Doug did have business to attend to.<eos> Fuck!<eos> There was no time to dwell on his latest victory... because an even greater challenge lay ahead-- ending Kara's reign at the Tour de Woodbury.<eos> [ Janet ] Consult!<eos> You do it!
On your feet maggot!<eos> That is no way to address an officer, sergeant.<eos> It's how I address a slack-jawed recruit before I bust his hole with my boot heel, maggot.<eos> Hold up there, sergeant.<eos> Can I help you, sir?<eos> Where the hell am I, sergeant?<eos> Forward Operating Base Heathrow.<eos> You just came in with the fresh recruits.<eos> Do I strike you as a fresh recruit?<eos> No, sir, you do not.
- Well, you gotta try it.<eos> Ray, come on, I don't want any.<eos> - Just have a taste.<eos> - I don't wanna taste it.<eos> Look how he blends the lime juice with the toasted sesame oil and the crunchiness of the chicken.<eos> - What are we doing?<eos> - Take it easy for a minute.<eos> - Walter!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - How you doing?
This is no way to treat one another.<eos> You have no idea what's going on here.<eos> Maybe somebody should tell you that your entire fucking family is dead!<eos> - Dead!<eos> - Leave her alone!<eos> Enough!<eos> Whatever this is, if the food was infected, we need to prepare ourselves for the worst.<eos> Let's go to the bridge.<eos> Ortega can help us.<eos> And how do we do that?
Shut the fuck up.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> You, look at me.<eos> Lights out, motherfucker.<eos> Things just got real for you, kid.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Bet you'd like to stick your dick in that, huh?<eos> I'd love to.<eos> I bet that kid doesn't even know what a pussy looks like.<eos> I do.
I'm leaving.<eos> The fuck you are.<eos> This isn't a good place, Crystal.<eos> It's a dead end.<eos> You should get out too.<eos> With who?<eos> With you?<eos> Do you love me?<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Everything you've got written there... I did it.<eos> And most of it I regret.<eos> But...<eos> No.<eos> I don't have an excuse.<eos> I don't have an explanation.<eos> And if that means I need to spend four to six more years before I get another chance... fine.<eos> I'm gonna have to live with that too.<eos> But I will get another chance.<eos> And when I do...
Attention on deck.<eos> We are now arriving at Fire Island Pines.<eos> Welcome to Fire Island, everybody.<eos> Please take care exiting the boat.<eos> Those steps can be wet.<eos> Also double-check you have all your luggage...<eos> Have a good day.<eos> - Hey, Weeks.<eos> - Hey, honey.<eos> How you doing?
Niles, you were Reinhardt's boyfriend.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> He died three weeks ago.<eos> Wouldn't even let me say goodbye.<eos> Not even let me kiss him goodbye.<eos> He's dead?<eos> So sorry.<eos> It can happen this fast?<eos> It just did.
- Excuse me.<eos> If we want anybody to show up for this dance, we have to get these out tonight.<eos> We need to go through and scratch out the word "gay" with a Magic Marker.<eos> Oh, honey, 10,000 times?<eos> Bruce, I have sympathy for kids living at home on Long Island with their parents, but... but the guys who are getting these...<eos> look at you.<eos> You live at home... you live alone, you own your own apartment, your mother lives in another state.<eos> Okay, what about my mailman?<eos> You don't expect me to take you seriously.<eos> - Yes, I do, Ned.
I know they are.<eos> - Can we kiss?<eos> - Felix.<eos> You have nothing to fight back with.<eos> You have no immune system to speak of.<eos> Your body is now open to every conceivable type of infection.<eos> You must be careful.<eos> I'm going to do my damnedest, so must you.<eos> I bet you say that to all the boys.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
I think that you just... got to have the bad days so you can love the good days even more.<eos> This day has been terrible!<eos> Terrible day.<eos> Yeah!<eos> A horrible day!<eos> A no-good...<eos> Very bad day!<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think this day sucks!<eos> Yes! It does.
English.<eos> Not "whatever."<eos> Just English.<eos> You need to stop. Ok?<eos> Please.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> I just wanna make sure you're ready.<eos> I've been ready my entire life.<eos> Remember, don't talk about mom and dad. If they ask, just say you were young. You don't remember anything.<eos> I don't.
No, not really.<eos> You're asleep the whole time.<eos> Come on, let's go over here.<eos> Aren't we too close to the fence?<eos> You're allowed, when you're with me.<eos> I've never been in the ocean before.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Go for it.<eos> I got my results.<eos> You did?
My parents were cured. They didn't love each other.<eos> They were just going through the motions.<eos> Every town is its own prison. And I wanted my own life. Not the one the government chose for me.<eos> So the next time you tell me you don't have a choice, I'm telling you, you do.<eos> Maybe you did.<eos> But, I, I could never walk away from my whole life.<eos> It's not about what you're leaving behind. It's what's out there waiting for you.<eos> Nothing is waiting for me.<eos> Well, don't you look nice this morning.<eos> I always do.
Yes it is.<eos> It's true.<eos> It's why we're looking for him every day.<eos> I know I should have told you earlier.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> Because I couldn't.<eos> I'm trying to stop this cure. So are my friends. But we can't talk about it.<eos> Look what happens to people who do.<eos> So this whole time you were lying to me. Telling me you like me.<eos> Because I do.
I just want to leave...<eos> But why that now, Leo?<eos> It's not the first time I think about that.<eos> It's been awhile.<eos> Just imagine how cool it would be to go somewhere and no one knows you<eos> No one knows who you are<eos> You can invent a new personality if you want to.<eos> What?<eos> You don't like your personality?<eos> I do.
You think so?<eos> !<eos> Ah, they've been so close lately.<eos> Wanna know what?<eos> Let's go drinking without them, then.<eos> Where do you think there's vodka?<eos> Hey, Carlinhos.<eos> You've got any Vodka?<eos> Giovanna?<eos> Karina's party did you some good, huh?
She's awake.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's Ben.<eos> Your Ben.<eos> If I'd have known you were in any kind of danger, I'd never have stayed away.<eos> I had to.<eos> For Adam's sake.<eos> He's our son, Chris.<eos> And he loves you very much.<eos> We both do.
What's a matter?<eos> Come on, you wanna fight?<eos> You wanna go, big man with the ladies?<eos> - Come here.<eos> Let's go. Like this.<eos> - Come on, Tommy.<eos> Like this. Like this.<eos> He's hooking. He's hooking.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Don't do that.
Hey, why you gotta say that kind of stuff?<eos> Look, first of all, Sinatra wouldn't be caught dead in that jacket.<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Tommy got it off a truck.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Tommy's a two-bit hustler.<eos> He doesn't see the big picture.<eos> Yeah?<eos> So what do I do?
You're under arrest.<eos> - What?<eos> - For what?<eos> - Defrauding an innkeeper.<eos> - What?<eos> You fellas played here last year?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You stay at a Holiday Inn?<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> - Well, they do.
Did you know my mother?<eos> Intimately.<eos> But don't worry anymore.<eos> I will take care of you.<eos> Lara!<eos> Please, Lara.<eos> Please...<eos> Please, Lara, let's leave this place.<eos> You don't want this.<eos> You don't!
Something is troubling you, my dear.<eos> This cannot last, Silas.<eos> Eventually we will be discovered.<eos> The spring is coming.<eos> People will come. Visitors.<eos> We cannot just lock them out.<eos> The only reason any of us are here is because the world wanted to be rid of us.<eos> We're embarrassments to our family, exiles to the human race.<eos> We will not be discovered for the simple reason that no one cares.<eos> My husband does.
-Because I'd read to her in the womb, she knew my voice immediately. It's like in one moment everything is different.<eos> It's like all the stuff before...<eos> It's a gift. - We're figuring it out...<eos> - We're just animals. But now, okay, real life.<eos> I can't remember Goldilocks either anymore. The porridge part, but not what happens.<eos> - She gets eaten, right?<eos> - Does she?<eos> There's like an oven that's too hot.<eos> You don't want kids, right?<eos> Because I don't.
Yeah. A roster.<eos> It's a group of girls that you're hooking up with that keeps you from sending the wrong message.<eos> - Which is what?<eos> - That you wanna date one of them.<eos> You gotta start building a roster.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It'll help ease the transition a little.<eos> No, no.<eos> I do not need a roster.<eos> Okay? Yes, you do.
Oh, we weren't supposed to do that.<eos> You weren't supposed to do that.<eos> See?<eos> I was encouraged.<eos> Another example of just plain awful parenting.<eos> But, like, the job that you have right now, like, is it something that you actually want to be doing?<eos> You know what?<eos> It can be fun.<eos> But do I love it?<eos> - You don't.
I know.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go tell her how you feel.<eos> Go make a scene.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Make a public spectacle.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Dude.<eos> Go big.<eos> Do it like the movies.
We got 100.<eos> 20%.<eos> Twenty of 100, that's what 20% is.<eos> - You didn't go to school?<eos> - Hey, hey!<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> Look who's here!<eos> It's the boss!<eos> Fresh out of the slammer, huh?<eos> How you doing, jailbird?
Yeah, I have.<eos> Sucks to be 13, doesn't it?<eos> Whatever.<eos> Scoreboard, bitch.<eos> Hey, what am I supposed to do?<eos> - What you're gonna do is play your side!<eos> - All right, I got it! Stop yelling at me.<eos> - Get in the bunker, Danny!<eos> - All right! I'm in! Just relax.<eos> What you gonna do?
Wow.<eos> All right, let's do this!<eos> - All right, you good? - Good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Go, go!<eos> - Hang tight.<eos> - Fly, baby.<eos> - Whoo!<eos> You're up.<eos> All right, do it!
No, I...<eos> I'm not doing anything.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> This isn't real.<eos> How'd you do that?<eos> What?<eos> How'd you break the glass?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just did it.
I'm not doing anything.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> This isn't real.<eos> How'd you do that?<eos> What?<eos> How'd you break the glass?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just did it.<eos> You just did it?
Human child, find the selkie's true coat, then she can sing the song and save us all.<eos> Quickly, human child, before the owls return.<eos> That pipe will see you to the outside world.<eos> I'd like to sing some more.<eos> Go on so.<eos> Do-la-mon, a-pena pwee, Do-la-mon...<eos> There's a bus.<eos> Quick, Saoirse.<eos> I just saw real fairies.<eos> Course you did.
Just give me one minute. I just wanna say one thing and I'm gone.<eos> Everything's a mess. Everything's insane.<eos> My dad, my mom. Everything I thought about them?<eos> Lies.<eos> Lies. Lies, lies, lies. Nothing makes any sense anymore.<eos> I gotta figure out what I'm gonna do with Harry.<eos> Of course I wanna save him. You know?<eos> I wanna save him because he's my best pal.<eos> And what if my blood works?<eos> But what if it doesn't?
Wished him ill?<eos> I did.<eos> Dead?<eos> Yes.<eos> Deputy Hanson testified that you told him... that only you were allowed to drive that car.<eos> Not even your late wife.<eos> It's my car.<eos> But now a man's blood, a man that you hate... was found on a car that only you drive.<eos> But you don't know how it got there.<eos> I do not. No.
Objection.<eos> Asked and answered.<eos> Overruled.<eos> Correct.<eos> So on one of the worst days of your life... you enter the mini-mart... you see a man you hate...<eos> Objection.<eos> Argumentative.<eos> Let him finish.<eos> You see a man that you hate, and minutes later... you've altered your route... and both you and that man are on the same road at the same time... only you're in your car with his blood on it... and he's in a ravine with his kidneys ruptured and his back broken... and you don't remember hitting him?<eos> I do not.
I have her.<eos> Let me go, Charles.<eos> There.<eos> You see?<eos> Secret Serviceman.<eos> Left of the stage.<eos> - Got him.<eos> - Go.<eos> What the hell are you doing? I didn't tell you to activate them.<eos> I didn't.
-I'm not sure.<eos> But it felt like it had happened.<eos> That's what scares me.<eos> Horrible!<eos> And no one has asked for forgiveness.<eos> Not even me.<eos> No one has asked for forgiveness.<eos> So what happened?<eos> It's so horrible I don't dare tell.<eos> Then don't, you stubborn fool.
I can not imagine the guilt, remorse.<eos> The feeling you know, You should have it.<eos> Who is behind schedule penguins?<eos> Who is behind schedule Norther?<eos> His it is better.<eos> What?<eos> Sorry guys, but this time you can not lead.<eos> We are a team and you're our captain.<eos> We do not need these guys.<eos> We do not Kovalsky, but Pesak yes.
You gave me no choice.<eos> I have a company to think about!<eos> Not anymore! Fucking idiot.<eos> Do you hear me, Mal?<eos> Move away from there.<eos> Destroy now not all that paint.<eos> Do you hear!<eos> You can take everything I have, Mal!<eos> Do you hear!<eos> No, do not!
What my child's telling me will get me laughed out of this town.<eos> That's what I'm saying. I don't know what to preach.<eos> I don't have anything to say.<eos> Just speak from the heart, Todd, like you always do.<eos> What about fear do we struggle with?<eos> Is it confusion?<eos> Is it doubt?<eos> Is it questions?<eos> I got questions.<eos> We all do.
- Where did you see him?<eos> - In heaven.<eos> I loved my grandfather very much.<eos> He was there with me when my father couldn't be.<eos> He taught me to weld.<eos> He gave me that slingshot.<eos> I know. We play with it.<eos> That's right. And he was a good man.<eos> He was a really good man, but I don't know what he believed in.<eos> None of us did.
...nine, 10...<eos> Turn around!<eos> Maisey... you're safe.<eos> Maisey.<eos> Come here, honey.<eos> I know I might look scary, but... I would never do anything to hurt you.<eos> Come sit with me.<eos> It's over.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You do?
- Some of the kids I could've carried.<eos> - You saved so many people, Gale.<eos> Without you, there would be no District 12. Not even the memory of it.<eos> This is where you kissed me.<eos> I didn't think you remembered that.<eos> I'd have to be dead to forget that.<eos> Maybe not even then.<eos> I knew you'd do that.<eos> How?<eos> I didn't.
-Hi.<eos> -Hi. -Hi.<eos> -You guys go to Lincoln?<eos> -No, we go to Peabody.<eos> Peabody's the best public school in our city.<eos> We are not in the Peabody school district.<eos> If you live here, you're supposed to go to Lincoln a school that is totally, 100 percent terrible.<eos> Unless you like getting your A kicked by Irish kids.<eos> -I don't want to get my A kicked.<eos> -Honey, nobody does.
I'd like to do this again sometime.<eos> I'd even shower and show up.<eos> How about that?<eos> - You promise?<eos> - Yeah, I promise.<eos> I guess I wanted to do that.<eos> I wanted to do that, too.<eos> Good to know.<eos> I wouldn't mind doing that again.<eos> Then do it.
- My parents think you're dangerous.<eos> - They're right.<eos> Sooner or later, I'm gonna have to pay for what happened today and I can't have you standing next to me when I do, OK?<eos> - I can't have you getting hurt.<eos> - I'm not gonna get hurt.<eos> You hang around with me long enough and you will.<eos> I don't care! I don't care!<eos> I mean, Dawson, do you want this?<eos> Do you want me?<eos> I do.
- They're right.<eos> Sooner or later, I'm gonna have to pay for what happened today and I can't have you standing next to me when I do, OK?<eos> - I can't have you getting hurt.<eos> - I'm not gonna get hurt.<eos> You hang around with me long enough and you will.<eos> I don't care! I don't care!<eos> I mean, Dawson, do you want this?<eos> Do you want me?<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
Slow down! - Whooo!<eos> God, it used to be so beautiful.<eos> I just... this is how we're supposed to do this?<eos> I mean, yeah, I don't know.<eos> This is where he scattered Clara's ashes, so...<eos> - Right. - Seems all right to me.<eos> Well, we should say something.<eos> - No. - OK.<eos> We love you.<eos> We do.
It's just a matter of time.<eos> - If you turn yourself in... - They'll arrest you as an accomplice.<eos> Witnesses saw both of us with the body in the hotel hallway.<eos> You arranged fake passports for us.<eos> - No, no, no, no... - You accompanied us to Crete.<eos> And now you're carrying, what, an extra $1,000 of my money in your pocket?<eos> I'm trying to help you.<eos> I know.<eos> Did you know he was dead?<eos> Colette doesn't.
You don't have a choice!<eos> Be a man and milk me. Milk yourself!<eos> Try milking yourself!<eos> I'm sorry. Okay.<eos> Get on your hands and knees.<eos> We need a pail or something.<eos> What?<eos> You gotta get on your hands and knees.<eos> I'm not a cow!<eos> Well, how else do you do it?
Brad Pitt before grab clit.<eos> Deez nuts before skinny sluts.<eos> Masturbate before I ask her to date.<eos> Beef stew before watching The View.<eos> Male erection before One Direction.<eos> Mario and Luigi before Thelma Louise-ee.<eos> Bert and Ernie before squirting' spermy.<eos> Man purses before regular purses.<eos> Makes sense. Yeah. Okay.<eos> It does.
Well, maybe you should be.<eos> That's never been me.<eos> Just because I'm a mom doesn't mean that I'm gonna change who I am.<eos> Well, just because I'm a father, it doesn't mean I can stop doing mushrooms with teenagers.<eos> Fine! Fine!<eos> Good. Good, then.<eos> Okay, Kevin, I don't think we're a good team anymore.<eos> The team is breaking up. Yep.<eos> This worked before we had Stella, but...<eos> Now it doesn't.
The problem is that they're on probation.<eos> I know. They're being careful.<eos> They're never gonna do anything ridiculous, because they're watching themselves.<eos> What would be great is if they didn't think they were on probation.<eos> Our probation's been lifted! Our probation's been lifted!<eos> Our probation's been lifted!<eos> Yeah, this is amazing.<eos> I want a baby. I'm gonna have a baby.<eos> You don't want a baby.<eos> I do.
I feel like I should really tell Anthony that you never left.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You're supposed to be my friend.<eos> I mean, it was you and me and Savan and Danielle before he ever even asked me out.<eos> - But I'm not going to tell him.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Because he bought a ring. And he's going to propose to you.<eos> Yeah. That's right.<eos> He did.
No, that's...<eos> You know, if the Thornhills want quality give them quality.<eos> We don't pimp no Numbers trash.<eos> We've come up in the world, like Kratsov.<eos> You wanna go downstairs, kidnap some s-s-skirt, and get s-s-snuffed like Kratsov?<eos> For what?<eos> Plenty of little chickens out there we can get for a handful of f-f-feed.<eos> See, that's why I run this operation.<eos> You don't know nothing about retail markup.<eos> And you do.
But none of this matters, of course, if you win.<eos> - Who was that?<eos> - He said he was a reporter.<eos> What was he asking you?<eos> If you guys had said anything about other things the guy might have done, the destruction of a sacred place.<eos> He gave you something?<eos> - Yes. - Before the next challenge, please take out your New Orleans Parish Library card.<eos> My library card?<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> - No, you don't.
You're fucking sickening.<eos> You know why we always picked on you?<eos> 'Cause you fucking asked for it!<eos> You walked around with that stupid look on your fucking face saying, "Please punch me in my fucking throat."<eos> The day after we threw you in the dumpster, you passed me in the quad and you smiled at me.<eos> You fucking smiled at me!<eos> My brother pissed on your brother's face.<eos> You remember that?<eos> You can't tell me you don't remember that.<eos> I do.
As far as I can tell, I've...<eos> I've barely made par.<eos> My God, you're serious.<eos> Would you prefer I made a joke?<eos> Oh, I don't think you know what those are.<eos> Hardly seems fair that that's a requirement for employment here, Mr....<eos> Commander Denniston, Royal Navy.<eos> All right, Mr. Turing, I'll bite.<eos> Why do you wish to work for His Majesty's government?<eos> Oh, I don't, really.
It's about cryptography.<eos> Like secret messages?<eos> Not secret.<eos> That's the brilliant part.<eos> Messages that anyone can see, but no one knows what they mean unless you have the key.<eos> How's that different from talking?<eos> -Talking?<eos> -When people talk to each other, they never say what they mean.<eos> They say something else, and you're expected to just know what they mean.<eos> Only I never do.
Go on, then.<eos> Turn that thing off.<eos> No. Don't, please. Please.<eos> Please!<eos> Please!<eos> No!<eos> N-No. No!<eos> Don't!<eos> Well, then, it seems that your great big expensive machine doesn't work.<eos> It does.
Or would you like me to go and fetch your precious Christopher to help?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Mm...<eos> I want you... I want you to stay because I-I like you.<eos> I like... talking to you.<eos> I like talking to you, too, Alan.<eos> And what if you weren't alone?<eos> What if you had a husband?<eos> Do you have one in mind?<eos> I do.
-R.<eos> -R.<eos> My God, you did it.<eos> You just defeated Nazism with a crossword puzzle.<eos> There are five people in the world who know the position of every ship in the Atlantic.<eos> They're all<eos> -in this room.<eos> -Oh, good God.<eos> Oh, I don't think even He has the power<eos> -that we do right now.
And we'll have each other's company.<eos> We'll have each other's minds.<eos> That sounds like a better marriage than most.<eos> Because I care for you.<eos> And you care for me.<eos> And we understand one another more than... more than anyone else ever has.<eos> I don't.<eos> -What?<eos> -Care for you.<eos> I never did.
- Oh... He loves an image of me.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> Tuck...<eos> What happens if I get a divorce?<eos> Well, I... I think we both know that you'd never be able to come back here and...<eos> Your children would suffer the most.<eos> They are heirs to a European throne, Grace.<eos> And add to that the fact that you would have been a failure as a Princess.<eos> I don't want to say no to the movie.<eos> I don't.
- That's not it.<eos> I mean, that may be true, but..<eos> Something is happening to you.<eos> - And I don't know if it's what happened before ... - It's not.<eos> - ..or not.<eos> - Believe me.<eos> - Ok, then what? What ?<eos> !<eos> I don't know, Phillip, sometimes sometimes you just look at everything, and... ..it's all just different, d'you know?<eos> Yeah, I do.
It may well be , sewer leading into the sea.<eos> Do I need to know where the garbage is ?<eos> If such a dangerous virus unleashed and became a pandemic would the guy who invented the vaccine , become a folk hero .<eos> I'm just trying to save lives.<eos> That's why Porter is so important.<eos> He has the key to the vaccine.<eos> For your legacy to the world.<eos> Now we need you to move out .<eos> - You do not understand.<eos> - I do not?
Mistakes can be corrected but you must pay the price.<eos> If you need me, do you know where I am.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Police!<eos> Do not move!<eos> Down on your knees!<eos> Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - You know why we are here.<eos> Of course he does not, Ange?
Could you please review Eee Tee for the Atari 2600?<eos> I mean it's the worse game of all time.<eos> Heard legends of it that it's buried in the landfill somewhere.<eos> Let's just keep this one buried.<eos> Why is it called Xenophobe, anyway?<eos> Well, apparently it means having a fear of anything foreign.<eos> Well, if by foreign it means a drooling, alien creature that's gonna kill me, you bet your ass<eos> I fear it. When in the name of the ass are you going to do the Eee Tee?<eos> You are my last hope.<eos> Please do Eee Tee.
Thank you.<eos> She won't return any of my call, she's ignoring my text.<eos> Why are girls so crazy?<eos> Man makes us crazy.<eos> You know what I mean though, you with this crazy person and make you crazy.<eos> You just wanna shake them and show them what you see.<eos> - Yeah, I've been there.<eos> - How'd you handle it?<eos> Me?<eos> I didn't do anything. Nothing?
You're telling me...<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> I look for fulfilling work all the time.<eos> I just happen to be taking a break whenever you're around.<eos> It's like studying when mom is watching.<eos> Did you talk to your parents about the lease?<eos> Because the deadline's on the first and Cedric is willing to take over if you... yeah, no, I haven't made a decision on that yet, per se...<eos> How did you not make a decision yet?<eos> I mean, what did you do today?<eos> What did you do this week?
Most guys like naked me.<eos> I love naked you.<eos> Naked you is awesome to look at and touch.<eos> What I mean is that you could make the getting-naked-there part a little like...<eos> What's up? Boop.<eos> Then you take your bra off the side.<eos> You could even imaginary pole, just bring it, smack it.<eos> Bring it down...<eos> oh God! Bring it up.<eos> Do the little ass thing with your underwear.
-Super touchy-feely lately.<eos> -I can't process this. This is too much.<eos> Anyway, so, what's even going on?<eos> - Did we get in trouble with the police, or...?<eos> -We did, yeah. - Yeah.<eos> A lot. -We got arrested for along list of felonies.<eos> But because you took a bullet for the detective, DA got rid of the biggies.<eos> Ha, ha. Pretty sweet.<eos> All right, so I'm guessing we saved the business.<eos> - Nope. We did not.
Sit down.<eos> Do you know why I'm here?<eos> - Mm.<eos> - You have a brother.<eos> Peter, yes?<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Are you close?<eos> He's my brother.<eos> Why didn't you tell me he fought for the Resistance?<eos> He doesn't.
Nothing.<eos> Okay.<eos> We're short one.<eos> We're missing one.<eos> - You've gotta be kidding me.<eos> - We're missing a goddamn panel.<eos> We have to go, fellas, unless you speak Russian!<eos> We've covered all this area.<eos> We didn't look here.<eos> - We did.
So, girls...<eos> As the weather is nice. It's hot, there's the sun.<eos> Enjoy the moment!<eos> Come on, fagots! Strip! You'll dance a little naked there.<eos> You're going to caress a bit. Let's see if you're queer or not.<eos> What are we waiting for? Undress, guys. They don't understand.<eos> Handsome!<eos> Handsome! No, but look at him!<eos> He doesn't understand!<eos> Really, he doesn't!
I'm making memories by myself.<eos> I have no one to share them with.<eos> Yeah, well, we got our whole lives for that.<eos> When does that start?<eos> Even when you're here, you're not here.<eos> I see you.<eos> I feel you.<eos> But you're not here.<eos> I hate the Teams for it.<eos> I do.
We've the cape and the cow.<eos> You've got the cape!<eos> What have you done with the cow?<eos> - She ran away.<eos> - What?<eos> I never even reached home.<eos> I've been looking for her all night.<eos> How could you?<eos> Well, she might just as easily have run away from you.<eos> - Yeah, but she didn't.
I mean three kids.<eos> Just coming all this way just to party with the old folks. It's just...<eos> Mom, are you okay?<eos> I'm sorry, just, I think I do need to go powder my nose after all.<eos> You're the best.<eos> You're so lucky. Got a good man, good... couple of kids, and you even still got your figure.<eos> Oh, your figure is fine, Betty.<eos> Bob certainly noticed.<eos> My mother would say, "Count your blessings, babe"<eos> Oh, I do. I do.
Anyway...<eos> Even if you were to turn me in, I wouldn't lift a finger.<eos> But...<eos> But?<eos> You have to think about the kids.<eos> And you have to think about yourself, Darcy.<eos> Honey, you have to think about yourself!<eos> Who is going to believe that you lived with me for all these years and you didn't know?<eos> - Didn't even suspect.<eos> - I didn't...
- Sure, sure.<eos> It's okay I, I... I understand.<eos> I'm really tired.<eos> It was a long drive. It was exhausting.<eos> Could you turn out the light honey, huh?<eos> Would you mind?<eos> Stupid bitch!<eos> Did you really think I was going to let you live?<eos> Did you really think I was going to let you live, huh? Did you really think that I was gonna let you live?<eos> Did you? Huh? Huh?
No, not yet.<eos> But you know, all good things come to those who wait.<eos> - This is nice.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's... How long has it been since we've had a... a girl-girl afternoon?<eos> Oh, I don't know, a couple of months?<eos> That's right, because you and Bob are so tight.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know how you do it, Darc.<eos> - Honestly. - Yeah, neither do I.
The wires are cut.<eos> Derrick is missing.<eos> That guy Bo has got to be fucking with us.<eos> What if Bo did something to Derrick?<eos> Might not be Bo.<eos> What?<eos> I saw Derrick and Ryan fighting earlier.<eos> What?<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Yes, I did.
I said that he tried to kill everybody.<eos> No.<eos> You said that he killed the caretaker.<eos> How would you know that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't...<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> How did you know that the truck doesn't work and that we had to walk?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Kennedy, I don't...
He has something.<eos> - I can't see who he got it from.<eos> - We're about to see right now.<eos> Look, look, look, look.<eos> He has a paper. You did not get her number.<eos> Totally got her number. Right there.<eos> You doubted me, and my spy glasses worked.<eos> You, too, you're a sellout.<eos> No, uh-uh, you didn't get Emma's number.<eos> Yes, I did.
Really?<eos> Oh, come on, this is what the Internet is for.<eos> Um, "step one, get a driver's license."<eos> - Do we have one of those? - Oh, wow.<eos> All right, am I good?<eos> ' - Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Dude, do you even know what you're doing?<eos> No, I don't.
Mycroft's intelligence is not nebulous at all, it's specific, incredibly specific.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's not an underground network, John, it's an Underground network!<eos> Right.<eos> Sometimes a deception is so audacious, so outrageous that you can't see it even when it's staring you in the face.<eos> Look, seven carriages leave Westminster.<eos> Mm. And only six carriages arrive at St James's Park.<eos> Ah, but that's, I mean, it's impossible.<eos> Moran didn't disappear.<eos> The entire tube compartment did.
Help me up.<eos> How long have you and my husband been seeing each other?<eos> I don't know... a couple months.<eos> Did you just start sleeping together?<eos> We were going to hold off for prom, but we just got carried away.<eos> We're adults. We had sex.<eos> The details don't matter.<eos> The details do matter, because... there's a difference between having sex one time and having sex ten times.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Did you do it more than ten times?
Mmm. Good morning, big boy.<eos> Okay, guys.<eos> Ready for school?<eos> Nope.<eos> Ha-ha!<eos> Very funny.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Where's your backpack?<eos> We love school!<eos> - Yes, we do.
You want to tell me what this is all about?<eos> I mean, if you want me to protect this, don't you want me to know what it is?<eos> - No, I don't.
I just got off the phone with Max Stone. Yeah?<eos> How are things in Buffalo?<eos> Well, I guess you didn't ask him then, when you called him behind my back.<eos> Max is an old friend of mine.<eos> He calls me up to congratulate us on the Callahan thing and I express my opinions on the matter.<eos> He call you, or you call him?<eos> It's such a crazy day.<eos> Who remembers?<eos> Yeah, well, how 'bout try and remember this, I can and I will fire your ass.<eos> Then do it, Sonny.
You're her boyfriend.<eos> I fuck her from time to time.<eos> Does that make me her boyfriend?<eos> Does around here.<eos> She has a lot of boyfriends, I've heard.<eos> How many?<eos> You want me to confess to adultery? Is that why you're here?<eos> Somebody beat her up.<eos> - Did she tell you I beat her up?<eos> - No, she didn't.
Thank you.<eos> - You all right? - Yeah.<eos> Take your hands out of your pockets.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Why?<eos> I heard you had a gun.<eos> I have to say I'm surprised.<eos> Thought I'd have to go looking for you.<eos> Just 'cause I'm here doesn't mean you have to go through with it.<eos> Yes it does!
You were supposed to e-mail me your sound treatment over the summer.<eos> I have radio, BSU... now this Head of House thing.<eos> Okay, do you want this?<eos> Look, this thing might as well be my right hand.<eos> I was busy this summer.<eos> Your peers are out getting internships, making short films.<eos> My dad was sick.<eos> I had to go home.<eos> If you need time, take it. But if you want to be here next semester...<eos> - I do.
Honey, I'm home!<eos> Oh, and the party is over before it's even begun.<eos> Sweetheart, where are you?<eos> There you are.<eos> What's for dinner?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why are you dressed like that?<eos> What? You don't like it?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Tell him!<eos> - No trouble. - Okay, yeah.<eos> Yeah, your word. Give him your word.<eos> My word.<eos> That's right.<eos> This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen.<eos> He violated me. Tully, he violated me.<eos> He had his hands all over me.<eos> He didn't touch her. He didn't touch her.<eos> He did!
Get on, pace me.<eos> What?<eos> What did I do?<eos> Did I hurt you?<eos> No, I'm just messing with you, man.<eos> I can't feel anything.<eos> Man, I...<eos> Sometimes my legs hurt so bad, I'd wish I didn't feel anything.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No, I don't.
It is a submarine.<eos> There are no windows.<eos> What is looking for?<eos> There is no chimney, right?<eos> No son, no chimney.<eos> Come here.<eos> It is a good sign.<eos> They like you.<eos> Store that.<eos> What do you doing for me?
"Balby"?<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> -You better do this!<eos> -No.<eos> Hey, what about a wager?<eos> -A wager?<eos> -If I win... You give me my life back.<eos> You have nothing I want.<eos> But I do.
It's my fucking time, Yuda.<eos> And I want my father to know that.<eos> - It won't be long now.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> When?<eos> Wait here.<eos> Hello?<eos> I've seen many a man fall before they should.<eos> They could have lasted a little longer had they known when to stop.<eos> But they don't.
You caught your boy rubbing up on some hot little skank... And he apologized to you by busting you a good one.<eos> Worse.<eos> Worse?<eos> I went to the bar where he works to surprise him.<eos> And out he comes with this girl who had no business being in a bar.<eos> On the very first night that we met... We walked by a bakery that was having their sugar delivered.<eos> And it was in the air, everywhere.<eos> A sugar storm.<eos> And before he kissed me... He leaned in...<eos> And did this.

Just don't piss her off.<eos> See you, guys.<eos> Elvis has left Missouri.<eos> She had to have made a mistake.<eos> We need to check Amy's story, piece by piece.<eos> Nick, I can't do anything.<eos> We had the national spotlight on us, we stained the rug.<eos> The case is with the feds now, they're done.<eos> That doesn't mean you have to be done.<eos> It does.
- Should we wait for Lassie?<eos> Is the suspect inside?<eos> No, Carlton, just his wife.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Pretty sure, yeah.<eos> Well, like I said, I kicked Patrick out a couple days after he missed our anniversary dinner.<eos> He tried to make up this tall tale about being arrested for sticking up for himself.<eos> But there's no way that's true.<eos> Marie, I am sensing that Patrick had a serious problem with one of the other patrons at Javva the Cupp?<eos> Yes, he did.
With what pathologists think were tools.<eos> The first took place eight months after Davis's family was tortured with similar tools.<eos> You see, I think he picked 'em.<eos> I think he picked all of them, but what the fuck do they all have in common?<eos> Well, Ackerman was a child molester.<eos> None of the others were.<eos> Well, they do all have criminal records.<eos> So you think this behavior started<eos> - with the death of his family, right?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Good morning, fellas.<eos> So, you got a trail name?<eos> You know, like a nickname.<eos> We've got one for you.<eos> - Really.<eos> - Queen of the PCT.<eos> Come on.<eos> You've just got so many stories about people doing things for you and wanting to help you out.<eos> I mean, nobody ever gives us anything.<eos> No one ever does anything for us, in fact.
Check the patient's kidneys.<eos> Could be in renal failure.<eos> That's good.<eos> So you can stay for the next surgery.<eos> I've got an angioplasty starting at 2:00.<eos> Oh. I actually have plans.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Does he know that this thing is gonna be ending in a couple of weeks?<eos> 'Cause the kid at dinner last night didn't really seem to know.<eos> Of course he does.
911.<eos> What is your emergency?<eos> Hey. Um...<eos> I just saw some kids break into the zoo down on Lakeview.<eos> Yes!<eos> Love is in the air, Davey.<eos> What's that smile for?<eos> I'm thinking of asking Sabine to marry me.<eos> Does Jade know?<eos> No one does.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Anne, please.<eos> David didn't get into UGA.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Uh, no, I didn't.<eos> Although I'm not surprised.<eos> I am.<eos> It's why I called Helen and she said she never got my letter.<eos> You told me it went out with the mail.<eos> It did.
Just hear me out, okay?<eos> Two tickets.<eos> We can leave tonight. We could go anywhere.<eos> This isn't over, Jade.<eos> I refuse to believe it's over.<eos> I haven't moved on.<eos> And I don't think you have either.<eos> Do you love this other guy?<eos> Do you love him like you love me?<eos> Do you?
- It'll be seven years.<eos> Isn't it time you moved on?<eos> I have moved on.<eos> I don't mention him. I don't talk about him.<eos> What strain is that on you, Claire?<eos> You're not even good enough to have a dad.<eos> Everyone else has one and you don't.<eos> I do have a dad!<eos> I listen to your life day in, day out, and you never stop to ask me anything about mine.<eos> I do!
What's the advice Drummer?<eos> Forget about what you're thinking. Remember our deal.<eos> We need him alive.<eos> So he can sit in a courtroom and beat this on a technicality?<eos> Those are orders, Barney.<eos> - You broke the phone.<eos> - I got another one.<eos> Think we'll make it back from this one?<eos> You didn't have to come along, Christmas.<eos> Sure I did.
- But I didn't need it upholstered.<eos> Nor do I need silk lining in my jacket, or pistachio cream for my dessert or oysters!<eos> Not everybody can be rich, dear.<eos> September 2nd, 200 francs.<eos> October 5th, three-seventy-five francs.<eos> November 20th, 450 francs.<eos> There's no end to this.<eos> You owe me ten thousand francs, and you must begin to pay.<eos> - But I have nothing to pay you with!<eos> - Oh, but you do.
I can get you the car.<eos> I'll get it. - I will take a finger...<eos> - No. ...for every day that you do not bring me my Porsche Carrera.<eos> No, please, I'll get it.<eos> I'll get the Carrera, I'll get it.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> - Told you not to fuck with me, right?<eos> - Yes, and I won't.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Did I not?
Listen, Dex, erm, I can't come to the final ruck.<eos> - What you talking about?<eos> - I'm looking to get out. Going straight.<eos> Got a geezer who said he'll sort me out with a job.<eos> A proper job.<eos> Not a florist.<eos> Dex, I got a kid to support.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No. You're right.<eos> I don't.
Jayant, I've no time.. ...and you've run out of time.<eos> Understand.<eos> You're helping someone who robs the helpless.<eos> And I am giving you respect, accept it.<eos> What's the problem with me?<eos> Do I have long teeth?<eos> Long nails.<eos> Are my feet backwards?<eos> Do I have a long tail?<eos> I don't, do I?
Last week, an alleyway off Buck Street, first call of the night, I pull a baby out of the bottom of a dumpster.<eos> I'm giving it mouth-to-mouth.<eos> It's already dead.<eos> Just a little, tiny, dead sack in my hands.<eos> All right?<eos> There you go.<eos> That's my week.<eos> You didn't tell me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I did not.
Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> Have I dealt with my inability to commit?<eos> How do you deal with that kind of thing?<eos> I don't know how to deal with commitment issues.<eos> I mean, you either have them or you don't, right?<eos> Or like, you have them until you commit, is that how it goes?<eos> Yeah, so then I still have them.<eos> How do we end this?<eos> What do we...
Dr. Allison says there's not enough "solid evidence. "<eos> But his critics say Allison is motivated by something else... by all the money he has repeatedly taken. from Coca-Cola, Pepsi.<eos> and the American Beverage Association.<eos> I know you've received a lot of money from the food industry in general.<eos> Was there evidence that said the ingestion of sugary beverages actually contributed to the obesity problem?<eos> Ingestion of all calories contributes to the obesity problem.<eos> One question you might ask is whether sugary beverages contribute more so than do other calories.<eos> That's a very challenging question to ask.<eos> Well, let me ask you that.<eos> Do they?
And clearly we're determined to finally take on one of the most serious threats to their future, and that's the epidemic of childhood obesity in America today.<eos> We've got some talented chefs and nutritionists here to teach us how to make healthy breakfasts.<eos> Farmers' markets do more than just help Americans feed their families healthy meals, they help...<eos> We're issuing a call to action.<eos> We need you not just to tweak around the edges, but to entirely rethink the products that you're offering.<eos> In the first months of the Obama administration she was exhorting the industry to change its products and to cut its children's marketing and to really make substantive changes that way.<eos> My guess is when the food industry heard Michelle Obama launch her Let's Move campaign they reacted in terror<eos> Our kids don't choose to make food products with tons of sugar and sodium and super-sized portions and then to have those products marketed to them everywhere they turn.<eos> That's a terrifying discussion for the food industry.<eos> So what did they do?
Shh! It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> My name. She said my name.<eos> Do you want to talk about it?<eos> I doubt it, Mom.<eos> Well, maybe she does.<eos> We're a family that talks, so if you would like to talk about it, then-<eos> I was just spooked.<eos> I - I'm sorry. I don't know why.<eos> Yes, you do.
It doesn't matter.<eos> We're in this together.<eos> I'm not sure about this.<eos> Maybe she can tell us something.<eos> Something like what?<eos> Like something useful, something we should know, something that could help us.<eos> She was there the whole time.<eos> Maybe she saw something.<eos> Maybe there's something we need to do.<eos> Do?
Yeah.<eos> Have the feds been here?<eos> Not since the funeral.<eos> Good.<eos> She was loved by many.<eos> Have you seen your sister?<eos> No.<eos> I haven't seen her or Irish.<eos> I told you what would happen.<eos> Yes, you did.
You know, not...<eos> Not since the funeral, no.<eos> I want to take Mom's ashes.<eos> I want to take her to the lake.<eos> She would have wanted it that way.<eos> Yeah. I think... yeah.<eos> - I think she'd...<eos> - Hey.<eos> - She wanted that.<eos> - Yeah, she did.
Oh, sorry, no, hula woman. Oh!<eos> - Fuck off, Bruce.<eos> - You fuck off.<eos> - Good shot.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> You need to dance, Bruce.<eos> You were lost.<eos> This is your chance to get back.<eos> - I don't have a partner.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
What do you need to catch the Ungli gang?<eos> Sir, the Ungli gang thinks differently.<eos> Their method is different.<eos> Their purpose is different.<eos> To catch them, we have to think like them.<eos> We'll have to do something different.<eos> Then do something new!<eos> Yes, Mishra, tell me!<eos> - Kale, my blood pressure is off the charts right now.<eos> Did Nikhil do something?
We autorickshaw drivers will not be secure until the culprits are caught!<eos> This guy wants to meet us again.<eos> Monday.<eos> Same time, same place.<eos> Doesn't seem like he's going to stop.<eos> Have to admit...<eos> he has a really wicked mind.<eos> Truly.<eos> Sending the rickshaw driver with his rickshaw to Delhi...<eos> What a badass thing to do.
But only the things left behind by those who hustle.<eos> I was thinking the exact same thing.<eos> What are the odds?<eos> What are the odds.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You're not how I imagined you'd look.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> Someone should have told you that.<eos> Well, you just did.
You could have had that earlier.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll stop.<eos> But you have to do something for me, too.<eos> What's that?<eos> The bird.<eos> What about it?<eos> It has to go.<eos> Why?<eos> What did it do?
I told you... You should've stayed away.<eos> Your pretty flowers are all dead now.<eos> Everything's over now.<eos> Who's there?<eos> That's Midori.<eos> I don't know her real name.<eos> I thought you understood me.<eos> What are you doing to her?<eos> Do you really want to know?<eos> Do you really?
It's got T-tops.<eos> Man, they don't even make those anymore..<eos> And that rear window is louvered.<eos> - That is some posh shit.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> That's like having French blinds on your car.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> There he is.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> How you doing, Lonny?
- Rumors get thrown out there all the time.<eos> - They're talking about it everywhere!<eos> It's the best rumor I've ever heard and it's probably got its own<eos> - team of publicists spreading it.<eos> - Jill, I don't give a fuck about that!<eos> - Should I click on this, Chord?<eos> - Sure.<eos> ...convention, and screw up your schedule?<eos> You know what all those people you stood up will think?<eos> You do, right?
Down the south corridor!<eos> Freeze!<eos> I know you think you're helping him... but you're not.<eos> You're not.<eos> Unless we get him to come in... I can't start trying to make sense of what happened.<eos> Someone killed my mom.<eos> That's what happened.<eos> It was not my father.<eos> Without hearing his side of the story, they can't know that, can they?<eos> I do.
There's no margin for error.<eos> You fuck this up and one of them hits the panic button, then it's, 'Whoo-ooh,' game over.<eos> But, if they're scared enough, they won't do shit.<eos> So you get your gun right in their fucking head, say, 'Don't fucking move or I'll fucking waste you.'<eos> You look like you mean it, they'll just about do anything you say.<eos> Come on, I've got to go see about a driver.<eos> She needs fucking tightening.<eos> Maybe you're just not driving it right.<eos> - When did they let you out?<eos> - They didn't.
She took off and just started really fucking up.<eos> Um, I think she probably got jealous of, like, Hollywood trash.<eos> TMZ deemed her the A-list actress that dreamt of making it to the Z-list.<eos> You could have told me sooner.<eos> You despise Internet gossip.<eos> This is not gossip.<eos> It's information.<eos> It's celebrity news. it's fun.<eos> - I thought you liked her a lot.<eos> - I do.
- You hungry?<eos> "You'll be my lover.<eos> I'll keep driving everyone else away.<eos> I'll have a tighter and tighter hold on you."<eos> Honestly, you don't find this ridiculous?<eos> - Why, 'cause she speaks brutally?<eos> - No, because it's phony.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> So you don't think people can be blinded by their own emotions.<eos> No, I do, but not to that extent.
Alpha coded.<eos> 7 digits password...<eos> Why you wasting time, Charlie!<eos> If it's a glass safe, Break it and take the diamonds!<eos> Shut up, Nandu!<eos> This opens with a 7 letter password...<eos> If we put in the wrong password, the alarm will go off. Dammit... dammit... dammit.<eos> Dammit! I underestimated Grover.<eos> I don't know anything about this safe.<eos> But I do.
That's what I do.<eos> I know a hot property when I see one.<eos> "Hot property"?<eos> This is a hot property?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You bet your ass.<eos> Look, I-I-I...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't need an agent actually.<eos> Yes, you do.
My granddaughter.<eos> How do they know how to do this?<eos> Well, its nature.<eos> It's how baby turtles know how to run into the ocean after they've been born.<eos> And I guess it's how bees know how to make a hive.<eos> Nature's amazing. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.<eos> We should film it.<eos> That's such a great idea.<eos> Too bad we don't have a camera though.<eos> What... Oh, no. Yeah, you do.

I think I know where they are.<eos> What if we are now where we think we are or even went?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> If we passed through a wormhole. A wrinkle in the space time fabric.<eos> Theoretically, we could be in different dimension with those people who don't exist...<eos> Or they never exist?<eos> That is insane! Stop it!<eos> That's enough! All of you!<eos> I know what's going on here.<eos> You do?
Do all what?<eos> Practice, the road, making records.<eos> Starting a family.<eos> I ain't starting nothing.<eos> Except what we doing.<eos> Bobby, we in there.<eos> All them little grooves.<eos> That's us.<eos> That's all the money we got.<eos> And some we don't.
Is this all over the house?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> She's trying to protect the house.<eos> It smells really bad, though.<eos> Dad!<eos> What?<eos> She's getting it all over my room, too.<eos> There is no bad spirit.<eos> What did she do in your room?
- Yeah.<eos> - Fresh start.<eos> - We got a brand new life.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We're getting old.<eos> - No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean kind of.<eos> I got a job.<eos> - You did?
Welcome.<eos> Grandma's room's right there, boys.<eos> So I signed the discharge papers. I thought that might help.<eos> "Help" would be taking her in yourself, Ian.<eos> No, that would not be.<eos> That would be martyrdom.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's a room.<eos> You told me she had a private room.<eos> She did, at first.
Already took Georgia.<eos> Uncle Billy's coming.<eos> Burning down every thing in his path.<eos> Rest assured, it'll be cruel.<eos> And the crueler it is the sooner it'll be over.<eos> We can hold 'em.<eos> Girl, I believe you can.<eos> You know how many battles I fought in?<eos> Don't seem like many, easy as you went down.<eos> No. It don't.
No-one<eos> Mr Williams, let me out.<eos> Let us out..<eos> Billy's afraid..<eos> I've checked everywhere Dad!<eos> Me and Billy.. were following somebody outside...<eos> Ok then I heard you screaming.<eos> They're trying to separate us.<eos> Did you see anyone up there?<eos> Did you?
Me and Billy.. were following somebody outside...<eos> Ok then I heard you screaming.<eos> They're trying to separate us.<eos> Did you see anyone up there?<eos> Did you?<eos> Come on Billy! No..<eos> Billy's staying with me.<eos> Do you ever see other people in the house?<eos> Billy, if you see someone, you know you have to tell me?<eos> Did you?
It was only one nanny and people react differently to the death of a loved one and, by the way, this is the same nanny that Mr Williams caught smoking drugs in her room, so...<eos> No way!<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we can do that.<eos> We'll wait for the report back from the psychiatrist and then we'll see what to do after that.<eos> I'm not going to a psychiatrist.<eos> There's nothing wrong with me.<eos> You have to.<eos> We agreed to it.<eos> You did. I didn't.
Nothing.<eos> You know what he's like.<eos> Come on. If we hurry, we can catch the last sitting at Fratellis.<eos> -Glass of wine, sir?<eos> -No, thank you.<eos> God, Mal. You didn't tell me the Judge was here.<eos> -I,assumed you knew. -Mal.<eos> You came!<eos> Just seeing if the old tuxedo still fits after all these years.<eos> Well, it does.
Was or wasn't the apple which fell on Isaac Newton's head a trifle?<eos> A cosmic trifle.<eos> There are no other trifles, only the cosmic ones.<eos> You're thinking about trifles all the time.<eos> Objects are attacking you.<eos> That's good.<eos> Would you say that?<eos> Maybe.<eos> - Do you remember about dinner?<eos> - Yes, I do.
It's the push I need.<eos> You need to let your doctors make that call.<eos> I am a doctor.<eos> Alex, I know how frustrating this is.<eos> Believe me.<eos> But... you need to be patient and try to stay strong.<eos> I don't feel strong.<eos> You sat by my bed for months, and you never stopped believing.<eos> Well, I don't have that same feeling.<eos> I do.
No, I-I'm not using the ghosty thing to spy on Dawn.<eos> Come on.<eos> She'd totally do it to you.<eos> Well, that's not the point.<eos> Okay, you go in and have a quick snoop around, and I will follow it up with an impassioned pitch to get you extubated today.<eos> - Bribery? - Mm.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Okay, sweetheart.<eos> Yes, mommy has to go to work now.<eos> Yes, I do.
It might hurt a bit.<eos> It was the most normal morning in the world.<eos> I got up.<eos> I gave her a kiss.<eos> I went to work.<eos> This is a...<eos> A nightmare?<eos> Yeah, you got no idea.<eos> I blame him.<eos> I do... the baby.
My mom ran the sunday school.<eos> Poor woman.<eos> Tried so hard to get me to believe in something.<eos> Something wrong with your arm?<eos> Well, it-it hurts under the pit a bit.<eos> Let me take a look at it.<eos> Hey, speaking of saints, you know a... a doc named Selena?<eos> Works out of a drop-in on Gerrard?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
No, sir, you are not dying.<eos> I th... I thought I was because of that woman.<eos> I... I started to write my will.<eos> And my... my brother's coming in from Kingston.<eos> - Okay, well...<eos> - You know?<eos> Got a couple hours to come up with a good story.<eos> Can I have my picture?<eos> Hey, Alex.<eos> How you doing?
And she'll be all right, so you can go now.<eos> Look for the big bright light and run like hell straight towards it.<eos> She's not all right.<eos> What?<eos> She left something behind.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Dr. Reycraft.<eos> Dr. Bell.<eos> Apparently, I don't have a girlfriend.<eos> No, you don't.
I think the underwire of your bra is yanking on your staples.<eos> I'm gonna put a dressing on it, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Are you afraid to look at your own blood?<eos> I didn't used to be.<eos> Just don't say anything, okay?<eos> Right.<eos> There's something else you might remember about the old you.<eos> She had loyal friends.<eos> Still does.
Never better.<eos> It went well.<eos> They'll transplant the liver, stabilize you, and then Dr. Goran will operate on your spine.<eos> My spine?<eos> Oh, god, no.<eos> If I can't move...<eos> I don't want to be a burden to my son.<eos> Well, you didn't think he could do this. who knows what he can handle, right?<eos> I do believe in him.<eos> I do.
What on earth for?<eos> Well, with any luck, it will grow new blood vessels and help oxygenate your brain.<eos> What's left of it.<eos> The omentum could actually help regrow it, improve your memory.<eos> Sounds crazy.<eos> Dr. Hamza is an incredible s...<eos> You don't have to tell me.<eos> We hit the jackpot with that guy.<eos> And he has a crush on you.<eos> No, he doesn't.
It's nothing, just a bit of carpal tunnel.<eos> I've seen my share of hand cramping.<eos> That looks more like focal dystonia.<eos> - Are you a doctor?<eos> - A violinist.<eos> Musicians get it a lot.<eos> A buddy of mine had to quit the London Symphony because his hand just stopped working.<eos> Well, I don't have focal dystonia.<eos> Good.<eos> - Because if you did...
You're gonna be okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I-I can't tell you how sick I feel about this.<eos> Um... so, listen, your blood work is in the system... under the name John Smith.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I know you'll take precautions.<eos> Of course, but... you're saying my insurance company won't find out I have hep "C"?<eos> You don't.<eos> John Smith does.
I'm gonna barf.<eos> I'm the most epic fail of all time!<eos> I hate that stupid diving board.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> I thought you jumped off the garage?<eos> No, it wasn't just me.<eos> Those girls were doing it.<eos> But I hit the deck, and then fell right into the diving board.<eos> Didn't Milo tell you that?<eos> No, he didn't.
- A big day for you.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> In honor of the family, the family is open.<eos> I, Niccolo Emilio Tortano... want to enter into this organization... to protect my family and to protect my friends.<eos> Our thing you wish to be a part of,<eos> it's a wonderful thing.<eos> The greatest thing in the world.<eos> Do you feel this way as well?<eos> Yes, I do.
I told you, it makes no difference to me.<eos> Anyway, out of those five girls one girl is my sister. Got it? All I know is..<eos> ...that that terrorist will keep all the kidnapped girls at one place.<eos> We need to save them and also catch that scoundrel.<eos> No, wait a minute. Preeti?<eos> In those five photos one boy's name was Sarfaraz.<eos> I sent my sister in place of his.<eos> Where are you at this very moment?<eos> Santacruz.<eos> Why? Do one thing.
- Yeah.<eos> In front of the kids?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah. All of them.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> That is just painful to watch.<eos> And, you know, it's like the whole time we were together I just remember thinking,<eos> "How can I possibly be this happy?<eos> "She likes me now, "but one day, she is gonna figure out "that she is too good for me."<eos> And then one day, she did.
If I can shoot six out of six on Albert's behalf, you owe him a dollar.<eos> If I can't,<eos> - he owes you a dollar. - Wait, what?<eos> - A dollar?<eos> - I've never seen a dollar.<eos> Nobody's got a dollar!<eos> Let us see the dollar!<eos> Well, this is interesting.<eos> All right.<eos> Do your best, ma'am.
I was drowning. I'm just not capable of...<eos> You deserve to be loved, Eddie.<eos> You do.<eos> I just wanted to be what you wanted.<eos> Now I spend every fucking minute praying to be somebody else.<eos> Somebody I'm not!<eos> Anybody-<eos> Just put the gun down, Ed.<eos> She doesn't love you anymore.<eos> You don't, do you?
That was... twenty years before I put on that goddamn outfit.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Okay.<eos> I was just...<eos> You know, before you come tomorrow night.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I'm going to destroy your play.<eos> But you didn't even see it.<eos> Um, you know, did I do something to offend you?<eos> Actually, you did.
Eddie, please, give me the gun.<eos> It was me.<eos> I was drowning. I'm just not capable of...<eos> You deserve to be loved, Eddie. You do.<eos> I just wanted to be what you wanted.<eos> What you wanted.<eos> Now I spend every fucking minute trying to be something else, something I'm not.<eos> Just put the gun down, Ed.<eos> She doesn't love you anymore.<eos> You don't, do you?
Okay.<eos> Five, six, and...<eos> Dragging just a hair.<eos> Wait for my cue.<eos> Five, six, seven...<eos> Rushing. Five, six, and...<eos> Dragging. Five, six, and...<eos> Why do you suppose I just hurled a chair at your head, Neiman?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Sure you do.
You need to break something.<eos> Try this.<eos> - The trophy?<eos> - Yeah. Are you sure?<eos> I've been looking for a way to tell my father I kind of hate basketball.<eos> Go to town!<eos> Always!<eos> An Imperial Affliction. Yes.<eos> I'm so glad that you liked it.<eos> Yes, I did.
Yeah, just a sec.<eos> Hi.<eos> Sorry, she's asleep.<eos> Yeah. Uh, okay.<eos> All right. Bye-bye.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> It's not fair to him.<eos> It's not.<eos> He doesn't need this in his life.<eos> Nobody does.
They're fiction!<eos> They cease to exist the moment the novel ends.<eos> But they can't!<eos> I get it in a literary sense or whatever, but...<eos> I can't do this, Lidewij.<eos> It's impossible not to imagine what...<eos> I will not indulge your childish whims.<eos> I refuse to pity you in the manner in which you are accustomed.<eos> - I do not want your pity!<eos> - Of course you do!
Ready?<eos> Augustus Waters was a cocky son of a bitch.<eos> But we forgave him.<eos> Not because of his superhuman good looks... or because he only got 19 years when he should've gotten way more.<eos> 18 years, buddy.<eos> Dude, come on.<eos> Really? I'm assuming you have a little more time, you interrupting bastard.<eos> Interrupt me in the middle of my eulogy. You're supposed to be dead.<eos> But when the scientists from the future... come to my house with robot eyes... and they tell me to try them on... I'm gonna tell those scientists to piss off, because... because Gus, I don't even want to see a world without you.<eos> I don't.
Your boy Waters and I corresponded quite a bit in his last days.<eos> Oh. So, you read your fan mail now?<eos> I wouldn't exactly call him a fan.<eos> He detested me.<eos> But he was quite insistent I attend his funeral... and tell you what became of Anna and her mother... so here I am.<eos> And that's your answer, "Omnis cellula e cellula."<eos> "Life comes from life."<eos> I'm really not in the mood.<eos> You don't want an explanation?<eos> No, I don't.
we haven't even met him yet.<eos> He might want to keep things intact.<eos> Seriously? And not clean house?<eos> He's throwing out merc's toilet.<eos> Mm.<eos> Stop it. We need to stay positive.<eos> I have a good feeling about this.<eos> You do?<eos> I don't.<eos> Well, I really do.
Now, I haven't given this one as much thought.<eos> Is that scientifically possible?<eos> It's about this guy who loses his job and has to move home with his parents.<eos> Um, can I stop you right there?<eos> Again, it's an area we explored when you were here.<eos> Uh, did we like it? No.<eos> Ah. In fact, you were the one who said, "it's been done to death."<eos> [Laughs] Well, you know me.<eos> I never remember what I say.<eos> We do. [Laughs]
What are you doing?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Let me be absolutely clear with you, and you, Mr. club sandwich...<eos> This script isn't going to you.<eos> It isn't going to fox.<eos> The only place it's going is in our suitcase home.<eos> I totally hear you.<eos> But...<eos> Obviously, you don't hear me.<eos> I do!
No, she doesn't know anything.<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> - Really? Nothing?<eos> - No, she doesn't know anything.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> So, all you have to is play the game.<eos> - That's it.<eos> - He's not a pervert, right?<eos> You'd like that.<eos> - Yeah, I don't...
Now, listen, you know I hate doing this, princess, but you chose this line of work.<eos> I'm gonna ask you one more time...<eos> Where's my fucking money?<eos> I don't have any... oh!<eos> Did you just fucking lie to me?<eos> Is that what just happened?<eos> - Then where's my fucking money?<eos> I just seen you with that faggot.<eos> So I know you got some. No, I don't.<eos> I don't.
- No, you're not!<eos> No, you're not.<eos> It's just over.<eos> No.<eos> My God...<eos> I love you, Joy.<eos> That was never a lie.<eos> It's just time for us to be in the real world.<eos> What if I don't wanna be in the real world?<eos> Well, I do.
LMNTRIX really brought it last night, so we changed up the plan a little.<eos> You guys duking it out is gonna make for a much more compelling storyline.<eos> Yo, just don't make a fool outta me.<eos> Don't worry, baby, it's in the bag.<eos> This is gonna be some killer TV.<eos> What?<eos> You don't trust me?<eos> - Shh.<eos> - You know I do.<eos> Oh. You do?
- Will you promise me one thing?<eos> - What? - This is legal, 'cause I'm...<eos> - Totally.<eos> I swear, I wouldn't do it if it wasn't.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> Don't you? - Yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> All right.<eos> If you think it'll be OK.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Because of the blizzard.<eos> Right.<eos> So beautiful, Kate. Really.<eos> Just wonderful writing.<eos> It's hot.<eos> Which one is your favorite?<eos> I don't have a favorite.<eos> It's like me with my painting.<eos> I don't have a favorite either.<eos> George does.
The last thing I want them to take from this... is they should hide who they are or what they think... if they believe it will get them into trouble.<eos> Life has its obstacles, but I learned early on... that they will always be lessened if faced with honesty.<eos> I believe the world is a better place if people aren't lying.<eos> In the words of the apostle Paul to the Corinthians:<eos> "Love does not delight in injustice... but rejoices with the truth. "<eos> Yours sincerely, George Garea.<eos> Very good.<eos> I don't have time to read it.<eos> I want to.<eos> But you don't.
Excuse me.<eos> I am looking for my brother.<eos> He may have arrived here a month ago from Northern Sudan.<eos> Where did you hear that?<eos> A letter to my sister from somebody here in the camp.<eos> What is his name?<eos> Theo Deng.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry. There is no one registered here under that name.<eos> So what do I do?
He's such a horrible thug.<eos> Sometimes I can't believe we're actually related.<eos> Oh, I give up.<eos> I do hope you're not in too much pain.<eos> I'm sure I'll survive.<eos> Perhaps you can help me take my mind off things.<eos> Perhaps I can.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> No, no, no. I don't want that.<eos> Nonsense, of course he does.
- What was all that about?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Something important actually.<eos> - Work?<eos> - No.<eos> Another woman?<eos> I said something important.<eos> I believe you have something for me.<eos> How do I know I can trust you?<eos> You don't.
The wrecks at sundown.<eos> Once he sees the pouch with the seal unbroken, he will hand over the page.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> It's unclear which is more appealing, your beauty or your intelligence.<eos> You are very kind, monsieur.<eos> Well, let's not get carried away.<eos> You.<eos> Is there a problem, Captain?<eos> She doesn't have your page.<eos> Flint does.
Right now.<eos> The boat is waiting.<eos> We can be free of this place.<eos> We can have a life together.<eos> And it can start this very minute.<eos> All you have to do is say yes.<eos> Set us both free.<eos> Come in.<eos> Max, I need you to tell me where the page is.<eos> And if I don't, then what?
I can't help feeling we're making a terrible mistake!<eos> We're not making a mistake, we're making history!<eos> Don't worry!<eos> C.J! Let's go!<eos> "The end will come."<eos> Welcome, everyone, to the Grand Reopening... of the newly renovated Hayden Planetarium... here at the Museum of Natural History.<eos> New York's glitterati have all turned out... for what has promised to be a memorable evening... filled with the dazzling special effects... and technical wizardry we've all come to admire from this museum... and its renowned Night Program.<eos> Tonight gonna be fun-fun!<eos> Here come Dum Dum!<eos> Hey, how we doing, Sac?
You better come see this.<eos> - Have you ever seen it like this before?<eos> - Never.<eos> This corrosion has never happened before.<eos> It's always been exactly the same.<eos> I wonder what's up with it.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> And to be honest... my father knew the secrets of the tablet better than I did.<eos> Unfortunately, he swore he'd never reveal them.<eos> He never did.
If there is no Camelot... there is no Guinevere and no Lancelot... then I'm nothing.<eos> I'm just a sad lump of misshapen wax. Stop looking at my nose!<eos> - I wasn't looking at it. - You were, I saw you.<eos> You were like this. "Hmm, hmm." Staring.<eos> - I wasn't like that.<eos> - You were!<eos> Don't look at it!<eos> It really is hard not to look at.<eos> Yes, he is.<eos> - I didn't.
She really appreciates everything you're doing for her with the money.<eos> It's a pleasure.<eos> I'm gonna go see her again this week, if that's okay.<eos> Told her I'd spend the night again.<eos> Ah, her sweet boy.<eos> How'd you get the simulit back?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You know, our machine. The Shadow.<eos> When you sold it to Robbie, how'd you get it back?<eos> I didn't.
If you're frustrated, don't take it out on me.<eos> I think that you need to get your cable fixed and stop confusing me with your soap operas.<eos> Well, you beat up on what you can't control.<eos> Makes it bad for everybody else.<eos> I don't know how.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Just try. You do it.<eos> I can't.<eos> You have smaller fingers.<eos> Macie, just do it.
Your home is beautiful.<eos> Gorgeous jewelry.<eos> Costume stuff.<eos> I love it.<eos> - Where is it from?<eos> - London.<eos> And I made this one.<eos> A little insect that goes round and round the world.<eos> Impressive.<eos> You did it yourself?
She wide open just jump on in.<eos> Yeah, she looks a little bit like a whore, but...<eos> What?<eos> I think maybe we too late, Gor.<eos> Norman.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Norman, you sneaky snail.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Wait a second, did you...<eos> Did you...
- Really, really, really good.<eos> - Right.<eos> - I did you a birthday card, Granddad.<eos> - Oh, thanks, Lottie.<eos> She's got something of your mother.<eos> - Can he not play with that?<eos> - Oh, Mickey!<eos> Sorry, I just wanted to show Granddad the badger in the revolving doors and the nun with two heads.<eos> Nobody wants to see a nun with two heads.<eos> - I do.
Never, ever say that out loud again.<eos> Over here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> My brother Doug is going to say a few words.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Well done for shaking off the reporters.<eos> The press have portrayed my father's death as a disgrace.<eos> But what better way to die could he have had than on his favourite beach watching the grandchildren that he loved play play...<eos> I don't know what Dad would have made of all this.<eos> Actually, I do.
- Go!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Holy fucking goddamn motherfucking shit!<eos> You see that guy, piggy he was fucking covered in bloodshed<eos> Grow some balls!<eos> Ouch. What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> God, my eye!<eos> Drive over there.<eos> - Fuck, you're crazy!<eos> - Do it!
Not for the sex, obviously.<eos> For saying 'sex' in front of a whole lot of people.<eos> Totally inappropriate. I should have realised.<eos> This is about the worst apology I've ever made.<eos> Are you done?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, look, can we just...<eos> What?<eos> You know?<eos> No, I don't.
Oh, they also want to know when we're going to sign the indictment against Vasilich and her son.<eos> When we've got a reasonable chance of a conviction.<eos> In their mind, that bar's been jumped.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Andy wants you to meet him outside the Blakely house just before seven tonight.<eos> He'll go over everything.<eos> On site? You want us traipsing round Blakely's house with the cops?<eos> I get dragged out to see the AG, you can get dragged out to assess a theory.<eos> It might even give you what you need for a draft indictment, assuming you still want to stay on Blakely?<eos> Yes, I do.
So why don't you cut the crap?<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> He was a friend of mine.<eos> My condolences.<eos> Whether you did it yourself, or you paid some arsehole to do it for you, we're gonna find out.<eos> And that's a promise.<eos> Richard!<eos> What are they looking at Dad for?<eos> I... I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
No, no, no.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> Excuse me, Owen?<eos> You prosecuted Crown against Gianopolous, 2011.<eos> Yeah, murder case.<eos> Small-time drug dealer fired into a car, claimed he didn't know anyone was in it.<eos> In Judge Renmark's judgement, he cites Crown against Sharp, implies the defence relied on the case. No.<eos> The rule in Sharp didn't apply to the facts.<eos> No, it doesn't.
What did he say against me?<eos> He thinks you can't work so well after being sick.<eos> I said it wasn't true.<eos> I wasn't any weaker after my accident.<eos> I was more motivated, remember?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Are you OK?<eos> Drive.<eos> You don't really believe it can work.<eos> Of course I do.
I wish that was me.<eos> Who?<eos> That bird singing...<eos> Shall we go?<eos> I can tell we're going to split up.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> You don't love me anymore.<eos> You pity me but you don't love me.<eos> Doesn't it bother you we haven't made love for four months?<eos> It does.
I suggest Julien does the count with me.<eos> That suits me.<eos> Does everyone agree?<eos> Happy now you've stirred up the shit?<eos> Friday's ballot was enough.<eos> You shouldn't have scared them so they'd vote against me.<eos> What are you implying?<eos> You told some of them if I wasn't laid off, they would be.<eos> I never said that.<eos> You did.
There was a-- there was a roadblock.<eos> It was cops everywhere that night.<eos> He-- he got out. I haven't seen him since.<eos> He got out?<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> He got out.<eos> There was no way he was getting through that roadblock.<eos> And where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No one does.
It's cool.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I overreacted.<eos> I do that sometimes.<eos> Letting it go!<eos> Poof.<eos> Aw, come on. Let's hug it out.<eos> I don't- - I don't want to hug you.<eos> Why don't you want to hug me?<eos> I just don't.
- I'm sorry. - What?<eos> - I'm sorry, just wait.<eos> I'm spazzing out in there, I know, but something fucking weird like Twilight Zone shit is going on here, and I'm trying to get a handle on it, okay?<eos> Last night we had a nice dinner.<eos> We had a blast together, right? - Yes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Then, we smoked some pot.<eos> I fell asleep on the couch.<eos> Next thing I know, you woke me up claiming that we had just had sex together.<eos> Because we did!
Have you ever prayed so that you can talk about it?<eos> Do I have to go to a mosque to write about religion?<eos> How absurd is that?<eos> You keep saying the imam's feet stink.<eos> What's it to you?<eos> The man walked 10 km in this cold.<eos> And he had to enter the room with those feet.<eos> What exactly are you trying to say?<eos> You know damn well what I'm saying.<eos> No, I don't.
Do you want me to go and see?<eos> No.<eos> Did she come down today?<eos> Probably.<eos> In what sense you ask?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Off you go.<eos> So?<eos> I thought you never went out.<eos> I don't really.
A pussy mouth?<eos> You are a fucking idiot!<eos> Yeah, I'm mad at you, too!<eos> Okay, time out, guys.<eos> Oh! The only reason that I have lived with you this long is because I felt guilty!<eos> - Let it out, Evan.<eos> - I am done... That's good. ...taking care of your shit!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Did you not see that I had the gun?<eos> You did?
I always doubted these two.<eos> Especially this midget.<eos> - No, no, no, that's not it.<eos> I'll tell you what happened.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Shinu said to Angad that..<eos> ..kissing your future bride is an art.<eos> So what did you say?<eos> I said I want to learn the art of kissing.<eos> He did.
You know, I do the chi chi stores and I do the French preschools.<eos> I mean, if you have more than five IMDb credits you can't pick a wedgie in your back yard without me finding out a way to get paid.<eos> I'm the reason people know that Anne Hathaway has a vagina.<eos> I mean, before that, you know, they thought, "yeah, maybe." But they didn't know.<eos> 256 gigs.<eos> Nice.<eos> Anyway, you'll like this.<eos> I stuffed 30 tablets into those mtv gift bags.<eos> You want to know my return on investment?<eos> Nope. No, I don't.
I just thought it sort of happened.<eos> Your mother has a lot to answer for. Hmm, I know. I have a list.<eos> Mycroft has a file.<eos> So, it's the big day then.<eos> What big day?<eos> The wedding!<eos> John and Mary getting married.<eos> Two people who currently live together are about to attend church, have a party, go on a short holiday, then carry on living together. What's big about that?<eos> It changes people, marriage.<eos> Hmm, no it doesn't.
How to resist the temptation to scratch their behinds.<eos> Afferent neurons in the peripheral nervous system.<eos> Bum-itch.<eos> So why don't you see him any more?<eos> Who?<eos> Your previous commander, Sholto.<eos> Previous commander?<eos> I meant ex.<eos> "Previous" suggests that I currently have a commander.<eos> Which you don't.
Bum-itch.<eos> So why don't you see him any more?<eos> Who?<eos> Your previous commander, Sholto.<eos> Previous commander?<eos> I meant ex.<eos> "Previous" suggests that I currently have a commander.<eos> Which you don't.<eos> Which I don't.<eos> Of course you don't.
There was a moment that kind of stuck in the mind, yeah.<eos> Exactly.<eos> When he showed us the letters.<eos> OK.<eos> So, he's brought the letters to London, so no matter what he says, he's ready to make a deal.<eos> Now, Magnussen only makes a deal once he's established a person's weaknesses, the pressure point, he calls it.<eos> So, clearly he believes I'm a drug addict and no serious threat.<eos> And of course, because he's in town tonight, the letters will be in his safe in his London office while he's out to dinner with the Marketing Group of GB from seven till ten.<eos> How do you know his schedule?<eos> Because I do.
This is about a dream.<eos> It's about trying to make a dent in the universe.<eos> Leonard's lawsuit...<eos> Accuses me of stealing his code, his ideas.<eos> He's attacking my integrity and the integrity of this company.<eos> He's attacking this.<eos> And this is all we've got.<eos> All good?<eos> Suits... they don't get it.<eos> No, they don't.
You saw how he lives.<eos> Kevin Neyers was my sperm donor and nothing more.<eos> So, I gave him some money and said goodbye, but guess he figured out who I was?<eos> Found my email address and started asking for more.<eos> He threatened you with going public.<eos> To announce to the world that he's my father.<eos> You think anybody cares?<eos> Well, maybe you care.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Hi.<eos> Are you going to marry Princess Erica on TV?<eos> Can I see your phone?<eos> Did you have a baby when you were 10?<eos> Don't take his phone.<eos> Mom?<eos> Okay, what are you doing with my phone?<eos> Playing Angry Birds.<eos> But I don't have Angry Birds.<eos> You do now.
Just five more feet.<eos> Five more feet, and you're on your mark.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, don't move.<eos> I think I see something.<eos> - Huh?<eos> - There's something out there.<eos> What do you mean, there's something out there?<eos> What is it?<eos> Can you zoom in on that?<eos> What do I do?
He probably doesn't see you.<eos> - Oh, it fucking sees me.<eos> - It ha... it has night vision.<eos> - They have night vision?<eos> That tiger has night vision goggles?<eos> It doesn't have night vision goggles.<eos> It just naturally has night Listen, just keep the line clear,<eos> Dung Beetle, please?<eos> Aardvark is in trouble.<eos> What do I do?

Fantastic.<eos> You have to secure the package.<eos> Secure the motherfucking package.<eos> He's got the package.<eos> He has the package.<eos> I got it; what do I do with it?<eos> Aardvark, there are people coming.<eos> You have to act now.<eos> Secure the package, secure the package.<eos> - What do I do with it?
Fuck you, Dave.<eos> You fucking asshole. I just have one more question for you.<eos> ♪ What is that?<eos> - I don't know what that is.<eos> - Oh, yes, you do.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I never heard that before in my life.<eos> I don't know what you're singing.<eos> You know exactly what it is.<eos> - No, I don't.
I'm weak.<eos> I'm sick.<eos> I get into the houses and I can't leave until I go all over their drawers.<eos> Listen to me, son.<eos> You got one way out. And it's through the grace of God.<eos> You're only how the Lord made you.<eos> You are not flawed.<eos> We, you, me, people, we don't choose our feelings.<eos> There's grace in this world, and there is forgiveness for all, but you have to ask for it.<eos> I do. I do.
Let's get you to your room.<eos> - I can walk.<eos> - I know.<eos> Here we are.<eos> - Am I a guest or a prisoner?<eos> - Well, that choice is yours.<eos> How can I make that choice when I'm dealing with a stranger?<eos> But you're not.<eos> Didn't you name the John Galt line after me?<eos> Yes, I did.
Maybe next time?<eos> I'll decide on the way.<eos> At one point, about 20 years ago, I got transferred to Kansas City.<eos> I didn't want to uproot the kids in the middle of the school year, so my wife and kids stayed in Houston.<eos> I'd just fly in on the weekends to see 'em.<eos> Took me a few visits to realize the hardest thing wasn't living apart.<eos> The hardest thing was... looking at those little pigs' faces on Sunday night and saying goodbye.<eos> Sometimes, if work kept me in Kansas City for the weekend, I didn't fight it.<eos> What am I gonna do, mon ami?<eos> The same as your family did with the phosphate miners and the Machado's family Cuban sugar.
This has been a profound loss for all of us.<eos> There will be no school Monday so members of our community can attend her memorial service.<eos> We encourage everyone to attend to celebrate the life of this wonderful teacher.<eos> What is it?<eos> That was the principal of your school.<eos> What happened?<eos> Norman...<eos> what happened last night?<eos> You said something about Miss Watson was going to give you a ride home?<eos> - But she didn't?
No!<eos> Oh my God!<eos> He did it!<eos> - He killed Herzog.<eos> - It worked. I knew it.<eos> Herzog is dead.<eos> He is dead.<eos> Yes!<eos> Holy cow, that was close.<eos> You did it!
- He killed Herzog.<eos> - It worked. I knew it.<eos> Herzog is dead.<eos> He is dead.<eos> Yes!<eos> Holy cow, that was close.<eos> You did it!<eos> You killed Herzog?<eos> I can't believe that that actually worked,<eos> Of course it did.
- I had a vision.<eos> My wolf.<eos> He's still with me.<eos> Josh?<eos> You don't belong in this plane.<eos> - I'm not going back to limbo.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> You said we're linked, I'll take you with me, I'll leave you there.<eos> - You don't know what I can do.<eos> - Oh no, I do.
OK, I'll go.<eos> I'll see you next month.<eos> You're saying that destroying my death spot erases my way home.<eos> But you and I are linked, and you dragged me down through my death spot.<eos> That's gotta mean I get out through yours.<eos> Well, I guess I gotta find it then.<eos> You see?<eos> This is exactly why you belong down here.<eos> You don't know what you're doing.<eos> But I do.
Nothing urgent.<eos> I updated your calendar.<eos> Ah, fantastic!<eos> Thank you.<eos> I saw your father today.<eos> Aidan?<eos> - Where the hell has he been?<eos> - I didn't ask.<eos> I was under the impression that we didn't need him.<eos> We don't.
But today, I'm a little less worried about perception than I used to be.<eos> As long as I hold that fort, doesn't really matter.<eos> So the street will know what you did.<eos> They will know you betrayed your brothers for a woman.<eos> That story will spread far and wide and you'll never sail beneath the black again.<eos> You'll sit in this place and rot with the rest of the whores.<eos> Something tells me that'll sting worse than dying.<eos> Loyalty, Jack.<eos> It's supposed to mean something.<eos> It does to me, anyway.
- Did you find your bastard?<eos> - Mixed race.<eos> - Do you want me to help looking?<eos> - Leave her alone.<eos> - Have you taped a lot of them?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Can I have a hit?<eos> - You don't smoke.<eos> - Yes I do.<eos> - No, you don't.
- Calm down!<eos> - But listen to me.<eos> This doesn't go here.<eos> - Okay, calm down.<eos> - This is the tunnel.<eos> There is no turns.<eos> There is no turns.<eos> This is straight.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What the hell do we do now?
- They're buried!<eos> - Do we have anything?<eos> - Sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> Where's our water?<eos> Our food?<eos> Do we have any batteries?<eos> For the lights?<eos> Yeah, we should start conserving the lights.<eos> - Shit!<eos> - What do I do?
Watch out, Benji.<eos> Can you read that?<eos> What does it say?<eos> "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."<eos> What?<eos> According to mythology, that's the inscription over the gates of Hell.<eos> What?<eos> I'm not going in there.<eos> I thought you didn't believe in any of this.<eos> I don't.
- I don't believe this.<eos> You cannot possibly know this.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> What?<eos> - He's married.<eos> - Aunt Vanessa?<eos> - I see a sequence of trysts.<eos> - I've never told her anything.<eos> He cannot leave his wife.<eos> No, he did not.
Her son died 20 years ago.<eos> No!<eos> Some nights she still sees him, in the shadows, her little Daniel.<eos> This is the boy that I followed.<eos> He always listened and behaved, but one morning he wanted to go out to play. She refused. He had been sick for many days.<eos> Fever, rash... same as his friends.<eos> But he insisted.<eos> And he never came back.<eos> He disappeared.<eos> They all did.
Vadim?<eos> Wounded...badly.<eos> He can't have got far.<eos> Stop there, Vadim! Stop!<eos> I should have strangled you at the Chatelet, saved myself a lot of trouble.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> For the fun of it.<eos> It was a good trick.<eos> It should have worked.<eos> It nearly did.
OK? Like, I'm, like... I'm, like, a meme.<eos> Know what a meme is? I'm a meme.<eos> I'm a fucking meme.<eos> Carl, you need to take a break.<eos> I've been on a break.<eos> I've had too much of a break.<eos> - No, you need a real break.<eos> - I need to work.<eos> - I need to get back into a kitchen.<eos> - You don't. Carl...
I've also been shooting these videos - one second every day.<eos> One-second videos?<eos> Now you're joking with me.<eos> No. You edit 'em all together.<eos> One second of every day.<eos> And then you cut 'em together and watch it. It's cool.<eos> OK, enough with the virtual world.<eos> How about something real?<eos> Who wants to stop at Disney World?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I do.
I do not wanna hurt anybody.<eos> Sir, put the gun down. Put the gun down. Put the gun down, sir.<eos> You put that down.<eos> My wife and kids are in this house.<eos> Get your gun.<eos> You don't have it?<eos> - Dumb shit.<eos> - Sir, put the weapon down.<eos> Trespassing.<eos> - Sir, don't do that.
Why? How?<eos> What can I say?<eos> I didn't see or hear him do anything.<eos> Wouldn't I just be a stronger witness for him?<eos> You validate the opportunity.<eos> What?<eos> Keith Nelson is saying that the whole first weekend never happened, but according to Maya, they babysat you and her while your Mum and Dad had a weekend away.<eos> But Keith Nelson says they were there the whole time.<eos> And without you, we have no independent evidence to support what Maya's saying.<eos> You don't?
I'm not so much interested in what we hide, but why we hide it.<eos> What deep desires are we repressing?<eos> And if we tore down our personas, what sort of beast lies within?<eos> When he coined the terms "anima" and "animus", you don't really think he meant beasts within us, do you, Professor Danvers?<eos> We are animals, all of us.<eos> The only difference between humans and anything else is the persona, the mask behind which we hide all desires, everything that scares us about ourselves.<eos> - So, what's on your mind?<eos> - It happened last night.<eos> - It almost happened in front of Philip.<eos> - But it didn't, right?
You joke, but you're right.<eos> Did we order these?<eos> They're courtesy of the gentlemen at the bar.<eos> He also wanted me to give you this.<eos> Let me handle this.<eos> Uh... go get him, tiger.<eos> - Well, hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - I see you got my message.<eos> - I did.
Yeah, but I'm not quite so angry around you, you know.<eos> I'd like to try things again.<eos> I enjoy your company.<eos> I do.<eos> I didn't mean to be rude.<eos> It's that easy?<eos> I don't know, yeah... what you mean?<eos> I'm sorry, but it isn't easy, no.<eos> So you know you're a son of a bitch. Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
Through the force of his will, thriving when so many of the rest of the world are barely hanging on.<eos> I mean, you're that successful, Washington comes to you.<eos> Jonas, you have to back us.<eos> Roosevelt is choking the whole country.<eos> - He's a socialist.<eos> - He's a Russian Jew.<eos> He's gonna tax us businessmen out of business.<eos> Maybe we ought to be taxed out of business, seeing as how it was our business that got this whole country in a mess in the first place.<eos> Really, Jonas, you act like you don't want to make money.<eos> I don't.
What did Adam Smith say?<eos> "It's not by augmenting the capital of a country," "but by rendering a greater part of that capital" "active and productive than would otherwise be so,"<eos> Why don't you kiss me?<eos> It's been so long since you kissed me.<eos> Did you forget how?<eos> Gosh, no, I didn't forget nothing.<eos> It's just...<eos> Just that I'm not supposed to.<eos> But don't you wanna?<eos> Yeah, I sure do, sis.
I don't notice you piling into JetBlue.<eos> You know, people have this contempt for money because nowadays nobody's allowed to say what everyone knows...<eos> That money is the best way of keeping score.<eos> -Dido, you're full of shit. -I am not full of shit, I am telling you...<eos> -I don't think we've met.<eos> -No, you're right.<eos> Hello. -Welcome.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -How do you know Curtis?<eos> -Um... I don't.
He wasn't threatened by me.<eos> The stronger I was, the more he liked it.<eos> That's rare.<eos> Good for him.<eos> You know him well?<eos> I helped him through some difficult days.<eos> When he was a student, he loved the idea of faith. The life of the Church.<eos> So, someone had to point out that he didn't actually believe.<eos> And that was you?<eos> And he didn't?
In cabinet?<eos> He's refusing on the grounds of national security.<eos> It's not going to wash.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Certain.<eos> I've known from the start.<eos> From the minute I first saw the evidence.<eos> I am going to have to rally round him, publicly.<eos> If you feel it's necessary.<eos> I do.
There's nothing... more tiring than exasperation.<eos> And you... you've exhausted me.<eos> Would you please... please just leave me alone?<eos> Fine.<eos> You!<eos> You better start packing, 'cause I'm selling.<eos> I'm selling!<eos> - Excuse me, Jim. Business.<eos> - Do you have anything for a headache?<eos> I do.
You look in the mirror, and you see an adult.<eos> But you have to look more carefully.<eos> There's a big piece of you that never grew up.<eos> It may have grown tall, but not up.<eos> You spend your life waiting for your parents to come back and make it all right.<eos> But they don't come back.<eos> It's not all right.<eos> You have to somehow move past them.<eos> You have to somehow convince yourself that you don't need those people.<eos> Because you don't.
Actually, I had just hosted a show back there, and Donna performed.<eos> - You didn't catch any?<eos> - No, I couldn't find the room.<eos> That's a bummer.<eos> - 'Cause she was amazing tonight.<eos> - You know what? Thank you.<eos> Like, she's always great, but, like, tonight, I would say, she was, like, particularly on point.<eos> - Interesting.<eos> - Congrats. That's awesome.<eos> You do this a lot?
- You farted in my face.<eos> - I'm... it happened.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I would not hire myself in this.<eos> When do you start again?<eos> I'm on call, which means that I only get to work if the other receptionist gets sick.<eos> - So we're praying for bird flu?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Cool, I have the dumbest mirror face in the world.<eos> Please, everybody does.
We can be a team like no elf and human has ever been before.<eos> Liya, I'm not going to disappoint you.<eos> - Liya! It's time to go.<eos> - We have to go.<eos> The closer we get to the gem, the more I want to change.<eos> I feel a shadow of dread touching my whole being.<eos> We can't reveal our other side.<eos> There would be no going back.<eos> - We have no choice now.<eos> - Of course we do.
Come on.<eos> Sit in your chair. Complete the table.<eos> - We want to help you save Greendale.<eos> I got to go to the bathroom.<eos> Mm, give him space.<eos> Repiloting can be intense.<eos> New people show up. Regulars shift roles or even fall away.<eos> Season nine of Scrubs, Zach Braff was only in the first six episodes.<eos> That son of a bitch.<eos> After everything scrubs did for him?
You left kind of freaked out.<eos> I can't stop thinking this school might be in trouble because of this bridge-collapsing guy.<eos> He's the one making bad bridges.<eos> That's like me blaming owls for how much I suck at analogies.<eos> Sometimes a student will claim, in court, that their school ruined their life, and they'll win.<eos> You want to save Greendale?<eos> - Make it litigation-proof. - How?<eos> Think like the enemy.<eos> How did Greendale damage you, Annie?<eos> It didn't.
I've dropped the amnesia thing, copped to my crimes, and went to jail.<eos> Now I'm on work release. - Working as what?<eos> - Math teacher.<eos> Next, explain the pajamas.<eos> Well, I'm on work release from house arrest, but I don't have a home.<eos> This won't let me travel 100 yards from this, and this only has a 30-yard cord, so I can only travel...<eos> You do the math.<eos> - You said you teach math.<eos> - Exactly. I teach it.<eos> You do it.
Shit!<eos> Come on!<eos> I'll say this, John.<eos> They sure as fuck broke the mold with you.<eos> You always had a certain audacity about you, you know.<eos> Right? Oh, yeah.<eos> I can say you're still very much the John Wick of old.<eos> Am I?<eos> People don't change. You know that.<eos> Times, they do.
So that's your thing?<eos> Well, it sure isn't for the company or the frills.<eos> There ain't no greater exercise in boredom.<eos> But you're right. I... I bought this baby special when I landed my bighorn permit.<eos> Been waiting to fill that last little space on the wall.<eos> - You get a gender exemption?<eos> - Yeah, dulled male only.<eos> You mind if I just double-check that permit?<eos> You know what the odds are for landing a bighorn license?<eos> I sure do.
Stay inside the vehicle, please.<eos> I'm going to jail.<eos> We're not-- we're not-- Nobody's going to jail.<eos> Zo-- Hi, it's Scarlet.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Scarlet, it's Keegan.<eos> Give me a call.<eos> Got a hiccup.<eos> Please tell me Brickman showed up.<eos> - He did.
I didn't ask for a priest.<eos> You have such a long history of violence, Mr. Tate.<eos> First arrested at 14.<eos> After that, numerous arrests for robbery and assault.<eos> And now you're being executed for two counts of felony murder in 30 minutes.<eos> And you have nothing to confess?<eos> I'm innocent.<eos> I was set up.<eos> Nobody seems to believe you, do they?<eos> No one ever did.
As chancellor pro tempore, you can give the order to start reducing the population.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Sir, we're wasting time.<eos> Removing the 100 from the population only buys us another month.<eos> Engineering needs more than that to fix those systems<eos> - if they can fix them at all.<eos> - You have my answer, Commander. Enough.<eos> If we're gonna kill hundreds of innocent people we're gonna do it by the book.<eos> In the meantime I want to know who helped this janitor get on that dropship.<eos> Because he sure as hell didn't do it by himself.
I heard stories about those ships as a child.<eos> Oh, hellish stories.<eos> Know why they're shackled?<eos> To stop 'em jumping overboard.<eos> Yeah, cos... that's better... than watching your friends, your family, your children die of starvation... and sickness... ..and hopelessness.<eos> You'll get your justice, Porthos.<eos> The King will see to that.<eos> So, what's it like... ..buying people?<eos> I suppose you have a shopping list.<eos> Actually, I do.
Yeah. And her friend sitting next to her, her dad runs a big company too.<eos> His mom works for the UN.<eos> His dad's the captain of some aircraft carrier.<eos> Her parents are actual royalty.<eos> Kyle isn't the only one with a powerful parent with a kid worth taking.<eos> And your company, any enemies there that might benefit from this?<eos> We are a multinational I.T. corporation.<eos> We sell to governments, armed forces and businesses here and abroad.<eos> I have 350,000 employees, so to answer your question, yes, I have enemies.<eos> Most everyone else here does too.
So far, I've set up data-links with four of the drones.<eos> Once all ten are listening, we'll transmit the override code.<eos> When will they be ours?<eos> Five minutes.<eos> If there is any kind of redemption for you, Naveed, it begins now.<eos> We're more than halfway through this flightkey data. I still don't see anything suspicious, Chloe. Well, look harder.<eos> Jack's headed back to jail because of you.<eos> Yes, I'm aware of that.<eos> You don't need to keep reminding me.<eos> Yes, I do.
No one was responsible for what happened to your family.<eos> Why would you keep that from me?<eos> I didn't want you to leave.<eos> I was going to tell you eventually, no matter what. The truth is always best.<eos> What truth?<eos> The truth when you decide to tell it?<eos> Look around, Adrian.<eos> All your work has led to this.<eos> Please, don't ask me to regret all I've stood for.<eos> I don't.
Hunter's working the council hard.<eos> I can't afford another embarrassment.<eos> You said it yourself, there's blood in the water.<eos> Yeah, that's right. So be the shark.<eos> Be the fucking shark, Alex.<eos> What are you gonna do, Nola?<eos> I think I was wrong to ask you to stick around.<eos> After everything that's happened, everything you went through, I should have thought about that.<eos> I'm sorry, but you don't belong here anymore.<eos> I never did.
- You get on a train, go to Canada.<eos> Live your life.<eos> 112,000, all in.<eos> - Don't want to count it?<eos> - Just make sure you keep your end.<eos> I will.<eos> My condolences, then.<eos> What for?<eos> You just lost a son.<eos> - Yes, I did.
I guess we're lucky the bald guy and the dyke caught us first.<eos> - You think so?<eos> - Hey, I liked the dyke.<eos> Do you know what I love about this country?<eos> The same laws that protect people from me, protect me from you.<eos> You sound like my father.<eos> I think that was an insult.<eos> You see, my father believed that the law spoke for all men, even a black janitor.<eos> You just have to have faith in the system.<eos> And he did.
You pig.<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Just... just go. Just go.<eos> You won't hear from me again.<eos> Why?<eos> - Jonathan, why?<eos> - You know why.<eos> No...<eos> I don't.
All right?<eos> Just point it.<eos> Whenever you're ready.<eos> There you go.<eos> Ian?<eos> Yeah, buddy.<eos> Why can't I call you dad?<eos> Who, uh, said you couldn't?<eos> Grandpa Dave.<eos> He did?
Andre saw two Henrys at the rail yard that night.<eos> Explain that to me.<eos> Okay, after he saw that the tracks were clear, he climbs up into the cab, he starts driving it.<eos> That's when he sees "Henry"<eos> throw a body in front of the train.<eos> So, h... he can't... he can't stop in time.<eos> He runs over it.<eos> When he comes down to see what had had happened, the body is also Henry.<eos> And why didn't Andre tell us this before?<eos> From his perspective, he did.
And get him out of here, via his desk.<eos> Lord knows what you'll find in there.<eos> I'm sorry. I think you might be overreacting to this.<eos> No, Terrence. What am I gonna do?<eos> Am I gonna hit him? Sir, please, don't take this away from me.<eos> The West Wing is part of my DNA and vice verse.<eos> Okay, this is a teachable moment, and I think...<eos> You're embarrassing yourself.<eos> Sir, I don't have anything else in my life.<eos> - He really doesn't.
Say, Alex..<eos> ..you know, earlier.. You said something. It was a misunderstanding.<eos> You wanna explain that to me?<eos> Uh, it was nothing.<eos> Come on, he's a big boy.<eos> Let him answer.<eos> It's just a funny thing to say.<eos> What'd you mean by it?<eos> I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
Fleur told me what you said at the trial, that she should do the right thing.<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> Have you come here to gloat?<eos> I wouldn't waste my energy.<eos> There is nothing worse than a woman who betrays her own sex.<eos> I can think of a few things.<eos> But let's not argue.<eos> Why do you hate me?<eos> How have I ever hurt you?<eos> You didn't.
We've just been downstairs...<eos> Sorry, um... I've forgotten your name.<eos> Nick Pellegrini.<eos> Did you know it was me that was prosecuting when you spoke to him? No.<eos> So go and tell your self-pitying paedo that if he maintains a not-guilty plea and this goes to trial, I'll kill him, and when I say I'll kill him, I mean I'll kill him.<eos> He will never recover from what I do to him in cross-examination.<eos> Pleading? Yes.<eos> But he wants you to leave out the level-four laptop stuff.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course he does.
Billy isn't himself at the moment.<eos> Now, I know him really well, and he wouldn't do a thing like that, believe me. But he did.<eos> Amy...<eos> What am I supposed to do, Martha?<eos> It's the truth.<eos> I thought I could rely on you.<eos> Oh, er... thank you for yesterday.<eos> I learned a lot.<eos> So.<eos> Did he do it?
Thank you.<eos> Jordan, it's my job.<eos> Now, when you go in the witness box, there is nothing I can do.<eos> So, if you want to thank me, help yourself.<eos> It's hard.<eos> You don't understand football.<eos> I used to go with my dad to Burnden Park, see Bolton... ..and we used to talk about life through talking about football, and then I went to university, moved away, and he got ill...<eos> ..and after going for four seasons every fortnight, we never went again, which meant we never spoke again, really.<eos> See, our common language had gone.<eos> So, no, I don't. I...
He can pass.<eos> He's got good feet.<eos> Trent's the past.<eos> He's all blood and thunder.<eos> He can't play.<eos> Jordan plays like he's Spanish.<eos> Trent plays like an Englishman in the 1950s.<eos> And are you the only one who thinks like this?<eos> Of course not.<eos> They all do.
Oh, yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Top class.<eos> Top bloody class.<eos> So, what now?<eos> You can play again.<eos> If I want to.<eos> Do you?
They said that, if we were serious, we had to prove it.<eos> Rashid and I had to help them get security details for their attack.<eos> But Rashid didn't go through with it, did he?<eos> You went ahead, but Rashid backed out.<eos> No.<eos> It was the other way around.<eos> I backed out.<eos> I told him I didn't want to go through with it, and then I went back into my room.<eos> Then why did you tell this court that Rashid did the research from the same room?<eos> Because he did.
Just another day, please.<eos> I don't know if I can take any more.<eos> Antxon!<eos> Not Antxon again!<eos> Yes, or we'll get in a mess.<eos> Weren't you with my father?<eos> Yes, but...<eos> I think he suspects something.<eos> He says it doesn't seem you've been together three years.<eos> - He did?
Hey, um... can I talk to you for a second?<eos> - Just, like, upstairs? - Yeah, ok, sure.<eos> Actually, could you close the door?<eos> - Are you ok?<eos> You're acting really weird.<eos> - Yeah, no, I'm fine.<eos> I don't know how to say this, really. Um...<eos> Say what?<eos> You know that I care about you a lot, right?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
No, Mel.<eos> No, Mel, why did you do that?<eos> I don't want to go up there. I don't want them to take me.<eos> No.<eos> I'm really tired.<eos> I think I'm gonna close my eyes for a little while.<eos> No.<eos> Please, no! Mel! Wake up!<eos> Mel, wake up!<eos> Don't do this to me!
Avery thinks Sara's still out there somewhere with amnesia or something. One day she'll just show up out of the blue, walk back into our lives, and wonder what all the fuss was about.<eos> Avery couldn't make it today.<eos> She had to do something.<eos> Did the four of you guys ever go to Rosewood?<eos> You've got that funky little movie theater.<eos> We went there a couple of times.<eos> It's like she kept us all on hold when she disappeared.<eos> Left us dangling.<eos> That sounds like she did it on purpose.<eos> She didn't.
All kinds of things happen that we're not expecting.<eos> It's hard to explain.<eos> Try me.<eos> Ravenswood turned into more than I thought it would.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> That's why I'm glad that you're out of there.<eos> Hanna, I might have to go back.<eos> What do you mean, "might"?<eos> I have to go back.<eos> No, you don't.
It's hard to explain.<eos> Try me.<eos> Ravenswood turned into more than I thought it would.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> That's why I'm glad that you're out of there.<eos> Hanna, I might have to go back.<eos> What do you mean, "might"?<eos> I have to go back.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I do.
I'm sorry. I'm terrible.<eos> But that's what I keep thinking.<eos> You're done. You've... you've got your life back.<eos> Not us.<eos> She's gone but she's not gone.<eos> And we can't get away from her.<eos> And I'm so tired of being Sara's friend.<eos> Just... sucks the life out of you.<eos> I understand how you feel.<eos> No, you don't.
She's gone but she's not gone.<eos> And we can't get away from her.<eos> And I'm so tired of being Sara's friend.<eos> Just... sucks the life out of you.<eos> I understand how you feel.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I wished Sara was dead before she disappeared.<eos> I told you I'm a terrible person.<eos> - I have to go.<eos> - No, you don't.
I see.<eos> Self-righteous son of a bitch is flanking me with all his own people.<eos> Says it's for my own good, that I lack experience in an executive capacity.<eos> He told me to take it or leave it.<eos> You're gonna be transferred.<eos> There's nothing I can do about it.<eos> You're still the chief of police.<eos> You've never left me out there, not for one day.<eos> You know you have to do this.<eos> No, I don't.
I'm serious, do not use that toilet.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You wanking?<eos> I t-told you not to mess with these.<eos> Can you... Can you turn on the music?<eos> Please?<eos> Mind if I...<eos> I'm not... interested in men in case that's what Dr. Rose told you.<eos> She didn't.
There were some issues when she was last on the floor, but know this. Not all of them were her fault.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Part of the problem was that we didn't have enough oversight.<eos> Well, I was doing my best-<eos> Which is why I'm assigning Jackie to Dr. Roman.<eos> Wherever she goes, shadow her.<eos> Hey.<eos> I know I shouldn't, but I feel kind of bad for Dr. Roman.<eos> Don't feel bad for her.<eos> But I do.
Can I plug this in your ear?<eos> Why don't you try that girl I saw you with earlier?<eos> She seems to have a fair amount of extra energy.<eos> - Heather.<eos> - Oh, Heather's, what, like, 19?<eos> She's completely age-appropriate.<eos> Why' you jealous?<eos> Fuckin' -A, I'm jealous.<eos> You see that body?<eos> No, of course you did.
We need more doctors like you and nurses like Miss Barkow.<eos> Right, speaking of Miss Barkow... there's a situation I need to tell you, just-<eos> Oh, I'm so relieved.<eos> - Zoey- - 'Cause if you weren't okay with us dating-<eos> You two are dating?<eos> Crap.<eos> I thought you knew.<eos> - She didn't know.<eos> - No, I did not know.<eos> And I still don't.
Kinda relaxed kinda guy. Just relaxed.<eos> You believe he's living it. He's saying the words.<eos> You don't believe he's acting.<eos> I imagine his arms are always at his side.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> He acts as though he knows something nobody else knows, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, yes. You know that? Yeah.<eos> Yeah. That's what I do.<eos> No, sorry. I do the opposite.
His eyes. He wasn't happy.<eos> So how long you gonna be away for?<eos> Eight weeks.<eos> Eight weeks? Gosh.<eos> That's tough.<eos> That's a long time to be away, though, isn't it'?<eos> What am I gonna do otherwise?<eos> I'd just do more panel shows.<eos> Joe's, uh, just finished his GCSEs, doing his A-levels now.<eos> A-levels, gosh. What A-levels you gonna do?
- Whiskey and coke.<eos> - Cool.<eos> I was wondering, could you do me a favor?<eos> Of course.<eos> Do you know where I could buy some stuff?<eos> - What, weed?<eos> - Yeah, but...<eos> But some other stuff too.<eos> Remember what happened last time.<eos> - Thanks, I do.
A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese.<eos> You're a good lad.<eos> Any word of Shae?<eos> I've heard nothing, my lord.<eos> I suppose that's a good thing.<eos> What are they saying about me out there?<eos> You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the King.<eos> - Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?<eos> - No, my lord.<eos> You didn't?
Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe.<eos> I've got something else for you.<eos> I hope I got your measurements right.<eos> I'll find her.<eos> For Lady Catelyn.<eos> And for you.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> I have one more gift.<eos> I don't need a squire.<eos> Of course you do.
Please don't do this.<eos> Look at me. Look at my face.<eos> Did you see him when you hit him?<eos> Did you see him?<eos> Tell me what he looks like. Tell me what he looked like!<eos> - Tell me what he looks like. - I'm so sorry for what I did. Tell me you saw his face!<eos> -Tell me you saw his face!<eos> -I saw him.<eos> You're gonna pay for what you did to me.<eos> -For what you did to my boy. -No, please.
It only tastes a little bit like dog food.<eos> Kathleen.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Come on!<eos> You know what?<eos> Just speed it up.<eos> How come you never hear her get out of bed?<eos> Shut up.<eos> How come you don't deadbolt the door?<eos> I did!
Well, eventually, no one will know what they are.<eos> I'm ever so sorry.<eos> Hello, Brian.<eos> Welcome to this week's episode of The Natural World, where this week we explore the bizarre hibernation patterns of the rare Cambridge physicist seen here in his remarkable plumage.<eos> So how was it?<eos> What did they say? How's your wrist?<eos> I have a disease, Bri.<eos> Is it venereal, Stephen?<eos> I have motor neuron disease.<eos> Sorry, I don't...
I'll be right back.<eos> Nice piece of ass there?<eos> Could you get me a gun?<eos> A gun?<eos> Yeah, I can get you a gun.<eos> What do you need a gun for?<eos> I'm a soldier, man.<eos> I like guns. Yeah. I know a guy.<eos> You got cash?<eos> I do.
Oh, I'll see what I can do.<eos> I can handle them from now on, Marge.<eos> Gentlemen, I've been thinking.<eos> My glorious youth and beauty won't last forever.<eos> Someday, when the leaves have turned and the moon has broken apart into chunks of floating cheese, I will be old.<eos> What's your point, pound cake?<eos> I'm hoping we can find a way to coexist.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He wants to see if ghosts exist.<eos> Ooh, they do.
We took a stand.<eos> We can't turn back now.<eos> I'd rather see the government grind to a halt.<eos> Think of the headline:<eos> "Democratic Leadership Enacts Entitlement Reform, Staves Off Freeze."<eos> We show unity.<eos> We offer progress.<eos> Let's convert some lifelong conservatives.<eos> You have Mendoza's assurance he'll work with us?<eos> - I do.
No one's sending you away, baby.<eos> You're lying, both of you.<eos> Please, honey, just get in the car.<eos> No.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you!<eos> - L-listen, we s... we should go.<eos> - No, Artie.<eos> You... really, you don't know.<eos> I do.
Let me buy us some real breakfast.<eos> I've got to sleep, but thanks.<eos> Well, how about dinner tonight?<eos> You're not mistaking me for a sweet little debutante at the summer fair, are you?<eos> That kind never did take my interest.<eos> Oh, you like things back-alley.<eos> I like things to be what they are.<eos> Then dinner it is. Anywhere but here.<eos> Well, I don't know London much.<eos> I do.
Previously on Penny Dreadful:<eos> Man does not live only in the empirical world.<eos> We must seek the ephemeral.<eos> Dr. Frankenstein, thank you for coming.<eos> Life and death the flicker that separates one from the other.<eos> Everything else is insignificant.<eos> Our young doctor has a secret.<eos> - Dinner tonight? - Anywhere but here.<eos> - Well, I don't know London much.<eos> - I do. Mina?
Well, it's awfully long.<eos> You've read it?<eos> Yes.<eos> There are...<eos> There are lines that speak to me.<eos> "O fleeting joys "Of Paradise, dear "Bought with lasting woes!<eos> "Did I request thee, Maker "Out of my clay "To mould me Man?"<eos> I'm sorry about Simon today.<eos> He's a beast sometimes, but he doesn't really mean it.<eos> Yes, he does.
Where should we go?<eos> - Jay, shift your weight.<eos> - Shut up, old man.<eos> This aint E and E, its R and R for me.<eos> You know...<eos> - I havent thanked you yet. - For what?<eos> Your excellent work in picking a vacation spot.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You know I was born to roll like this.<eos> Yes, I do.
Not me.<eos> You keep that for yourself.<eos> I ain't putting that on.<eos> Whoo.<eos> Whose is this?<eos> It's mine.<eos> Who the hell you think it is?<eos> "Whose is this?"<eos> I would've thought D.M.V. took away your license by now.<eos> They did.
Oh, finally...<eos> I get the pleasure to make your acquaintance, Seńor Vega.<eos> I didn't order the hit.<eos> - Who did?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Back away, Vega.<eos> I'm really sorry to barge in here, Mr. Herrera.<eos> The side door was open.<eos> You done good, Steven.
We need to go home.<eos> - Because you're not listening to me, Jeff.<eos> - You're not trusting me.<eos> You're being selfish.<eos> You're being selfish. We tried.<eos> It's been fun.<eos> We'll come back another time. That's what I'm saying to you.<eos> There's not gonna be another time. - You don't know that.<eos> - This is it! I do know that!<eos> They do this all the time?
-Nothing, thank you. -Thank you, sir.<eos> -On duty, is it?<eos> Well, I'm sure that's to be admired.<eos> Let me ask you something. What do you think to motorway service stations?<eos> That phone's going to ring in a minute and I've got to decide whether to put in for one on the M4 above Port Talbot.<eos> I couldn't really claim to be an expert -<eos> The smart young men I pay to know such things tell me it's the future, but I'm not so sure.<eos> Do you use them?<eos> I don't have a car.<eos> But if you did?
I'd see you were looked to.<eos> Find someone to take you on, rattle you through your Sergeant's.<eos> McNutt maybe?<eos> McNutt's good.<eos> One for the road?<eos> I didn't stay in Oxford to work under McNutt.<eos> "They were together in the armchair by this time<eos> "and Wendy plied him with more questions.<eos> "If you don't live in Kensington Gardens now...<eos> "Sometimes I do still.
-He's been killed.<eos> He what?<eos> No, don't touch me! Don't touch me!<eos> Leave me!<eos> Do you have any idea why somebody would want to attack John?<eos> No.<eos> What was bothering him at the wedding?<eos> We have some savings that we can't agree how to spend. That's all.<eos> Have you any idea why John would lie about Jerry Markham being in contact with him?<eos> He didn't.
Yes, the name is Peter Latimer.<eos> Yes, £10,000 in cash.<eos> Can you give that dog something to eat?<eos> I can't take the big doe eyes any more.<eos> -It's for his own good.<eos> -Then take him for a walk, or something.<eos> Honestly, I can't bear it!<eos> OK, could you try... ..Dr. Peter Latimer?<eos> So, did Donnie and Isobel see you as being... a bad influence on Angus?<eos> Donnie did.
Sorry, with which hand?<eos> My left. Anna tried to push me out of the laboratory.<eos> I'm ashamed to say that I knocked her to the floor.<eos> And left her to die of her injuries.<eos> It was a moment of madness.<eos> It's something that I will have to live with for the rest of my life.<eos> Let me see your left hand.<eos> Within the bruise... ..there's a mark that was left by a hand with a ring on it.<eos> You don't wear a ring.<eos> But your wife Tessa does.
But as long as the flash memory on the card is intact and the internal circuit board isn't cracked, it should be possible to retrieve the files.<eos> Come on, Angus, how long is this going to take?<eos> You're back on Fair Isle now, Uncle Jimmy.<eos> The land where time doesn't just stand still, it frequently loses its internet connection.<eos> Ah, here we go.<eos> Uncle Jimmy? What?<eos> You haven't told me about problem number two!<eos> Aye, I'll speak to you later!<eos> He retrieved the data?<eos> He did indeed.
Where would I go?<eos> It's not my day for Lerwick.<eos> He knew her.<eos> She visited him yesterday.<eos> And he saw the body this morning.<eos> He said that?<eos> He wasn't trying to hide it.<eos> He said he saw her at 5am.<eos> He doesn't sleep so well this time of year.<eos> Who does?
I know you didn't kill Catriona.<eos> I don't think you killed Catherine either. But until I can find out who did, I'd like it if you stayed here.<eos> It would be protective custody. So you wouldn't have to be locked in.<eos> -See?<eos> -See, Magnus.<eos> I've to feed the bird.<eos> The bird's dead.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> People do stupid things when they get fired up.<eos> -The bird didn't do any harm.
Is Sally home?<eos> -Sally's at school.<eos> -No.<eos> No.<eos> School just said she phoned in sick today.<eos> What is it?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Sally didn't turn up at school.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Of course she did.
I know you're sleeping with Emma.<eos> I will not stand by and watch you destroy Pamela like J.R. destroyed me.<eos> Is that alcohol I smell on your breath?<eos> You promised me you would be here.<eos> We are meant for each other.<eos> I just need you to give me the chance.<eos> John Ross and Pamela are now husband and wife.<eos> [Cheers and applause] Bobby: I can't imagine how low your son had to stoop.<eos> Now I don't have a move left to stop him from drilling this ranch.<eos> But I do.
- Or people are gonna start dying.<eos> You make me sick.<eos> Just when I think you couldn't sink any lower, Ryland, you reach a whole new depth.<eos> Taking orders from a drug lo he's not working for a drug lord.<eos> He's working for us.<eos> You're telling me he's working for the CIA?<eos> Four years ago, the Mendez-Ochoa cartel came to me to run drugs.<eos> I came to him.<eos> Since when does the CIA go after drug dealers?<eos> We don't.
You are more and more like your daddy every day.<eos> But he never drilled this ranch.<eos> And mark my words... neither will you.<eos> What do you mean the decision has already been made? When?<eos> !<eos> Well, why wasn't I told about it?<eos> Stanley, this is not right, and you damn well know it.<eos> I can't imagine how low your son had to stoop this time, but he managed to get to the railroad commissioner.<eos> Now I don't have a move left to stop him from drilling this ranch.<eos> But I do.
It's different.<eos> She was sweet and respectful and friendly and liked you.<eos> And anyway, that girl -<eos> I mean what more could you want from your first girlfriend experience?<eos> She's not a lesbian.<eos> How do you know?<eos> And even if she were, she would not go for a girl like me.<eos> Why not?<eos> You know.<eos> No, I really don't, why?
Oh, whatever they do.<eos> Y-you know, kiss, scissorin'.<eos> - Ooh, look at you!<eos> - Hey!<eos> I am knowledgeable in the arts of various sexual arenas.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> You thank God for "Glee" every day, or you'd still think scissoring was a mixed martial arts tap-out hold.<eos> I'm a - I'm a - I'm a Gleek and I'm proud of it.<eos> Why does it even matter what you label as your sexuality?<eos> It doesn't.
Your secret's safe with me.<eos> I'm great with secrets.<eos> Look, you took my virginity, and to this day, are the only man I have ever slept with.<eos> So no matter how much of an asshole you can be, you'll always be special to me.<eos> David!<eos> David!<eos> Wha -<eos> Did he hurt you?<eos> No!<eos> No, he didn't. No.
I heard a loud thud... And I got scared because I thought I´d dented the car.<eos> I wanted to return and try to fix it before Mr. Mauricio woke up.<eos> May I?<eos> José, can you please sit in the driver´s seat?<eos> - Should I touch it?<eos> - Yes, grab the wheel.<eos> Sit back.<eos> Could you shut the door?<eos> Do you use the rear view mirrors when you drive?<eos> The mirrors? Yes, of course I do.
You guys ready?<eos> Ew, he wears cologne.<eos> It's gross.<eos> If my dad finds out, I'm totally getting grounded.<eos> And if your dad doesn't find out, maybe we'll be invited to Ryan's New Year's Eve party.<eos> Maybe we won't go into next semester being the same lame losers we are now.<eos> I don't have to jump off a bus to prove I'm fun.<eos> I'm fun.<eos> I know that.<eos> Just... no one else really does.
Not really, no.<eos> Well, that sounds like a pretty good definition of prayer to me.<eos> I don't think the man upstairs would be interested in hearing from me.<eos> I've been a particularly wayward son.<eos> E*veryone says that.<eos> No, no, no. I'm a blasphemous mess.<eos> If there's a top ten most-unwanted list up there I could very well be on it.<eos> Maybe so.<eos> But right now you just seem like a man who loves his wife.<eos> I do. I really do.
- How much for this model?<eos> They're not cheap.<eos> - lt's a good investment.<eos> - For who?<eos> Well? - lt's ridiculous.<eos> I've been asked to give out awards to the best Vita reps.<eos> Honestly, it's an honour for me to be here and meet you.<eos> - l'm starving. - l have toothpaste.<eos> - Doesn't work.<eos> - lt does too.
Ah, Emily, I gotta get you out of there.<eos> Just wait outside for me, put on a coat or something.<eos> I'm leaving right now.<eos> Find me, Emily.<eos> I don't know where I am.<eos> Come play with me.<eos> You did this to me, Emmy.<eos> I want to play.<eos> You did this.<eos> You did this to me, Emmy.
- Hallelujah.<eos> - But we don't have approved copy.<eos> We don't even have a name for it.<eos> Dang it.<eos> Chevy graphics people keep telling me there's a "Chevy way" of doing things.<eos> - And money is no object.<eos> - Get it in writing.<eos> You didn't pick an angle for Accutron.<eos> Wow, is that today?<eos> Sure, I did.
What exactly is the company, by the way?<eos> The client is in footwear.<eos> Shoes, women's.<eos> The new head of marketing wants to cut costs.<eos> I get it.<eos> It's 20 degrees out there and the kids are in sandals.<eos> Lowering overhead is not a bad idea.<eos> Is that where you'd start, keeping in mind "the four Ps"?<eos> Do you have an MBA?<eos> No, but their head of marketing does.
Here. This is yours.<eos> It's a gift.<eos> Good night.<eos> What is this?<eos> Let's go to bed.<eos> Hey.<eos> Yes?<eos> We haven't celebrated.<eos> Oh, I didn't know if you wanted to.<eos> I do.
Talk about his hair or the way he smelled or something.<eos> Priscilla! Jackson Hale's silver locks really revved your engine, didn't they?<eos> And you... wanted to be the lone lady of his desires.<eos> But he acted like you weren't a human person with feelings and emotions and passions and dreams and lots of love in your heart.<eos> You have so much to give, and Jackson Hale was just too foolish to see how amazing you are and what life could've been like if he had taken a chance on you instead of all those other ladies with flaming eagles tattooed just above their seat cushion!<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes! Yes! I was his dream girl.<eos> I was! What else did I have to do to show him I was the one? The one!<eos> Prosecution requests a recess, frankly, to regroup.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Sometimes things are a lot more one-sided than we would like them to be, aren't they, Mr. Camp?<eos> For example, I can relate because I'm a psychic.<eos> Which means love is even more difficult for me than it is for you.<eos> But there is a woman in this courtroom right now, a little slice of blonde perfection, a perfectly formed beignet lightly dusted with powdered sugar and a badge.<eos> The first time that I saw her, I had a vision that we would be married, and we would have so many kids that most of them would have to be put up for adoption.<eos> Where are you going with this, Mr. Spencer?<eos> Judge, I can't answer that question for you. I mean, we work together.<eos> It'd be like the two of you having a connection and wondering if it's real or...<eos> Is it real, how do you know?<eos> You don't.
- Okay, great.<eos> I'm really not as fragile as he thinks I am.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> - I'm really a good old girl.<eos> - Good.<eos> - But if you did have some arnica for these bruises on my thigh, that would be so helpful.<eos> Did you run into something, or is that more of, like, an abuse scenario?<eos> 'Cause those are really...<eos> You know, I don't know what to call a provoked physical attack by someone you love.<eos> - I really don't.
Whoops, they're back.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Do you guys want me to give a different read?<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You got it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh...<eos> Does he know?<eos> - He does.
- No, I don't do cocaine.<eos> But you're clearly on cocaine.<eos> Oh, no, everybody thinks that, but I just have really chronic congestion and, like, a terribly fast mouth.<eos> Is this living or is this living, my flower?<eos> - This is living.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Uh, have you got more coke?<eos> Have you got more money?<eos> No, but I know where to get some.<eos> - You do?

You're talking like it's the end of the world.<eos> Fucking doomsday preppers or something.<eos> Planes crash, people survive.<eos> They get rescued... all right?<eos> Our job is to stay positive.<eos> Exactly, and there are people that are injured that need our help surviving... until help comes, all right?<eos> They need us to be optimistic.<eos> That's the other thing I wanted to talk about.<eos> Why do I feel like I don't want to talk about this and I don't want to hear it.<eos> Because you don't.
You shouldn't be hearing any of this.<eos> I hear many things, Miss Stein, but I never, never speak of them.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I need a place where I can talk.<eos> Where are you?<eos> In Ramallah.<eos> You...you should come out of there, Nessa. You should go home to Jerusalem.<eos> Ephra, I'm looking at the figures. A transfer was made. But according to the minister, the money went into Gaza.<eos> Well, when did we start funding projects in Gaza?<eos> - We didn't.
Give your present job to a night watchman, then call me over to walk in your wake, as it were.<eos> I'll have to burn Harold Parr.<eos> - To the Israelis?<eos> - Mm. That's fine.<eos> They'll bury it. They won't let this go public.<eos> But I... I have one other stipulation.<eos> The Stein Foundation has to stay intact. It cannot be compromised.<eos> It already is.<eos> The Israelis will know. Hamas probably already does.<eos> But the world doesn't.
- That's my decision.<eos> She's my wife. My wife.<eos> - It wasn't yours to make. - And when did it become yours?<eos> I didn't have a choice, Ephra.<eos> You didn't give me one.<eos> So, what, now you're trying to ruin my marriage?<eos> Is that what you're trying to do?<eos> Do you really want to keep it?<eos> What?<eos> Do you?
So was the man your security officer killed.<eos> You're suggesting - this was a military operation.<eos> - No, no, no. They left four years ago and functionally disappeared. Until now.<eos> Too late.<eos> Clearly, they're a team that leaves no trace...at all.<eos> So, where next?<eos> Given what's happened, I have to suggest the possibility that our most likely point of first contact will be when Kasim's kidnappers choose to make it with us.<eos> So the long arm of the law has just come up short. Is that what you're telling us?<eos> And how do you expect us to react to that?<eos> He doesn't.
But I wouldn't pretend it doesn't exist.<eos> Not any more.<eos> Tell me about him.<eos> Who?<eos> Kasim's father.<eos> I really did not know him.<eos> Sometimes... in situations like that things happen much faster than they should.<eos> He was hopeful.<eos> And if he hadn't died?<eos> But he did.
#Absolutely.<eos> Your mother is not depressed.<eos> #Yes, I am.<eos> Happy to have it.<eos> Goes with being smart.<eos> All right, Olive.<eos> -We might as well discuss it, Henry.<eos> #He might have it too.<eos> But you don't think I'm smart.<eos> #Of course I do.
♪ Is the sky? ♪<eos> - That was great.<eos> - It sure was.<eos> Boy, that's just awful.<eos> The rotten grandchildren talk to Bonnie like that.<eos> It's just...<eos> They sound like real hellions... That Julie's not much.<eos> Bonnie always talked about her like she was God's gift.<eos> - You never really know what goes on.<eos> - No, you do not.
God, Vicki, we've been through all this.<eos> She's in her bedroom reading.<eos> No, I will not.<eos> She doesn't wanna talk to you. She told me that explicitly.<eos> Yeah, well, you go right ahead.<eos> You do that. She probably won't be here when you get here, though.<eos> I'm gonna put her on a plane myself.<eos> I am, too.<eos> Yes, I do have the money for that.<eos> I do.
The fact he couldn't control his Change, that's not your fault.<eos> - He was a ticking time bomb...<eos> - You're not listening to me!<eos> I'm the ticking time bomb!<eos> We both are.<eos> Look, we don't think clearly when we're around one another.<eos> People are dead.<eos> Elena, we stopped him from killing anyone else.<eos> He didn't kill the guy in the office, Clay.<eos> Yes, he did.
I have a life in Toronto.<eos> - A good life. It's my life.<eos> - Keep telling yourself that.<eos> You'll find whoever made the Mutt.<eos> Okay?<eos> You'll punish him.<eos> But you don't need me!<eos> Keep telling yourself that, too.<eos> He's not the only one that needs you.<eos> We all do, Elena.
- I got blindsided too.<eos> Okay...<eos> Cousin.<eos> Car accident.<eos> Coma.<eos> Kids.<eos> - She's out of the woods.<eos> - Okay.<eos> What name did you give her?<eos> I didn't.
She's here with me now.<eos> We're on our way.<eos> - Logan.<eos> - It's not good.<eos> We have to go back.<eos> We have to go back right away.<eos> He's not wearing his jacket.<eos> He always took it off before a fight.<eos> He didn't go down without hurting someone.<eos> Who did this?
He's using a very liberal definition of the word friend.<eos> Think he'd remember me? The question is, do you want him to?<eos> Your men?<eos> They are dead.<eos> Then they have come.<eos> Yes.<eos> I spent 15 years searching for my daughter.<eos> And now she hunts me.<eos> Tell me, Yulish. Do you really believe in God?<eos> I do, yes.
And now she hunts me.<eos> Tell me, Yulish. Do you really believe in God?<eos> I do, yes.<eos> To me... God always felt like something men made up to feel less alone.<eos> I am more alone than I have ever been.<eos> I don't trust you.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> And instead of wishing for God... I am praying...<eos> That He does not exist.<eos> Because if He does... Dead or alive...
Whole place smells like lip gloss and bras posters .<eos> Dad says women are like men who've been hit in the head.<eos> Look at them all, talking about periods, and scrunchies, and Patrick Swayze.<eos> That's not all they talk about, Martin.<eos> I was watching Patrick Swayze last night in "Dirty Dancing", and I got my period, and it hurt like an overtightened scrunchie.<eos> Hi, Niamh.<eos> Hi, Alison.<eos> Hi, Claire. Hi, other Claire.<eos> -How do you know their names?<eos> -I don't.
[shudders]<eos> Okay, okay, um, do you have any pictures of your son?<eos> They're ... they're ...<eos> they're in my house.<eos> Okay.<eos> W-why don't we go to your house and get them, okay?<eos> [breathing shakily] Okay.<eos> Okay. I just ... I-I have to call my husband first.<eos> [police radio chatter] We failed that kid.<eos> - No, we didn't.
Figure it out, Heather.<eos> That was the best part about going public.<eos> I was able to buy up controlling interest in the company.<eos> What part of that outfit is business casual?<eos> You don't really think John Ross would cheat on you with her, do you?<eos> I like to know that I'm the only other... other woman.<eos> Cheating husband... my favorite kind of case.<eos> Once Pamela realizes the full extent of the Ewings' betrayal, she'll want revenge as much as I do.<eos> - When does the CIA go after drug dealers?<eos> - We don't.
We just needed to show you who you were dealing with.<eos> The only thing you succeeded in proving was that he's a better man than you thought.<eos> John Ross turned Candace down.<eos> Yeah, well, John Ross may not have slept with Candace, but that doesn't change the fact that he's a married man.<eos> Are you deluded enough into thinking that he's gonna leave his wife for you or are you just content in being his little piece on the side?<eos> I thought I raised you to think more of yourself than that.<eos> You don't know a damn thing about John Ross and me.<eos> We understand each other.<eos> Oh, so you think you know the real John Ross?<eos> I do.
I will not stand by and watch you destroy Pamela like J.R. destroyed me.<eos> Perhaps your drinking is making you forget your loyalties, mama.<eos> Cliff: Pamela's the key.<eos> Turn her against John Ross.<eos> And she will help you get your justice and mine.<eos> You'll abuse the land.<eos> You'll disrupt the lives of the people who work on it just to get what you want. John Ross:<eos> If I have to frack Southfork to get those arctic leases, I will frack it dry!<eos> I don't have a move left - to stop him from drilling this ranch.<eos> - But I do.
Mr. McKay, I have one more question. Mr. McKay!<eos> Nicolas: Congratulations.<eos> I couldn't have pulled this off without you.<eos> I guess I saved your ass with the cartel, huh?<eos> Hopefully, we both got what we wanted.<eos> So, I get to run the company as long as I allow you to launder money through its various assets, right?<eos> That's correct.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> ! I thought you knew someone on the inside?<eos> - I did.
Do you think he bought that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This guy didn't get where he is by trusting anybody.<eos> Can I use the bathroom?<eos> I know you took my pencil, but I say nothing.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> Why?<eos> Because... I like you.<eos> And, uh, I think that maybe you like me, too.<eos> I do.
You'd made it clear you wanted out after the Ewing Global takeover.<eos> As you said, I've become a man, a man who understands the value of real power, the power you'll wield when you own the new president of Mexico.<eos> I'm so very glad to hear that.<eos> I don't need any help.<eos> I know my way in.<eos> Emma. Oh!<eos> Oh, are you all right?<eos> It's okay. - I'm okay.<eos> - How'd you escape?<eos> I didn't.
I'm on my way to you right now.<eos> Elena? Are you still there?<eos> Elena, what's wrong?<eos> It's Nicolas.<eos> He's here.<eos> You came.<eos> I guess we can thank St. Christopher for protecting you through all of this.<eos> I told you... I never take it off.<eos> [Jingling]<eos> And neither did Drew.
- Who's the letter to?<eos> - What letter?<eos> The girl you've been writing a letter to.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> - But I wanna know.<eos> - That doesn't matter.<eos> You know you're not allowed to smoke indoors?<eos> Yes.<eos> You know smoking is one of the leading causes of lung cancer?<eos> - Yes, I do.
You forgot to tell her you love her.<eos> That's why it doesn't work.<eos> Why you keep rewriting it.<eos> That's the word that's missing.<eos> We're gonna need you to come with us, sir.<eos> You wanna explain this to us before we call the police?<eos> - I'd love to hear this one.<eos> - I don't remember this at all.<eos> You don't remember this happening a few hours ago? No, I do not.<eos> No, I do not, sir.
I didn't say it was all right. I'm saying they shouldn't have been there.<eos> We're pledged to guard the realms of men.<eos> She's dead because of me. We can't even guard Mole's Town.<eos> We can't go after them.<eos> You know that. It's what they want.<eos> And little Sam.<eos> As if I cut their throats myself.<eos> Maybe she managed to hide herself.<eos> I thought all of you was dead. You went north with Mormont and no one came back.<eos> Not for ages. But then you did.
But what he says about what they do, it's all true.<eos> It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.<eos> Yes, imagine the stories wildlings tell about us.<eos> Love is the death of duty.<eos> I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you.<eos> Which is why you've abandoned your watch atop the Wall to come here and read about the terrible things that may have happened to the girl you love.<eos> I don't love her.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No.<eos> Yes, you do.
How is that possible?<eos> What am I saying? Of course it's possible.<eos> How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing?<eos> We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us.<eos> One look in the past 20 years, one real look at your own children and you would have known.<eos> Known what?<eos> Everything they say is true. - About Jaime and me. - No.<eos> - Your legacy is a lie. - No, no, no, no.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Yes, you do.
You're no son of mine.<eos> I am your son.<eos> I have always been your son.<eos> What have you done?<eos> Quickly.<eos> Trust me, my friend. I brought you this far.<eos> I want to see the captain.<eos> You're seeing him.<eos> I want to go north to the Wall.<eos> No, you don't.
No!<eos> Look who's awake.<eos> You want to finish her off yourself?<eos> Is that it?<eos> Go on.<eos> It's either her, or you.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Go on.<eos> It's either her, or you.<eos> Do it.
Look who's awake.<eos> You want to finish her off yourself?<eos> Is that it?<eos> Go on.<eos> It's either her, or you.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Go on.<eos> It's either her, or you.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it!
You've got a loyal fellow there, Mr. Lowe.<eos> Treat him well.<eos> I must express my gratitude for your intervention.<eos> They do say the true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him no good.<eos> They do.<eos> However, in this case, the observation wants for accuracy, since apparently I'm in a position to do you a great deal of good.<eos> Indeed, but not for long.<eos> My lady Selima believes it would be quicker to torture from you what we need.<eos> So I understand.<eos> I, myself, do not.
- Jesus.<eos> - Well, he was, actually, Marcy.<eos> Uh, Charlie, I need to speak with you for a moment.<eos> Won't you please excuse us?<eos> Be right back, Krull. Just a second.<eos> We're having a business meeting in there.<eos> I know. - Wasn't a social hour.<eos> - Listen, listen, listen.<eos> What if I told you I know how we can get out from under our current financial crisis?<eos> I do too!
I thought you had that situation under control.<eos> I was mistaken.<eos> And I thought we had the full picture, not to mention complete access.<eos> Maybe you can tell me how it is that patients here just go missing, or how a member of my team is attacked by an infected monkey she was told didn't exist in the first place.<eos> Or maybe you'd like to tell me why my brother was tinkering with maybe the worst contagion this world has seen in his own damn lab?<eos> You should ask your brother.<eos> I would never encourage something so reckless.<eos> First things first:<eos> how do we contain the infected patients?<eos> We don't, not without complete transparency.
You think "A" orchestrated that all just to scare us?<eos> Where are you?<eos> I can barely hear you.<eos> The church.<eos> My mom wanted me to drop off a pie for the bake sale.<eos> Just call me later, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Dad.<eos> How did you know I'd be here?<eos> I didn't.
This is my fault.<eos> I drove him into her arms.<eos> Constance.<eos> Why don't you go home?<eos> If we hear anything, we'll let you know. I promise.<eos> She's upset.<eos> She loves him.<eos> Well, she said she didn't.<eos> And you believe that?<eos> He did.
- Go ahead.<eos> It's not a rape.<eos> Nada want.<eos> It has plenty of room.<eos> Less than mine, but...<eos> Wow, what a bathroom!<eos> That bizarre, two vases!<eos> This room there is mine!<eos> Hello.<eos> How you doing, man?
These Mutts need to be put down for good.<eos> I agree.<eos> No middle ground, no mercy.<eos> - Elena...<eos> - They killed Pete, they killed Antonio.<eos> What more is it going to take until we fight back?<eos> This is more than just killing a few Mutts.<eos> Nick, we can talk about this later.<eos> No, I have the rest of my life to grieve.<eos> We all do.
Your work is waiting.<eos> Hi, Dr. Black.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Great... my old self again.<eos> I check out today.<eos> I... can't believe I did that.<eos> It's almost as if I was somebody else.<eos> This whole experience has been pretty major.<eos> I don't... want to be a physicist anymore.<eos> You don't?
Somewhere to hide.<eos> But you can't hide forever.<eos> I'm not hiding. Matthew.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> And I'm counting on you staying right here.<eos> You?<eos> Keep it down, Garza.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Remember when you were in the rebellion and you convinced your commander to run a flanking move and everybody was captured except you?<eos> Do you?
Shotgun.<eos> Unlucky.<eos> Top-bunk wankers.<eos> Oh, fuck off, Neil.<eos> I want some hottie above me, not your rotting arsehole.<eos> I just wanna be near you.<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> Do we really need to go to Splash Planet?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
Look, I just wanted to check in, tell you I've met some great new people...<eos> Oh, is... is Grandma staying over?<eos> No.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> You've got two bowls and two mugs out for breakfast.<eos> Oh, yes, so I have.<eos> So who's staying over?<eos> Your grandma.<eos> You just said she wasn't.<eos> Did I?
- I'm gonna swim with one, though.<eos> And I'm gonna give it the time of its life.<eos> Is it just me or did it sound like he's gonna wank off a dolphin?<eos> That is what it sounded like.<eos> We split up and I went to find Katie.<eos> Last night she said I was sexy.<eos> So, today, I just had to seal the deal, by laughing at anything she said or did.<eos> Got ya.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you did.
Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Aa-aargh!<eos> Aaagh!<eos> Whoaagh!<eos> Waagh!<eos> A-wob a-bob bob?<eos> - What?<eos> - I said, what time is it now?<eos> No, you fucking didn't.
They scream, "I've got a trust fund."<eos> So get a normal haircut, you unbearable prick.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> I may have won the battle, but I'd lost the war.<eos> By now, my real friends were hundreds of miles away, but my fake friends were a little too close to home.<eos> - I don't lose.<eos> - Oh, Ben.<eos> I don't lose.<eos> I don't lose.<eos> - I... don't...
Did you...<eos> [Exhales] Jeez.<eos> Did you really kill him? Sam?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Is Sam dead?<eos> How do you feel about that?<eos> Well, I mean... of course, it's, you know, a tragedy.<eos> Well, why'd you kill him then? Now hold on a second!<eos> I never...<eos> Well, actually, you did.
She has attacks.<eos> Attacks?<eos> Dizzy spells.<eos> It's gornisht - nothing.<eos> It's not nothing!<eos> What if you have a dizzy spell when you're out and about?<eos> You may fall and hurt yourself.<eos> I don't go outside, so that will not happen.<eos> You don't go outside?<eos> Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
All right, I love you so much.<eos> I need you to focus on our future.<eos> Think about us in our new house.<eos> - You go to hell!<eos> Okeydoke.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> Who did you sell the house to?<eos> - Shawn, this really isn't the time.<eos> - Did you or did you not sell my room to lassie?<eos> - Yes, yes, yes, yes, I did.
Or, at least some of it.<eos> In return for my continued patronage.<eos> If you understand me?<eos> I can assure you I've quoted you my very best price.<eos> Are you an honest man, Mr Pratt?<eos> Of course, M'Lord!<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's all I need to know.<eos> You don't HAVE to go.<eos> Yes, I do.
I've had enough independence for one lifetime.<eos> Anyway, I'm not 20 anymore.<eos> You're as good as.<eos> Oh, you're sweet, Jim, but I have to be realistic.<eos> Now Mr Selfridge is quite a catch.<eos> He's the kind of man, the less you ask for, the more he gives.<eos> He's married to your chum.<eos> He makes her unhappy.<eos> She doesn't understand him.<eos> And you do?
For God's sake, Henri.<eos> Call me by my name.<eos> It's good to see you, Agnes.<eos> Look at you.<eos> They will not even let me change my shirt.<eos> I look terrible.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What is it that they think you've done?<eos> They believe I have a link to Germany.<eos> And do you?
Mr. Selfridge isn't here so it's become my responsibility.<eos> You should hear Mr. Edwards talk.<eos> The tales he tells me.<eos> Really, Miss Hawkins?<eos> Oh, yes! Spies in our midst.<eos> Secret agents everywhere.<eos> Even Buckingham Palace has got...<eos> Oh, don't stop on my account.<eos> Miss Towler, I'm sure Miss Hawkins meant no harm.<eos> Of course she did.
- Tell me to leave.<eos> Tell me you don't wanna see me.<eos> Or that you don't want me to see you.<eos> All you have to do is tell me "no".<eos> Nick, what are you doing?<eos> I'm here to wake you up.<eos> And to tell you that you look...<eos> - Amazing.<eos> - I look the same, Nick.<eos> Same as I did a year ago, pretty much the same as I did five years ago.
Evidence of theft?<eos> Not at first glance, no.<eos> Marshall, get this area secure.<eos> And get these people out of here so we can conduct a proper investigation.<eos> You said she received a note before she left?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do we have that note?<eos> Do you have the note?<eos> Why would I... no.<eos> Bridget, do you?
The cosmos, as revealed by science, is stranger than we ever could have imagined.<eos> Light and time and space and gravity conspire to create realities which lie beyond human experience.<eos> That's where we're headed.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Back in 1802, on a night like this, the astronomer William Herschel strolled the beach on the English coast, with his son John.<eos> Herschel was the first person ever to see into the deeper waters of the cosmic ocean.<eos> There he glimpsed the magic trick that light does with time.<eos> Father... do you believe in ghosts?<eos> Why, yes, my son!<eos> You, you do?
Poor man died when you were a babe,<eos> God rest his soul.<eos> He held that some stars are invisible.<eos> They really exist, but we shall never see them.<eos> "Dark stars," Michell called them.<eos> With all due respect, Father, surely your friend was mistaken.<eos> If no one can see them, then how can we possibly know they exist?<eos> Did you see the man who left those footprints, John?<eos> Why, no, Father.<eos> I did not.
- Ma, we gotta go.<eos> Um, you know, you should just...<eos> Ah!<eos> That's nice!<eos> I've been trying to get her to wear her hair back.<eos> - You should try it.<eos> - Would you get...<eos> What do you call a nightmare that happens to you when you're awake?<eos> That couldn't happen.<eos> - Just did.
- Sorry.<eos> - N-no, just give me a minute.<eos> Wait here.<eos> - Where's Jane?<eos> - Interrogation room with a pedophile who lives near the park.<eos> Okay, uh, can you tell her to come down to autopsy<eos> - when she's done?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - We need to talk about our kiss.<eos> - Yes, we do.
- Because I don't want to help the FBI with some half-assed espionage scheme.<eos> You'd like nothing better than to be an international spy.<eos> You're just mad because they won't tell you what's so important about the pen.<eos> It might have a poison tip, you know?<eos> Or... or... or microfiche hidden inside.<eos> I think there could be something else going on entirely.<eos> Really?<eos> What?<eos> Did Miranda see this agent Drexler?<eos> - Did anyone?
Did you see anyone fiddling around with the cobblestones o-on the ground over there?<eos> I know y-you can't talk.<eos> But this is a police matter.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Vous comprenez ce que je dis?<eos> C'est important.<eos> Dites-moi ce que vous avez vu!<eos> Dr. Pierce, who are you talking to?<eos> - We should go back to the embassy.<eos> - No, don't.
What about the blood we found at their house?<eos> It doesn't look like they have any fresh wounds, but I'll type the kids just in case.<eos> Time of death?<eos> I'd say yesterday morning, 6:00 to 10:00 A.M.<eos> The decomp was...<eos> Just say 6:00 to 10:00 and maybe a prayer that you catch the monster who did this.<eos> Two dead kids stuffed into suitcases.<eos> Sound bad enough to justify some overtime?<eos> And... and how do you intend for us to break this news to the mother?<eos> I don't.

Part-time.<eos> How's it going, man?<eos> -How you doing?
Means they've absorbed the shock.<eos> But still no official reaction from Vienna? -Nothing.<eos> -So what do you think is happening?<eos> Well, I imagine that the Austrian and Serb governments have opened a private channel of communication and are sorting the problem out between themselves.<eos> But?<eos> But?<eos> I'm expecting you to say what you always say at this moment.<eos> What do I always say?<eos> You wear what you imagine is your guileless face and you tell me that where central Europe is concerned, it is better to listen to what Berlin is saying than Vienna.<eos> -I do that?
I wonder who that might be.<eos> You've sacked the butler, have you, dear?<eos> Foreign Office? Crowe's cabal in the Foreign Office?<eos> -Just you and Crowe? -Please, Margot.<eos> -One sugar or two.<eos> -Two.<eos> Diplomacy, all those silken phrases.<eos> Why don't you just come out and say what you mean for once?<eos> Why don't you say what you mean when you see a friend wearing a dress you don't like?<eos> She does.
Do you know Eyre Crowe here? Yes, of course you do.<eos> So you know he's an exceptionally knowledgeable fellow, and he tells me that in the entire history of mankind, there is not a single instance where financiers have not panicked at the prospect of a war.<eos> The Peloponnesian War...<eos> Yes, apart from the Peloponnesian War.<eos> So, you see, Sir Walter, I have this odd situation.<eos> Up in Trafalgar Square right now, I'm being told by Keir Hardie and the Socialists that a European war would mark the end of civilisation.<eos> And here... I have a great banker of Threadneedle Street<eos> -telling me the same thing.<eos> -I didn't mention civilisation.<eos> True enough, you didn't.
- Yeah.<eos> - Jane, I just want...<eos> - Do you have any idea what you did to us, what you did to Ma?<eos> I... look, it's hard for me to open up.<eos> Well, try.<eos> You put your family through hell, and I for one would like to know why.<eos> You were a good Dad.<eos> We were a-a good family.<eos> We had good times, right?<eos> Yes, we did.
- Stiletto shoes?<eos> - Yes, and stiletto blades.<eos> - Maura, you were supposed to narrow it down and not tell me we're still looking for a sharp pointy thing.<eos> What's with the black stuff on the swab?<eos> Oh, I found it when I swabbed the posterior entry wound.<eos> I was just about to give it to the crime lab.<eos> - You didn't sleep, did you?<eos> - No, not much.<eos> - Cavanaugh knows.<eos> - Well, of course he does.
Oh, by yourself?<eos> No, not alone.<eos> Emily said she'd come.<eos> Emily? I don't think of her as a tomboy.<eos> She isn't.<eos> I used to be a real tomboy.<eos> I would spend more time in the tree in our front yard than I would in my own bedroom.<eos> - What changed?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Yes, I do.
You know who "A" is.<eos> I'm not so sure anymore.<eos> Oh, cut it, Spencer.<eos> First it was Mona, then it wasn't.<eos> Maybe I know or maybe I'm just looking into another mask.<eos> Ali is alive.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Never mind.<eos> She's alive and you know how to find her.<eos> No, I don't.
See this?<eos> "Still thinking of Ambrose Pearson."<eos> Right, but that's not what it used to say.<eos> Originally it said "still thinking of Ambrose Pavilion."<eos> "A" changed it so that would sound more like a person's name so that instead of looking for a location, we'd be searching for a guy.<eos> Yeah, some weirdo named Ambrose.<eos> Right.<eos> So Ambrose Pavilion is in Norristown Zoo.<eos> So how does that prove that Ezra is "A"?<eos> It doesn't.
Did you or did you not see me standing with a shovel that night?<eos> And if you did see me hurt Ali, then why didn't you just call the cops?<eos> Hi. Anything for the dry cleaners?<eos> It was 3 days in rehab, Mom.<eos> I really did not need so many sweaters.<eos> I thought, I don't know, maybe you'd go outside for some fresh air or if you got cold.<eos> I did get cold and then I got the sweats.<eos> You know, withdrawal symptoms can't really be stopped with a cable knit.<eos> They said that the medical detox would help mitigate your discomfort.<eos> It did, mom.
I'm not alone.<eos> I just mean that my dad's here with me.<eos> Look, I've got to go.<eos> The tour's starting.<eos> Bye.<eos> Wow. Morning, sunshine.<eos> No, don't start.<eos> You look worse than me.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Shouldn't it be the other way around?<eos> Not that I'm complaining or anything.<eos> Yeah, you better not be.<eos> I can finish this.<eos> Why don't you go up and put your laundry away?<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Spencer. Veronica, may I come in?<eos> I was just stopping by to see if you got the flyer I left in your mailbox about the bridal show fund-raiser.<eos> I did.
Did you read the book?<eos> Do you know what it says about Alison?<eos> If Alison were alive, I'm sure she'd love being the focus of a scandalous page-turner.<eos> But no, Ezra only showed me parts of chapters I was written into.<eos> I never saw the whole thing.<eos> I didn't come here to hash things out.<eos> I came here to tell you that you need to leave.<eos> Yeah, I understand you need your space.<eos> No, I don't think that you understand.<eos> I do.
Well, would it be any easier if I was at the foot of your bed?<eos> But Jason's not answering, Emily.<eos> He's unloading boxes from his car.<eos> I'm just gonna walk over there and try to talk to him.<eos> Talk to you later.<eos> You're up early.<eos> Yeah, I have to go talk to somebody before school.<eos> Okay, I'll grab my jacket.<eos> No, Dean, you don't have to come.<eos> Yeah, I do.
And by the way, you are required to treat everyone regardless of the immigration status.<eos> This has nothing to do with his status as an illegal immigrant.<eos> We've looked after him well. He has had great care.<eos> He is simply well enough... Excuse me. It's a crock of shit.<eos> I'm sorry. You know it.<eos> You know it's about a bed.<eos> He's not well enough to leave. I'm sorry.<eos> What qualifies you to make that prognosis?<eos> You don't have to be a doctor to see that he's not well enough to leave.<eos> Actually, yes, you do.
I'm not worth anything, if I can't do that.<eos> Sky Van Der Veen.<eos> - Phillip Kopus.<eos> - Yeah, I know who you are.<eos> Do you mind if I sit down?<eos> You're a lawyer.<eos> I thought lawyers were supposed to argue all the time.<eos> You were the quiet one-- you never said anything at all.<eos> You don't remember me.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You gonna be all right to play tonight?<eos> Hey, you don't happen to know where Jean's brother is, do you?<eos> Parents are lookin' for him.<eos> They think he was hanging out with Phillip Kopus last night.<eos> That sound right to you?<eos> I thought that Jean was with Kopus last night.<eos> No, she was at a friend's house.<eos> She don't know where Brian is, either.<eos> You sure you don't know where he is?<eos> No, I don't.
It's getting really late.<eos> You know what they say early to bed, early to Human Centipede.<eos> I gotta go Human Centipede with the Olsen twins.<eos> They've done it before.<eos> See you gay boys later.<eos> Let's find a place to sleep, buddy.<eos> It's been a long day.<eos> Oh, Jesus!<eos> - I didn't eat corn.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
"Oh, thank you, Fred!"<eos> "I love my bird feeder, and I love you."<eos> "That was so thoughtful."<eos> "Why don't you go ahead and touch my boobies?"<eos> Yes!<eos> From your mouth to Sheila's.<eos> - Sheila!<eos> - Mom!<eos> What happened to your eye?<eos> What didn't?
Jordon!<eos> Jordon!<eos> It's Austin. Come in!<eos> Jordon, come in!<eos> It's Austin.<eos> Got any signal yet?<eos> No. There's nothing.<eos> He's coming along side of us.<eos> - He's going to pass us. - Oh, my God.<eos> What do I do?
Jordon!<eos> It's Austin. Come in!<eos> Jordon, come in!<eos> It's Austin.<eos> Got any signal yet?<eos> No. There's nothing.<eos> He's coming along side of us.<eos> - He's going to pass us. - Oh, my God.<eos> What do I do?<eos> What do I do?
Fucking sociopaths.<eos> Acting all respectable and altruistic until your opportunity pops up, to get ahead, and bam, there you are, pushing the rest of us out of the way!<eos> - Well guess what?<eos> - What?<eos> If I see you touching any of our shit, I'm going to shoot you. And then I'm going to kill you.<eos> People like you have it long coming.<eos> Don't think I don't have my eyes on you.<eos> Scared me.<eos> When was the last time you slept?<eos> I don't no.
- When I find her ...<eos> Don't be an idiot.<eos> Lay low for now and erase all traces of our work.<eos> - What the hell, Ditlev.<eos> - We have not seen each other and will not again.<eos> - What if they find her?<eos> - She has dug herself into a hole.<eos> Finally she disappeared altogether.<eos> - What if they find her?<eos> - Then we do it.
The rubies in that necklace were blood-red.<eos> I don't expect civil servants to understand how impressive that is, but I do expect you to get them back.<eos> If there's any other details the two of you can remember...<eos> Mr. Powell?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, uh... no.<eos> I'm sorry. I have to get this done before sundown.<eos> Adrian is convinced the gunmen will come back, so he's decided to change every lock in our house.<eos> You know how to change locks? Aah!<eos> No, he does not.
I need to get pregnant... Now.<eos> I-I just talked to my mom.<eos> She told me what happened with Zoila.<eos> If you hadn't told anyone I was back... I know. I know.<eos> I'm sorry, but...<eos> I was just worried about you.<eos> Look, I can't talk.<eos> I got a job interview.<eos> I-I-I know we fought a lot those last couple of weeks, but... but that doesn't mean that we ha...<eos> Yeah. It does.
You showed a human how cyper is used?<eos> Most Atrians don't even have that information.<eos> If the Trags find out...<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> That's why I'm asking you.<eos> You're the only person I can trust that can help me.<eos> Maybe I used to have a reason to be on your side, but like you said this morning, it's over.<eos> The Trags have honored me by making me their leader.<eos> Do you know why you're here?<eos> I do.
Thank you.<eos> Be careful.<eos> No one knows how vyre works on humans.<eos> It will cure the side-effect of cyper, but...<eos> There's no telling what else it will do.<eos> Keep it moving.<eos> I have it.<eos> - The vyre.<eos> - Thank God.<eos> What do I do with it?
How'd you know?<eos> My mother is a leader of the Trags.<eos> There's not much I don't know.<eos> But why are you helping out now?<eos> It's time I embraced my destiny.<eos> Nicely done.<eos> If it wasn't for your speech, the integration program and your father's work would've gone down the drain.<eos> You wouldn't have given up on integration, though.<eos> No. But I'm only interested in programs that work.<eos> Thanks to you, this one still does.
Ours was to be a transitional generation...<eos> Ensuring that 3 generations from now mankind could go home.<eos> But everything has changed, and we will either be the generation that sees the human race return to Earth...<eos> Or upon whose watch... It finally ends.<eos> My son is already down there.<eos> I sent him.<eos> And the truth is I don't know if he is alive or dead.<eos> But I still have hope.<eos> How does the Chancellor vote?<eos> I don't.
Wait, what?<eos> You're gonna go stay with Ray for a while?<eos> Just through the rehearsal process so I can just think about the play and not have to deal with all this drama.<eos> What drama?<eos> This is just me.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> You didn't even care about the play.<eos> Well, but here's the thing.<eos> I did.
You heard from Robert?<eos> No, Patricia.<eos> Hi, Pattie. Hi.<eos> Shove over.<eos> Guess what.<eos> What?<eos> My mother's going to...pay for Annie's nursery furniture.<eos> What?<eos> How did you talk her into it?<eos> Well, I didn't, but...
Good night, Tricia.<eos> What do you think?<eos> We'll see.<eos> The idea is to take color theory and turn it on its head.<eos> Break all the rules.<eos> They're gorgeous.<eos> Who'd you say your client is?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I was just wondering if maybe I knew them.<eos> You don't.
Fuck!<eos> Oh fuck, shit!<eos> Get out of the car!<eos> No. No, no, no, for fuck's sake. Please not another.<eos> Where did he go?<eos> Huh! Who?<eos> The man you just hit.<eos> Yeah. But I didn't. Did I?
Someone wants to say "hello".<eos> Hi guys. This is Constable Rachel Heggie here.<eos> Um, if you'd keep your eyes out for an IC1 male, six foot, bearded, and probably injured.<eos> We should keep an eye on the local hospitals as well.<eos> Sir?<eos> Sergeant MacReady?<eos> In all seriousness, Constable, you sure you're not imagining all this?<eos> There was blood on the headlights, sir. So no.<eos> See, I'd be happy to get the car checked if we had a victim.<eos> Do we?
- There's no rear exit.<eos> - There's no access to the roof?<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Come on!<eos> - You've reached emergency services.<eos> All operators are busy at present.<eos> - Please hold, We will connect you...<eos> - Shit!<eos> You have a battering ram here?<eos> Of course you do!
I know the feeling.<eos> As soon as all your hospital corners are done, I'll turn this on.<eos> You're confident of your corners?<eos> What difference will it make?<eos> Shouldn't you be upstairs?<eos> I should have lent you the money.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Probably wouldn't have had enough for a TV anyway.<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.<eos> Well, I did.
There was no signage!<eos> Nerds.<eos> Just tell them I'm in the bathroom.<eos> For the whole day?<eos> Yeah. Just say you don't want to know, make an "ick" face, and no one will ask any questions.<eos> There's my little hottie... and Dr. Grant.<eos> All right, I'll see you.<eos> I'd say your clothes are ruined, but they couldn't get any worse!<eos> Meredith, hey.<eos> These girls just did this to me last week.
- Hell of a coincidence.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> It can't be.<eos> Can't be what?<eos> It's my writing.<eos> The way I wrote my name and... The flower evening primrose.<eos> It was my favorite when I was a girl.<eos> It grows in Montana.<eos> I have notebooks full of them.<eos> I did this.
Sullivan: Anabella Capella went to Yale.<eos> Is that the connection?<eos> Uncle Luke spotted you, thought you might have the right stuff to be a wiseguy?<eos> This guy's not tough enough to be a wiseguy.<eos> - He's a mook. - [Chuckles]<eos> - Are you a mook?<eos> - Mook.<eos> I love this word.<eos> Did you know the word "mook" was popularized by Martin Scorsese's film Mean Streets?<eos> No, I didn't.
Somebody who tried to kill Lizzie, who did kill Richards.<eos> Somebody is watching us.<eos> I can't do this again.<eos> -Susan, it's not like that.<eos> Susan! Susan, hang on.<eos> I had to make myself ready to die for them? You understand?<eos> -I know.<eos> I know. -No, you don't. You don't know.<eos> That's the problem, you don't know.<eos> None of you do.
Real trouble.<eos> Jasper too. We know he likes a flutter.<eos> That's fine. We won't tell anyone.<eos> We just wondered if you'd seen him with any...you know, bad types.<eos> It's all bad types in here, love.<eos> How'd your friend get rolled up in this?<eos> She and Jasper had a thing going on the side.<eos> Selling. Yeah, I heard about that.<eos> All right, I know Jasper.<eos> Everyone does.
DS Akers requested assistance.<eos> You were the duty station?<eos> DI Denton is entitled to be questioned by an officer at least one rank superior.<eos> There's no suspicion of DI Denton.<eos> She is being interviewed purely as a witness.<eos> Yeah... Sam, it's all fine.<eos> We were the duty station as, at that time, Akers and the witness were located within the precinct of 4th Street and the 4th Street Estate.<eos> And did you share that information with the officers at 4th Street Station?<eos> No, I did not, sir.<eos> You did not?
No, she didn't.<eos> Did she refer to any process?<eos> Sorry, gaffer, you said you wanted these straightaway.<eos> That's all right, thank you.<eos> That's my new DC, Kate Foster.<eos> You were saying?<eos> Did DS Akers refer to any process of clearing her actions with her superiors?<eos> No, she didn't.<eos> Did she discuss any role played by other members of her team?<eos> No, she didn't.
How come you knew the name of the nurse, the very same nurse who was involved in killing him? I didn't.<eos> I hung up when they put me through.<eos> I realised it was a stupid thing to do.<eos> I wasn't thinking.<eos> You expect us to believe that?<eos> If I had conspired in the murder...<eos> Which you didn't.<eos> ..why on earth would I have made a call at that exact time?<eos> It would only incriminate me.<eos> It does.
Do you mind going... just going by the nursing home?<eos> They want to send my mum's... personal effects, and I'd rather go and get them myself.<eos> I'll get the authority.<eos> We're going to name you some police officers, and you are going to tell us what crime or crimes they committed.<eos> Have you got it?<eos> We're going to start with Deputy Chief Constable Michael Dryden.<eos> Dryden got himself blown by the girl. Did he kill her?<eos> To confirm the agreement, any evidence that you give in this regard is immune from prosecution.<eos> We had the photos... but we needed the threat of the girl being able to testify to really turn the screw.<eos> But she did a runner.
15 minutes later, Dryden's vehicle exits at high speed.<eos> Passenger seat's empty.<eos> But if we keep going... ..shortly after, an unidentified vehicle exits the car park.<eos> 15 minutes before Dryden's.<eos> This is the vehicle used to obtain the photos of Dryden and Carly?<eos> Most likely.<eos> Do we have any sighting of Denton at all?<eos> No.<eos> No. She could've been there but just knew how to avoid the cameras.<eos> Dryden didn't.
About your sister.<eos> George!<eos> Well, if you're here to see Sarah, you have a strange way of showing it.<eos> You didn't tell mother, did you?<eos> No, no, no. I was quick enough on my feet to cover for you.<eos> Assuming it's Anna you're here for.<eos> Yes. I should have guessed with all the trips to the city.<eos> She's been talking to you about Gino.<eos> You know about him?<eos> I do now.
Hey, what are you doing?<eos> No!<eos> Who are they?<eos> What are they doing here?<eos> - English!<eos> - I was just telling my son that someone reported we had restricted technology.<eos> We don't have restricted tech, so you can just stop!<eos> They can threaten us all they want.<eos> We have nothing to hide.<eos> Actually, we do.
It's true.<eos> So what about you?<eos> Are you into all this leather, whip, chain paraphernalia?<eos> - Men on hooks?<eos> -Not your thing?<eos> No, although I do kind of have--<eos> - See that guy over there? -Oh, my.<eos> I've got a soft spot for, you know, the old men who masturbate in the ass-less chaps.<eos> And I bet you've got a pair of ass-less chaps in the back of your wardrobe somewhere.<eos> Maybe I do and maybe...

You gonna watch him fuck people?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> If I was paying someone for sex, I don't think I'd want you in the corner with your crayons and sketch pad.<eos> I think it needs to be more about how he makes people feel.<eos> He did have something, that guy, but it could have just been the jock strap.<eos> You know, if anything, it really is more about intimacy than sex.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I don't think jerking off some random guy on a sofa has much to do with intimacy.<eos> Of course it does.
You wrote a treasure map.<eos> If you see him around, I wanna meet that guy.<eos> There's a project I want to discuss with him.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> "This puts the future squarely in the hands of those who know computers not for what they are, but for everything they have the potential to be."<eos> What?<eos> You know who said that?<eos> No, no, I don't.
Because I want to build a machine that nobody else has the balls to build.<eos> Wow, you're serious.<eos> Look, that's a terrible idea.<eos> - For such a multitude of reasons that I... because it's illegal.<eos> Worst-case scenario, IBM sues us into the ground.<eos> Uh, Cardiff finds out, then both of us would be on the street.<eos> Apple, IBM, they have the market sewn up.<eos> Plus, you got Commodore, Tandy, Texas Instruments.<eos> I'm sorry, but you missed it.<eos> We all did.
Double it.<eos> My wife makes 15 at TI.<eos> Well, then I feel sorry for her.<eos> So?<eos> What's it gonna be, Joe?<eos> Answer honestly.<eos> This is for legal record.<eos> False answers put you at risk of perjury, you understand?<eos> I'm sorry, you have to answer "yes" or "I do."<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
— Dai had to make a snap decision.<eos> Oh, this is all my fault.<eos> He was in London.<eos> Would you have told them to keep their money?<eos> I'll tell you what I would've done.<eos> I would've come back.<eos> All right, I run a civil meeting here.<eos> If you want to scream and shout, get on the pickets.<eos> I don't have a problem with what they are.<eos> - None of us do.
You girls have opened my eyes.<eos> I'm going to extend my repertoire, you'll see.<eos> - The vegan Delia Smith.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Take care now.<eos> It's a bloody travesty, man.<eos> I don't accept it.<eos> - Gethin.<eos> - I don't!
India.<eos> I don't want to go.<eos> I know.<eos> I've been thinking about quitting the agency.<eos> Quitting?<eos> Why? We just got married.<eos> It doesn't change who you are.<eos> You love what you do.<eos> You don't want me to be here?<eos> Of course I do.
I wanna know what kind of monster minuses the best student in his class. I'm a monster?<eos> I was in the storm drain lair of the Black River Ripper.<eos> I have seen human heads used for things other than heads. So you best not be calling me a monster.<eos> Okay, you're a bad teacher.<eos> I got her off your back.<eos> I was handling it.<eos> I know how to engage my students.<eos> I may not love teaching, but I did fool around with it today. I may hook up with it again a few more times... -...even if I do dump it before Christmas.<eos> - We do not work for them.<eos> Maybe we do.
--It will not be late.<eos> --I have school tomorrow.<eos> --Come, I give the pizza.<eos> --I'll talk to your father.<eos> --Clear.<eos> Okay. See you tomorrow?<eos> --You have not been home for two weeks.<eos> --I have to work, Mom.<eos> --Stay.<eos> --It does not.
Awesome!<eos> Um, do you wanna play quarters or something?<eos> Cool.<eos> Give us a minute?<eos> ♪ Boy uh, I'll go get some beers.<eos> I don't wanna ruin what is clearly going well for you with cute and nice over there, but I thought that flock of seagulls boy with the grouchy attitude was more your speed.<eos> He is.<eos> Scott's a friend.<eos> Oh, your boy didn't show, huh?<eos> No, he did.
He's all yours.<eos> Suddenly, I realized that Sebastian was a pressure cooker.<eos> I just hoped he wouldn't blow.<eos> I'm gettin' it, dude!<eos> No, dude, dude, you can't keep doing that.<eos> - No, man, hey, stop. - You gotta let go.<eos> - You can't do that!<eos> - Come on. Ohh!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Unfortunately, something else did.
I gotta go do something.<eos> Where you going?<eos> To take some of the pressure off of you.<eos> Larissa, I have known you to be an interesting, intelligent... strange woman, who has had a wonderful influence on my daughter, which is why this is all so confusing for me.<eos> Isn't part of being married about living with the person that you're going to spend your life with?<eos> I mean, why won't you move in with Harlan?<eos> I don't wanna live with him because I'm afraid if I move in, I'll become a person who has nothing of herself left, and that scares me.<eos> Wait, but what do you mean?<eos> Moving in doesn't mean you become less you.<eos> And yet it does.
Cops are coming!<eos> - Everybody run!<eos> - What?<eos> Everybody run!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> They're gonna bust us!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Come on, get out while you still can!<eos> I guess I should go.<eos> No, you don't.
- I just, I mean...<eos> How much do you even know about this Tony guy?<eos> Isn't he, like, 18?<eos> Does he really have connections that are all that important?<eos> He's the real deal.<eos> And you'd knt if you bothered to look into it.<eos> Which would be easy for you to do, since you work at a magazine.<eos> But I guess since skateboarding doesn't interest you, it's not worth doing.<eos> It's like you don't even want me to have my own life.<eos> Of course I do, just not at the expense of our relationship.
I'm glad you came.<eos> I've missed you.<eos> It's only been a week.<eos> I know, but, well... (Chuckles)<eos> I don't know about you, but it's been the longest week of my life.<eos> So, first things first.<eos> I got my results back yesterday.<eos> They're negative.<eos> I assume you got good news, too.<eos> Yeah, I did.
And I'm picking up these.<eos> All right, now tell me again about the skinny bitch you're supposed to interview.<eos> She's a 17-year-old Prima Ballerina... the youngest ballerina to ever play the black swan in "Swan Lake."<eos> Feels like the world is nothing but birds...<eos> Swans, my little Gabriel.<eos> Still haven't found him, huh?<eos> No.<eos> But I did find a man while I was looking for him.<eos> Oh, and did you get a reward for finding him?<eos> Yes, I did.
What will you do?<eos> Will you have to move out?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, this place is rent-controlled.<eos> If I sell my Porsche, that'll buy me at least six months.<eos> Maybe by then, my investment will start to pay off.<eos> I guess it's pretty scary, huh?<eos> I'm so sorry, Sebastian.<eos> - Maggie. You seriously didn't have to come see me off.<eos> - No, I did.

You seriously didn't have to come see me off.<eos> - No, I did.<eos> - No, you didn't.
How do you know I'm here to bet on a horse?<eos> We're in front of the O.T.B.<eos> And a deli and a hair center for men.<eos> You told me you come up here and bet.<eos> I love the idea that betting relaxes you.<eos> It did until you showed up.<eos> Look, I've been thinking about you a lot.<eos> I was hoping to find you.<eos> I don't know where you live.<eos> Very few people do.
I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't understand what's happening to me.<eos> I-I'm a scientist.<eos> I know that sex is a purely physical act.<eos> But with you, it's... it's more.<eos> It's like I crave you.<eos> I keep searching for this biological explanation, but there's none.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> I do.
What does this feel like to you?<eos> It's me.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, help me.<eos> Help me.<eos> Take it out, please.<eos> Take it out.<eos> Don't stop.<eos> Don't stop.<eos> Don't...
He is almost 30 years and is already a leader.<eos> Parisi is an idiot.<eos> - But we put a stop to.<eos> - It's not about Parisi.<eos> - It's about Genny.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> If something happens to me, he takes my place.<eos> What do you think about that?<eos> - That he's your son.<eos> And what do the others?
My size only comes in white.<eos> Okay, I can't be stuck in Rear D.<eos> It's for the guys who can't cut it.<eos> - I'm in Rear D.<eos> - Let me back up.<eos> Rear D maintains the base and supports the families of deployed soldiers.<eos> - It's an important job.<eos> - Totally agree.<eos> - Now, how do I get out of it?<eos> - You don't.
In Afghanistan, I led over 100 raids on insurgent camps.<eos> If anyone can make you real soldiers, it's me.<eos> Now, to start with, this unit doesn't even have a motto.<eos> A motto embodies the spirit of the unit...<eos> Ooh, how about, "give me back those CDs you borrowed, Brian."<eos> - That's not a motto.<eos> - But it does need to be said.<eos> Let's talk about your appearance.<eos> Now, we've got a weight issue in this general area here.<eos> - We do.
Yes, honey, I cleaned up her Internet.<eos> Since quitting football, Tim had invested over a thousand hours with his guild-mates on various dungeons.<eos> An incomprehensible amount of time for his father to imagine.<eos> A man who had been a first-string tailback himself, Kent had nurtured his son to play since his fledgling days in pee-wee.<eos> Football served as a common language for which they had no substitute.<eos> Remember when you saw her for the first time?<eos> Kissed her lips?<eos> Touched her soft skin?<eos> Do you remember when you said "I do" and meant it?<eos> Well, we do, too.
Hey, Dad.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're really beautiful, you know that?<eos> I'd like to explain last night.<eos> I don't know how we got here.<eos> I just... It's like we slipped, and before we knew it the whole reason we started dating or...<eos> - had a family just...<eos> - What do you want?<eos> I don't...
Any sign of a struggle?<eos> Single incision... here.<eos> Long, slim blade.<eos> She'd have felt it. No great discomfort.<eos> Subcutaneous fat closes over the wound, so not much bleeding.<eos> Not much to see.<eos> Oh, and you got your murder weapon yet?<eos> Well, the wound has a little kink in it.<eos> In the flesh. Meaning?<eos> So did the blade.
No!<eos> Stop! Stop! Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> (Voice breaking): Sorry, guys.<eos> I already missed it once.<eos> - Ding dong!<eos> - No!<eos> Thanks for the invite.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> No. You don't.
Well, she says that I can't, but I don't believe her.<eos> Wait...<eos> Would you do that?<eos> I had to try.<eos> Anyways, there's not a spell in the book for it.<eos> Nora, I can't stay here for eternity.<eos> You and Josh, you guys are gonna move away soon, yeah?<eos> And Aidan, we never completely know what he's gonna do.<eos> It's not like he lives a risk-free lifestyle.<eos> None of us do.
I was just trying to help, Zoe.<eos> That's the lie you tell yourself every time, but you possessed bodies even though you knew it was wrong.<eos> You shredded ghosts...<eos> Because you couldn't accept yourself.<eos> You sent Nick to limbo, and then you brought him back as a zombie.<eos> Now you're gonna do the same with this lil' smokie girl!<eos> Nobody knows I messed up more than I do.<eos> I've had a lot of time and multiple dimensions to think about my guilt.<eos> Do you think I like coming here and being scorned by you?<eos> I really don't.
Kenny wasn't gonna do anything!<eos> He's a time bomb, Josh.<eos> And you know it.<eos> Caroline, don't.<eos> I'm sorry, Josh, but after what happened here, it's pretty obvious we need to stick together.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Andrew...<eos> Is Emily OK?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
It's no problem.<eos> Don't wait up.<eos> We'll be really late.<eos> - Subtle, what you just did.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What are you guys gonna be doing?<eos> Ok, I wanna see these bus-boy moves in action.<eos> I don't get this.<eos> I don't get this, Sally.<eos> I just don't...
So I did make her pregnant?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Doesn't work that way.<eos> Just how do women get babies?<eos> I'm not allowed to discuss that with fourth-graders.<eos> Fifth grade, you get every dirty detail.<eos> Do you know how embarrassed I was To get a call at my arraignment For my behavior during the pub crawl<eos> My son placed on his art teacher? I didn't mean to make her pregnant.<eos> I just hate art so much.<eos> Oh, everyone does, son.
Hmm, you look unhappy.<eos> Is that because you kept your word or because you broke it?<eos> You're not the only one that I gave my word to.<eos> What?<eos> Like you owe those vampires something?<eos> Not all of them, no.<eos> But Kenny, yeah, I do.<eos> Suzanna, Kenny is my son.<eos> Oh! Well, that does change the equation, doesn't it?<eos> Yes, it does.
Reranked all the DoctorWhos by puffiness of the hair.<eos> Oh, and I also got married to my actual, non-imaginary, comic-tolerating girlfriend, Strawberry.<eos> Now when Milo talks to himself, it won't seem crazy.<eos> So, Milo talks to himself.<eos> We will treasure that information.<eos> Yes... we will.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna share this primo origin ish with my bride.<eos> Even the mintiest comic is just acidifying pulp, if you have no one to read it with, right?<eos> Nerds don't get girls.<eos> These days they do, man.
Lucas.<eos> It's pronounced "Luca-dollar."<eos> That's my competition name.<eos> I'm a competitive eater.<eos> Competitive eater?<eos> Did I hear right?<eos> I could be a competitive eater?<eos> No!<eos> You didn't hear anything!<eos> Yes, I did!
Oh, yes, I remember that painting.<eos> And that is the man I sold it to.<eos> And that man sold it to me!<eos> That proves the painting is mine!<eos> And nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money!<eos> I love art!<eos> Art?<eos> What do you know about art?<eos> You don't even know who painted that picture.<eos> Yes, I do.
Irresistible, especially to the kind of man few people would miss. ♪ I never read it in a book ♪ ♪ I never saw it on a show ♪<eos> ♪ If you want to get to heaven ♪ ♪ You got to raise ♪ ♪ a little hell ♪<eos> I mean, sure, we hunt sometimes for sport, but it's a lot easier and a lot safer to get delivery.<eos> Come on, sweetie.<eos> Aren't you gonna give me a name?<eos> It's... Ann.<eos> Mm.<eos> Sweet Ann.<eos> You got any idea what I'm about to do to you?<eos> Yeah. I do.
You thought what?<eos> That I'd hurt you?<eos> Kill you?<eos> I would never hurt you.<eos> Not my baby girl, not my sweet Alex.<eos> How could you even think that?<eos> Baby, why did you do it?<eos> Why did you run from us?<eos> I love you, mama.<eos> I do.
I've given my word!<eos> Gavin, listen to your father.<eos> I know what's best for you.<eos> Kids.<eos> Squirrel.<eos> I hope you were nice to your father.<eos> What?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Look, we got the Blade.<eos> You do?
Sal, what are you do--<eos> He's not coming, is he?<eos> David'll be here in a few minutes.<eos> You won't be.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> 'Cause he's my little brother, Violet.<eos> It's my job to protect him.<eos> It's my job to keep our blood pure.<eos> You believe that bloodline crap?<eos> We all do.
It's my job to keep our blood pure.<eos> You believe that bloodline crap?<eos> We all do.<eos> Bloodlines -- everyone knowing our place.<eos> It's the one thing we all agree on.<eos> If your people find out you ran off with a shifter, they'll be lookin' for payback.<eos> And they'll come after my family.<eos> And then it's nothin' but bad times and dead bodies on both sides.<eos> David wants to go straight, that's his call.<eos> But he does it alone.
Order.<eos> If I let you take matters into your own hands, what's to stop one of them from doing the same?<eos> You can talk to her.<eos> You should talk to her.<eos> But leave the Blade outside.<eos> Are you asking or telling?<eos> We're not asking.<eos> You sure you don't want to go back, Cass?<eos> Look, if Dean is right about Tessa...<eos> No, I, uh... I do.
Oh, are you kidding?<eos> Hot Doug's?<eos> That line is like an hour.<eos> [Laughs] Don't we know?<eos> The Elvis?<eos> Oh, seriously, you guys.<eos> This is for me?<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> They didn't have to do this.<eos> They didn't.
There's nothing wrong with me visiting him, being at a party.<eos> There is if this photo is on the front page of the Daily.<eos> Politics and business are intertwined in China, as I'm sure you know.<eos> It's not uncommon to partner with someone who can ensure Beijing's approval.<eos> So you needed his political influence.<eos> All this is moot.<eos> Our venture fell through.<eos> Right after the Port Jefferson Bridge was approved.<eos> Well, I had nothing to do with that project.<eos> - Neither did Feng, to my knowledge.
- Look, Raymond,<eos> I'm your lobbyist, not your henchman.<eos> I don't employ lobbyists. I employ people who can be useful to me.<eos> And you are proving otherwise.<eos> Quiet now.<eos> - I'll figure something out.<eos> - Soon.<eos> OK, that's good.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Your son will have everything he needs.<eos> I am always thinking about you.<eos> I love you, baby.<eos> Always remember that.<eos> Swear to keep this place secret.<eos> No human can know about it.<eos> Eljida and your son's life depend on it.<eos> You'll see your mother again.<eos> I really believe that.<eos> After today, I do, too.
These guys have all day, but we don't!<eos> Commander Bisgaard is on the scene.<eos> First rule of officer safety.<eos> You can't protect yourself, you can't protect anyone.<eos> Don't ever do this again.<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> I know Lieutenant Dunn is in charge here...<eos> The bodies were discovered over here, sir.<eos> Did you discover the bodies, Lieutenant Dunn? No, Commander.<eos> Detective Jensen did.
What?<eos> !<eos> Give me the phone.<eos> So, you're a live-in?<eos> That's good.<eos> No!<eos> That is not good!<eos> She's supposed to be in design school!<eos> She says you know the people she's working for.<eos> I do?
Oh. How did that go?<eos> Good.<eos> Helped me realize something...<eos> You were right.<eos> Valentina does deserve the best.<eos> And that piece of crap doesn't even come close.<eos> You're a liar.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You said you didn't know how to write lyrics.<eos> I don't.
Oh, not till late. He's shooting a commercial.<eos> What are you doing tonight? Are you kidding?<eos> It's Friday night.<eos> I've got crazy plans.<eos> Gonna drink tea and write in my therapy journal.<eos> Why don't you call some friends and have them come over?<eos> My uncle wouldn't like that.<eos> No!<eos> He wants you to have a good time.<eos> We both do.
Ethan. I've been lying for you since I was five.<eos> I'm tired of being your accomplice.<eos> But everything that I have done...<eos> Has been for me.<eos> Got it.<eos> Ethan, this is my home.<eos> I wouldn't know where to go.<eos> If you're smart enough to get away with murder, I'm sure you could figure out how to rent a condo.<eos> Don't you love me?<eos> I do, mom.
You're right.<eos> I'm a hypocrite.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I won't tell anyone.<eos> I know you won't, because you're gonna sign a confidentiality agreement.<eos> Come on.<eos> For you to work here, I need to know that you're not gonna talk about my private life, or anyone else's.<eos> I gave up coke. I guess I can give up gossip.<eos> You know, for all the high-profile folks that you've worked for, I'm surprised that no one has made you sign a confidentiality agreement before.<eos> Oh, one guy did...
I love having a child.<eos> Miguel makes me very happy.<eos> You know what I love having?<eos> A dream.<eos> And the day my dream comes true, I'm gonna be as happy as you are.<eos> What if it doesn't come true?<eos> What?<eos> Well, lots of people have dreams that don't work out, Or they get their dream and then it goes wrong.<eos> That's not gonna happen to me.<eos> But what if it does?
Zoila's Pablo.<eos> Her ex-husband?<eos> Her current husband, but thanks for asking.<eos> Is she here?<eos> She's making breakfast.<eos> That smells good.<eos> If you invite him to eat with us, I'll kill you.<eos> - We have to talk.<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> We really, really do.
I thought you had that situation under control.<eos> I was mistaken.<eos> And I thought we had the full picture, not to mention complete access.<eos> Maybe you can tell me how it is that patients here just go missing, or how a member of my team is attacked by an infected monkey she was told didn't exist in the first place.<eos> Or maybe you'd like to tell me why my brother was tinkering with maybe the worst contagion this world has seen in his own damn lab?<eos> You should ask your brother.<eos> I would never encourage something so reckless.<eos> First things first:<eos> how do we contain the infected patients?<eos> We don't, not without complete transparency.
All right, everyone, write down your pick for cheer captain.<eos> Another for Lissa.<eos> Good choice, Trina.<eos> Wow, this is a tight race.<eos> In fact, it's dead even.<eos> Lissa doesn't even want to be cheer captain.<eos> Well, if I'm called to serve, I guess I'd have no choice.<eos> Jenna, the equipment girl, may I have your ballot, please?<eos> - I get a vote?<eos> - No, you don't.
- I meant not over a loudspeaker.<eos> Nobody knows it was us.<eos> I so didn't need to hear that your sex life is sex death.<eos> Not surprised.<eos> But still, keep that nastiness to yourself, please.<eos> Clearly Tamara's GPS-ing of her G-spot wasn't enough to relieve the ongoing tension.<eos> Which left me wondering if I'd been too harsh with Matty last night.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry about the way I handled things last night.<eos> I've just got a lot on my plate...<eos> Yes, we all do.
I ought to send you out to the gate to meet him.<eos> There's nothing like one of your reproachful stares to make a person toe the line.<eos> He's scared I'll hit him with my stick.<eos> Right, Jacob... ..are you ready for a spot of crowd control after lunch?<eos> What is this?<eos> It's called Quiche Lorraine, according to Mrs B.<eos> Pass me the beetroot.<eos> With Sister Julienne's permission, I'll make myself a sandwich.<eos> Of course. What I want to know is does Nurse Lee say when she's coming back?<eos> No, she doesn't.
And he hated the life I chose.<eos> He used to say "Why, Enid? Why?<eos> You're throwing your life away."<eos> The irony of it is... ..he was the first baby I saw being born.<eos> And it was his first cry that decided it for me.<eos> There was... So full of hope.<eos> Everything made new.<eos> You see the good in everything.<eos> That's your curse.<eos> And you don't.
Max Simkin.<eos> Well, Max, I'm Carmen Herrara from the Lower East Side Action Committee.<eos> OK.<eos> Basically, we're dedicated to the preservation and rejuvenation of the Lower East Side.<eos> We're trying to stop real estate developers from converting the neighborhood into luxury housing and retail spaces, forcing the regular people out.<eos> - How are they forcing them out?<eos> - Money. I mean, they buy them out or they raise the rent.<eos> How much do you think I'd get for a place like this?<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> It does to me.
You are beautiful.<eos> - Are you high?<eos> - No, but I wish I was.<eos> Get over here.<eos> Oh, sure, OK.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I screamed at you before.<eos> It's just...<eos> I get scared. And I need to know you want me here.<eos> Oh, I... I do.
- Are you high?<eos> - No, but I wish I was.<eos> Get over here.<eos> Oh, sure, OK.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I screamed at you before.<eos> It's just...<eos> I get scared. And I need to know you want me here.<eos> Oh, I... I do.<eos> I definitely do.
Oh, um, we need more names for our petition.<eos> Do you think you could get your dad to sign?<eos> - Nah.<eos> - Max, this is important.<eos> I know.<eos> My, uh, father took off a while ago.<eos> He ain't around anymore.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - It hurts.<eos> Yeah, it does.
Yep. The smart one, went up to Yale?<eos> Yeah, no, she's smart. She's smart like her Grandfather Tommy.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I don't think Anabella's father, the doctor, was the reason that she went to college.<eos> I think her Grandfather Tommy was.<eos> Why are you bugging me with this? I'm trying to eat my dog in peace.<eos> 'Cause Tommy was smart.<eos> He knew Anabella's father wanted nothing to do with the family business.<eos> And Tommy's other son, Luke? He doesn't have the brains.<eos> But Anabella does.
I'm in really good shape right now, but my looks are a serious problem.<eos> And I sweat way too fucking much.<eos> Girls don't like clammy hands on their tits. - That's a fact. - [Sighs]<eos> Hey, isn't that that girl from that time? Remember?<eos> Oh, yeah, the one who wanted a photo with you because you were famous for fucking your students?<eos> Yeah, that made me feel awesome. - Good times, dad.<eos> - You should go talk to her. She's all by her lonesome over there. - Go on.<eos> - She's not really my type.<eos> You don't have a type.<eos> Sure I do.
I can probably bang her outright...<eos> - No banging.<eos> - No banging?<eos> Just talking, all right?<eos> What about fingering?<eos> I will break that finger right off.<eos> - [Yelps] - Just enjoy her. And let her enjoy you, okay?<eos> Try not to fart.<eos> I love you, you know that?<eos> I do.
An engineer could use a boiler room to blow up the whole school.<eos> We have to get them out of there. We have to get everyone out.<eos> How do we do that?<eos> Wow.<eos> Pulling a fire alarm on mischief night is one thing.<eos> Doing it when there's a mass murderer spotted nearby is insane!<eos> If I was four years younger, I'd punch you.<eos> What?<eos> Coach, that doesn't make sense.<eos> Oh, well, it does to me!
I just saw you two talking.<eos> And you left the bug together on Saturday.<eos> Where did you go?<eos> Okay, he asked me to give him a ride to Edendale, and I felt bad for him, so...<eos> Look, if you don't want me to hang out with him, I won't.<eos> I know that you really like him.<eos> A momentary lapse in judgment<eos> I can only attribute to a hormonal shift and/or... sheer boredom.<eos> But if you wanted to get with Drake, then...<eos> I don't.
Fine.<eos> All you ever do is push me away and act like I don't exist, so, really, it's not that big of a deal.<eos> Do you think that's what I want?<eos> Do you think it doesn't kill me every time I have to walk away from you?<eos> Then why?<eos> I told you.<eos> I have been telling you.<eos> It's to keep you safe.<eos> And I told you, I don't need protecting.<eos> Yes, you do.
This is a dangerous man.<eos> High Priest, Nicodemus is here to see you.<eos> Caiaphas.<eos> Nicodemus.<eos> I've had reports of a young prophet, a Jesus of Nazareth.<eos> He has a big following in Galilee.<eos> It's rumored he'll come to Jerusalem.<eos> Galilee?<eos> He works miracles.<eos> They all do.
And he asked for you?<eos> Interesting... Says he couldn't trust anyone else.<eos> Anyway, look, I just wanted to say, um... I know we have our ups and downs, but, er...<eos> I really am jolly fond of you.<eos> Are you drunk?<eos> And we make a good team, don't we, you... you silly package?<eos> Are you dying?<eos> Christ, am I dying?<eos> ! Good God, woman! I just wanted to talk to you, tell you how I felt.<eos> Well, don't!
You went to Olsen.<eos> I pointed out to him what I had seen and suggested that I could be useful to this operation.<eos> That man I killed-- you ID the body?<eos> Nope. No match on prints, dental or DNA. The guy was a ghost.<eos> Felt like Special Forces, though-- guy was tough.<eos> But you were tougher.<eos> Yes, ma'am, in that moment, I was.<eos> Tough and useful, and yet 26 kids go missing on your watch.<eos> You still think I'm in on it.<eos> No, I don't.
Tell him your put-down, Abe. Tell him your put-down.<eos> Well, I was just telling Ed here that your game reminds me of a case of trichomoniasis in an otherwise healthy vagina.<eos> (Both laugh) - I had to agree!<eos> - It's true!<eos> You guys are both hilarious and a pleasure to park near.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Ah!<eos> You're so hot.<eos> Mmm, so are you. You want to get dirty?<eos> Yes, I do.
Oh, God. Did we have a meeting today?<eos> I'm so sorry. I've just been totally scattered lately.<eos> [Chuckling] No, no. I'm just here to get a few signatures to close the deal.<eos> The deal?<eos> [Sighs] Let me guess. You never talked to Harry.<eos> No.<eos> Wait. Are you saying that he accepted an offer without telling me?<eos> I had no idea.<eos> I assumed he told you.<eos> Mm, no. He didn't.
I mean, you gave her her first piano.<eos> Given what happened last week... that freaked Reagan out.<eos> Look, Reagan just isn't ready to lift the ban on you and Esme seeing each other.<eos> No, I, uh...<eos> I totally understand.<eos> I do.<eos> So, just give Esme a hug for me, will you?<eos> And tell her, um...<eos> Well, you know what to say.<eos> I do.
Ooh, look at this.<eos> Apple pie.<eos> This is my favorite.<eos> Ruby doesn't eat sweets 'cause she's diabetic, but I'm certainly gonna enjoy this.<eos> Where's pops?<eos> I want Catherine to meet him.<eos> Uh, he's, uh, watching TV.<eos> Pops! Pops, come on, man!<eos> - You didn't tell me she's diabetic.<eos> - I did.
Oh, stop.<eos> You're... you're too kind.<eos> I'm the lucky one.<eos> He's a...<eos> He's a catch.<eos> - Yes. He is.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, I do hope you are as crazy about him as he is about you.<eos> My son deserves a wife who thinks he is the sun, the moon, and the stars.<eos> Yes, he does.
You know that?<eos> I gave your mother this necklace the morning you were born.<eos> The hearts are you and me and Joshua... strung on the same chain of gold.<eos> And whether or not you ever speak to me again... That chain will never be broken.<eos> Kitty, you look... you just...<eos> You're so much like your mother.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I'm nothing like her.<eos> Why do you give your father so much power over you?<eos> I don't.
- Yeah.<eos> His name's Wade...<eos> Wade Jordan.<eos> - Wade Jordan, did you say?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Gee, that rings a bell.<eos> - You know him?<eos> Did he used to work with Herbie Hancock?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he did.
"No obligations.<eos> No strings."<eos> - Yeah, your motto.<eos> - Your words.<eos> I take them at face value, which I assume is what you want.<eos> Well, it's what you want, isn't it?<eos> I'm open.<eos> You want to talk about this?<eos> Sure.<eos> If you do.
You're beautiful, smart, you have a lot to offer.<eos> Why throw yourself at someone who doesn't care about you?<eos> Do you think Catherine cares about you?<eos> We're engaged.<eos> She'll never go through with it.<eos> She doesn't love you, and you know that in your heart.<eos> Step aside.<eos> Look, you want her to be someone she's not just like I want to believe that you could love me.<eos> We have the same problem, you and I.<eos> We do.
I am just thrilled to have this in my restaurant.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Delilah, will you please decant this?<eos> Mais, bien sûr.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> All right, okay, how we looking?<eos> - We good?<eos> - Great.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?
Whoo, and that mule tossed me like a baseball on Sunday.<eos> Yes, sir. Happy day.<eos> Ain't none left.<eos> Tie that boot.<eos> Work it up.<eos> Work it up. Work it up.<eos> Work it up. - Let's go, now!<eos> You ate oysters.<eos> Says who?<eos> Did you?
And that's taking the virus longer to break the SODRAs down.<eos> But it still does in the end.<eos> I've taken this as far as I can in culture.<eos> I need to see how it reacts in living tissue.<eos> I can start animal studies to test efficacy and safety right away.<eos> - We could have results in 24 hours.<eos> - I'd like to bring my veterinary pathologist, Doreen Boyle, up to speed on this.<eos> I think she could be a big help. - Alan, this is progress.<eos> - It has to work in the rats first.<eos> - And if it does?
I really need you to answer these questions, Mr. Conner...<eos> - Yeah but he's alive, right?<eos> - I didn't mean to do that.<eos> Do you have asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure...<eos> - No, no.<eos> Ah! Was it your machete, Mr. Conner?<eos> - What, no, no, this is so...<eos> - Heart trouble?<eos> Liver... Do I look like a guy who would carry a machete?<eos> - Hey, he didn't do anything!
It was either him or me or you. Don't forget that.<eos> We are the righteous ones in this situation.<eos> You have to stop saying that.<eos> - Dad's coming down.<eos> Mel just talked to him.<eos> - I went to school, you know.<eos> - To be a stripper?<eos> - Reflexology actually.<eos> - Did Brian tell you I was in the ER?<eos> - Of course he did.
Check in her bag if she's got a prescription or anything.<eos> Maybe she's diabetic.<eos> I got an auntie in Tallahassee who's a diabetic.<eos> - She could be in insulin shock.<eos> - No, you gotta give her sugar.<eos> - Bleeding sugar.<eos> - Just, like, candy or gum<eos> - or something, anything.<eos> - Here, sugar. - She's trying to say something.<eos> - What do I do? What do I do?
That the way they do it in prison? Yeah.<eos> Fight like a fucking man, ya lepre-coon.<eos> Fight like a man, huh? Fight like a man?<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> - Oh, my goodness. - Come on!<eos> Stop it, stop it! Just stop it!<eos> I'm tired of this. I'm sick of it.<eos> Don't any of you have families at all that you're worried about?<eos> Well, if you don't, I do.
When was the last time you had a drink?<eos> Like five minutes ago.<eos> What about your 53 days?<eos> It's more like 40.<eos> I might've been stretching the truth a little.<eos> Besides, I've got a system.<eos> No, systems don't work. Okay?<eos> Trust me.<eos> I've seen them all.<eos> This one does.
Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> - How is he?<eos> - Well, I don't know.<eos> They, took him to the hospital for an MRI and some other tests.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I can call you if there's news.<eos> That's if you want to know.<eos> I do.
I want to know what happened at the Quintana House.<eos> It was a freak thing.<eos> She had a stroke.<eos> The money wasn't supposed to be there.<eos> Well, um, like I told you, we had a delay.<eos> We understood you, would be able to handle the volume.<eos> And we can.<eos> Then why didn't you?<eos> That will not happen again.<eos> But it did.
What are you doing?<eos> Foreplay?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Is this weird?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe you should go.<eos> I can't.<eos> She's your mother.<eos> I mean, what if this guy saw her?<eos> No, he didn't.
No, we were.<eos> When I lost my first wife, it didn't add up.<eos> Who dies of breast cancer at 31?<eos> I wanted to sue, doctors, the hospital, everyone.<eos> I thought they were hiding something.<eos> No.<eos> Grief demands an answer, but sometimes there isn't one.<eos> Her life couldn't be saved.<eos> Period.<eos> What do I do?
- It ain't no joke.<eos> What used to wake me up?<eos> Gunshots.<eos> Now you know what does?<eos> People fucking.<eos> Moaning and screaming like goddamn cats in the alley.<eos> You know what they say,<eos> "When you get hot and sweaty, it make you ripe and ready."<eos> I drank too much.<eos> We both did.
Thank you so much.<eos> Pied Piper is a proprietary site that lets you find out if your music is infringing on any existing copyrights.<eos> So, imagine you were a song writer, ok?<eos> I don't think I could write a song.<eos> Yeah, no, just imagine if you were.<eos> I don't even think I could say, "Pied Piper is a proprietary site."<eos> Well, I just did but it wasn't easy.<eos> Crunching all those songs to find matches sounds like it would take incredible processing power.<eos> - I mean... - Yes.<eos> Yes, it does.
If he wants it, be my guest.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're a peach.<eos> No!<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I love Zoe.<eos> You think you can just throw me away for some junior varsity mall rat?<eos> I made you, Kyle, not her.<eos> You owe me.<eos> No, he doesn't.
I'm insisting.<eos> You want to be burned at the stake?<eos> Again?<eos> Want has nothing to do with it.<eos> At the start of your glorious reign, the last thing you need is an ABSCAM or Watergate.<eos> I killed, and I must pay for it.<eos> Now, before word leaks, and you are tainted by my hubris and actions, however deserved.<eos> Myrtle, stop talking.<eos> I didn't hear this.<eos> I didn't.
- Run, Debra! Run!<eos> - Stay here!<eos> I'm not staying here.<eos> - Oh, my gosh. - N.Y.P.D.!<eos> - I got her!<eos> - Oh, no, you don't!<eos> Debra! We're trying to help!<eos> Roosevelt Island side. I need officers there now!<eos> - My balls!<eos> How you doing, Debra?
She looks up to my kid, not the other way around.<eos> Thank you for the latte.<eos> Really hit the spot.<eos> We'll give you a moment.<eos> I said a lot of things when we were fighting that I... I shouldn't have said.<eos> And I want you to know that...<eos> I-I don't regret everything.<eos> I did love you.<eos> We had some good times, right?<eos> [Chuckles] Yeah, we did.
Do you?<eos> Of course not!<eos> But the last time he called me, I told him I needed a way to contact him in case of an emergency, and he told me he would send me something.<eos> Like, what kind of something?<eos> Phone number, an e-mail address.<eos> Whatever it is and whenever it comes, the FBI knows about it, and they want it.<eos> You know what? Screw the FBI. You don't owe them anything.<eos> Right?<eos> ! Yeah.<eos> Well, actually, uh... you kind of do.
I have to go now.<eos> Is Lucy... ?<eos> Lucy's in Tahoe for the week.<eos> So, agent Gordon's gonna be here in an hour, so are you cool if he just sets up camp? Yep.<eos> He can set up wherever he wants. I don't care.<eos> Okay. I was kind of hoping we could talk before he...<eos> There is nothing for us to talk about, Daniel.<eos> I just want this whole thing over.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
My life flashed before my eyes, and it wasn't my life before Harry, and it wasn't my life after Harry.<eos> It was my life with Harry.<eos> Should I tell him?<eos> - What for?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> Maybe just to validate what he said to me?<eos> Just to test the waters to see if there's anything left there between you?<eos> [Sighs] Don't go opening that door unless you plan to walk through.<eos> You guys did an incredible job last night.<eos> You did yourselves proud. Well done.
Just like the Red Hawks.<eos> And like the Red Hawks, they hate race-mixing.<eos> If they thought that you and I were together, they would kill you.<eos> Just to send a message.<eos> All I wanted was to protect you from this.<eos> All of it.<eos> No.<eos> I needed to hear this.<eos> I wanted to know all this time why you kept pushing me away.<eos> Now I do.
Is that the case here?<eos> Not that I'm aware.<eos> So?<eos> My hands are tied, Jim.<eos> My client wants his day in court.<eos> No, he wants another week in the press.<eos> He knows public sympathy is building.<eos> Don't let him do it, Jim.<eos> He has no grounds.<eos> I do.
The prosecution certainly will.<eos> All part of the performance;<eos> it's just not my performance you're watching. You'll be found guilty and given the federal death penalty.<eos> I'm trying to save your life.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> My name... is Bedelia Du Maurier.<eos> You're Hannibal Lecter's therapist.<eos> What's that like?<eos> I've heard so much about you, I feel I almost know you.<eos> - You don't.
My testimony is based on my professional--<eos> - You are smitten with the accused, Miss Bloom,<eos> And it is adorable, but not our brand of defense.<eos> And Ms. Vega will smell it on you like you stepped in Young Adult and tracked it into the courtroom.<eos> Were you and Will Graham involved romantically?<eos> I have no romantic feelings for Will Graham. I have a professional curiosity.<eos> I like that. "Professional curiosity."<eos> It seems so... heh, it seems so indifferent.<eos> Unless you look like you're lying when you say it.<eos> But you didn't.
So, you discount the encephalitis he was suffering as a cause?<eos> He managed his illness with the help of his neurologist, whom he murdered for his trouble.<eos> Is Will Graham an intelligent psychopath?<eos> There is not yet a name for whatever Will Graham is.<eos> He kills methodically, and I believe would kill again, given the opportunity.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Chilton.<eos> Your witness.<eos> Dr. Chilton, Will Graham spent his time catching murderers for the FBI.<eos> You don't see a contradiction between that and your description of a coldblooded killer?<eos> No, I do not.
This is a far more practical use for those limbs.<eos> Hard to have anything, isn't it, Dr. Lecter?<eos> Rare to get it, hard to keep it.<eos> A damn slippery life.<eos> You were determined to know the Chesapeake Ripper, Dr. Gideon.<eos> Now is your opportunity.<eos> You intend me to be my own last supper?<eos> Yes.<eos> How does one politely refuse a dish in circumstances such as these?<eos> One doesn't.
And when they do, I'm dead.<eos> What did you do?<eos> I shot him.<eos> I shot Jaha.<eos> What?<eos> I found out they were sending you to Earth.<eos> I couldn't let you go alone.<eos> Someone came to me with a deal, do this.<eos> Kill him, and they'd get me on the dropship.<eos> And I did it.
I've learned to adapt.<eos> None of this changes the way I feel about you.<eos> It wouldn't work, Hank.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Why don't you give me a chance to prove you wrong?<eos> We'll take it slow, see what happens.<eos> You are such a special man.<eos> But I can't.<eos> Zuri, I don't have a problem with it.<eos> But I do.
What will you do to him?<eos> He trusts you, Janice.<eos> To save your daughter's life, You will poison him.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Sharlene is Amber's best friend.<eos> She's going to be staying with us until your people let her mother go.<eos> I know that you're alone and you won't talk to me about it.<eos> You should tell your partner, she is your daughter.<eos> Your sister... You don't trust her, do you?<eos> No, I don't.
I know that you're alone and you won't talk to me about it.<eos> You should tell your partner, she is your daughter.<eos> Your sister... You don't trust her, do you?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> That's why her FBI handlers are staying close.<eos> Can I ask why you don't trust her? No.<eos> She do something to you?<eos> "No," as in my personal life has nothing to do with this investigation.<eos> Your life includes your sister and your niece. So maybe it does.<eos> It doesn't.
And I had to keep my company clean of it.<eos> Jonas was connected to it so I severed that relationship.<eos> Severed... The relationship with Jonas.<eos> Does your husband know you're screwing him?<eos> No, my husband doesn't know.<eos> To protect yourself, to jeopardize Amber.<eos> Of everything you've ever done, of all the things you've taken, this is the worst.<eos> Susie, I didn't know about this until yesterday.<eos> And what were you planning on doing about it?<eos> I did something about it.
I think Cinderella was in the wrong part of town.<eos> Aw, no way, forget it.<eos> What the...?<eos> Thanks a lot, fellas.<eos> Hey, Boys Town is that way.<eos> Take it easy. Whoa.<eos> You got a minute?<eos> Hope you can do better than that.<eos> Just want to talk.<eos> The older ones always do.
Deeks and Granger just caught a Durendell Securities employee breaking into Robert Brown's house.<eos> All right, tell them to sit tight, we'll be right there.<eos> And send Nell over to babysit till we get back, all right?<eos> Got it.<eos> One of these guys better be a lawyer, or you're all screwed.<eos> Told him I used to be a public defender, but for some reason, he declined my services.<eos> Hmm. That's funny.<eos> He's pretty feisty for a guy who could be looking at jail time for war crimes.<eos> You're gonna have to do a whole lot better than that.<eos> Actually, we don't.
All right, uh...<eos> Sure, right through... there is the bathroom.<eos> Wow, okay. A little help here.<eos> Okay, let's get you a cane, maybe get you some crutches.<eos> I would settle for a shot of tequila.<eos> Definitely looks like an RPG attack.<eos> Who was onboard?<eos> Special Forces.<eos> Hard to believe anybody could've survived this.<eos> Yeah, they didn't.
You'd rather protect a terrorist who took American lives?<eos> To get to the truth, you sometimes have to dance with the Devil.<eos> Sounds like a pretty good way to get burned, huh?<eos> Only if you're afraid of the heat.<eos> Anything for a story, right?<eos> Including selling your soul.<eos> I have a right to protect my sources.<eos> You also have the right to remain silent.<eos> The California Shield Law protects journalists who want to keep their sources confidential.<eos> And the Patriot Act doesn't.
I could go for several.<eos> Several? Such a lady.<eos> Lady is thirsty.<eos> I was thinking you're more of like a...<eos> They're quite a team, Henrietta.<eos> They're my '27 Yankees.<eos> Doesn't get any easier, does it?<eos> Sending them out each time, never knowing if they'll come back.<eos> They always come back, Owen.<eos> Until one day they don't.
There's no one here to stop you.<eos> How's it progressing, love?<eos> It isn't.<eos> What's the issue?<eos> The issue is that Miss Brownlee's Finishing School never taught me the French words for coagulate or duodenum or infarction.<eos> It's all very technical.<eos> I was taught to serve tea cakes.<eos> If you needed assistance deciphering a restaurant menu, then I'd be your girl.<eos> Everett, I tried.<eos> No, no, no, yeah, you did.
We can't do this without anaesthesia.<eos> Otherwise, the pain will...<eos> Well, at least he won't feel it.<eos> Here. Hold this.<eos> I'm in a hospital?<eos> I wish you were in a hospital.<eos> Got it.<eos> Relax.<eos> I just thought this room might make you feel better, Gabriel.<eos> It doesn't.
the... the key code for the blur.<eos> Now you should be able to use the code to try... It's working.<eos> Weatherly.<eos> All this time, it was right in front of me, and I never saw it.<eos> No one saw it.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I spoke to him this morning after they found Tetazoo.<eos> Did he tell you where he was going?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He did.
You've got a loyal fellow there, Mr. Lowe.<eos> Treat him well.<eos> I must express my gratitude for your intervention.<eos> They do say the true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him no good.<eos> They do.<eos> However, in this case, the observation wants for accuracy, since apparently I'm in a position to do you a great deal of good.<eos> Indeed, but not for long.<eos> My lady Selima believes it would be quicker to torture from you what we need.<eos> So I understand.<eos> I, myself, do not.
You were ripped from my arms as a baby.<eos> It's completely different.<eos> Not for a child without a mother.<eos> You know, all this guilt is really taking all the fun out of this mother-daughter outing.<eos> I'm sorry Tyler bit you, but you're not going to die.<eos> Did you ask Klaus for his blood?<eos> Oh, my, you really are delirious.<eos> Nadia, he would love nothing more than to watch my daughter die.<eos> And you don't want to risk being outed.<eos> No, I don't.
No, I want to stay with Stefan.<eos> Very well.<eos> Best of luck.<eos> Wait, you said that you weren't gonna hurt him.<eos> No, I said I'd try not to hurt him.<eos> We need his blood for the spell.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Tessa didn't need my blood when she linked me to Silas.<eos> Good for her.<eos> We do.
Again.<eos> Because I love you.<eos> Then stop loving me.<eos> I can't!<eos> Well, that's the problem.<eos> We don't work!<eos> I know.<eos> Then we agree.<eos> This has to end.<eos> It just did.
Who the hell are you?<eos> I'm the one who gets people to do things they don't want to do.<eos> I killed Aaron Whitmore. You did not kill Aaron Whitmore.<eos> I did.<eos> I thought you broke my heart, so I rip open Aaron's neck.<eos> That is how much control you have over me.<eos> And I'm still here.<eos> That's how much control you have over me.<eos> This has to end.<eos> It just did.
- Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Want me to hold your metal detector?<eos> - No, it's all right.<eos> - Sure?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - You don't trust me with your baby, do ya?<eos> - No.<eos> - I lend you my baby.<eos> - Certainly don't.
Yeah.<eos> No answer.<eos> This operation, we still go?<eos> And if they ask me to do something in the middle?<eos> What if they do?<eos> What if they ask you to do something today? You choose your job or your daughter?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Come on, Dunn.<eos> She's your daughter.<eos> - What do you do?
For two years.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> No. It's no big deal.<eos> I just wanted to know.<eos> What about my school?<eos> My friends?<eos> I remember when I was your age, and I know that it's tough now...<eos> I don't need a new beginning!<eos> Honey, we both do.
Yeah.<eos> Okay, so, Natalie was murdered trying to flee to one of three places that do not have extradition treaties with the U.S.<eos> What's your feeling on the senator?<eos> Any chance she's behind this?<eos> Pretty cold to kill your kid, even if she was about to leak top-secret intel.<eos> Well, unless your kid's a female Edward Snowden.<eos> I don't care how powerful she is.<eos> If she did it, we're gonna get her.<eos> Did we check if the boyfriend hopped on a plane?<eos> Oh, yeah. He didn't.
You don't like it?<eos> Ah! I think it's beautiful.<eos> I'm just... wow.<eos> What do you say if, we officially christen the place?<eos> Do you mean carrying me over the threshold?<eos> You're gonna do something, do it right.<eos> Really?<eos> Don't drop me.<eos> I've always wanted to live in a Brownstone.<eos> - And now you do. - And now I do.
Just go online and pick a time.<eos> Lauren?<eos> I'm Al.<eos> - How did I do?<eos> - Fine.<eos> But you know, you could stop smiling.<eos> Smiling?<eos> I'm working.<eos> I've always wanted to live in a Brownstone.<eos> - And now you do.
And all I could say was, "nope."<eos> So, had you rung up a tad earlier, mama might have survived.<eos> The doctor said she died of a broken heart.<eos> Actually, I said coronary artery disease.<eos> Funeral is Sunday.<eos> Meanwhile, George was processing his own loss.<eos> - So, that's it?<eos> - That's it.<eos> But I thought you liked Nora.<eos> I do, just not in that way.
She killed her mama three times.<eos> And, Lord, if she would have seen this little bald girl marching into her Christian home!<eos> Bald girl?<eos> I'm, like... I'm, like, wearing 14 pounds of human hair.<eos> Would have killed her again.<eos> Oh, where are my manners?<eos> Would either of you homicidal maniacs like a sweet tea?<eos> Sweet tea?<eos> I want to switch.<eos> - No, you don't.

At the bumper cars for a while, then we went home.<eos> - What time was it?<eos> - Midnight.<eos> - I know because we had to go.<eos> - Where did you leave them?<eos> On the road.<eos> At the edge of town.<eos> - Did they have boyfriends? - No.<eos> Is it true they wanted to leave town?<eos> - Who doesn't?
- I'm not hungry.<eos> The girls' autopsy just came.<eos> Estrella's pantyhose had semen on them.<eos> Blood type AB.<eos> I talked to Miguel.<eos> I asked him for a list of all the Dyane 6's in the area.<eos> When did you talk to him?<eos> - Early.<eos> - You never sleep?<eos> - Sure I do.
Actually, according to this piece of paper, it's our house now.<eos> Hey.<eos> You got any idea what that thing is worth?<eos> What, like... 100 bucks?<eos> That's a third-model Colt Dragoon used by Confederate General William Mahone.<eos> So more than $100?<eos> Probably more than your annual salary.<eos> Though I have a car stereo probably costs more than you make, so that ain't sayin' much.<eos> That's a lot of money for a gun that probably doesn't shoot.<eos> The hell it doesn't.
Now, did you hear from the Canadians regarding the shipment?<eos> Just that we're still on track for delivery in two days.<eos> Well, for $900,000, I want more than an ETA.<eos> Well, if you boys are looking for a drink, you've come to the wrong bar.<eos> Oh, we're not thirsty, Boyd.<eos> Well, we don't sell doughnuts.<eos> So why don't you take your fat asses out of here?<eos> What, she supposed to mean something to me?<eos> Oh, you don't know her?<eos> No. I don't.
All right.<eos> Whatever, man.<eos> Come on, Loretta.<eos> Loretta, let's go.<eos> Your call.<eos> Well, thanks for the ride.<eos> You lied to him, didn't you?<eos> Moved the money and didn't tell him. I'm not a total moron.<eos> Even though you knew it might get him killed.<eos> It didn't.
Ma'am, I swear to God, we all thought he was gonna just eat some shrimp, rattle off a few platitudes, go home, watch Full Meta! Jacket for the millionth time and fall asleep.<eos> Kelly, tell Mike to climb off his wife and get on the speakerphone, now.<eos> Do you know what this is?<eos> Let me explain something to you.<eos> This is POTUS trying to screw me, okay?<eos> This is the unflushable turd that is left in the can for the next person, e.g. me.<eos> The toilet's still broken, FYI.<eos> Has POTUS gone nuts?<eos> We can't have a crazy president.<eos> In Italy they do.
Ripped By mstoll<eos> Is this the last one, Leash?<eos> I cannot walk another step with my Louboutin heels.<eos> Yeah, Louboutin. Right.<eos> And who wears fake heels at breakfast time?<eos> - Dee do.
- How so?<eos> You're with us now, but you ain't soon?<eos> Yep.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> Just looking for the right place is all.<eos> Oh, we ain't good enough for you, huh?<eos> Some of you ain't exactly friendly.<eos> You ain't so friendly yourself.<eos> You know you need a group out here.<eos> - Maybe I don't.
Tara, this is Maggie.<eos> He's a big fan of yours.<eos> I met Tara on the road.<eos> Couldn't have made it here without her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> When she heard what I was doing, she said she had to help me.<eos> She's just that kind of person.<eos> What's up?<eos> He just said that he knows what caused the outbreak.<eos> He does.
Drake stopped by my pod.<eos> He sounded strange, like he was saying good-bye.<eos> What's your point?<eos> I don't know what it is that you're ordering him to do, but I am asking you, please, release him.<eos> You are demanding a lot of me today.<eos> I know,<eos> I'm in your debt.<eos> I will give you what you ask if you can affect the release of Prisoner 337 from the Crate.<eos> What would make you think that I could arrange something like that?<eos> I don't.
I come from a big family, and I don't know what I would do without my brothers and sisters.<eos> How about you?<eos> Oh, my older brother died.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'd do anything not to "know what I'd do without" him.<eos> I understand.<eos> That's why I need Thomas's help.<eos> There are people whose families have been ripped open.<eos> Victims that he could help. I understand.<eos> I really do.
That's right.<eos> Thank you for coming to All Hallows Mass.<eos> How nice to see so many of you haven't been caught up in the silly old pagan rituals of halloween.<eos> Not that there's anything wrong with paganism, of course.<eos> Anyway, we'll have a reading now, from the Colossians.<eos> - What's she doing?<eos> - Oh God.<eos> I think it's protest reading.<eos> Protesting about what?<eos> Doing the reading.
I'm versatile.<eos> Is that a surplus bowl of Coco Pops?<eos> Someone seems to think Coco Pops and Readybix are the same thing!<eos> - Oh, Jesus.<eos> - Eejit.<eos> Oh, Martin, before you eat will you go and grab Delma's dress?<eos> I'm happy-go-lucky, right, Sean?<eos> Hey, you're the happiest and the go-luckiest, buddy.<eos> Don't worry about Majella, you know what women are like.<eos> Do I!

I always thought it would be Larry, but I think it's time to re-imagine.<eos> This stupid fucking holiday.<eos> Listen, if you want, I can help you forget what day it is.<eos> You know, or your name, for that matter.<eos> You know, no.<eos> I am not interested in being a prize, albeit a shockingly-undervalued one, in your little sex game.<eos> Fine.<eos> I lost my manipulative, gorgeous, psychopath ex and my sweet, kind, unfocused fiancé.<eos> I don't have a home anymore.<eos> Yeah, Chapman, you do.
[Rock music playing]<eos> I found this in your trash.<eos> And this is...<eos> The guy you always talking about?<eos> Yeah, I know something about loving people who aren't smart enough to wanna be loved back.<eos> But I learned a secret that I can tell you.<eos> They don't deserve it.<eos> He's ruined this day for me forever.<eos> Nobody knows that we're not together.<eos> Yeah, but you do.
It's cute.<eos> - Hey!<eos> I'm next!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Me, too.<eos> You know, I gotta see this shit!<eos> Yo! Back up!<eos> Nichols! What the fuck? Why you pickin' all the peaches?<eos> - I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Oh, doesn't apply to me.<eos> I'm the group facilitator. No... no, you're not.<eos> - I'm not?<eos> - No.<eos> With that being said, I want this place to be a place where you all feel free to talk within the given guidelines.<eos> Tell you what... let's switch.<eos> - Here, you take the stick.<eos> - No. - Come on.<eos> - I... I don't got nothing to say.<eos> Sure you do.
Well, how would you rate your state of mind today?<eos> A four?<eos> You having any angry thoughts?<eos> They coming up regularly for you?<eos> Are you having angry thoughts that are coming up regularly?<eos> That's projection.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> You have any idea what I do for a living?<eos> What my job is?<eos> Of course I do.
Nicky.<eos> Do you think people can change?<eos> All right.<eos> I need you to take this from me, 'cause I'm gonna do it.<eos> And I really, really don't want to.<eos> Who gave that to you?<eos> Taystee.<eos> It came from Vee.<eos> I'm so sorry, Red. I let you down.<eos> - No, you didn't.
They can leave their weapons, too.<eos> Thank you for the early release.<eos> Thought about taking off, but I'm...<eos> Curious.<eos> Who would break a stranger out of prison?<eos> Someone who wishes to hire you for a job.<eos> I need you to help men retrieve a certain item.<eos> This is the item.<eos> You know it, yes?<eos> Yes, I do.
Thea.<eos> Hmm.<eos> She reminded me that I still owe this city.<eos> And I want to be remembered as something more than Malcolm Merlyn's pawn.<eos> As you should.<eos> But you know there was another reason for my reticence.<eos> You're afraid the people will learn that Robert wasn't her biological father.<eos> I managed to get through a criminal trial without the truth coming out, but political campaigns tend to be a bit more adept at extracting skeletons from closets.<eos> But no one else knows.<eos> Someone does.
You can't.<eos> I--I got to go.<eos> Roy!<eos> You haven't said much.<eos> Are you working on your lecture?<eos> No lecture.<eos> I suppose you think I was wrong about Sebastian, too, though.<eos> [Exhales] I think... that you have everyone fooled, because you want people to think that none of this gets to you.<eos> And that you don't need anyone's help.<eos> I don't!
Look at you.<eos> You're ok, baby.<eos> Because Starling City is our city.<eos> And starting today, we're going to take it back.<eos> I know we need to talk.<eos> You need to listen.<eos> For the past year, I have stood by your side...<eos> And I have fought, because I wanted to believe that you weren't this... Monster.<eos> And I needed to believe that I still had a mother.<eos> You do, Oliver--
That's the devil your father should be speaking of.<eos> Sex, pleasure, immodesty, us here now, this is no sin.<eos> Will you be there on Judgment Day to make my case, then?<eos> God's not watching.<eos> He's too busy not saving sick children and letting people starve.<eos> But if He does exist, He's the one that should be doing the atoning, not you.<eos> Don't say things like that.<eos> You're here with me now.<eos> Do you want to be or not?<eos> I do.
Tomorrow we're gonna find the son of a bitch that did this.<eos> But we're gonna do it together.<eos> Hi.<eos> Ada Chapel looking for Officer Lopez's room.<eos> You can find him over there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> It's the third officer-related shooting since you formed your new gang task force.<eos> My boss has a few questions for Lopez.<eos> Well, not now, he doesn't.
To turn money away.<eos> This bank isn't for the one percent.<eos> It's for the community.<eos> People who need security.<eos> Okay?<eos> This minimizes risk, and allows them to trust us.<eos> Sounds like a frickin' waste to me.<eos> What good is a bank if we're not gonna be laundering our money with it?<eos> Look, everything doesn't revolve around you, Carlos, okay?<eos> Yes, it does.
You going to brew it or screw it?<eos> Her name is Jasmine and she likes to take it slow.<eos> Check it out.<eos> Would you look who's standing in our office?<eos> Oh, no way.<eos> I can't believe it's that guy!<eos> - You have no idea who that is, do you?<eos> - Yes, I do.
And another one the next morning, the same evening Infeld activated his malware to siphon funds from the client retainer accounts.<eos> With as much detail as you can provide...<eos> Check out the decanter of scotch behind Karp.<eos> It's full.<eos> Look at another depo the next morning at 10:40 A.M.<eos> Now, do you recall, in detail, the conversation...<eos> Check out the decanter now.<eos> Nearly empty.<eos> Karp's wearing the same suit, so he never went home.<eos> But Rachel King did.
No, there isn't.<eos> I tried to explain it to my father and he just scoffs.<eos> He wants me to join his practice at Columbia.<eos> But why would I do that when I could be watching the man invent the future right in front of me?<eos> To work so closely with a surgeon of his genius,<eos> - it's...<eos> - Intoxicating?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It means a lot to me that you understand.<eos> I do.
It's back there.<eos> Do not go down there!<eos> You're not allowed!<eos> No.<eos> Get out!<eos> What's in there?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You need to leave.<eos> You have no right to be in here.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Dead bodies, just a bonus.<eos> Look.<eos> How was your water last night?<eos> I didn't force you to drink so much vodka or to make out with that poster of "The Most Interesting Man in the World."<eos> No, you didn't, but you did try to sabotage my evaluation.<eos> Which means you were scared I was gonna do better than you.<eos> Which means... someone thinks I'm a good teacher.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Boom!<eos> I do.
He hardly qualifies.<eos> You're right.<eos> And if Whitaker was murdered because of his highly sensitive military work with the Pentagon, I shouldn't know anything about that.<eos> So, I'll happily leave.<eos> Wait.<eos> What did you tell him?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Who told you that he works for the Pentagon?<eos> And consider your answer well.<eos> You did.
This one will not go to sleep.<eos> No, I'm - - I'm sorry.<eos> I got excited.<eos> Look, we can't wage war on whoever bugged your phone -- if you were bugged.<eos> That's just not a service that we provide.<eos> I understand.<eos> We'll start by looking into your phone, and as soon as we know anything, you'll know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And you understand the pricing schedule?<eos> Yep, I do.
Why didn't you tell us that Dan Becker broke into your office?<eos> Because he didn't.<eos> Oh, yes, he did.<eos> And he searched the place until he found your safe.<eos> Uh-huh, and he opened it, and he stole your little black book of names.<eos> Jason, what are they talking about?<eos> Uh, Mr. Kern here has been bribing residents and city officials to keep them from testifying against your company.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> All right, I don't have a black book, and even if I did, how did Becker get into my safe without a combination?<eos> Well, he did.
I am, as I said, in fear for my life.<eos> Think about what you're doing.<eos> These are people I care a lot about.<eos> Yes or no -- a warrant has been issued for my arrest, hasn't it?<eos> How did you know about that?<eos> So one has.<eos> I call that an execution order, a license to shoot me down in the street like a dog.<eos> So I'm here to prove my innocence beyond any shadow of a doubt.<eos> Do you have any knowledge as to what's happened to Grace Van Pelt?<eos> I don't.
Come on, darling, let's get you inside. Get you something warm.<eos> Okay. Thanks.<eos> Okay, now, mind those steps, 'cause those are slippery.<eos> Hey, shut the door behind you. Don't let the heat out.<eos> Phone's in the bedroom. I'll go get it.<eos> No electricity, huh?<eos> Oh, Lord. Bless your heart.<eos> No. The poles don't come out this far.<eos> Then how do you have a phone?<eos> I don't.
We do, but nothing's popped. He doesn't seem to have a lot of friends.<eos> He hangs out a lot at a bar on si9xth street.<eos> We could set a tail on him.<eos> Eh, could be waiting for weeks.<eos> Uh, my plan is a little more elaborate, but it's much more entertaining.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> You already have a plan?<eos> Well, as you know, agent Lisbon, the key to a good con is always making the mark feel that he is in control.<eos> I mean, you can lead a man anywhere as long as he thinks that he is driving.<eos> So, how do we do that?
He couldn't express his love to her in words, so he did it a different way -- with a painting.<eos> It's worth maybe $100 million if it ever went to auction.<eos> Mm. You have someone who wants it?<eos> We've got a customer lined up.<eos> How much? $5 million.<eos> 50/50 split.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Now, you've probably got some, uh, cute, little plan to get us in and out, no fuss, no muss, huh?<eos> Well, I do like to keep my muss to a minimum.<eos> I don't do cute.
They released you from the hospital?<eos> I released myself.<eos> This is an active crime scene.<eos> I'm looking for my sister.<eos> We're doing everything we can to find Amy.<eos> But you haven't found her, have you?<eos> Daniela, why'd you come back here?<eos> You told us you didn't know if Amy was even at this house.<eos> I didn't...<eos> But I do now.
Objection.<eos> You said "murder".<eos> Thomas McAllister may have shot and strangled himself.<eos> There are no objections here, Mr. Jane, no judge, just a friendly inquiry.<eos> But I take your point.<eos> Do you recall the day of McAllister's death?<eos> I do -- big day.<eos> I had been chasing the man for eight years.<eos> Any of you know what it's like to be driven by a moral imperative?<eos> You do.
Yeah, but it wasn't like that.<eos> Leanne wasn't a party girl.<eos> I know a lot of girls who get taken all over.<eos> This was professional.<eos> She booked a modeling gig.<eos> And they left four days ago?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Some model scout set it up.<eos> Did you meet this guy -- the model scout?<eos> No, I didn't.
Sure, yeah, I know all about that-- that and the Betamax and the BlackBerry.<eos> I don't understand the reference.<eos> Nobody wants it.<eos> Uh, hydro is supposed to be a sleep aid, but it's crazy powerful-- too powerful.<eos> The half-life's like 100 hours.<eos> - So?<eos> - So, people need to get up in the morning.<eos> - Where can I get it?<eos> - You don't want it.<eos> I do.
What evidence did he have?<eos> I want to know everything.<eos> There's Madeline.<eos> Think she beat us to it?<eos> Stay on task.<eos> We have two minutes to access the security door.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Lizzy, I know this must be very difficult for you, but we can't both lead.<eos> How did you know about Omaha?<eos> I didn't.
How do you know Madeline Pratt?<eos> She called me last month, asked about the effigy.<eos> I'd never met her before, and I don't know how she found me.<eos> So, why'd she call you, then?<eos> Because the effigy of Atargatis once belonged to my father.<eos> He stole it from the British Museum.<eos> He was a patriot who revered Atargatis.<eos> He thought it belonged in Syria.<eos> - Then why put it up for auction?<eos> - He didn't.
Work has been insane and we've had to put so many things off, and I'm not doing it anymore.<eos> I wanna marry this man!<eos> Cheers. Ha-ha-ha.<eos> Now, go get dressed.<eos> And, oh, just make sure he shaves.<eos> I'm not marrying George Michael.<eos> You shouldn't be here. Yeah?<eos> You think I didn't try?<eos> I called you the minute I knew. Yeah.<eos> Lot of good that did.
Slide it.<eos> Slide the gun, now.<eos> No.<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Do it.<eos> Kill her!<eos> Pull the trigger. Do it!<eos> Now!<eos> Pull the trigger.<eos> Do it now. - Don't do it. Tom.
They call Ron "Dad".<eos> This is good.<eos> This is healthy.<eos> I'm creating a connection.<eos> And a diversion.<eos> Run, you idiot!<eos> This way!<eos> Hayley, what did you do?<eos> We have nowhere to go!<eos> Yes, we do.
I put 5 milligrams of something-something in your coffees and we all got an "A."<eos> Done!<eos> I'm a bad person for tracking your location, but you altered my brain chemistry?<eos> I was up for three days that week. I invented an entire language, you fliztbarping gitzgorg.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You messed with my brain.<eos> That's a big deal.<eos> This is a big deal.<eos> I don't mess with your brain, Annie.<eos> - You kind of do.
- Okay, I'll allow it.<eos> - No, it's okay.<eos> We gave it our best shot, no?<eos> I'm sorry, Rachel, is this your home?<eos> Oh, God, no, I'm sorry.<eos> - Well, this is what we're playing.<eos> - But it doesn't make any sense.<eos> Oh!<eos> It sounds like Anthony wants to forfeit.<eos> - He doesn't.
You're not screwing things up, though.<eos> That's good to know. But the problem with me will always be that I can never know for sure.<eos> There's not a huge amount of people in my life that haven't eventually kicked me out, and I don't always see it coming.<eos> I don't want it to happen with you.<eos> Well, don't manipulate me and don't keep secrets from me and we'll probably be okay.<eos> Cool.<eos> It stopped raining.<eos> Yeah, it sure did.<eos> Aww, you hired a stunt person.<eos> No, I did not.
Victim appears not to be breathing.<eos> Like you don't download porn to your phone.<eos> Oh, I try to keep my phone away from my dick.<eos> He always wants to call my ex.<eos> He just fell down like he was having a heart attack!<eos> Is he conscious? No.<eos> He hit his head when he fell. Uh-huh.<eos> Make a hole!<eos> Let's move, move, move. Give him some space. He's been making weird noises.<eos> How you doing, buddy?
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> How you doing? How did you know that that was a food allergy?<eos> Go. - Oh.<eos> Uh, well, the... The swelling in the lips.<eos> And he had this rash.<eos> My dad had food allergies.<eos> He was allergic to shellfish and peanuts and marriage, apparently.<eos> Oh, this is my new partner, Danny.<eos> - How you doing?
Yeah. I can do really little stuff when I want.<eos> But bigger stuff, I can't really tell when it's gonna happen.<eos> - Well, that sucks.<eos> - It's like hiccups.<eos> It starts and then it stops.<eos> And it's usually when I'm mad.<eos> Why do you want to know so bad?<eos> Well, 'cause last I checked we were dead-broke and we don't have a place to stay, so I was thinking maybe your little spooky routine might be able to hustle us up some options.<eos> You want to do something wrong.<eos> - No, I don't.

Is there any way that can be done without Will finding out?<eos> It's not our job to spare people's feelings, you know.<eos> It's not our job to ruin marriages either.<eos> Is there a way of asking that without...<eos> No.<eos> No, there's not, I'm gonna have to ask.<eos> Gives him a motive, doesn't it?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> He might know.<eos> Guys normally do.
Saskia, could Louis have got in here without the grown-ups knowing?<eos> Yeah, there's a back way, behind the old kitchen.<eos> Thanks, love.<eos> Wait.<eos> What you said before about the girl who thinks she can save her dad? Was that you?<eos> -Yes, love.<eos> -And did you?<eos> -Save him?<eos> -No, love, I didn't, because in the end, he didn't want saving.<eos> They never do.
We don't always make a lot of friends.<eos> That's Troy.<eos> Is that Ron?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We spent time together in Iraq.<eos> Most of my employees have some sort of military training.<eos> - And who... who's that?<eos> - Bobby Hammond.<eos> - He work here too?<eos> - He did.
If you look at sunlight through a prism, you'll see its spectrum.<eos> When you magnify the spectrum with a telescope, as Joseph Fraunhofer did, you raise the curtain on the electron dance within the atom.<eos> When the energy of the electron flags, and it drops to a lower orbital, the light wave it emits scatters.<eos> Most of it doesn't reach us.<eos> That leaves a dark gap or black vertical line in the spectrum.<eos> These dark lines are the shadows cast by hydrogen atoms in the atmosphere of the Sun.<eos> Sodium atoms cast different shadows.<eos> Their electrons dance to a different tune.<eos> A grain of table salt is composed of sodium and chlorine atoms.<eos> Ten million billion of them doing their crazy dances in a single grain of salt.
And know that you and your friends are welcome in our kingdom.<eos> If you need anything, we're at your service.<eos> Thank you, but all we need is horses.<eos> We have our own kingdom, our own castle.<eos> Our castle was destroyed in the curse.<eos> Well-played, Your Majesty.<eos> You laid waste to everything.<eos> Not everything.<eos> Her castle still stands.<eos> Of course it does.
I've known this was right since the moment you walked into my furniture shop.<eos> Why do you think your order was ready two weeks early?<eos> Your commitment to excellence?<eos> [ Chuckles ] I couldn't wait to ask you out.<eos> [ Laughs ] It seemed the most non-stalkery way to speed things up.<eos> I do love that end table.<eos> That's a start.<eos> I do love you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
What kind of potion?<eos> Was she gonna hurt us?<eos> A memory potion.<eos> Regina says she's gonna use it to prove that she didn't cast the curse.<eos> Like I'd drink anything she handed me.<eos> Well, somebody will!<eos> And if they remember, we'll know exactly who did this to us.<eos> He's bradycardic!<eos> B.P. dropping fast!<eos> - What did this to him?
How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> Come in.<eos> The lady in the mortuary said you were up here.<eos> Yeah, I'm here.<eos> When you called me, you didn't say anything about staying here.<eos> Well, that wasn't the plan when we talked.<eos> But things changed.<eos> She said you work here.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Admissions.<eos> I'm Yvonne.<eos> What you got there?<eos> Well, I have just discovered an amazing new product, Yvonne.<eos> Cal-O-Metric for weight loss, specially designed for women.<eos> For example, do you know, uh, how it feels when you're still carrying that extra baby weight?<eos> I've had two myself and, darn it, if it isn't hard to fit back into your favourite...<eos> I didn't have a baby.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Um, I did, and...
After all, it is my curse.<eos> Screw your curse.<eos> Everything's ready.<eos> Nobody's ever come back...<eos> Tell me again.<eos> All the clues are in place.<eos> When I return home. They'll guide me back to you, even though I won't remember.<eos> When your crows brought us that gorgeous singer to perform for us, I told her to come find me...<eos> Who? Who told you to come?<eos> You did.
How was my life so great... you know.<eos> Whatever... you're not, thinking I had anything to do with this?<eos> We don't really know what to think at this point, Hank, I mean... it does sound like Tommy was jealous of you.<eos> How did you get all the girls?<eos> Did he mention anything else?<eos> Was that it? Actually, he talked about tonight. The reunion.<eos> I don't know, it was weird, he kept talking about Vicky Lannister.<eos> - The girl who died in 10th grade.<eos> Remember her?<eos> - Yeah, yeah. I do.
But at that point, why does she stil take the jacket?<eos> Like a trophy?<eos> Maybe, maybe.<eos> No, but then... she gives it to Tommy and tells him to get rid of it,<eos> - which he doesn't. - Yeah, I'm thinking, Tommy panicks, decides to keep the jacket close where it won't be found, it won't be traced back to him, it's only later, when his life has turned to crap, that he decides to get his payout, at the reunion.<eos> I'm buying it, except for two things.<eos> I can't put Tommy and Melanie together at that reunion, and I can't out them together at that party 22 years ago.<eos> Ok, so the police report said something about blue paint transfer from the car to Vicky's clothing, right?<eos> Yeah, we check with DMV, neither Tommy nor Melanie had a blue car.<eos> But Melanie's aunt, Laura, did.
It's Logan's show now.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> We need to move up our timeline.<eos> Well, I'm buying shares as fast as I can.<eos> I'm talking about a tender offer.<eos> The plan is shock and awe.<eos> If we rush a tender offer, we won't have enough leverage to force people to vote with us.<eos> It's fine to have shock and awe when you're the only one in the game, but Walter Gillis knows we're coming, and he got himself an ally.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because I do.
I'm your eyes on the inside.<eos> Thank you, Tom.<eos> ? What they do<eos> Do you have feelings for Jake?<eos> That's none of your business.<eos> I know.<eos> ? Back stabbers ?<eos> Long night?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Do you?
Okay, then, we need to cancel it.<eos> I feel sorry for you.<eos> I do.<eos> Candidate's flaming out. Peaked too early.<eos> Money's trickling in.<eos> And this debate could be the nail in your coffin.<eos> I've been there.<eos> If this debate happens, you are going to go to jail.<eos> I-I don't know if we sell copy paper.<eos> Because I just don't, okay?
What's on the schedge for today?<eos> The two of you are to relieve the agents surveilling this target.<eos> You are not to approach the target under any circumstance without my authorization.<eos> Agent Perkins, is everything all right?<eos> This is Maya pope, Olivia's mother.<eos> Will that be a problem for you?<eos> God, I've missed you.<eos> Mmm. 22 years is a long, long time.<eos> Remember when you used to bring me flowers?<eos> I do.
Jake:<eos> Negative. Wait for my go.<eos> - She has a bomb.<eos> - I see that.<eos> I also want to see what she's planning to do with it.<eos> Okay, but shouldn't we...<eos> Stand down, agent Perkins.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Look, I don't want to just sit here doing nothing.<eos> Of course you don't.
I know you think you're on the right side of this, but you're not...<eos> Believe me, you're not.<eos> What I know is that you are a terrorist, a traitor to your own country.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But I'd rather be a traitor than what you are, Livvie.<eos> Cleaning up those people's messes... Fixing up their lives.<eos> You think you're family... But you're nothing but the help.<eos> And you don't even know it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Oh, I do. I do.
- When are you getting here?<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm not going to come.<eos> - My mother blew up the church that's costing you your presidency.<eos> I shouldn't be there.<eos> - How's your father?<eos> - Drugged.<eos> I think he was in pain earlier.<eos> I wish I could be there with you.<eos> No, you don't.
I'm sure somewhere there's a young republican sock hop where you're missed.<eos> Joke's on you.<eos> I'm not wearing any socks today.<eos> I got a blister at practice, and coach told me to let it breathe.<eos> Please stop talking about your feet.<eos> And we're not leaving.<eos> We're the front-runners for homecoming king and queen.<eos> People expect us to make an appearance.<eos> No one here cares about that outdated patriarchal tradition.<eos> Sure they do.
Yeah. Yeah Jane?<eos> Uh huh.<eos> Yeah. Let's go ahead and finish her off.<eos> Security!<eos> Oh my god.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Anna, do you know why I called you in here?<eos> No.<eos> Because I think you know who killed Jane.<eos> I don't.
There.<eos> You're all right.<eos> You're all right.<eos> I've got to go and talk to him.<eos> Tell him the Revenue is on to us.<eos> No, Joss.<eos> You can't.<eos> You know what he might do to you!<eos> Not while I'm still useful to him.<eos> Please don't, Joss.
You're all right.<eos> You're all right.<eos> I've got to go and talk to him.<eos> Tell him the Revenue is on to us.<eos> No, Joss.<eos> You can't.<eos> You know what he might do to you!<eos> Not while I'm still useful to him.<eos> Please don't, Joss.<eos> Please don't.
You're scared of him, then.<eos> Well, if that's what lights your candle.<eos> He has bad dreams.<eos> When you've done in here, fetch some water for the trough.<eos> This here is Mr Davey.<eos> Vicar of Altarnun church.<eos> That's my niece, Mary.<eos> I believe you came to my sermon last week, Mary?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I did.
What is this?<eos> Oh, it's, uh...<eos> Your mom just asked me to do a little, quick rewrite on, uh, the toast for uncle Mort's birthday.<eos> - You mean my toast?<eos> - It just...<eos> It was the tiniest bit... dry.<eos> It just needed some punching up.<eos> I am a celebrated author.<eos> - You don't even know uncle Mort.<eos> - Well, I-I do now.
- Yeah.<eos> - Good-bye, BlueBell.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> (Cheering) Now that is something I have never seen before.<eos> This is quite an unusual town.<eos> (People talking, laughing) Thank you.<eos> Oh, you shouldn't have... hey.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Lavon: I'm so happy you enjoyed the show.<eos> - I did.
- Aw... - That better?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> (Sighs) Sometimes I think I never should have let you go.<eos> Man, Shelby has got a set of pipes on her!<eos> I'm sorry that I've been so crazy.<eos> Hey, for the record, I completely believe in your creative abilities.<eos> It's just that a musical about biology didn't seem like it was gonna get the best reception from the... From the general public.<eos> Just... I need to know that you know that I can do anything.<eos> - I do.
Leave it to your parents to have a moat surrounding their house.<eos> Why are you so hung up on retracing your steps?<eos> I can't shake this feeling that something happened that night, like I... like I lost time.<eos> And it's the last night anyone saw Zoe.<eos> Okay, you got blackout drunk... it happens.<eos> And it's not like you were abducted by aliens.<eos> And someone did see Zoe later:<eos> Drake.<eos> And you believe him?<eos> Yeah, I do.

I hid the flight recorder in here.<eos> So... where is it?<eos> Looking for this?<eos> I heard you were making a big deal about this little thing.<eos> So I plugged into it.<eos> What I saw was very interesting.<eos> I imagine you don't want this landing in the wrong hands.<eos> This is indisputable proof you are every bit the snake we think you are.<eos> Vega, this does not concern you.<eos> Oh, but it does.
Well, that was his mama's fault.<eos> She got back on the pipe, she got all high-strung.<eos> She kicked it again after that, for a while.<eos> - Then Henry got taken.<eos> - And in your mind, is is all Alison's fault?<eos> She took three years away from me, sent my kid to live with strangers.<eos> - Yeah, I blame her.<eos> - She's not your problem, Henry.<eos> She didn't plant drugs in my house, change the course of my life?<eos> Whatever she did, she didn't do it to you.
I told this to Fargo... came by the garage the day it happened.<eos> Brown hair, just under 6 feet, not young, not old.<eos> Had a cut on his forehead, here.<eos> Said he just wanted to take a look at Sam, which he did, then he left.<eos> Look...<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> He was my friend, okay? Sam.<eos> Sure, he was a jerk, but deep down...<eos> All I'm saying is, you're gonna find him, right?<eos> The... the guy who did it.
And then he told me that he loved me.<eos> And I knew...<eos> I just knew that he was talking about Jake.<eos> Well, Gordon...<eos> You've been a busy boy. [Clears throat]<eos> You broke Jake's windshield.<eos> Then you stabbed him.<eos> Then there's this.<eos> Want to tell me why you murdered Jake Daly?<eos> - I didn't.
I'm the reason he's flunking.<eos> That's true.<eos> I start nights tomorrow.<eos> Okay.<eos> You look miles away.<eos> Seven thousand?<eos> That's a joke.<eos> I think I'm gonna go get a glass of water.<eos> You need anything?<eos> Yeah, I do.
The New York Times isn't going to wait for us.<eos> They've already scheduled the cover for October based on our timing...<eos> Then I can't be a part of it.<eos> It's the Galloway nonsense, isn't it?<eos> Claire, come on.<eos> It's okay. You can say so.<eos> We're friends.<eos> It doesn't help.<eos> You don't actually believe I....<eos> No. But enough of the country still does.
Wait...<eos> I wanted to tell him,<eos> I was so excited and then we had a fight, and I didn't want to tell him.<eos> But then... I still...<eos> I tried.<eos> But now I can't and I don't know why.<eos> So don't tell him.<eos> What?<eos> No, yeah. I have to tell him.<eos> No, you don't.
It's not my fault you've got a great ass.<eos> Nice boobs too.<eos> Okay, stop. No. Back.<eos> - Listen, kid. How old are you?<eos> - Eleven.<eos> - What are you, French?<eos> - No.<eos> All right, listen. Spielberg, look at me.<eos> Did you take video of something that happened there last night, huh?<eos> Did you?
Lucho's desperate.<eos> You think we can trust him?<eos> If he's right, we can't afford not to.<eos> We've got 67 people working in the GTF.<eos> They're dealing with LAPD, ICE, FBI, DEA.<eos> That's 400 people that we talk to on a daily basis.<eos> If any one of them is on the take, we gotta find out.<eos> And there's the annual affirmation for the fund.<eos> Great.<eos> How we doing?
Well, don't you think you ought to have known?<eos> What?<eos> Jesus, Cleaver, you're a barrister!<eos> You cross-examine people for a living.<eos> Yet a 15-year-old boy...<eos> I asked him if it was a girl in his class, he said yes, it was.<eos> Did you ask him what her name was?<eos> What difference could that have made?<eos> I don't know the names of anybody in his class.<eos> No, you don't!
Really nice.<eos> Alright, guys, let's take five minutes.<eos> Grab some water, take a break.<eos> Stet.<eos> Stet, we wanted to hear you sing.<eos> I mean, whatever you've been singing in Wooly's class.<eos> How about the Saint Matthew Aria?<eos> Can I sing Pie Jesu?<eos> Pie Jesu? Where'd you learn that?<eos> I just did.
- I won't quit.<eos> Of course you'll quit! You know why?<eos> Because quitting is all you know!<eos> - I'll do better. - It's too late.<eos> - You can't make me leave.<eos> - You never wanted any of this.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because music means nothing to you.<eos> You need to really want this.<eos> I do.
I run several miles every day.<eos> I go biking 60 km through the countryside.<eos> I work long hours.<eos> I feel great.<eos> It's nice waking up in a light, trim body everyday.<eos> And so many of my vegan friends and patients are thriving since their transition to a vegan diet.<eos> So yes. I've seen vegan moms go through healthy vegan pregnancies and deliver healthy vegan children and raise them to tall, full-sized, intelligent vegan adults.<eos> And yes, certainly all the nutrients are there in the plant kingdom to do this, that is correct.<eos> Think anyone should be consuming dairy?<eos> I really don't.
- Poker?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No. Nurses. Pennies.<eos> Harmless. Huh.<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> It's just you were my plans for the evening.<eos> No big deal.<eos> Oh. Well, you want to-<eos> Want to come?<eos> Yes, I do.
Yeah.<eos> Sure, I was.<eos> It's just...<eos> Did you do something?<eos> Or something?<eos> Well, it's nothing illegal, no.<eos> No, no, I mean like, like something bad.<eos> Maybe.<eos> So, I didn't get to talk to Callie last night, and I know that yesterday was kind of... weird, what happened and everything, and I just, you know, wanted to make sure you're cool.<eos> No, you don't.
This is all I've got.<eos> [Stef] You know what else I was right about?<eos> Should've returned the damn glass first before the place closed!<eos> What, you're just going to leave them there?<eos> We have to pay for those!<eos> Yes, we're just going to leave them there.<eos> Feel better?<eos> No.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Mariana did this for us.
I just feel like the idea of karma gives me control over the bad things.<eos> No one can control what the world throws at them, okay?<eos> But what we can control-- except in parts of India-- is who we choose to be with.<eos> So when life hits a rough patch, you don't reach for the clippers.<eos> You lean on the people you love.<eos> Even if they smell like mothballs?<eos> - What?<eos> ♪ so let's start over ♪ I love you.<eos> I guess I do have a great support team, don't I?<eos> We all do.
- You have been so strong.<eos> - It was stupid. Sorry.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> But it was weird.<eos> There was some trouble in an apartment. One guy I had arrested in Copenhagen.<eos> And then it turns out, he's got a little boy.<eos> This baby was covered in his own shit and piss. Ice cold.<eos> And then I just...<eos> So I wanted to call you.<eos> Yes, I did.
You think so?<eos> Everybody thinks so.<eos> Look, Tucker, it's been a month since Lynly left.<eos> What's the holdup?<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> Just, you know, Tansy and I had a complex history.<eos> We're both newly single.<eos> I j... I just want it to be the right moment, you know?<eos> And, plus, things are still tense, very, very tense, with... Lavon!<eos> Hey, man. How you doing?
Joel, hey, big news.<eos> Okay, so we are officially invited to the crab boil, and I know, I was thinking that maybe you could fake a seizure at dinner, because Aunt Winifred would be super impressed watching me save someone's life.<eos> Right.<eos> I'll keep thinking.<eos> Hey. - Don't say anything.<eos> - Okay.<eos> It's not that you're more likable.<eos> Just apparently Aunt Winifred is a New York-ist.<eos> You know, somewhere I have about eight billion retorts to that, but, um, right now I got my own Wilkes problem.<eos> That you do.
Stomach pain?<eos> Oh, how bad?<eos> Yeah, it's probably your gallstone.<eos> But I'm in the middle of something, and I...<eos> Honey...<eos> One second.<eos> Oh, sorry, I'll be off soon.<eos> If you have to see a patient...<eos> Uh... no!<eos> I-I don't.
I do.<eos> We love your daughter.<eos> Meeting her has been a complete godsend.<eos> And we want to get to know you, too.<eos> Come on.<eos> Meet the rest of the family.<eos> Oh, there's more of you.<eos> Bring them on.<eos> Come on, that's got to feel good.<eos> Yes, it does.
I love a good wedding.<eos> To the bride and groom.<eos> - Come on, you guys.<eos> - You'll get your turn.<eos> I want him to show us how he does it.<eos> Just wait till the song's over.<eos> It's over.<eos> Come on, Max, show us how you do it.<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Hey.<eos> We all know what we're doing.<eos> Damn right.<eos> I didn't vote for him but what the hell.<eos> Let's go get the President.<eos> Let's go save the President!<eos> Dr. Zimmer, I need you to get up there on that deck and get some kind of analysis on that thing.<eos> Copy that.<eos> You and the Admiral don't have such a good working relationship, do you?<eos> No ma'am we do not.
The virus has an extra gene now, which could have only been added with human intervention.<eos> So it was weaponized.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Or maybe it escaped from a lab somehow.<eos> But I think I know how to stop it.<eos> All the virus cares about is replicating.<eos> The engineered version lets it do that unchecked. So it no longer needs to mutate, which makes it stable and easier to defeat with a vaccine.<eos> Then why hasn't anybody done that yet?<eos> Because they didn't have the primordial sample.<eos> We do.
And I-I can't believe I'm wearing this.<eos> It's really not a dream.<eos> It is for me.<eos> Me too.<eos> So...<eos> We invite family and friends.<eos> - No enemies.<eos> - No enemies is good.<eos> We have to invite Nick.<eos> Of course we do.
Chap had a terrific future.<eos> Uh, did we just get Winston arrested?<eos> Or worse.<eos> Fortunately, I had time to sell out 'Arry and resurrect Despereaux one last time to clean up Winston's mess.<eos> - Maybe he meant well.<eos> - Yeah, maybe he really thought - he was doing the right thing. - Yeah.<eos> Hey, I've got an update on your Wim Stuyvesant.<eos> God, please tell me he doesn't exist.<eos> He doesn't exist.<eos> But he did.
I get it, all right?<eos> I'm with you.<eos> Rachel is a boatload of crazy.<eos> But for some reason, Miles really loves her, and him, we need to keep on our side.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Everything we spoke about.<eos> Getting the Republic back, that's what you want, right?<eos> Well, trust me, we need his help to do it.<eos> You understand?<eos> Do you?
They're part of the adulthood-begins-at-30 generation.<eos> And I'm... I'm actually looking forward to a little bit of...<eos> - Sanity?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Sanity. Yeah.<eos> I mean, it's over, but on the other hand, it's over.<eos> Amen.<eos> And to think this all started because you wanted to... Nail you.<eos> Yeah, I regret nothing.<eos> Don't.
After my dream girl turned me down to homecoming,<eos> I needed to be alone. So I went to my secret spot in the library.<eos> Frankie?<eos> Heather.<eos> Look. I made a mistake.<eos> I don't want to go to homecoming with Evan.<eos> You don't?
Wow. I'm thinking more along the lines of a peaceful protest.<eos> I'm...<eos> You know, our... our country has a long history of strong women who were made famous for... for standing up for what they believe in... women like Susan B. Anthony,<eos> Rosa Parks, and Gloria Steinem.<eos> They were famous, huh?<eos> I get that.<eos> Frankie won't be a problem anymore.<eos> Oh, I love it when you talk like a mobster.<eos> By the way, how did you convince him to go?<eos> - I didn't.
Previously on Switched at Birth...<eos> Daphne texted there was a fight in homeroom today.<eos> All these kids are like, what? Juvenile delinquents?<eos> Her tire was slashed the first day back at school.<eos> What are you shaking your head at me for?<eos> - I didn't.
Hey, this trip will involve pizza at some point, right?<eos> Yeah, you guys call the food stops.<eos> I'm choosing the music, 'cause the crap you kids listen to...<eos> I know. I can't stand most of it either.<eos> I mean, what's up with that?<eos> I can't even hear a band.<eos> It sounds like everything has been done on a laptop.<eos> Well, I like some old-school stuff.<eos> A little Bob Marley.<eos> Of course you do.
How was your day?<eos> Oh... you know. The usual.<eos> Flew to Denver and back on a private jet.<eos> Lost my only client somewhere along the way.<eos> The first half sounds fun.<eos> It wasn't.<eos> The guy was a total jerk.<eos> But it hasn't stopped me from kicking myself all night for letting it go.<eos> Well, you don't want to work for some jerk anyway.<eos> I don't.
Hey.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Kind of a crappy day.<eos> Want to talk about it?<eos> Not really.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's play then.<eos> Well, I kind of have an unfair advantage.<eos> Actually...<eos> I do.
Let me assist you.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Please. Crane, give him a minute.<eos> We shouldn't have let him do that. Parrish is capable of making decisions.<eos> Maybe we need to rethink everything.<eos> Absolutely. Wait.<eos> What do you mean, "everything"?<eos> As in, maybe this map shouldn't be found.<eos> I realize the dangers, lieutenant...<eos> Do you? Because I don't.
I, uh... just booked a room at a hotel, and, um, cab's on its way.<eos> So, it's all good.<eos> I can't thank you enough for letting me stay here while this all gets sorted out. Um...<eos> I'll come get the rest of my stuff when my car's ready, if that's okay?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - And, um, I'll look you up if I ever become a rich and famous author and start collecting art.<eos> - Miranda... - Yeah?<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> You have nowhere to go.<eos> - Yes, I do.
What was your son's name?<eos> I said after.<eos> Well, these are actually two separate rooms and we already cleared that one, so...<eos> Andre.<eos> His name was Andre Anthony.<eos> Make sure there isn't a box of cookies hiding in there.<eos> Did you have any other kids?<eos> Rules of the game, my friend.<eos> So?<eos> Did you?
So that he could swoop in and be her savior?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You can see your mother now.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> It's your first day.<eos> Thought you might like to see a friendly face.<eos> Thank you, but I think I've got it covered.<eos> And there's not a evil preacher teaching Spanish lab.<eos> Well, you never know.<eos> Actually, I do.
I'll tell her.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be safe.<eos> Your dad... he wants you... us... to stay close to the house.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Look, they'll find him.<eos> I don't really care anymore.<eos> Now I see him for who he really is... he lies, he keeps secrets.<eos> I know, but you always supported him.<eos> Well, maybe I don't anymore.
You have at least some pants.<eos> You also have some pants.<eos> Yet though.<eos> What are you a pervert.<eos> How far is it?<eos> - Not far more.<eos> We're just walking.<eos> - I really needed.<eos> Yet 800 meters.<eos> - As long as I do not completely full.
- You can stop time.<eos> Like me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Tell me quick.<eos> - Your mom...<eos> - Yeah, she's safe.<eos> - And Luca?<eos> - Dad, they're both safe.<eos> They need you.<eos> We all do.
Unless you want me to walk Morgan through Ultra's front door.<eos> Not here to negotiate.<eos> If you want your girlfriend to stay alive, you don't have a choice.<eos> Well, we've said our goodbyes.<eos> What about you and Stephen?<eos> I'll be sure to pass yours along.<eos> I'm not gonna let you hurt them.<eos> You know what your problem is?<eos> You think your adversaries have the same weaknesses as you.<eos> We don't.
Oh, crap, you scared me.<eos> Is everything OK?<eos> Yeah, actually, for the first time in a couple days, it is.<eos> You missed my coq au vin.<eos> You made it?<eos> Well, Conway made it, but I'm pretty sure I told him to.<eos> So, um, where were you?<eos> I was out with a friend.<eos> I didn't think you knew anyone in town.<eos> I do now.
It's really not. I...<eos> I mean, I just...<eos> I know that I messed up before when I was too embarrassed to date you out in the open.<eos> - Lacey, stop, please.<eos> - But I blew off my bitchy friends and I did everything that I could to prove your innocence so you could come home.<eos> - Does none of that matter?<eos> - It does matter.<eos> I'm very grateful.<eos> So why don't you wanna be with me anymore?<eos> I do.
Well, I'm gonna go to bed.<eos> I'm really tired, so...<eos> Okay.<eos> It's him.<eos> Even with everything he did, I know it isn't easy.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I'd like this wrapped up as quickly and discreetly as possible.<eos> I want that bastard in the ground.<eos> Mom, he's got... he's got a job he's got to do.<eos> Yeah, and the sooner he does it, the better.
I'm fine!<eos> What happened while you were gone?<eos> - I can help you.<eos> - No, no, you can't.<eos> Not if you don't tell me what's wrong.<eos> Danny, you're bottling up whatever this is.<eos> And I can see it's destroying you.<eos> You need to tell someone.<eos> You're right.<eos> I do.
But now, that cult?<eos> You said that they were trying to summon something.<eos> From what I've read in the past... these cults, they don't summon ghosts.<eos> They summon inhuman spirits.<eos> Something that's never existed in the flesh.<eos> Demons.<eos> What do they want?<eos> A soul.<eos> And they won't stop until they get one.<eos> What do I do?
I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship.<eos> Dad, this ice-cream place is closed.<eos> Aw, that's too bad.<eos> Do you guys remember how to get home?<eos> Yeah. Why?<eos> Mrs. Dunlevy?<eos> Oh, hi, honey.<eos> I'm actually feeling much better after taking one of these.<eos> I don't know why people don't take drugs all the time.<eos> My uncle Rick does.
I'll see you again.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Spratt...<eos> Offer Dr Clarkson some cake.<eos> Then you may go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm afraid serving me is a bit beneath his dignity.<eos> Even Spratt cannot always live for pleasure.<eos> how well do you know Lord Merton?<eos> I don't, really.
Then his sons are quite difficult.<eos> I know what that's like.<eos> Could you come to luncheon on Saturday?<eos> Help me cheer him up?<eos> Well, I'd love to.<eos> Of course, a single peer with a good estate won't be lonely long, if he doesn't want to be.<eos> You sound like Mrs Bennett!<eos> But what's he on about?<eos> He thinks I know something about Mr Bates.<eos> And do you?
I wouldn't say that.<eos> Come and meet the others.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> That's such a different path.<eos> It is, but it doesn't mean it's better than the one you've chosen.<eos> Your Ladyship, might I have a word?<eos> I'm very sorry to say it, but I've learned something that makes me feel both responsible and guilty.<eos> Would this have to do with Baxter?<eos> Because, if it concerns her criminal record, then I know all about it.<eos> Do you, m'lady?
What I don't understand is why you placed a convicted felon in my household, in my bedroom, when you knew every detail of her past.<eos> I wanted her to have another chance.<eos> Don't you think that should have been my decision, in my own house?<eos> Yes, m'lady. Perhaps it should.<eos> So... why tell me now?<eos> Because, if you have been using your knowledge against her, I'll have to consider your future here.<eos> Indeed, whether you have one at all.<eos> I just thought I'd been wrong and you ought to know.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, now I do.
Barrow, is she all right?<eos> I think so, m'lord.<eos> We must get her outside.<eos> Quickly, Tom!<eos> Tom, get the hose!<eos> Rose, wake Mrs Hughes and the maids.<eos> She'll do the rest.<eos> We must alert the firemen.<eos> Who knows where to find Drewe's number?<eos> I do.
House, dining room, where?<eos> I'm sorry about your niece.<eos> She must be a terrible loss in your life.<eos> She doesn't realize you saved her.<eos> I have one more surprise.<eos> You weren't the only one to hurt me, Ryan.<eos> Another was involved, and he must pay for what he...<eos> I know that place.<eos> That's my dad's house.<eos> ...did to Luke.
- You surprised I called?<eos> I told you I wasn't gonna let you get away again, and I meant it.<eos> - Come have lunch with me.<eos> - I can't.<eos> I have a presentation in front of my whole office today.<eos> Yeah, and if I know you, you've been studying on that shit for weeks.<eos> Come on, girl.<eos> You gotta eat.<eos> Where?<eos> I do business with niggers.
Mr. President, you also still have my letter.<eos> It's not too late, if you want to use that option.<eos> No, you're more useful to me on the Hill than in handcuffs.<eos> I'll call Kern.<eos> Goodnight, sir.<eos> How much did Green tell you?<eos> Enough that I showed up.<eos> He probably didn't mention Rachel Posner?<eos> Don't worry. He doesn't know.<eos> I do.
I got to go, I got work to do.<eos> Sorry. Hey, Richard Castle.<eos> Is it true that you're getting back together with your ex-wife?<eos> This isn't about me today.<eos> Castle, how come you didn't deny it?<eos> You mean back there?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Yeah, if I deny that, then they think it's true.<eos> I thought that stuff didn't bother you.<eos> It doesn't.
She needed to know that someone was watching.<eos> Is that what you were doing outside of her apartment last night?<eos> Watching?<eos> I should've saved her.<eos> But I never saw her.<eos> I waited for the limo. But then that girl came out.<eos> The not-Mandy, the other girl.<eos> So I went around to the back alley and I waited across the street.<eos> When the other girl goes in the front, that means that Mandy goes in the back.<eos> But she didn't.
The truth is, Marcellus, family can be more than just those with whom we share blood.<eos> We can choose.<eos> I know I haven't been around these parts lately.<eos> It's a testament to father Kieran that we could come together and share a drink and a story or two.<eos> Kieran rolled into town on a rusty old cruiser after his daddy died 25 years ago.<eos> And, damn it, that guy could party.<eos> That was, of course, before he took his vows.<eos> But even then, he was committed to the quarter.<eos> He knew that this town needed him.<eos> And we still do.
Now what?<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Quite a shop you have here.<eos> I don't think you came to talk about my shop.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> If you have something to say...<eos> I love my son, and I don't want to lose him.<eos> Clearly, he loves you, and I hope to God you love him.<eos> I do.
All you need to do is give me your username and password. All of this could stop.<eos> Did I say something funny?<eos> You're asking all the wrong questions.<eos> I... am the interface.<eos> If you want to talk to her... just give me a phone.<eos> Will this do?<eos> I'm sorry. I'm- - I'm a bit tied up.<eos> You're not gonna get it just yet.<eos> How do you use the machine?<eos> I don't.
I'll come to your place?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I'll make my special rotisserie chicken.<eos> 21 seasonings salute.<eos> Dude.<eos> How are you still single?<eos> It's just hard to meet girls in this city.<eos> Dude, you gotta know someone you can set me up with.<eos> You know what?<eos> No, I don't.
I'm proud of you two for working together,<eos> And Baby Legs, I know it was hard for you to come to the conclusion that you need a partner, - but I'm proud of you that you did it.<eos> - Thanks, chief.<eos> Now get the **** out of here!<eos> Pretty cool, Morty?<eos> I thought it was cool.<eos> I don't give a **** what you think, Jerry.<eos> You doing okay?<eos> I kinda know how you feel, Summer.<eos> No you don't.
Hey, Rick.<eos> I have to make a project for the science fair this weekend.<eos> - You think you could help me out?<eos> - Whatever.<eos> Well, I mean, traditionally, science fairs are a father-son thing.<eos> Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing.<eos> Morty, I think it would be fun for you to work on a science project with your dad.<eos> Uh...<eos> Yeah, dad.<eos> Why don't we do it together?
He snuck into her quarters on a nightly basis, and she flew his drone.<eos> Gates claims they were getting married when her enlistment ended.<eos> Claims?<eos> Well, Patrice has no appetite for the finer things in life.<eos> She buys her beauty supplies in bulk, and they don't sell Shalimar at the local Megamart.<eos> Coyne was knocking headboards with somebody else.<eos> Patrice Gates a suspect?<eos> She doesn't have a clue Coyne was cheating on her.<eos> Or the technical know-how to operate a drone, let alone modify one into a weapon.<eos> Who does?
I'm sorry, Jethro.<eos> With Parsa's piggybacking off of local radio towers, it'll be low-frequency, low-volume providers.<eos> I checked every college radio station in DC, Virginia and Maryland.<eos> Well, we still got to keep looking.<eos> Not you, too.<eos> Ugh. Look, I didn't have a choice.<eos> I can't go to the awards gala with her.<eos> I feel bad, okay?<eos> It just... seemed like you... didn't really want to go.<eos> I didn't.
The dead are owed nothing.<eos> Ah, come in.<eos> Come in, come in.<eos> Welcome home, Sara.<eos> I'm so happy you're here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, Sara, this is Sin.<eos> Wait, do you two know each other?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> We don't.
Oh, sweetheart. Ok.<eos> I love you, sweetheart.<eos> Ok.<eos> Device is hot.<eos> 3.2 seconds.<eos> Extract as much money as you can in 90 seconds.<eos> Stop!<eos> Get out of there!<eos> We've still got 20 seconds.<eos> No, you don't.
I was going to, but it all happened so fast.<eos> Plus, I thought you and dad would try and talk me out of going back to work so soon.<eos> Which is why you're here.<eos> I'm just worried about you.<eos> If you're worried I'm going to slip, I'm still going to two meetings a day, and--<eos> Laurel, it's not that.<eos> Everybody knows what kind of guy Bertinelli is.<eos> And not to mention his completely psychotic daughter, who's already on her way back to Starling City to kill him.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.
Fight this!<eos> Put her down.<eos> Please don't.<eos> He can't control it!<eos> That's why I don't have a choice. Whoa!<eos> Get out of the way.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> (GASPING) Kill me. Please.<eos> Kill me.<eos> THEA: Please don't do it!
Submarines have torpedoes, right?<eos> Can we blast our way out?<eos> I can see why you two are made for each other.<eos> You like your explosions. [Murmuring] Chert voz'mi.<eos> What?<eos> These are Kaiten torpedoes.<eos> Manually operated.<eos> Someone needs to steer from inside.<eos> Okay, but then, how do they get away from the explosion?<eos> They do not.
How you out-foxed him.<eos> Talk about unthinkable.<eos> You and me, I mean.<eos> When you told me you loved me, you had me fooled.<eos> For a second,<eos> I...<eos> Maybe you might have meant it.<eos> What you said.<eos> You really sold it.<eos> We both did.
He's a good kid.<eos> What did he do?<eos> They say he stole a car.<eos> HPD brought him in about an hour ago, but they haven't processed him yet.<eos> I just spoke to him, and he sounds really scared.<eos> Yeah, I'll bet he is.<eos> If they book Gabriel, that record's going to follow him the rest of his life.<eos> All right.<eos> All right. I'll, uh... I'll see what I can do.<eos> So what did you do?
Woman over there worked the bar last night.<eos> Says the owner, Jack Anderson, threw Yamada and one of his boys out around 11:00 after they mixed it up with another customer.<eos> We talk to Anderson?<eos> According to the bartender, he locked up the bar around 2:00 but apparently never made it home.<eos> His wife reported him missing early this morning.<eos> So, what, we think Yamada and his pal waited out here for Anderson and then confronted him about being tossed from the bar?<eos> It's a theory.<eos> Looks like he put up one hell of a good fight.<eos> Since when does the captain of SWAT show up at a homicide crime scene?<eos> He doesn't.
True.<eos> But you may still be valuable to someone else.<eos> It was you the Jabberwocky was sensing in there, wasn't it?<eos> It was like I could feel her... picking me apart from the inside.<eos> And now because of me, they know about the Knave's heart.<eos> And I'm sure it's only a matter of time before that thing gets inside the Knave's head and they'll find out where it is.<eos> Well, there's only one thing to do, then, isn't there?<eos> We figure out a way of finding it before they do.<eos> Finding it isn't hard. I already know where it is.<eos> You do? Yes.
Mm. But I know what does.<eos> Take one more step, and I'll take your head clean off your shoulders.<eos> Ohh. Come now, Cyrus.<eos> Is that any way to talk to a lady?<eos> What would your mother think?<eos> You don't know anything about my mother.<eos> Don't let her get in your head.<eos> She's poison, this one.<eos> If Jafar knows we're here, why would he send you?<eos> He doesn't.
We want more than just to defeat Jafar.<eos> We want to bring back the Queen.<eos> So unless you can help us with that... you're of no use to us.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't help you with that.<eos> But she can.<eos> - Done!<eos> - Nah.<eos> I thought you didn't like to drink.<eos> I don't.
From Zita's body.<eos> You cock-sucker.<eos> I knew we couldn't trust him.<eos> No, your friends understand the value of my presence, where you are simply a dog with a bone.<eos> Zo didn't want you inserting the key prematurely.<eos> In case it activates a river of lava or... venomous snakes.<eos> So you really imagine the architects of this structure would use the same deception twice.<eos> I see. It doesn't matter.<eos> Zo meant you no harm.<eos> None of us do.
Delivering from the bitter pains of eternal death, the woman was a wicked woman, and she was dead in her own life.<eos> Yea, Lord, pity them who are dead, and give peace and happiness to the living.<eos> Hey, Fruit Brute!<eos> Fruit brute!<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You don't remember me do you?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - I just made an ass out of myself.<eos> - No, no, no. I... I do.
Hmm. Did Lucas find the bottle that Max threw out?<eos> He did.<eos> 'Cause I've been thinking.<eos> Max said that it really screwed him up and knocked him on his ass, right?<eos> Mm-hmm. I wanna know if there's something in it that gave it that extra kick.<eos> You mean besides the alcohol?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I don't get it.<eos> If the scotch was laced, why didn't it show up in the autopsy?<eos> It did.
He or she shows up, ties him up...<eos> I do not know what that is... he passes out, the guest runs out of here, panics?<eos> - [Cell phone rings] - What do you think?<eos> - Mm-hmm. Flynn.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> We gotta head to the hospital.<eos> We'll see you later!<eos> Do you know what that is?<eos> I do.
Ah. You snuck up on me there.<eos> I know she went to our lawyer and changed the will.<eos> She's been making a lot of changes recently... since you started taking care of her, in fact.<eos> What are you implying?<eos> I'm not implying anything.<eos> I know what you're really after.<eos> I'm her nurse.<eos> You're a thief.<eos> You have no idea how good you've got it.<eos> Sure I do.
Did you hear?<eos> There was a murder.<eos> Yeah, I did. It's unbelievable.<eos> The police just questioned me.<eos> You...<eos> Why?<eos> My key code was used to access the ICU right before the murder.<eos> You didn't use it, did you?<eos> Uh... yeah.<eos> [Gasps] I-I did.
God.<eos> (scoffs) Gallery.<eos> Step into reality.<eos> Ilana?<eos> Are you eating garbage bagels?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Abbi sent me a Facebook invite to her gallery debut.<eos> Do you...<eos> look... crazy?<eos> Yeah, I do.
At least, on the bright side, sex with an Atrian is pretty amazing, right?<eos> Roman and I... we never...<eos> No.<eos> Seriously?<eos> What were you guys doing in the storage closet that whole time?<eos> We just wanted to be together.<eos> Oh. We still do.<eos> But you should know, before you ran off at the Bug, Drake asked about you.<eos> Really?<eos> He did?
- No. - Yeah?<eos> No. Josh doesn't like the spa.<eos> No, come on.<eos> It's like a peace offering.<eos> No, I don't need a peace offering.<eos> I promise, I'm feeling very peaceful.<eos> - If anything, I'm feeling too peaceful.<eos> - No, these things happen, yeah? Like, a party baptism.<eos> He does have a point.<eos> Does he...
I am-I have some more if anyone wants.<eos> Tremendous.<eos> You know, there's something about being jetlagged, it always makes me feel like I'm on my period, you know?<eos> No.<eos> I've been jetlagged before.<eos> It doesn't make you feel like you're on your period.<eos> Midsummer Night's Dream!<eos> Did you tell them?<eos> Tom, how do they know I'm on my period?<eos> They don't.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Josh, is that your sister?<eos> - Kind of.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, she's so cute.<eos> I want one.<eos> Don't you guys just want one?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, you do.
But he looks so glamorous.<eos> No, Tom, it doesn't make any sense.<eos> Josh, is this a bad time?<eos> No, no, sorry, my friends are trying to dress John like a girl.<eos> Sorry, what was that?<eos> You don't mind?<eos> Of course you mind, okay? You're picky about food. You're...<eos> You're the guy that minds. No, no, no, I... I eat all kinds of strange things now.<eos> Like, I really like eggplant.<eos> Well, of course you do.
Okay. See you, Josh.<eos> Bye, bye-bye-bye-bye bye bye bye bye...<eos> See you, Hannah.<eos> It's looking good, babe.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Do you want me to stay?<eos> I think Arnold just needs a bit of a rest, Josh.<eos> Yeah, do you...<eos> Do you... Do you want a rest?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I really do.
Corporal Russell...<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay. Hey.<eos> Slow down, all right?<eos> Detective Reagan.<eos> This is Detective Baez.<eos> Here to help you, John, okay?<eos> I don't need help.<eos> Maybe you don't, but Tommy...<eos> Tommy does, okay?
You're looking for a consensus you can present in court?<eos> Yes. Or even the appearance of a consensus. Just... give me anything.<eos> - I'll build on it.<eos> - Is this a Hail Mary pass?<eos> Yes.<eos> Is Peter Florrick the dad?<eos> No, Eli.<eos> We've had this conversation.<eos> No, we didn't. You said you didn't want to have this conversation.<eos> And I still don't. Hmm.
- Because not everybody has such nice insides, Joel.<eos> Some people have darker pasts and insides that nobody wants to hear about.<eos> No, but that's how you know if someone's right for you.<eos> You know, if you share all that stuff, and then they... stick around.<eos> Nobody wants to know what's below my surface, Joel.<eos> Nobody wants to hear about my mom and her 20 boyfriends and three husbands while I was growing up, or that she told me to meet a rich guy before my face and my boobs went.<eos> See?<eos> Guys just want to see me bend over.<eos> Nobody wants to hear the other stuff.<eos> I do.
Nah, you need to do better than that.<eos> All right?<eos> You need to shut him down. Lawyer his ass.<eos> Darryl, believe me, I will do the very best I can.<eos> This family needs to stay together.<eos> To wit, you need to find a fit place for that boy to lay his head.<eos> You have any ideas or you want them to just take him away again?<eos> No and no.<eos> But I ain't got no money just yet.<eos> No, of course you don't.
I need you to come with.<eos> You and him cut a deal?<eos> Borry, son.<eos> Well, one more question before I go.<eos> How did you spend your take of our first hit?<eos> That's what you're asking me?<eos> I invested it.<eos> It's always best to make your money work for you.<eos> That's funny.<eos> I did much the same.
Some closure.<eos> - I think they're gonna be okay.<eos> I'll take you to the playground where you used to play.<eos> You do know that the C.I.A. will just get McKinley... - and his bodyguard out of jail, right?<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> But they won't be able to cover everything up, since I leaked some vital information to Internet bloggers, and the New York Times picked it up.<eos> - Sneaky you. - That's how I roll.<eos> - I like that.<eos> - But by the way, how did you know that that guy was wearing a bulletproof vest?<eos> I didn't.
telling me he was in love with me... and he was getting a divorce.<eos> And he was handsome and I was alone... very alone... and I...<eos> Weeks later when he came to me... and he said that he was leaving his kids and his wife... and he wanted to be with me, I said no.<eos> I said I made a mistake.<eos> And he went crazy.<eos> He started threatening me. He started threatening my family.<eos> He told me that my brother that had been involved in drugs, he was gonna bust him.<eos> Monica.<eos> What you're telling me... is that you have... a motive.<eos> I didn't do this, Cat.
But if I'm cured, why am I still hallucinating?<eos> I have an even better question.<eos> Why are you hallucinating me instead of Alan?<eos> Sutton is trying to turn me against you.<eos> Of course she is.<eos> I just wanted to let you know.<eos> Sutton can be a dangerous enemy.<eos> I understand.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Why?<eos> - We need to leave this place.<eos> There is a woman coming down here to kill you.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - I'll explain everything, but right now, we need to leave.<eos> - Does Alan know about this?<eos> - He's coming down with her.<eos> - Alan would never...<eos> - He doesn't know what she's capable of.<eos> I do.
Sam?<eos> Lani?<eos> My darling Dana.<eos> Sam called me and told me you had a terrible accident.<eos> I didn't know you were here.<eos> When did you arrive?<eos> Sam asked me to come right away and help take care of you.<eos> What a nice surprise.<eos> You didn't have to come all the way here.<eos> Oh, I did.
Everything you own...<eos> Will be mine.<eos> Do not harm my boy.<eos> Please, please, please.<eos> Seon-u.<eos> How'd you get that name?<eos> _<eos> Look, I don't know what happened between you and your dad, but I trust him.<eos> I know.<eos> I did, too.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You have no right to kill one of my men.<eos> I had already taken care of that problem.<eos> No, Javier.<eos> You did not.
- like you did Sonny Watts.<eos> - I agree. So, about Sonny Watts, he had this video...<eos> On his cell phone.<eos> What kind of video?<eos> It was of you and Taj Depina.<eos> I saw the video.<eos> If you got a question, ask me.<eos> Did you push him?<eos> Are you sure you want me to answer that question?<eos> I do.
Oh, who was messing with Freya.<eos> And Ingrid's boss was messing with her.<eos> There's a pattern here.<eos> We can't ignore it.<eos> I know my son.<eos> I know what he's capable of, even at his worst.<eos> He's not a killer.<eos> Mm. Cold?<eos> Frederick. I know how you feel about me, Aunt Wendy.<eos> - Do you?
But you're about to find out!<eos> Oh. Are you okay?<eos> I... what happened?<eos> What did it do to us?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I-I-I feel fine.<eos> So do I.<eos> What?<eos> This doesn't make sense.<eos> Of course it does.
He knows that I don't trust him, and so he took something that belongs to me,<eos> - and he messed with it.<eos> - Okay, so give it to me.<eos> Maybe I can figure it out.<eos> - I'll do an unveiling spell.<eos> - I got rid of it.<eos> I didn't want it anywhere near me.<eos> So, the truth is he just could've found your earring.<eos> Joanna, you asked me to come out here to talk about this because you have doubts.<eos> I do.
And I did love him.<eos> Before he became corrupt.<eos> But you remained loyal to him long after he became corrupt.<eos> You could've joined us in the rebellion.<eos> You didn't.<eos> Because he fed me lies about all of you, and I believed him.<eos> I didn't know what I was doing.<eos> By the time I realized how wrong I'd been about everything, it was too late.<eos> I thought you understood.<eos> I do, I do.
I believe him.<eos> Okay, that's crazy.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about, Freya.<eos> What is that?<eos> Dash bought me a dress.<eos> Really.<eos> Is it couture?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> He did that for me on our second date.
- What's a death scorpion?<eos> They're in stasis now, but I can revive them.<eos> And he won't see them coming, because he doesn't know what they are, because we're the ones who invented the spell.<eos> The first sting will paralyse you and the second will kill you.<eos> Even if you're a telepathic, warlock, asshole.<eos> I don't want to kill him yet.<eos> The venom will paralyze him for a couple of hours.<eos> It's enough time for us to find out his plans.<eos> Only problem is, we don't know how to find Tarkoff.<eos> Or maybe we do.
I'm sorry.<eos> I guess I just...<eos> "panicked."<eos> I suppose I had that coming, but you need to calm down.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we shouldn't fight?<eos> Because we're family?<eos> Because I can trust... you?<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You don't help without strings attached, and you know that as well as I do.<eos> Okay, this isn't the way that I saw it playing out either, but I had to do something.<eos> You were upstairs carving your arms.<eos> You always had a flair for the dramatic, even as a child.<eos> Shut the hell up!<eos> Such a mouth!<eos> Just hear him out, mom.<eos> - There's no other way.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> Your servant Tarkoff did this.
I had to go to, like, five stores to find it and then finally they just ordered it special.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What, uh, what is it?<eos> It's aquavit.<eos> Since your mom said you spent so much in Denmark and my friends told me...<eos> Right, right, right.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I... I drank a ton of this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You don't like it.<eos> I do.
It's where I belong.<eos> You used to be a better liar.<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> She wasn't at the library.<eos> Oh, Ingrid is resting upstairs.<eos> Frederick, I need your help!<eos> Well, I'm glad she came back. You know, maybe<eos> I was wrong about her and Bastian.<eos> Deep down, Ingrid has the best heart of all of us.<eos> Oh,of course she does.
He was on his knees when you shot him.<eos> Twice.<eos> Ain't nobody's gonna believe that was self-defense, and you know it.<eos> - You want Jack to grow up without his moms, is that it?<eos> No.<eos> Then quit talking bullshit, okay?<eos> Because I ain't going to prison.<eos> You didn't have to stay.<eos> You didn't have to help me.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Yup.<eos> You buying AJ's PR bullshit?<eos> Nope.<eos> You know Kyle Stansbury?<eos> You mean the kid that stuck a gun in his mom, dad and sisters' mouths and went "bang"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's a loner.<eos> You know?<eos> Loser. Stays in his room mostly.<eos> So did he do it?
How about the time you got drunk at Christmas mass?<eos> - So you're a virgin, huh?<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> I was talking to the donkey.<eos> I can't believe Woody, of all people, is getting to meet the president.<eos> Trust me, it's not that big of a deal.<eos> Connie, do you really expect me to believe<eos> - that you know the president?<eos> - I do.
This is a cancer kid.<eos> I saved his life, had him sewn to me, so he could share my liver.<eos> Dear God.<eos> What's your name, son?<eos> Did I mention he's also a mute and pretty much brain dead?<eos> So he's brain dead and a mute?<eos> Well, he wasn't born a mute.<eos> He had tonsil cancer.<eos> Oh, I thought he had liver cancer.<eos> Oh, he does.
Is there something you're not sharing?<eos> These are copies of photos taken moments after Emily was shot.<eos> Each guest claims to have been in the main room.<eos> Lydia.<eos> She's not here.<eos> Which means she lied to the police.<eos> You look so beautiful.<eos> It was a like a real-live fairy tale.<eos> You've gotta remember something.<eos> I don't.
I'm going to prom.<eos> Just so you know, dating a high-school guy at your age is creepy.<eos> Also a little bit desperate.<eos> But mostly creepy.<eos> No.<eos> I'm on the alumni committee, and they asked me to chaperone.<eos> And it is going to be awesome.<eos> I always wanted to go to prom.<eos> No.<eos> No, you didn't.
You know what?<eos> Good call. You're going to need more than big socks this morning.<eos> I know this has been sort of confusing, Kira.<eos> I don't blame you for being put out.<eos> But, since we're stuck in this together, there's no reason why we shouldn't have a little fun.<eos> And there's no reason why we shouldn't have really awesome socks. Right?<eos> Sit, please, Paul.<eos> I'm in need of a new monitor.<eos> You have a monitor?<eos> She did.
But I'll throw 'em off the trail.<eos> Shit! I'm...<eos> I'm coming for her.<eos> No, no, I'm on the move.<eos> I'll call you at the meet-up spot.<eos> Are you gonna tell me who your mystery sitter is?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'll trust you know what's best for Kira if you will trust me with him.<eos> I don't.
Really?<eos> And where did you get your genetics degree?<eos> I can source another computer.<eos> Anything you need?<eos> No, we're good.<eos> Couldn't get my hands on a 6502 processor, but this one shares a chipset with the 65c02.<eos> He's a virgin, in case you couldn't tell.<eos> Aw, shoot-darn.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> Oh, but it did, my good man.
I was so insecure.<eos> I didn't think I was smart enough or funny enough or thin enough for him to ever really love me.<eos> I never felt safe.<eos> I couldn't ever trust, so I couldn't ever commit, I was so sure everything was gonna be taken from me, that I took it away from myself.<eos> I don't really know why, Callie, but you do the same exact thing.<eos> Always with one foot out the door, never taking the time to really connect.<eos> I think it's 'cause you're scared.<eos> I'm not scared, I'm sick of it.<eos> - I just want to be on my own.<eos> - You do?
Any idea what you do need?<eos> Yeah... to be out of the system... on my own.<eos> Then why'd you get yourself arrested and sent back here?<eos> Callie, you're still a kid.<eos> Like it or not, you need an adult to care for you.<eos> Whether it's in the system or back with your foster moms...<eos> No, I can't go back there.<eos> You can send me to a different foster home, or leave me here, I don't care.<eos> Just... I want them to adopt my little brother.<eos> I do.
What?<eos> Callie doesn't want us to be there.<eos> Too bad.<eos> You have to talk to the judge, right?<eos> So that way she can come home.<eos> Unless you don't want her anymore.<eos> Of course we want her.<eos> It is not a question of whether we want Callie.<eos> It is... it is whether she wants us.<eos> - She does.
So, honestly this time...<eos> is it because of Callie?<eos> Talya... Just... I just need to hear you admit it.<eos> So I know I'm not crazy.<eos> Yes. It's Callie.<eos> - Brandon.<eos> - What?<eos> She's just going to hurt you.<eos> You... you don't know...<eos> - I don't.
[chuckles] You want something to drink?<eos> You want me to get you something?<eos> Um, why'd you stop writing to us?<eos> You know, after you've been in prison for a couple of years, you, uh... you start to think maybe you're not gonna get out.<eos> I told myself you kids were better off.<eos> Truth is, I was pretty messed up.<eos> And I felt ashamed about what I'd done.<eos> And I was just waiting for the day to come when I'd open up a letter from you... accusing me of murdering your mother.<eos> You didn't... murder her.<eos> Yeah, I did.
So... if you're not really my brother, then Stef and Lena won't really be my mothers.<eos> - No, it's not the same.<eos> - It's exactly the same.<eos> I need a family.<eos> Not a piece of paper.<eos> If that's what adoption is, then what's the point?<eos> Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean...<eos> We can't keep doing this.<eos> But we do.
Ok, look.<eos> I love my brother.<eos> He's my twin and I would totally give him a kidney, anytime.<eos> But when it comes to girls, he can be a little all over the place.<eos> He's just not very good at expressing his true feelings.<eos> If he even knows what he's feeling.<eos> Which, most of the time, he doesn't.<eos> He's easily confused.<eos> Are you saying he doesn't like me?<eos> No, he does.
They're all... they're all in the right order and they're all just going down the track, you gotta get them into the right station.<eos> You know?<eos> Sure.<eos> Unless you pull into the wrong station, and then everything's just screwed up forever because now you're in Moscow and you wanna be in St. Petersburg, and nobody wants to be in Moscow, unless you're, like, Raskolnikov,<eos> and you're trying to escape the anguish of what you did.<eos> Maybe we shouldn't talk about Crime and Punishment right now.<eos> It's a little heavy.<eos> - But not.<eos> You know?<eos> - I do.
But, you know, you have other options.<eos> Well, Jude and the twins can't drive.<eos> So...<eos> Neither can Callie, come to think of it.<eos> And, I don't know, um...<eos> Mom tends to overreact to things, and...<eos> I was just feeling so anxious, I couldn't imagine dealing with her yelling, on top of it all.<eos> She only yells at you because she loves you so much.<eos> - I know.<eos> - We both do.
Wow. Have you heard of this, the "Word Gap?"<eos> So babies who aren't talked to enough are headed for trouble in school from the get-go.<eos> Like basically your entire ability to learn is wrapped up in how many words you hear in your first years of life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> But with the two of us for moms, I don't think our child is gonna have anything to worry about.<eos> What?<eos> You talk a lot.<eos> - Oh, I do?<eos> - Yes, you do.
Forgive me if I have a hard time taking you at your word.<eos> You volunteered to be our donor.<eos> You said that people like us should have kids, and you wanted to help, anonymously.<eos> And then you...<eos> - I read the contract. - Yes.<eos> And you knew what it was going to say.<eos> You agreed that Stef and I should be the parents.<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> I trusted you because I thought you had integrity.<eos> - I do.
I should let you rest.<eos> Dani just wanted to drop off her special lasagna for you guys.<eos> - Yeah? Uh... Thank you.<eos> Thank Dani, she did all the cooking.<eos> Please, thank her for me.<eos> I will.<eos> Your dad is talking about having a baby with Dani.<eos> I need you to know why I'm helping Ana.<eos> - I know why.<eos> - No, you don't.
I think I love it.<eos> So...<eos> There's something I need to tell you.<eos> What about?<eos> Brandon.<eos> - Hey. I was just working on a new song.<eos> Can you come sit please?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Mama told me what happened.<eos> - She did?
Connor, would you mind stepping out so we can talk to your dad?<eos> Mr. Stevens, do you think it's appropriate to spank a thirteen year old boy?<eos> I think it's none of your damn business.<eos> And quite frankly, this is all your fault.<eos> - My fault?<eos> - Yeah, you were the chaperone on the seventh grade camping trip, and allowed our sons to spend the night in a tent together without my permission.<eos> Why is that a problem?<eos> Because her son is gay.<eos> - Which I have no problem with...<eos> - Clearly you do...
I can't trust anything.<eos> And I knew this was gonna happen, Brandon, I knew it.<eos> Come here, come here, sit down with me.<eos> Take some breaths.<eos> OK, just take some deep breaths.<eos> No matter what, they can't make you live with them.<eos> We'll still be your family.<eos> I'm never getting adopted.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes I do.
- What's so funny?<eos> - Mama.<eos> She and Jude just got to the campsite and she sent me this picture of the outhouse.<eos> That's messed up.<eos> Mama tells me that you and... you and Hayley are having sex.<eos> - We're using condoms.<eos> - Well, good. You better be.<eos> That's not what I want to talk to you about.<eos> - Do we really have to have this talk?<eos> - We do.
Yeah, I get it, Sherlock.<eos> Lock up the scene, photograph and bag the evidence. Routine procedure.<eos> Where's the file?<eos> Case number 45344.<eos> Make sure you tag it, too.<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> I've been in here for a long time.<eos> It walked right to that evidence crate like it knew where it was going.<eos> Not like.<eos> It did.
Uh, if... if you tell a lie or even try to cover anything up, that Rothman woman will smell it like a shark does blood.<eos> And you, my friend... will be dead in the water.<eos> I, um, think I need to teach you how to tie this knot yourself.<eos> Oh. You're up, kid.<eos> Thank you.<eos> As you walk through that door, just remember that I'm very proud of you, Rusty.<eos> Very proud.<eos> Remain standing and raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
You can't go.<eos> You're, like, the only person in the whole world who actually cares about me.<eos> I feel the same way about you, but I have to go.<eos> I have to.<eos> Why, though?<eos> Um... there's a guy.<eos> What guy?<eos> There's a guy I owed a favor to, and he wanted me to do something for him.<eos> I tried to get it done.<eos> I really did.
Your Honor, this is normally when I would ask if Rusty could identify the person in the courtroom who tried to kill him, but, by sheer coincidence, Mr. Stroh has fallen ill this morning.<eos> So, if I may approach the witness...<eos> Can you point out which of these six men held a knife to your throat and slashed your leg?<eos> Sure.<eos> It's number four.<eos> Let the record show that the witness identified a photo of Phillip Stroh.<eos> No further questions at this time, Your Honor.<eos> Ms. Rothman, your witness.<eos> You didn't wait for the police after your heroic 911 call, did you, Russell?<eos> No, I-I didn't.
It comes and it goes, and it works out, like, maybe 30% of the time, and even then it's... it's a lot of work.<eos> It's gut-wrenching, pride-swallowing work.<eos> How do you know?<eos> 'Cause I'm not as unlovable as I look.<eos> Somebody loved you?<eos> She said she did, anyway.<eos> And you loved her too.<eos> Thought I did, yeah.<eos> She left you though.<eos> Yes, as a matter of fact, she did.
Who's Jorge?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Do you have any advice on how to accessorize this thing?<eos> Like, do I try to cover it or just embrace the whole robo-crustacean of it all?<eos> Put on it that says what happened that way you don't have to answer the same question over and over again.<eos> If that's the worst I have to deal with, I'll be happy.<eos> Give it time.<eos> Your hand'll get better.<eos> - Yours didn't.
Tell them everything. Or I will.<eos> Tell me what?<eos> Level X.<eos> Level X. There's a...<eos> What is on Level X?<eos> The virus vault.<eos> That's where we keep all our original core samples.<eos> You have original samples of NARVIK?<eos> A and B strains?<eos> Of course he does.
Not to mention you're the daughter of Rayna Jaymes and Deacon Claybourne, which pretty much makes you country royalty.<eos> You know, it's not fair what people are saying about you.<eos> They're just bullies, and bullies should not win.<eos> Hi. You about ready?<eos> Yeah. I'm just gonna get changed.<eos> All right, well, I should let you get ready.<eos> I'll see you out there.<eos> I wouldn't miss it.<eos> You know, you don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.
- when you had some heat?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I was... playing guitar for Rayna, writing hit songs.<eos> I guess I just didn't feel like I needed to be famous.<eos> Do you need it now?<eos> I'm not testifying.<eos> I've got a material-witness order that says that you are.<eos> If you don't testify, you will lose all immunity, and that means jail time.<eos> We've got enough evidence to convict you both.<eos> You don't.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Look, uh...<eos> I guess I'm not used to... to failing.<eos> But you were right about me.<eos> I... I don't know what it is that I want to say.<eos> Or if I even have anything to say yet, so... You're young.<eos> You probably just haven't thought about it enough.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, uh, so what do I do?
- You sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I mean, you got charts?<eos> - Yeah, I got charts. Yeah. - All right, yeah, we're good.<eos> Hey, I'd be happy to sing backup if you think it would help.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, I mean, I do sing.<eos> Well, yeah. It's just... it's a real gig.<eos> You don't want me to?<eos> Of course I do.
H-how do you cope with that part?<eos> Work more, play more, record more.<eos> Not your own stuff, though.<eos> Hasn't it been a while since you put anything out?<eos> To be honest, I'm... I-I feel kind of stuck.<eos> Spending so much time working on the other people's music... I can't really wrap my head around my own.<eos> Which I'm probably doing it on purpose, you know?<eos> I'm trying to hide from my own music.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> Yes. I do.
I know.<eos> I told you... I'm fine.<eos> Well, you can cut that out right now.<eos> This is too damn big to just shove down and deal with later, Rayna.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> - Tea?<eos> - No, I don't want tea.<eos> I want you to talk, all right?<eos> If anybody understands how complicated your relationship with Lamar was, it's me.<eos> - You don't.
I mean... uh... Are you okay with it?<eos> I know you two have your history.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm...<eos> You and Deacon and Will Lexington just go off on your tour and have a great time, and I'll just be here, keeping Highway 65 afloat with Juliette Barnes.<eos> - Come here. - [Chuckles]<eos> By all means, just let yourself in.<eos> Door was open.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> - No, we don't.
- Is that it? !<eos> - It's not like that at all.<eos> No! Get off of me! Please, don't hurt me.<eos> You little brat!<eos> Shut up! You make me sick!<eos> Shut up, you little girl.<eos> So, hopefully, they'll come to their senses and start playing my music again.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Pays to have friends in high places.<eos> Yes, it does.
You're tall! - Rayna: Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, I came by to tell you in person how much I can't wait to crank out "Ball and Chain" with you tomorrow night.<eos> - Mmm. - Well, aren't you sweet?<eos> - Hey, there, Maddie.<eos> - Hi. - I am excited.<eos> I'm excited for our live stream of "Ball and Chain."<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Me too. - I thought you hated social media.<eos> I do... for my personal life.
I don't think part of her punishment should be taking away her music.<eos> Music is the problem.<eos> And you can feel free to give me parenting advice once you've actually raised a child for 14 years.<eos> Yeah, well, I was kept out of that loop, too.<eos> Look, you may have some biological connection here, but you are not her parent.<eos> She is grounded.<eos> And she will not be seeing you here or at your concert.<eos> Of course I didn't know she was gonna go over to Deacon's.<eos> I can't believe she just out-and-out lied about it.<eos> Yeah, well, she did.
I do think that you're punishing more than just Maddie here.<eos> Listen, I'm just gonna need you to give me a pass on this, okay?<eos> Rayna.<eos> Okay, look. Fine. Fine.<eos> The minute you come off that stage, I am picking up the girls and Maddie's grounding resumes.<eos> No guitar lessons.<eos> Everything all right with the mayor?<eos> I swear, does the drama ever end?<eos> [Laughs] Yeah. Come here.<eos> It does right now.
Hands down, one of the best shows I've ever seen you play.<eos> - Really, Juliette.<eos> I have goose bumps. - Yeah, right?<eos> I don't think I've ever worked that hard in my life. - That better generate some buzz. - Oh, yeah.<eos> Hey, did Avery come out to see the set?<eos> I think he's still back there writing with Scarlett.<eos> Jeff: Congratulations, man.<eos> Congratulations on surpassing Rayna Jaymes on the country radio charts... it's big.<eos> Looks like I made the right choice signing with you.<eos> You did.
- Mom. Please.<eos> - Okay. No.<eos> Pinball, anyone?<eos> [Coin rattles] [Scoffs] Seriously?<eos> [Flippers clacking] Let me get that for you, Mr. Claybourne.<eos> All right, Danny, cut the "mister" crap, and you got like a million amps to lug.<eos> I got this.<eos> Well, actually, you might need your hands free.<eos> I got them.<eos> How y'all doing?
I'm a nobody. A trained killer doesn't just go after a nobody.<eos> You better hope he doesn't have any friends on this flight.<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> They got the wrong guy. Whatever's going on here, I'm irrelevant.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Would it be too much to ask you to snap a twig?<eos> Not my thing.<eos> We get a new number?<eos> No.<eos> But Mr. Reese did.
And the other flight attendants?<eos> Carlos is a selfish idiot who doesn't know what the hell he's doing.<eos> What ever happened to people helping other people?<eos> Holly, I hate to tell you this. You're good at your job.<eos> That's so nice of you.<eos> Thank you for that, and for saving me from that maniac.<eos> He was just trying to kill Owen.<eos> Where is Owen?<eos> How did he disappear?<eos> He didn't.
You're off your game.<eos> Well, I'm just lulling you into a false sense of security.<eos> Like a cobra, hiding in the weeds, ready to strike.<eos> Yeah, well... you are a snake. I know that.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Whose perfume is that?<eos> I-I don't smell--<eos> - Keegan.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't.
- That one looks fat.<eos> It does, doesn't it?<eos> But they all help make the tree strong, strong enough to weather any storm.<eos> Like a family.<eos> - Like our family?<eos> - That's right.<eos> You need your family, Tarzan, and your family needs you.<eos> - Nobody needs me.<eos> - I do.<eos> And I always will.
- It's that way.<eos> - Come on, guys.<eos> I know a shortcut.<eos> - Tarzan!<eos> - No!<eos> Whoa!<eos> Let's never speak of this again.<eos> Come on!<eos> Slow, down. Don't get too far ahead.<eos> - I won't.
-It's good?<eos> -It is.<eos> Give me the book.<eos> Who you selling this to?<eos> Since when do you ask questions, Mr. cold?<eos> It's not your style.<eos> You know what, you're right.<eos> I don't know what got into me.<eos> What if they try to screw us?<eos> -They won't.
I'd like to ask you something.<eos> But I don't dare.<eos> Come on, tell me.<eos> What is it?<eos> I want to do it with Antoine's cousin.<eos> I find him attractive.<eos> Well, go on then.<eos> Are you okay with it?<eos> You sure you won't tell me off later?<eos> I won't.
Remember my hunger strike?<eos> I wanted to die then.<eos> You gave me a lecture.<eos> You spurred me on.<eos> Don't do anything stupid.<eos> I'll always be there if you need me.<eos> I know.<eos> Do you think we'll see each other again?<eos> Of course, are you crazy?<eos> Of course we will.
I'll manage Vimmi, don't worry about me<eos> Have you ever managed to do anything alone ?<eos> In any case, Bunty is nothing without Babli<eos> Get up<eos> Unlock yourselves... I can't do it...<eos> We're nearing the railway signal on the outskirts of Delhi<eos> The train halts there for two minutes<eos> The two of... The three of you can get off and go wherever you wish<eos> No one recognises Bunty and Babli except me<eos> And no one ever will
Proceed with the air strike.<eos> F-14 strike force is on deck, sir.<eos> Weapons are locked and loaded and ready to fly.<eos> All right, let's get 207 and 209 into the air, gentlemen.<eos> Get off me.<eos> What happened?<eos> You were just to watch them and make sure they got out as planned.<eos> One they left behind may have figured out those plans.<eos> - Where is he now? - We don't know. If he gets to the Russians, we're screwed.<eos> - He won't.
Stop fighting.<eos> I. Tripitaka. am here,<eos> You're Tripitaka?<eos> Get Tripitaka!<eos> What's going on?<eos> Whose troops are these?<eos> How dare they attack us?<eos> Wake up, Don't die on me, Wake up,<eos> Mom. don't die,<eos> I won't.
3 lakhs for an acre.<eos> It is close to the water canal.<eos> Yield will be around 40 bags of rice per acre.<eos> You are in great need of money. I can't give you more than 2 lakhs per acre.<eos> He can't give. Just because we need money, you are asking for low price.<eos> That's how it goes. They buy for pennies and sell it for dollars.<eos> Never mind if you don't understand the joke.<eos> But we need the money within a week.<eos> Understood? I'll give you full cash as soon as you sign the documents.<eos> Sure, he will.
Isn't that your third time?<eos> No...! Not at all!<eos> Not a single time. I've spent three hours waiting for my turn.<eos> Come on, be nice! Here, have 1,000.<eos> I don't give a fuck about your dough.<eos> I just told you the girl is tired.<eos> Tired... tired...<eos> Everybody went on top of her.<eos> One more is not going to make any difference.<eos> Yes it will!
...Well?<eos> You, his valiant wife, who with Slavko, helmed between Scylla and Charybdis...<eos> Did you ever hear Slavko Leban use the word "eventually"?<eos> !<eos> ...Well?<eos> ...Well?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> He didn't.<eos> And he never will!
That is a difficult letter.<eos> Sean's always used an "X" to sign his name.<eos> Well, not for much longer.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Snow'll be coming soon. Now remember, really sound out the words with them.<eos> And when you come back, they'll be ready for the advanced readers.<eos> I'll keep them on it.<eos> Good. God go with you and your family, Sharp Claw. Thank you.<eos> And, Miriam, I'll be seeing you.<eos> Yes, you will.
- It's Behrooz.<eos> - Answer it.<eos> - Are you almost here?<eos> Yes.<eos> - What did you tell Dad?<eos> - I didn't, I just left.<eos> He was busy working.<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> Wherever we go, he'll find us.<eos> No, he won't.
- I'm gonna get her to talk.<eos> - She'll go into shock before she does.<eos> Agent Castle, step outside.<eos> I want her prints and photograph send over to CTU immediately.<eos> - He has no right to give me orders.<eos> He did the right thing.<eos> She was willing to kill herself.<eos> - She'd die before she gave in to force.<eos> - We need to get her to talk now.<eos> - And we will.
Did you bring your passport?<eos> Our mother was killed.<eos> I found her body in a state medical facility.<eos> I identified her, paid for her release.<eos> Made arrangements with a mausoleum in Moscow three blocks from where she was born.<eos> I thought she'd want it that way.<eos> And you have no idea who was responsible, who killed her?<eos> No.<eos> I swear to god, somehow I will find out who did this to our mother... and I will kill him.<eos> I will.

My compound.<eos> Can we trust him?<eos> He is telling the truth.<eos> I'll arrange for transport.<eos> Sydney, getting your father from Masari... We need to go in tactically.<eos> How am I supposed to sit here and do nothing?<eos> It's my dad.<eos> We both know he wouldn't want you to go.<eos> I can't lose him.<eos> You won't.
Sydney Bristow has taken something of mine... an access card.<eos> I want you to get it back.<eos> Why?<eos> What is it for?<eos> That's none of your concern. 48 hours.<eos> Don't let me down.<eos> Are you sure this is the right move?<eos> The right move?<eos> If they find out what you're up to...<eos> They won't.
And I began to wish the woman I loved was dead.<eos> I woke up every day imagining how I'd do it. What was the best way. What was the most efficient way.<eos> I mean, it's all I wanted.<eos> That woman was evil, and deserved to be punished, so I killed her.<eos> And although that woman was the worst kind of evil, I also know that killing her was wrong.<eos> I don't sleep much.<eos> I mean, I can't close my eyes without seeing it. That -- that moment.<eos> That look on her face.<eos> She won't leave me.<eos> She won't.
[Narrator] Michael decided that perhaps he should go after Sally.<eos> Have you seen my other pair of pants?<eos> Lupe washed them, and they sprouted.<eos> I threw them out.<eos> Well, that puts a lot of pressure on this pair.<eos> I think this one's good.<eos> Looks like it would've put up a fight.<eos> - I put up one to get it.<eos> - As long as it gets Frank Wrench to bid on me.<eos> - It won't.
That device has been discredited for years.<eos> Well, check their Web site.<eos> It's still used in 1400 state and local agencies.<eos> Well, not in Las Vegas.<eos> Or anywhere else in this state.<eos> Say, was an advocate or a parent present at the time of the confession?<eos> He didn't ask for his mommy and daddy.<eos> Long as he says he understands his rights, we don't have to have anyone there with him.<eos> He tell you why he did it?<eos> No, but he will.
What, you're telling me there was a girl on the plane ?<eos> Yeah, a dead girl.<eos> Hey, man, I don't know anything about that.<eos> Swap-outs happen on these routes so fast, checks are in and out in 60 seconds.<eos> So, she came on with the bag of checks ?<eos> Listen, pit stops, I'm maintaining the plane. Copilot's in charge of cargo.<eos> And conveniently, he's in a coma.<eos> Look, man, I'm telling you the truth.<eos> All right, check the freight manifest.<eos> I will.
I wish to hell that you didn't have to be part of this, that I could just make it all stop, but I can't.<eos> No one can.<eos> Belyakov means to kill me.<eos> He's a broken down, half-dead old man.<eos> Until his last breath, he is extremely dangerous.<eos> He ain't gonna hurt you, I promise.<eos> What if you're wrong?<eos> I ain't wrong.<eos> If you're wrong, will you protect me?<eos> Yeah, I will.
- No.<eos> But I sense you're like me.<eos> Old-fashioned at heart, not one to do the online dating thing, but too swamped to meet people any other way.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you could say I haven't had a normal life in a while.<eos> But I think that could be changing.<eos> Good.<eos> So, what do you do?<eos> Well, I teach... Or taught.<eos> - Kind of at a special-needs school, if you will.
- You can't be serious.<eos> I'm just saying, I'd like to know.<eos> - He kidnapped me.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because he thinks I can help kill you.<eos> - Don't you mean kill an Avatar?<eos> - Same difference.<eos> Okay, what I don't understand is why he would think that you still had a potion?<eos> - I don't know, ask him.<eos> - All right, I will.
- We need to fend them off.<eos> - If we're to find the Nexus?<eos> - The Nexus?<eos> - Where are Phoebe and Paige?<eos> I want more than to find the Nexus.<eos> I want to release the Shadow.<eos> Harness its ultimate power.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Well, now that evil has taken over control of the manor, I can.<eos> And I will.
That's not fair, you have everything, you've got the deli, the dog, Ricardo!<eos> I'm gonna have nothing!<eos> You got me and I got you!<eos> No matter what, T!<eos> I don't care about that!<eos> You can't do this to me, you can't!<eos> I'm not going away!<eos> You are my son, you'll do as I say!<eos> No!<eos> I won't!
All right. He might make a mistake today.<eos> He's angry and he probably hasn't done the kind of surveillance he'd like.<eos> Yeah, well, neither have we.<eos> Let's go, Reid.<eos> I'll bring the car around.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> This is the last place he watched.<eos> That house.<eos> Morgan said the family hasn't moved back in.<eos> Probably never will.
I'll get a team out to his house.<eos> In the meantime, we'd like to see his office.<eos> Suspect's cell is goin' straight to voice mail.<eos> Karl's a good man.<eos> That's what everybody says until they find a body in the basement. It's locked.<eos> I'll get security.<eos> No.<eos> We don't have time for that.<eos> Someone will have to pay for that.<eos> Karl Arnold will.
And without a father figure, poor mindy will grow up to be a stripper.<eos> A stripper?<eos> There's science to back that up.<eos> You know what?<eos> You go ahead and push the button on this day care thing, Lynette, and count Mindy in.<eos> Yeah,I'll handle Fran.<eos> You're doing the right thing, Ed, for little Mindy.<eos> yeah.<eos> dude,what if your mom walks in?<eos> She won't.
Edie, could you stop by the site?<eos> I've blueprints of the master bath.<eos> I'll see you in a few, Bill.<eos> My new contractor. We're sort of dating.<eos> Didn't you once say you never mix business with pleasure?<eos> No, I said never mix pleasure with commitment.<eos> Right.<eos> - What are you gonna do with the letter?<eos> - Would you open it up already?<eos> No, I won't.
- It's not about that.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I won't tell anyone. I'll keep your secret.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> But we're not moving.<eos> That's out of the question.<eos> I'm not leaving Julie. And if you want my support, that's the deal.<eos> - And if I refuse?<eos> - You won't.
Fonz, I wanted to pleasure Marion for our anniversary, but, as you know,<eos> - Oh, there we go.<eos> - Thank you, Arthur.<eos> Brian, will you carry me upstairs?<eos> I want to look at my toys.<eos> - No. I'm watching television.<eos> - Come on, I'm sick.<eos> All right. Come here.<eos> Oh, Todd, I feel like we'll never have a baby of our own!<eos> We will, Kelly.
But I don't want you to live a risk-free life. You shouldn't waste your heart on a dead man.<eos> He's letting you go,gwen.<eos> No. No,conor. No.<eos> That's why I have to go.<eos> What is he saying?<eos> What... he's leaving. Gwen, he's crossing over.<eos> Wait until after I go,and then tell her when she thinks of all the things we did... it'll remind her that love is possible.<eos> Conor...what?<eos> She'll find it again.<eos> I will.
O'Malley.<eos> I didn't cut the heart or the lungs<eos> Dr. Burke, I didn't cut the heart or the lungs!<eos> Good, good.<eos> Good.<eos> Good O'Malley.<eos> Really good.<eos> Now check for injuries and do a pericardiotomy.<eos> Uh I'll need some lap pads, forceps, metzenbaums and satinksy clamps.<eos> Yes you will.
- What if I say no?<eos> - Then I'm not moving here.<eos> Well, I guess we're at an impasse then.<eos> Dr. Yang.<eos> We never finished our conversation.<eos> Yes, we did.<eos> We decided we're not going to tell you-know-who about us.<eos> We decided?<eos> You're worried about your career and your reputation. What if he hears about us through the grapevine? - He doesn't have to hear at all.<eos> - He will.
He's gonna die 'cause he's too stubborn to make the right choice.<eos> Now we're in your territory.<eos> I'm respecting your husband's decision.<eos> I don't see why you've got a problem with that.<eos> Because it's crap.<eos> Because you browbeat patients, intimidate them, lie to them.<eos> If you think you're right, you don't give a damn what they think.<eos> I did what you do all the time. The only difference is, I did it to you.<eos> He'll never forgive you.<eos> Yeah. He will.
If you don't do the surgery, I'm gonna tell your wife that you've been sleeping with a series of nurses.<eos> Currently Nurse Cutler in Radiology.<eos> Now, what's 600 grand divided by two?<eos> Last Christmas party, Nurse Cutler handed you one of those little hot dogs.<eos> And you didn't thank her.<eos> Well, that only happens when you're very, very intimate.<eos> That, and the fact that you've been practically dancing around with your zipper open, and a used condom stuck on your shoe.<eos> Your wife is apparently the only one who doesn't know.<eos> There's no way you'll tell her.<eos> Of course I won't.
Are you afraid someone's gonna hear me yellin' about how I'm gonna take a piss?<eos> Hey! Stop it!<eos> I'll take him outside.<eos> For two... and another two.<eos> What could I possibly say to him, Tom?<eos> It has to be a miracle, and if he wants to tell the world about it, he should.<eos> I'm left-handed.<eos> - But who would believe him?<eos> - The faithful.<eos> No, they won't.
- I am not helping you with it.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> You know what, Dennis?<eos> We don't need her.<eos> - You're right.<eos> We don't need her.<eos> What we'll do is we'll find a girl for Charlie tonight in the bar.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - Yes, we will.
- You get it?<eos> It's a dead end.<eos> You're not getting in.<eos> We didn't find this by accident.<eos> - We're supposed...<eos> - We're supposed to find this, right?<eos> We're supposed to open it.<eos> Then tell me something. If we're supposed to open it, why haven't we opened it yet?<eos> - The island will send us a sign.<eos> - "The island will..."
But the case, they made him check it.<eos> What was in the case?<eos> Some travelling money. Some of his personal stuff. And four 9 millimetres with a few boxes of ammo.<eos> - Guns.<eos> - Guns.<eos> - So, where is the case now?<eos> - Sawyer has it.<eos> - He hasn't been able to open it.<eos> - Lucky for us.<eos> He will.
I tried.. I tried.. I tried to save him...<eos> I killed the witch, she's still there. Her body must be...<eos> I'm telling you the truth?<eos> Why don't you listen to me?<eos> That's classic paranoid schizophrenia.<eos> Brought on by the stress of graduate school, I imagine.<eos> Is he competent to stand trial?<eos> He is intelligent, but he is completely psychotic...<eos> He can't face what he's done.<eos> He probably never will.
...Donny used to be crazy.<eos> What would Jesus do?<eos> I forgive you.<eos> Really?<eos> Like I said before, Earl, prison changed my life.<eos> I mean, even if you hadn't of done what you did, I probably would have ended up there anyway.<eos> Cross me off your list.<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I will.
This is hard time.<eos> Every night... hard time.<eos> Tell us where Petty Officer Lambert's hiding.<eos> We'll cut you a deal.<eos> Minimum time in a Federal facility without nightly cavity searches.<eos> Aaron, if they had evidence of you doing something illegal-- which I know you didn't they wouldn't be talking deals.<eos> I have to listen to my lawyer.<eos> He's very expensive.<eos> When I find Petty Officer Lambert...<eos> And he will.
Starting a reverse search directory now.<eos> I'm glad you called.<eos> We were getting bored.<eos> Thought it would help to see your target in person tonight.<eos> He's here?<eos> You don't see him?<eos> Relax.<eos> I've been flying for over 20 hours.<eos> And the restaurant's packed.<eos> We will.
My dad didn't do anything.<eos> ...we are all friends and what do friends do? He told him he'd suffer.<eos> Everybody says it was an accident.<eos> But it wasn't.<eos> Was it?<eos> You're so lucky. I'd give anything to have a dad like yours.<eos> I know.<eos> And I know you're scared.<eos> But you've got to tell someone.<eos> - If you won't, I will.
- No, there's a story all right.<eos> It's a very sad, very human one, though.<eos> About a man abusing his son.<eos> You work that angle. That'll make Vincenzo happy.<eos> - And what are you going to do?<eos> - Try to keep someone else from dying.<eos> [Justin] You don't know what it's like.<eos> Your dad is so nice.<eos> You should tell somebody, Justin.<eos> If you won't, I will.
I'd say congratulations, except I have a pretty good idea who your source was.<eos> Carl! Perri! I wanna see both of you, now.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Who's your source?<eos> The one who got you on this story.<eos> You think I'd answer that question for him?<eos> It's not a question anymore, Carl. It's an order.<eos> The District Court ruled against the Beacon.<eos> - Well, then we'll appeal.<eos> - No, we won't. - Why not?
I know who you are, how big and strong and good you are.<eos> Let him go, baby.<eos> Just let him go.<eos> It's a quarter past. She said she'd be here at 4:00.<eos> It's called making us sweat.<eos> Look, we don't know why Ms. Rivers is coming.<eos> It may have nothing to do with the face mask.<eos> And if it does, we'll just play dumb and tell her to talk to our lawyer.<eos> We have a lawyer?<eos> We will.
I don't want to see that happen again to someone I love.<eos> I don't know who you are or what you're doing here but I am not going.<eos> Mom, please, you got to do this.<eos> Aren't you glad you got to come back for all this fun?<eos> Actually... I am.<eos> I'll put the bag in the car.<eos> I'll see you soon, sis.<eos> I'm so sorry that I put you both through this.<eos> - Just get better.<eos> - I will.
- Sure, what's up ?<eos> I don't know I'm just going a little crazy... cause I keep overhearing all these conversations... between Michael and corporate about like staff issues.<eos> - Oh no !<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He's making me take notes on his meetings, and I'm like, these people are my friends.<eos> - Right.<eos> - But he's all like this is confidential you can't tell anybody but..."<eos> I don't know I just feel like I want to...<eos> Just promise me you're gonna say anything.<eos> - I will not.
Check your pompons at the door.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> But if that's what everyone wants...<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> Brooke, Rachel's the best cheerleader we've got.<eos> If we want a shot at state, we need her.<eos> Look, I make the rules, and I say Haley's in.<eos> And besides, the routine won't even work with an extra person.<eos> Sure it will. Won't it, girls?
Joe...<eos> I, uh, I know I made some mistakes with you... but one day you're gonna have a boy of your own.<eos> Make sure he's a good man.<eos> I will.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too, son.<eos> - You all set? - Yeah.<eos> Hey, can I ask you a question?<eos> Why do you keep coming to see him if he's just not gonna remember?<eos> Because I will.
I'm his son, Andy.<eos> And look what he just did to his brother!<eos> This guy's got no conscience, Lucas.<eos> I think it's time you move back in with your mother.<eos> I can't!<eos> Come on, Andy.<eos> We're so close.<eos> You have to find out if I'm right, okay?<eos> If there's any chance that he's on to you, you have to get out.<eos> I will.
Well, let's hope I don't end up like Trigger. Well, let's hope I don't end up like Trigger.<eos> (Laughs) Oh, did you see this? (Laughs) Oh, did you see this? Justin's probably too modest to show you.<eos> Justin's probably too modest to show you. That's pretty impressive.<eos> That's pretty impressive. He says the house you bought is pretty impressive too. He says the house you bought is pretty impressive too.<eos> A swimming pool, stables... A swimming pool, stables... He's gonna have a fucking fabulous time<eos> He's gonna have a fucking fabulous time when he comes to visit his old man. when he comes to visit his old man. He could still have a fabulous time when he visits his old man<eos> He could still have a fabulous time when he visits his old man during the summer. during the summer. Your keeping us here isn't gonna make up for lost opportunities.<eos> Your keeping us here isn't gonna make up for lost opportunities. I want another chance. I want another chance.<eos> I want him to know who I am. I want him to know who I am.<eos> He will.
Mother forgives me?<eos> What if I don't forgive?<eos> Whatever you think she may have done, consider the possibility she did it out of love for you.<eos> I'll never forgive her.<eos> Be that as it may, your forgiveness is irrelevant.<eos> You must come home.<eos> I'm sorry. I will not.<eos> I don't want to use force.<eos> The priests will protect me.<eos> They won't.
She wiped the floor with Vic Feather, and he thought he was somebody!<eos> She worshipped you.<eos> And made the most pathetic excuses for you!<eos> I didn't realise you weren't autistic!<eos> Till you called me a cunt in suspiciously fitting circumstances!<eos> Oi! Down here!<eos> Here!<eos> Fuck's sake!<eos> She'll bar you permanently if she sees you.<eos> So she won't.
Admit it, you've fostered a pansy.<eos> Lip?<eos> What'sup,youfuckingpansy?<eos> No joy?<eos> It's only a matter of time. lt'll be OK.<eos> - What if it all turns bad, Steve?<eos> - lt won't.<eos> You nicked a copper's car!<eos> If they catch you, they'll screw you.<eos> - They won't.
Off you go, you two.<eos> Pint, please.<eos> A pint of what, Sheila?<eos> Just a pint.<eos> I'm not serving you, Frank.<eos> More than my job's worth.<eos> Christ's sake, give me the fucking Oscar.<eos> Come on, a quick one.<eos> Jess will never know.<eos> No, but they will.
I think Maya should stay with us.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - Yes, I do because<eos> - Maybe this isn't the time.<eos> - Well, she's not going to.<eos> You're gonna be very busy once the baby comes.<eos> You don't know what it's like with a new-born.<eos> No, but I think I'll figure it out.<eos> She'll probably end up staying with us when the baby comes anyway.<eos> No, she won't.
Really knows the ins and outs of the rules.<eos> I give him three-to-one odds to succeed.<eos> Wanna know the irony of it all?<eos> That device was originally used by the Ancients to create life in the Milky Way.<eos> Well, recreate it after the whole plague thing.<eos> No kidding.<eos> Now it all gets undone with the push of one button, leaving Anubis to recreate things all over to his own liking.<eos> There's a waste of a million-odd years of evolution, huh?<eos> I say someone should really do something to stop him!<eos> No one will.
I'll be in and out.<eos> The quickest way to figure out what is going on in there is to tap into the system and communicate directly with the Captain!<eos> Need I remind you of the obvious value in this?<eos> But is it safe?<eos> Would I be volunteering to go if it wasn't?<eos> No.<eos> Which is exactly what makes it safe enough for me to go.<eos> What?<eos> Better to have you on the outside, in case something goes wrong.<eos> - It won't!
But it would take significantly more power.<eos> We'll shut down everything we don't need.<eos> But it would take hours to reconfigure.<eos> Take what we need. We'll make the changes down there.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I cannot possibly...<eos> - Radek... - I... I can't even swim.<eos> There's not a lot of swimming under a thousand feet of ocean.<eos> Look, I'm not going to order you to go.<eos> I will.
Somebody hit me over the head<eos> And I rounded up just in time to see that thing turn into me.<eos> How is that even possible? Okay, okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Can you walk?<eos> Okay, we've got to hurry. Sam went to see you.<eos> What are you gonna do to me?<eos> I'm not gonna do anything.<eos> Dean will though.
Everybody knows it.<eos> I'm gonna prove these things exist.<eos> My little brother didn't die for nothing.<eos> Sure, buddy.<eos> Freak.<eos> A little late this time, Dr. Cirko.<eos> A lot of people saw it.<eos> How you gonna spin that one?<eos> We won't have to.<eos> Yeah, you will.
Maybe she cheated on him and she's pregnant. Oh.<eos> Steven, this TV producer called to tell me he loved my public access show.<eos> And then he offered me a job at his station in Chicago starting next week. Whoa.<eos> Um, you're gonna take a job and move to Chicago?<eos> No, no, not yet.<eos> No, I wanted to talk to you about it first.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> This is "serious" serious, not funny serious.<eos> We should probably leave.<eos> But we won't.
Yeah, I love catholic schoolgirls.<eos> They don't teach sex ed, so they don't know what not to do.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Uh, but I never really got together with any of 'em.<eos> Wait, you never...<eos> Okay, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Everyone, wait.<eos> Before you start in on him, let me just say, when I was a virgin, all I wanted was for one person to say it was okay.<eos> And no one did.<eos> - Neither will I. - Freak!
But as Heidi's parents, tonight it is our responsibility to look out for all of you.<eos> There's not gonna be any drinking, no pot, and most importantly, if I catch any boys anywhere near this party, they're gonna be in a world of hurt.<eos> All right, have a nice time, girls<eos> So, what do you guys wanna do first?<eos> We could play "girl talk."<eos> I brought the new Justin Timberlake CD. We should dance to it.<eos> How about we read each other's futures?<eos> I know. Let's do "Light as a feather, stiff as a board."<eos> Who wants to go first?<eos> I will.
Come on.<eos> Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?<eos> Professor Snape.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - Professor Snape.<eos> Professor Snape.<eos> Yes, frightens all.<eos> And, I believe you live with your grandmother.<eos> Yes, but I don't want that boggart to turn into her, either.<eos> No it won't.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.<eos> Alive, you're free.<eos> Turn me into a flobberworm.<eos> Anything but the dementors!<eos> Ron!<eos> Haven't I been a good friend? good pet?<eos> You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?<eos> I was your rat!<eos> - Sweet girl, clever girl!<eos> Surely you won't...
- A play?<eos> - A play indeed, yes.<eos> And I would be extremely honoured if you would allow me the use of your name for one of the characters.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Say yes.<eos> Good man.<eos> Porthos!<eos> That's mine. Let go.<eos> I won't go to bed.<eos> I won't, I won't.
Right. Now my nightmare is complete.<eos> You can start your play now.<eos> Your play.<eos> Get them in the scattered seats.<eos> Excuse me, sir. This way.<eos> Looks like we got one of the better-dressed ones.<eos> I just want you to know, I think you're a wonderful dog.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I won't go to bed.<eos> I won't.
Great.<eos> And how am I supposed to get home?<eos> You...<eos> I...<eos> Tomorrow you're coming with us You're going to take dinne r at a friend's place.<eos> Come on, Deep.<eos> You gotta play better D if you want to win.<eos> Play defense with your feet, not like Bobby.<eos> I wish Bobby could play with us.<eos> - He will... soon.
Thank you!<eos> Those are the gallery bandits!<eos> The scoundrel stole my purse!<eos> My bag!<eos> We've stolen that old lady's purse<eos> We must help Passepartout!<eos> How do I make this go lower?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Decreasing the overall weight won't work<eos> Yes, it will!
When he's lying in the dust, signal to attack.<eos> You'll have your city. I'll have my revenge.<eos> So be it.<eos> I accept your challenge.<eos> And tonight, I'll drink to your bones.<eos> -My lord.<eos> -Back to the line!<eos> Make him swing and miss. He'll tire.<eos> Brother if I fall, tell Helen- - Tell her--<eos> I will.
- Hey, man, how are you?<eos> - What's up?<eos> Hey.<eos> This way.<eos> Doesn't it hurt, smiling like that all the time?<eos> You get used to it.<eos> - Should I do it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You might not be able to hold it long, but go for it.<eos> Sure I will.
What are you reading?<eos> José Martí.<eos> It was my father's.<eos> We got rid of all his books just to be safe, but...<eos> I kept this one.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Javier?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - If we don't win the finals--<eos> - We will.
You don't talk, but you make yourself understood.<eos> Nice speech about spurned desire.<eos> What a Freudian slip!<eos> I shouldn't have come.<eos> Lucky she came in.<eos> There are things that kill desire.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Wait for the first train at 6.<eos> - Paul won't know.<eos> - Won't he?
Sadly, you could not belong to them<eos> All your life you've been playing the policeman in Khaki<eos> So... after you are gone, I'll take care of the mother and daughter<eos> Mac, aim at his temple<eos> If the DCP moves, make a sieve out of all of them<eos> Slap your boss<eos> No<eos> I won't<eos> If you don't, his head will be blown off<eos> I won't
Yes! Very good. OK.<eos> Now you give Sarah a bounce pass.<eos> Come on, Sarah.<eos> Come on. Come on, sweetie.<eos> "Section 5."<eos> "Custody and care of the Davis children."<eos> "An account and trust has been set up at Maplewood Savings Bank, in the names of Audrey, Henry and Sarah Davis."<eos> "This bank also holds the mortgage on the Davis property at 207, Oak Street."<eos> Yes, Larry, and that mortgage is quite large. We do need to talk about that, also.<eos> We will.
I mean, what the hell is this all about?<eos> I think I should talk to my father.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> From this point on, it gets confusing.<eos> I just need to see him.<eos> Taylor, we've got to know what happened.<eos> You can tell us. But I can't.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Bullshit, you can't.<eos> You won't.
You make a fool of me and everyone here.<eos> You put that cat poo in your mouth.<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes!<eos> - No!<eos> - Sí!<eos> - I will not eat cat poop.<eos> - You will do it immediately!<eos> - No!<eos> - You will!
I got a surprise for you.<eos> It's windowpane.<eos> For clarity of vision.<eos> Chin-chin.<eos> She's my favourite.<eos> Yeah, she's a beauty.<eos> - How you feeling?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Tell me when you feel more than okay.<eos> - I will.
- Gambling?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How much do you have?<eos> - Who does he owe it to?<eos> - This guy.<eos> This Russian guy.<eos> If I were you, I'd get a new old man.<eos> I gotta do something.<eos> They might kill him.<eos> They probably will.
We found them on her body.<eos> She was still wired up when she was killed.<eos> Guess sometimes you just get lucky on an investigation, huh?<eos> - You're sure you're okay with this?<eos> - Can't wait. Okay...<eos> It's only until we're inside. Across the threshold, so to speak.<eos> Till you've hid your girlfriend's knickers, you mean.<eos> - Look, I know how this looks.<eos> - So do we, Veil.<eos> So will the jury.
- I know..<eos> I'm really proud of you.<eos> Do the fireflies in L.A.?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Maybe I could take some with.<eos> Mommy, it's your last chance.<eos> I swear I leave tomorrow.<eos> I do not believe in you...<eos> And that was the agreement.<eos> - I will.
-And Mikhail?<eos> -Here.<eos> -You mean not together?<eos> -Not here, Djamel.<eos> We could push the beds together.<eos> No.<eos> -Why not?<eos> -Take a wild guess.<eos> -She won't hear anything.<eos> -Yes, she will.
Connie.<eos> - Baby, I can't do this tonight.<eos> - Do what, Emery?<eos> What?<eos> Some man attacks you out of the clear blue and I'm the only concerned one.<eos> - He didn't attack me.<eos> He just punched me.<eos> I walked up from behind him so he would've hit anybody.<eos> - What if he comes back?<eos> - He won't.
Get out!<eos> Want him to become what you've become?<eos> You think it's romantic?<eos> It's how it should be?<eos> Get out!<eos> Have some water.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They said I shouldn't leave you.<eos> So I won't.
-No, and I hate myself.<eos> I don't know what got into me.<eos> I was fed up living in this hole.<eos> Punish me as you want.<eos> I don't want to punish you!<eos> What should I do?<eos> Tell everyone how badly I hurt you?<eos> I, Nicole Shushan, am trashy and stupid...<eos> Stop it!<eos> -I won't!
- She didn't tell me anything. - Too bad.<eos> She says she doesn't want you here... when she gets back because you've been ruining everybody's lives and eatin' all our steak.<eos> - I'm not goin' anywhere, Napoleon.<eos> - Get off my property!<eos> It's a free country.<eos> I can do whatever I want.<eos> Get off my property, or I'll call the cops on you.<eos> Well, then do it.<eos> Go on.<eos> Maybe I will.
Mamma, I thought you wouldn't make it<eos> I was held up I thought I'd miss your flight.<eos> But Karan took care of everything<eos> Friend's colony?<eos> I live in Friends Colony too<eos> Sorry, I lied. Actually I live in Kailash Colony<eos> But now that we've met Let's meet up more<eos> No use<eos> You'll end up taking her out, splurging on her... And when you're dropping her home you'll hope she asks you in for coffee<eos> She won't
- God, it can't be.<eos> - Overbearing fathers-in-law!<eos> - They have a reputation to live up to.<eos> - Congressman is doing just fine.<eos> He's a miserable, bitter man who deeply regrets... some of the decisions and choices he's made in his life.<eos> He's unforgiving of himself and others.<eos> Instead of buying you a drink last night, he let you stew all alone.<eos> He doesn't think I belong at the table with the rest of you.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I will.
- Okay. - Okay. - Don't wander too far.<eos> - I wanna go now.<eos> It's spooky here. It's home to the dead.<eos> Maybe the doctors are vampires.<eos> - You read too many stupid comic books.<eos> - Yeah, well, did you see her?<eos> Do you really think she's getting better?<eos> [Sniffling] I need new clothes for school.<eos> Who's gonna take me shopping?<eos> - I will.
More like the Wilt Chamberlain sisters.<eos> I never noticed how big they are.<eos> But I'd still bone.<eos> My God.<eos> There's Heath.<eos> Dude, are you hitting Karen Googlestein, the soap heiress, too?<eos> How do you keep that shit dangling?<eos> I keep telling her I'm going to break up with my girl.<eos> You better hope Heather doesn't find out.<eos> She won't.
We've been cloned!<eos> He's got to be around here somewhere.<eos> Girl, wait a minute.<eos> Isn't that Marcus right there?<eos> -That's him, all right.<eos> Old lying dog!<eos> -Caught you.<eos> That sounds like Gina.<eos> -Don't answer it. She'll go away.<eos> -No, she won't.
Goddess Durga is going outside..<eos> - She knows everything...<eos> You know nothing...<eos> - Stop cutting your teeth in me.<eos> - Teeth can't be cut.<eos> I Want to tell you something.<eos> - Tell me...<eos> Listen Dad has arranged a Job for you.<eos> Will you do it?<eos> I will.
- Me? Ralph, I'm supposed to be a nun.<eos> And all I was trying to do was help you with a miracle.<eos> And now look what you've done.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Wake up! Wake up!<eos> Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Ralph!<eos> What are you doing? I thought the music might wake her up.<eos> - Well, it won't.
- It's totally pointless. - Really.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, you can do it like this.<eos> - Or... - Yeah. ...like this.<eos> This is Nick's favorite.<eos> - I can't believe you know all this stuff.<eos> - I'm a 14-year-old sexpert.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Put it on your college application.<eos> - I will. I will.
- Hallbera, don't keep me waiting.<eos> Fire will rain down from the sky very soon.<eos> - And the light of that fire... will reveal your destiny.<eos> So far from home.<eos> What destiny could I have here?<eos> After the fire a man will come, a man as strong as you.<eos> The warrior's strength will match your own.<eos> He'll even beat you in battle.<eos> No one's ever done that before.<eos> No one else ever will.
It's beautiful in the snow.<eos> Look in the bag with punchies in that Tibetan closet.<eos> Try there.<eos> So, door's shut.<eos> Simon was pretty cool with my flings?<eos> I tried to keep in mind his sensitivities?<eos> Fifteen minutes.<eos> The walls are thin so don't make too much noise.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> No we won't.
OK, he doesn't care who you are, Dorian!<eos> He only cares who he is and this will mean that he's the father of a homosexual.<eos> And that's going to freak him out!<eos> Well, I'm not going to be here for it.<eos> You know, some families actually grow stronger from this sort of thing.<eos> Oh yeah, we're a really good candidate for that.<eos> You tell your news, Dad will drink til he drops and Mom will be up until two o'clock in the morning dusting knick-knacks and humming to herself like a mental patient.<eos> Yeah, we're really going to grow stronger.<eos> Don't you tell him I knew.<eos> - I won't.
Sorry, boss.<eos> Maybe if I'd stopped her back in Gunn's office--<eos> - Did she toss you out a window? - No.<eos> - Then you're one up on me.<eos> Hey, what do you got?<eos> - Smoke and mirrors.<eos> - No trace of either of them.<eos> - Put tactical on Code Black.<eos> - If Illyria shows up again--<eos> - She won't.
Blood. But it's not his. It's...<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I think God is out at the moment. GUNN:<eos> Why would Greenway do this?<eos> It was just a stupid racketeering charge. I told him we'd get him off with probation if he shut down.<eos> He's a Wolfram and Hart client. Our client.<eos> Oh, and he's evil. What are the odds?<eos> - What do we do now? ANGEL: Now?<eos> I find Greenway and I kill every inch of him. WESLEY:<eos> You won't.
- Hi.<eos> - D-plus.<eos> Sign this.<eos> - This is a D-minus.<eos> - Either way, it's above a "D," right?<eos> - Another world-beater.<eos> And Lindsay realized she needed to take a firmer hand with her daughter.<eos> - I'm not signing this.<eos> - Fine.<eos> I will.
Surprise, about you.<eos> We were going to...<eos> You know what, it's not important.<eos> - I don't want that to... - You were engaged, right?<eos> You did it because you were engaged.<eos> Because I made a mistake.<eos> And because I was just... I was so in love with him.<eos> And I let that get in the way of doing my job. He just wanted it so much and I didn't want to be the one who crushed him.<eos> Reinstate the trainees to flight status.<eos> I will.
They're trying to destroy your work.<eos> Destroying you is an added bonus.<eos> But why?<eos> I don't understand. Why are they trying to blow me up?<eos> You told me what to do. I wouldn't be making this Cylon detector if it wasn't for you.<eos> But I'm just in your head, Gaius. They don't know about me or us or our life together.<eos> How romantic.<eos> I'm going to have to destroy that Cylon detector myself. Blame the sabotage on Cylon agents.<eos> That's what I'll tell Adama.<eos> No, you won't.
So I had a couple of drinks tonight.<eos> I was celebrating. I think I deserved to...<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> Launching those fighters on a hunch. You saved our ship.<eos> Just doing my job.<eos> You do your job good.<eos> That's why I need you, Saul.<eos> That, and that we're friends.<eos> I don't want anything to come between that, not even Ellen.<eos> It won't.
If the gas giant pulled her in, its radiation would fry her like an egg.<eos> What about the moon?<eos> The spectroscope people call the atmosphere as CO2, methane, some argon. The clouds are mostly hydrocarbons.<eos> Cold as hell down there, but she'd survive on the surface.<eos> - Until her oxygen runs out.<eos> - When?<eos> Forty-six hours and change, sir.<eos> Hell of a long time to stay in one place.<eos> - What if the Cylons appear?<eos> - They won't, not for a while.
- Oh, I couldn't deal with all that.<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> All the shouting and the blaming.<eos> No, be very messy.<eos> No, now, listen.<eos> Oi, you don't tell him.<eos> - Don't you ever tell him.<eos> - No.<eos> - No, Manny, I mean it.<eos> - I won't.
I'm never doing anything for anyone again.<eos> I'm not thinking about Jason.<eos> Or what he's doing.<eos> I've spent my whole time not thinking about him since he left.<eos> - I wish I could have a cup of tea.<eos> - Oh, for God's...<eos> Oh.<eos> Make it yourse...<eos> - I'll get the tea.<eos> - No, I will, Jason.
Whatever you're thinking, it's not gonna work.<eos> You're not gonna get away with it.<eos> Don't worry, I'll act surprised.<eos> I don't want you forget that I actually prefer chocolate cake with white icing.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay!<eos> I'll keep that in mind.<eos> - I better go.<eos> - Yeah, just hurry back.<eos> Okay, I will.
You are making a catastrophic mistake.<eos> You've made your share of mistakes.<eos> -This isn't one of them. -Send me back.<eos> Send me back now!<eos> Take this.<eos> It's Xindi... a family medal that belongs to one of the crewmen on this ship.<eos> There are Xindi serving aboard Enterprise-J.<eos> Why are you giving this to me?<eos> In case you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
- What's on Tuesday?<eos> Well, it's the town selectman elections, and we're desperate.<eos> Lane's band is playing, and I'll give you a button.<eos> - I'll be there.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know I'm a sucker for a good button.<eos> - Thanks, kid.<eos> - Tell Jackson I'm rooting for him.<eos> - I will.
Yeah. Of course.<eos> She's gonna be fine.<eos> You know, I was never gonna dump her.<eos> I was avoiding her a little.<eos> It got too hard. I got scared.<eos> Hey, these are intense feelings, Adam.<eos> Processing them at your age... yeah, but she saw me at the bottom, Mrs. G.<eos> Crying and complaining and scared.<eos> How's she gonna forget that?<eos> She won't
Robert didn't notice it was missing, either, when I shot him.<eos> - But you loved him.<eos> - He was sick.<eos> Sick?<eos> It took them one after the other.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> They were already lost.<eos> - What would have happened if we were rescued?<eos> I couldn't let that happen.<eos> I won't!
- The right thing.<eos> - Look, Lizzie, if this is your way of asking for a raise, it worked.<eos> Hey, how much do you want?<eos> I don't want money, Roddy.<eos> I'm not you. All right, you don't want money.<eos> What do you want? I want to be able to sleep at night. I want to be able to be proud of the show the way I used to be.<eos> What are you going to do, slip it under the producer's door anonymously?<eos> Didn't even have the courage to write your own name on it.<eos> Aw, Lizzie, all right, look, I'm sorry. - Hey, it'll never happen again.<eos> - Damn right it won't. Okay, okay.
Now!<eos> And turn off the damn noise!<eos> You got his age, Mcgee? / Um...<eos> - why, I just got the...<eos> - Yes or no?<eos> No.<eos> But if you give me a minute, I will, I think.<eos> You think?<eos> No.<eos> Definitely I will.
You're damn right I will.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Sure.<eos> So, you want to talk about last night?<eos> What's there to talk about?<eos> You tried to hurt your dad by ending up on the cover of some gossip rag.<eos> The motorcade doesn't leave for another 15 minutes.<eos> Why don't you talk to him?<eos> Thanks, Nicole.<eos> I will.
I'm not gonna give up on you.<eos> She left.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - I know.<eos> Can't you just forgive me?<eos> How?<eos> I don't know if we should be together.<eos> I mean, look how easy it was for someone to come into our lives, come between us.<eos> - How do I know it won't happen again?<eos> - It won't.
Hey.<eos> I'm sorry to bother you so early...<eos> Nathan and I had a fight last night and he didn't come home and...<eos> I talked to him.<eos> He's okay.<eos> Oh well, do you know where he is?<eos> - No.<eos> - Okay, well...<eos> The next time you talk to him, can you... ask him to come home please?<eos> Okay, I will.
Is everything okay?<eos> I'm Kirsten Cohen.<eos> Renee Wheeler.<eos> Hi.<eos> Renee is a witness in your father's case.<eos> Let's go out back where we can talk.<eos> We won't be long.<eos> I shouldn't be talking to you.<eos> If anyone finds out...<eos> They won't.
He had a heart attack.<eos> Haley, have you seen my gray T-shirt?<eos> I want to do something, okay.<eos> Haley....<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> -I could love you forever.<eos> You're my family now, Haley.<eos> The only true thing I have.<eos> I never want to lose you.<eos> You won't.
The ravens grab the rebound and push it up court.<eos> Tim Smith passes to Lucas Scott, over to Nathan Scott for the slam!<eos> I see the Ravens are finally working together.<eos> Go ravens!<eos> You know you can trust me.<eos> Brooke, it's really important to me that Nikki never finds out where Jake took Jenny.<eos> I know it's important to you, Peyton.<eos> That's why you can trust me with this.<eos> But she still hasn't told you?<eos> No, but she will.
How were the auditions?<eos> You should not have given that music to Peyton.<eos> -She liked it, didn't she? -Yeah.<eos> -But I'm mad.<eos> -Hales, you wouldn't hear it from me.<eos> Besides, I'm supposed to believe in you when you don't believe in yourself.<eos> That's what you've always done for me.<eos> -Okay, I'm not mad anymore.<eos> -So then you'll play?<eos> I will. Okay, maybe I will.
Why did you do that?<eos> Just trying to spread the magic.<eos> You know, maybe next year we all should go.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Brian, how about you?<eos> I'd rather have my tongue super-glued to a lesbian's twat.<eos> Besides, I'm going to be way too busy with my new business.<eos> And, uh, my new account.<eos> The "Circus of Porn" account isn't exactly going to buy you a summer home in P-town.<eos> But the Remson Pharmaceuticals account will.
What are you reading?<eos> Your horoscope?<eos> Huh. The new Auerbach mural.<eos> Ah. I stopped by yesterday to take a peek.<eos> Pretty amazing.<eos> I've always loved his work.<eos> He's always evolving and always challenging himself.<eos> Hey, Sidney, what would you think of doing an exhibit of his work in conjunction with the mural?<eos> It'd be a dream come true.<eos> Except that it won't.
Come home here, and dealing with this shit across the street.<eos> I just feel like everything-- everything good in my life is just... sliding away, and there's nothing I can do about it.<eos> Jesus, Tommy.<eos> What?<eos> How big a pussy are you?<eos> I had something taken away from me, my husband, but the things you want, they're here.<eos> All you have to do is fight for them.<eos> Grow a pair of balls, why don't you?<eos> And talk to Damian.<eos> I will.
You fixed the Todd ?<eos> Well, without regular therapy, it'll probably only last... a week.<eos> So...you're mad at me.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Oh! You're not mad at me!<eos> Why did you just close your eyes at me?<eos> I've never been able to wink. Ohh.<eos> I'm not mad. Cool!<eos> You're obviously very stubborn and very proud, but you're nice so eventually you're gonna tell me.<eos> - No, I won't.
He told you he has too many patients. He's swamped.<eos> The kid screwed up.<eos> OK. Darn kid!<eos> And guilt can lead to compromise.<eos> Turk is doing this sweet thing for me, and...<eos> Men's room.<eos> I just wish there was something I could do for him.<eos> You know what, sweetie? I'm fine with getting rid of this mole but you gotta be willing to take my last name when we get married.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> Of course I will.
Yes, sorry, Lip. lt's been a bit of an off day today, hasn't it, Karen?<eos> So. Vodka, some tonic.<eos> Plenty of rum but we're out of blackcurrant.<eos> - And gin.<eos> - Just coffee, Mum.<eos> - (Tearfully) And a few lagers.<eos> - Lager would be great.<eos> Cheers.<eos> - What if your dad comes back?<eos> - He won't.
And you are happy that we found you when you were looking for your mam on the street?<eos> You'd no idea where she belongs, so you brought her here.<eos> So that we could help you.<eos> No.<eos> She had a party badge on.<eos> - Why'd you take her?<eos> - She was crying for her mum.<eos> Where was her mum?<eos> Nobody cared!<eos> They will now!
- But what?<eos> - I had to twist his arm.<eos> You better make me look good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Well, wait a minute. What's the gig?<eos> AGC car company is doing a bunch of scams.<eos> We need you to go after the owner as Harriet Homemaker.<eos> All right, I took Home Ec.<eos> Let me know when I can ditch the uniform.<eos> Sure will.
I'm gonna go check on the laundry.<eos> All right, look.<eos> The Strike Team, that's your gig, okay?<eos> You and Vic, you established it, everyone knows that.<eos> I just wanna add what I can to the mix.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> But I don't wanna be along for the ride if I'm not wanted.<eos> I wasn't trying to be a dick.<eos> Me and Vic built this thing and I don't want somebody coming in and screwing it up.<eos> I won't.
Oh, I'm so much happier when I'm high.<eos> I got your eyes.<eos> That's so scary.<eos> I wish you could see this. Well, get my camera.<eos> It's right over there.<eos> How's the light in here? good, we're good.<eos> Pucker up. Yeah.<eos> The problem is not nuclear war. The problem is what's gonna cause nuclear war.<eos> I don't see us living through a nuclear war, george.<eos> Of course no not a whole lot of people will.
I keep thinking any minute something terrible will happen.<eos> It's already happening.<eos> - Yes, I know, but...<eos> - Our days are numbered. It's only a matter of time.<eos> But I truly believe if we prepare...<eos> Don't be naive, George.<eos> You weren't brought up that way.<eos> - There's no hope.<eos> Even if it's true, I can't give up.<eos> No. No, I won't.
I know what a friend is.<eos> A friend is someone who would stand up for you and protect you.<eos> A friend is someone who would jump in a river to save you from drowning... even if it meant they had to give up their own life for you.<eos> You don't need to tell me... what it means to be a friend.<eos> Then you know that a friend would never keep me locked up in here.<eos> Get used to it.<eos> I did.<eos> People are going to come looking for me.<eos> No.<eos> They won't.
That's OK. You might faint again.<eos> It's just not working any more. It doesn't work on you either.<eos> I meant it wasn't gonna let you die.<eos> It is a coincidence that it stopped working now. I need a drink.<eos> Go.<eos> You always told me I shouldn't be afraid of the dark.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> I can't sleep now.<eos> What if the darkness comes?<eos> It won't.
I have made my recommendation to the Council and they've agreed.<eos> We have already begun inoculating our people.<eos> You're leaving?<eos> Unless you'll go back to formula on the serum, there's no point in my staying.<eos> Re-open the project.<eos> With more work we could prevent the mutation, maintain it as a defensive drug.<eos> Merell is dead.<eos> The cause of death is still to be determined.<eos> - They need to stop the inoculations.<eos> - They won't.
- We could destroy this facility.<eos> You're supposed to be working on solutions.<eos> We think the jumper must be damaged for this to have happened.<eos> Ancient systems are too advanced for pilot error.<eos> So we can't rule out a catastrophic power feedback in the drive manifold.<eos> Without the technobabble.<eos> There's a very slim chance that when the control is interrupted and the pod damaged, the main drive could overload.<eos> She means to say explode.<eos> Especially if McKay starts nosing around inside the control conduits.<eos> And he will.
You probably don't remember this, but when your mother...<eos> This is where we...<eos> We could have her moved somewhere else if it would make it easier.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I shouldn't have let her go.<eos> There's nothing you could've done.<eos> Mugged.<eos> God, if I could just have it to do over again.<eos> You should talk to them.<eos> I will.
It's the end of the line, Maggie.<eos> Please, Nick.<eos> I promise I won't tell anyone what I know.<eos> You're right.<eos> You won't.
- I was trying to protect you.<eos> - I didn't need you to protect me.<eos> I never did.<eos> What I needed was for you to let me in. To be a part of your life.<eos> But now...<eos> God, after this...<eos> Luc, please.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> It will.<eos> Maybe not the same way, but it will.
I'm going to go get Jake, but I'll leave the front door unlocked in case Satan shows up to collect your soul.<eos> Wait a minute. Alan?<eos> I gotta put you on hold a sec, Tiff.<eos> How come Judith's not bringing him over? I don't know.<eos> Judith asked me to do it, and I just got tired of arguing.<eos> She still busting your chops about what Jake said?<eos> Look, blame it on me.<eos> - Tell her I'm sorry.<eos> - She won't buy it.<eos> Sure she will.
After we fight, you will.<eos> Sue, she's a hag from hell.<eos> Where do I have a beam in the middle of my house, just sitting there?<eos> You got it in every corner, on the bottom...<eos> Yeah, connected to a wall.<eos> How I made it to 48 without Sue Hawk leading me by the hand is a mystery.<eos> Tom.<eos> You do your half, I'll do my half thing.<eos> The tree's coming down, Tom. You can do it, then.<eos> I will.
Grandpa has an even smaller hat.<eos> It kind of goes to the ranking in which you are in the organization.<eos> So this means I'm the boss.<eos> Nicole and I are going to get hats this big.<eos> Yeah, we want a big, big hat.<eos> Those girls appear to be relatively intelligent, and I kind of rule with an iron hand, so what I say is gonna go.<eos> Let's put on some britches.<eos> That's hot.<eos> Nicole, the bulls are not going to care how beautiful you are.<eos> Yeah, they will.
My friend is worse.<eos> -I'm sorry.<eos> -Yeah, thanks for asking.<eos> It's nice.<eos> You're nice.<eos> I can't believe you voted for Reagan.<eos> -I hope he gets better.<eos> -Reagan?<eos> -Your friend.<eos> -He won't.
life goes on, and... it matters what you do, Donald.<eos> It matters so much what we all do, more than it has ever mattered.<eos> He paced until daybreak on the right side of the line.<eos> His faith stayed.<eos> His life didn't change.<eos> - He won't ever know.<eos> - Betrayal is betrayal, whether the betrayed knows it or not.<eos> I didn't kiss him before he died.<eos> I didn't hug him.<eos> Now I never will.
There's no leaving this city.<eos> Help must come to us.<eos> It must be getting near teatime.<eos> Leastways, it would be in decent places where there is still teatime.<eos> We're not in decent places.<eos> Mr. Frodo?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's just a feeling.<eos> I don't think I'll be coming back.<eos> Yes, you will. Of course you will.
Grant their request.<eos> We are in the middle of repairing and rearming this ship.<eos> We can't afford to lose a single man off the line to start caring for refugees.<eos> We have 50,000 people out there. Some of them are hurt.<eos> Our priority has to be caring for refugees--<eos> My priority is preparing this ship for combat.<eos> In case you haven't heard, there's a war on.<eos> Colonel... the war is over, and we lost.<eos> - We'll see about that.<eos> - Oh, yes, we will.
The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her and the end of your species.<eos> As you adequately put, the problem is choice.<eos> But we already know what you are going to do, don't we?<eos> Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal the onset of an emotion designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.<eos> An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple and obvious truth:<eos> She is going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it.<eos> Hope.<eos> It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness.<eos> If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.<eos> We won't.
How many of them you can help?<eos> I will have a meeting in the headquarter.<eos> CAPO has checked the guy is called Shing.<eos> If it proofs that it was done by these three guy, I will definitely remove them.<eos> If we dealt with him first, all would be fine.<eos> Wong Sir.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> May has just arrested a guy. The suspect is sending to the Serious Violence and Crime Unit.<eos> - Isn't it that wanted person Shing?<eos> We will off duty in thirty minutes.
You're wrong.<eos> It's a Captain Amazing compass.<eos> - How much you want for it?<eos> - It's not for sale.<eos> No way. Sorry.<eos> - Wanna play some ball?<eos> - No. You play ball.<eos> I gotta check this entire beach if I'm gonna make my car payment.<eos> - You've got a car?<eos> - No, but I will.
This is... nothing's going on here.<eos> Great, Tom.<eos> I'm glad you think I'm a complete idiot.<eos> No, no. I'm telling you.<eos> I was just checking these girls for breast cancer.<eos> You make me sick.<eos> - No...<eos> Lisa, wait!<eos> She's never gonna forgive me.<eos> - Of course she will.
- Hmm, yes!"<eos> - Well..<eos> - Yes.<eos> "Well, you decide. you decide...<eos> Grace, they say you are having some trouble here."<eos> No.<eos> No more trouble than back home.<eos> I'll give you a little time to think about this.<eos> - Perhaps you will change your mind.<eos> - I won't.
Well by the time this day closes you will be with the blessed Savior in his glory.<eos> I... I will be an infinite gainer to be translated.<eos> General Lee.<eos> What is the news, Reverend?<eos> General Lee, I must report that his case appears hopeless.<eos> His wounds are healing, but he's dying of pneumonia.<eos> Surely General Jackson must recover.<eos> God will not take him from us, not now that we need him so very much.<eos> Will you see him, sir?<eos> No, sir, I won't. No, sir.
Isn't that what it's like every day, brother?<eos> Come on, isn't it?<eos> Yes, Father!<eos> Yes, it is!<eos> There is so much blood on me, Father!<eos> So, brother, kneel down.<eos> Come on, kneel down!<eos> Will you accept Jesus?<eos> Will you accept Jesus?<eos> Will you?
-We're on our way.<eos> Here's the seating chart and Spencer's list of groomsmen.<eos> Oh, I almost forgot.<eos> I spoke to him about reading the poem.<eos> He'd rather not.<eos> I said all right.<eos> Excuse us for a second, Joan.<eos> A good wife lets her husband think that everything's his idea... -...even when it's not.<eos> -I don't care if he reads it.<eos> You will in retrospect.
- To shoot me?<eos> - They hang women.<eos> Shut up and move!<eos> Free me and I'll tell you the Aquitaine password.<eos> I know it God help us.<eos> - Picardy?<eos> - God be with us. - Burgundy?<eos> - Glory to God. I know them all.<eos> Franche-Comté God bless.<eos> Champagne God wills it, etc.
Oh, God!<eos> Please, I don't wanna go.<eos> Please, Frank...<eos> - What are we gonna do?<eos> - We gotta go to the police.<eos> How are we gonna go to the police?<eos> We're in the middle of nowhere.<eos> - Come on. Let's go, honey.<eos> - We can't leave him here.<eos> No, we won't.
It's alive.<eos> Sometimes I get my dreams messed up with being real life too, you know.<eos> - That could be it.<eos> - No.<eos> That wasn't it, Dale.<eos> So what then, our house is haunted?<eos> No, not the house.<eos> The dark.<eos> What happens when the batteries give out?<eos> - They won't.
I used to like to hear the music from the house as I was walking down the street.<eos> It was really pretty.<eos> It was?<eos> It was always the same record.<eos> It was the Mule Serenade.<eos> It was really pretty.<eos> Take care of yourself, Dad, okay?<eos> Yeah, you too.<eos> And remember to send me the girls' shoe sizes, okay?<eos> Yeah, I will.
- Rodrigo?<eos> ! - ...if I were your enemy.<eos> - How, .. how did you escape?<eos> You do recognize this dagger?<eos> It's your sister Urraca's!<eos> She's the one who killed your brother!<eos> Alfonso: How dare you!<eos> You can't escape!<eos> My guards will arrest you!<eos> - No, they won't!
You best thank God instead.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> We'll... give that a try.<eos> Well, I expect you men are hungry.<eos> Button just ate.<eos> I thought I'd make myself some breakfast.<eos> Two more mouths wouldn't be any bother.<eos> I'm just gonna change. You.<eos> You should try to sleep.<eos> He will.
Please tell her we've done all we can.<eos> I've no more to give.<eos> At this stage?<eos> - When should I tell her?<eos> - You'll ruin the marriage.<eos> - lmagine we never helped her. - That's rich.<eos> Yes, I'm getting out now.<eos> I won't tell her, I'm not so cruel.<eos> - You...<eos> - I won't.
Father?<eos> Yes, son?<eos> - I don't think they want me.<eos> - Oh, no, they do.<eos> They do, son.<eos> They came a long way for you.<eos> Then can I go with them?<eos> I will still have to speak with them.<eos> Then can you tell them I'm an angel?<eos> I will.
Yes, son?<eos> - I don't think they want me.<eos> - Oh, no, they do.<eos> They do, son.<eos> They came a long way for you.<eos> Then can I go with them?<eos> I will still have to speak with them.<eos> Then can you tell them I'm an angel?<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
He's a very clever, talented person, you know.<eos> He's artistic and gentle.<eos> He's a very sweet man.<eos> And he's just, you know, very weak as well.<eos> I'm gonna leave this tonight, I can't concentrate on it.<eos> You know, in two or three years...<eos> I hope I'm gonna be able to support us properly.<eos> And then I'm gonna have a child with him before it's too late.<eos> -Does he want that?<eos> -Yeah, he will.
Well, since you're going to be here a while, I think I should read this script.<eos> See what it is you want so badly.<eos> Please do.<eos> Maybe you can make some sense of it.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> No gloves.<eos> Don't need 'em.<eos> Dickie, you promised to help me with my pep squad tryouts.<eos> Oh, I will.
You can't get to the gate without a ticket!<eos> Did you see him go through security...?<eos> My daughter was there today!<eos> - I'm not the one who pimped her... - What?<eos> I'm not the one who pimped her into the fucking grift!<eos> I'm not the one who put her at risk.<eos> She put us at risk!<eos> - How?<eos> - What if he goes to the cops?<eos> - He won't.
- No. One glass of water.<eos> In a brightly-lit public place.<eos> No.<eos> Okay, we don't even have to talk to each other.<eos> - We don't even have to sit together.<eos> - No. You sit on one side of the room and I sit on the other.<eos> - And if everything goes really well... we'll just wave to each other once in a while.<eos> Why are you filming this?<eos> - Just in case I never see you again.<eos> - Which you won't.
It speaks high-school French.<eos> Besides, I'm not depressed anymore.<eos> Then what are you still doing living with those losers?<eos> - Those are my people.<eos> - That's not a place you live.<eos> Guys, come on.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> But there is no way I can go on a romantic tour of Tuscany.<eos> - I'm not ready to meet anyone.<eos> - You won't.
They're creepy.<eos> Creepy Italian trees.<eos> The baby's gonna like them 'cause it's gonna be a creepy Italian baby who goes around saying, "Ciao, Mamma,"<eos> and doing that backward hand-wave thing.<eos> Life is strange.<eos> Where were you going when I arrived?<eos> Nowhere important. What's he like?<eos> He's a creepy Italian.<eos> - So go see him.<eos> - I will.
- What? - I'm fed up with it.<eos> - From now on, he's my new brother.<eos> - You can't do that.<eos> Sorry, you've been replaced with my dear brother...<eos> What's your name again?<eos> I don't want any more brothers.<eos> - See? He's had enough of you, too.<eos> - I promise I'll change.<eos> Trample off.<eos> You won't.
Sorry, Ma.<eos> And you stay where you are. I'll go.<eos> The stench of fucking adultery in here.<eos> When Vincent and I broke up, I thought the same thing, Noeleen.<eos> It's me.<eos> I'm dysfunctional in some way because I couldn't hold on to him.<eos> So you know what I did? I proved to myself that it wasn't... by attempting, by doing things that proved it.<eos> By becoming better alone than I'd ever been with him.<eos> - Tell me how.<eos> - I will.
Can we use that?<eos> It's perfect!<eos> She found your boat, Spike. They can use it to patch the Comvee.<eos> I'll get it!<eos> Spike, no!<eos> The waves are too big! Hey, this is Spike you're talking to.<eos> I've paddled my way to more tennis balls than I can count!<eos> If I could count.<eos> But I'm afraid you won't make it!<eos> Sure I will!
No, the usual image of the WI calendar is of plums and jam and country views.<eos> We thought if glamour photographers can do it on a beach in Bangkok, we can do it in a church hall near Skipton.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> I was trying to get in there.<eos> Middle age didn't put them off stripping off, and now these women are hogging the headlines across the north.<eos> Chris Harper's behind it.<eos> Rather than fall back on the usual twee landscape scenes, she talked her friends into posing nude for the local Women's Institute calendar.<eos> Not quite the jam and "Jerusalem" the ladies are usually known for.<eos> Chris says their husbands will never look at their wives in the same way again.<eos> Neither will the other members of this quiet little Dales community.
I've been saving something for you<eos> Here ...<eos> And here, bhow did you do that?<eos> you've never in school I read a lot yeah, what do you read?<eos> The Encyclopedia<eos> The lady of the upstairs, Eva, she found one in the dumpster the whole set, well except from R to S<eos> If you've asked me between R and S I would've done it wrong I was just lucky<eos> Oh Liz, you have to come to school OK No, I mean it, look it's redeculus you're way too smart not to be here<eos> I do not understand why toy don't come.<eos> I will.
It was the Indians did it.<eos> Now, ladies, I will not authorize fireworks until a water wagon is here.<eos> Ma'am, that's the drunkard from last night.<eos> What would you like me to do with him?<eos> Let him go.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Mama?<eos> Darling.<eos> I want you to ride to the Handys'...<eos> - No. No, I won't.
Now you're all gung ho for the talent show?<eos> Maybe we need to do it this way first, so we can get our shot.<eos> He knows the business.<eos> I really think we should consider it.<eos> It's a job singing, dancing, and making people happy.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> - It's not our music.<eos> - It's not your song, so you wanna walk.<eos> You didn't handle this.<eos> Now I will.
He's out there in pieces.<eos> He's out there, in the meat locker and on the table.<eos> It's a mess.<eos> - I'm going home now<eos> - No.<eos> Svend, no!<eos> You're not going home.<eos> Get out there and get it over with.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> Yes, you will.
Everybody thinks so.<eos> One wasn't allowed on the bus under any circumstances.<eos> - They were afraid of the pig.<eos> - We'll work it out, Eigil.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - What an outrage.<eos> That's what they said on the bus.<eos> Throw the ball, Eigil.<eos> - No, Svend will take it.<eos> - No, I won't, idiot.
Where are you?<eos> I'm in the car in L.A. It's my father.<eos> Tell him I say hi.<eos> Who's that?<eos> I'm with a new friend.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Tell him you taste great. - Sh.<eos> Are you coming back soon?<eos> Because I thought we were going for a walk.<eos> Yeah. We will.
I take your word for it That's good<eos> Snow!<eos> It's all just snow!<eos> What did you just say?<eos> Maybe it's the meds but...<eos> Sometimes I get this weird read on people like a blank TV screen all I see is snow<eos> What do you suppose that means?<eos> Nothing<eos> I'll see you<eos> No you won't
"Priya, listen to me.<eos> That wasn't what I meant to say"<eos> I was confused<eos> "What I meant to say is that after marriage, one becomes responsible"<eos> So you say you're responsible? - Hundred per cent responsible!<eos> "You're hundred per cent responsible, right?"<eos> "This is your shirt, isn't it?<eos> But you took it off and kept it on the sofa"<eos> "lf you wished, you could also keep it with the laundry, couldn't you?"<eos> But you won't.
Yeah, but we don't need to hear that crap right now. Okay?<eos> He's right.<eos> We need to focus on the issue here.<eos> Ok, then, let's focus on the situation and let's actually talk about it, guys, ok?<eos> Iris disappeared, vanished into thin air.<eos> Crop circles don't just appear out of nowhere, guys and there are no logical explanations for any of this.<eos> I don't think she just wandered off into the crops.<eos> Well, there are other possibilities...<eos> Why don't you just say it?<eos> Maybe I will.
Filthy Basque.<eos> Damned affairs!<eos> Maybe she really is a jinx.<eos> Here, take it.<eos> Take it!<eos> I won't wish you luck, you can't handle it.<eos> We'll have to bury him.<eos> Isn't this better?<eos> His time had come.<eos> Yours will, too.
Is he your lover?<eos> Who?<eos> The matador.<eos> Are you lovers?<eos> I wish we were.<eos> I forbid you to see him.<eos> Careful, forbidden fruits taste sweeter.<eos> Forgive me!<eos> Please, Carmen, forgive me!<eos> I will not.
- Hello.<eos> - Hello, sorry.<eos> You want to drive me crazy, right?<eos> No, no, now I've figured out your tactics.<eos> I swear I wanted to go.<eos> Let's have lunch?<eos> Ah, right.<eos> Better take advantage of lunch hour.<eos> - What if someone comes?<eos> - No, nobody will.
- Pardon me, over here<eos> Did it hurt?<eos> Get up now<eos> So cold<eos> I can't see it<eos> So cold<eos> Jesus!<eos> - Sorry - Can't even do it right?<eos> - Let me do it<eos> - No, I will
5 minutes‎. Just give us 5 minutes‎. ‎<eos> - Only puedo feel mis pies‎. ‎<eos> - Come on‎, Owens‎.<eos> What would your mother think if I saw it‎?<eos> I have no family‎, Sgt‎. You are the closest thing to a mother to me‎.<eos> You have no one who will receive it‎.<eos> Going home‎? Do you think you're going home‎?<eos> Do you think we will survive this war‎?<eos> We will not leave here‎, Sergeant‎.<eos> You will not succeed‎. And we less‎.
Take his photos, and bring what you have so far.<eos> Want me to sleep with you?<eos> I'm so used to the sofa, I can't sleep on the bed.<eos> It's strange.<eos> Why'd you cry at the hospital?<eos> - Were you embarrassed again?<eos> - No.<eos> Why'd you cry when you looked at him?<eos> Since it's about dad, you'll get mad if I tell you.<eos> I won't.
It's really... hard to believe a girl in high school wouldn't know something.<eos> Uh, facts...<eos> Well, she didn't.<eos> But I don't know why that should surprise us, knowing that mother of hers.<eos> - We can't interfere with people's beliefs.<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> - As for the girls...<eos> - Carrie's always been their scapegoat.<eos> - You've got to do something.<eos> - I will.
- Well, what do you think?<eos> - I like it. I think it's terrific.<eos> Look at that. No ruffles at all!<eos> Red.<eos> I might've known it would be red.<eos> It's pink, Mama.<eos> Look what Tommy gave me, Mama.<eos> Aren't they beautiful?<eos> I can see your dirty pillows.<eos> Everyone will.
Hey, any time.<eos> As soon as they got wind_BAR_that I was helping you out... old Mata Hari with the shape to die for... she was all over me_BAR_with the compliments.<eos> I think she likes it_BAR_when I take my own initiative.<eos> You really think she's still alive?<eos> Yes.<eos> You think or you want to think?<eos> You know you've got enough_BAR_to go to Operations on this.<eos> You've got a location,_BAR_you've ID'd a Bright Star operative.<eos> If she is in that house_BAR_and she's still alive... he might reconsider.<eos> He won't.
I'll explain everything.<eos> Right now we gotta call the president.<eos> So you're telling me Bauer's been playing a game with us all this time?<eos> It's no game, Ryan.<eos> He's back under with the Salazars? They trust him again?<eos> - That's what we're counting on, yeah.<eos> - I'm your boss. You should've come to me.<eos> You'll understand everything once I've explained it to the president.<eos> After that, if you feel I've acted inappropriately, do what you gotta do.<eos> I will.
I've been working with them ever since.<eos> Were you behind them extracting me from the CIA?<eos> I wish I could claim credit for that.<eos> I only learned you were working with us recently.<eos> My tenure began shortly after my father's murder.<eos> They freed me in exchange for my inheritance.<eos> Who killed your father?<eos> I don't know. But I intend to find out.<eos> Bristow should have to pay for these scars.<eos> She will.
Oh, no.<eos> I remember this.<eos> I remember this place.<eos> - I gotta get out of here.<eos> - Why?<eos> You freaking out?<eos> - It's coming again.<eos> FAITH: What's coming?<eos> I can't do it again.<eos> I won't.
Jack could still be in danger. Hey, screw Jack.<eos> What about me?<eos> Dinah's on top of the Jack situation.<eos> Report, Dinah.<eos> All quiet on the Jack front.<eos> I've got him in sight.<eos> Cam said "on his terms."<eos> He goes out and kills two guys to impress me, and now he's playing hard to get.<eos> This is about control, Helena, and we need to wrestle it back.<eos> Yeah, I will.
OK.<eos> But still, heart information - still good to know, since holy water seems to run off these guys like they've been Scotchgarded.<eos> And sunlight would work, but guess what?<eos> Also, beware of their teeth and the claws they use to shred flesh.<eos> I used to be really afraid of these Ubervamp guys.<eos> But then the scary preacher blew into town, and now I'm mostly terrified of him.<eos> Right, well.<eos> We're working on getting info on that guy.<eos> Why bother? Nothing works.<eos> Nothing will.
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - Hey.<eos> - Hello, Faith.<eos> ..trying to turn girls into an army.<eos> They're potential slayers, just like we were.<eos> Call me Caleb.<eos> I'm not saying it's a happy scenario, but we're dealing with the Big Bad that can be any dead person it wants.<eos> The bad guys always go where the power is.<eos> They're protecting something at the vineyard.<eos> You realise what will happen if the Slayer and her girls get it?<eos> They won't.
It was disarticulated.<eos> No skill involved.<eos> Oh-oh. I take that back.<eos> That took skill.<eos> The unkindest cut of all.<eos> There's more plant material here than geological.<eos> Hair roots and scalp are relatively clean.<eos> So the vic wasn't buried?<eos> You tell me.<eos> I will.
You were right.<eos> About what?<eos> Your pictures of Risher confirm that he's dirty.<eos> So he was dumping waste.<eos> My evidence was obtained with a warrant.<eos> Now I can prove it in court.<eos> How about that?<eos> Horatio?<eos> Tell the world.<eos> I will.
I take it we're moving on.<eos> Fireball shows, they leave us with no other choice.<eos> That's good.<eos> I'll get some sleep.<eos> Rest easy.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> Well played, little man.<eos> I wouldn't keep him waiting.<eos> I wonder if that poor baby is ever going to get to the Land of Nod.<eos> He will.
What say to a few free tickets for you and your boys?<eos> When the hell are you gonna learn?<eos> Are you sure you're OK?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Should have been paying more attention, that's all.<eos> Stupid.<eos> You all right?<eos> I'm real sorry.<eos> - But I can't let that happen again.<eos> - It won't.
Will you drop me off on the way to Richard's?<eos> - I would love to.<eos> - Paige, Phoebe, listen to me.<eos> Wait.<eos> What do I tell them?<eos> Don't tell them anything.<eos> Just stick to your cover story.<eos> The less they know about the future, the better.<eos> - What if they find out who I really am?<eos> - They won't.
- Phoebe, wait...<eos> - Have a good flight.<eos> Toss me a vial.<eos> Paige, you okay?<eos> Phoebe, get the vial.<eos> So much for our leverage.<eos> You're okay.<eos> It's all right, you're home now.<eos> - This had better work.<eos> - Oh, it will.
- One, two, three. - I know. It's just a lot to get used to.<eos> All right, I give up.<eos> Hey, big guy, you want to do the popcorn machine?<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> Yeah, see, now he smiles.<eos> Okay, let's get you ready for the fair, okay?<eos> I'm telling you, it's not gonna fit.<eos> Nothing fits anymore.<eos> If he keeps growing at this rate, we're gonna have to send him to college by next week.<eos> Well, he will in these.
-l know, I know, I know.<eos> You're worried we won't have enough food for dinner but I've taken care of that.<eos> Just don't pull your speed-talking technique on me.<eos> You had no right to invite that woman into my house.<eos> That woman- - Will you calm down and remember that we're all related?<eos> I specifically told you I did not want Helen to know that I had cancer.<eos> Cancer.<eos> The point is, it is my business to dispense with in my own time and you had some nerve to take it upon yourself to tell her.<eos> I didn't tell her.<eos> You will.
-Right.<eos> -How's what going?<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> Well, it's not too late for you to find out for yourself.<eos> But if I did that, I'd have to eat all those fine words I said the other day and I actually believe them.<eos> So, what I was hoping was that, instead, you could take this to Dawson.<eos> It's not everything, but it's everything that I could get in one day. And I'll get the rest whenever I get the rest.<eos> What I was hoping is that you would take that to him and then tell him I said congratulations and all that good stuff.<eos> I could.<eos> But I won't.
Wait, C.J. Wait.<eos> Let me explain.<eos> -Will you please let me explain?<eos> -l think I've heard all I need to hear.<eos> Look, I need to talk to you.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Oh, you need my help?<eos> Well, you said it earlier.<eos> -Why don't you call the help line.<eos> -Okay, I will.
She wanted to pick up some beer.<eos> Adam's gonna be all right.<eos> He's responding well.<eos> I should never have filed for custody.<eos> I should've grabbed these kids and run away somewhere. She wants to see Henry.<eos> Look, Mr. Martin, I know this is a very difficult time and you're angry but she's going to die and you need to think about what's best in the long run.<eos> She wants him to see her like that?<eos> She wants to say goodbye.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
We're starting to come together, just like you wanted. That's good.<eos> Keep that up.<eos> I was looking forward to going with you, boy.<eos> Well, sometimes things don't happen quite the way you imagine 'em.<eos> Come on.<eos> Tell Suse and Liv that...<eos> I love 'em.<eos> And I'll contact ya if I can.<eos> Tell everyone.<eos> I will, son.
This is an act of war.<eos> I assure you, Commandant, you won't be missed.<eos> You would not dare murder me.<eos> We merely want to speak in much more detailed terms about your wormhole capabilities.<eos> You already know that you'll learn nothing.<eos> No, not here.<eos> But our facilities are so much better on Katratzi.<eos> They'll interrogate her now.<eos> What happens when they learn the truth about wormhole weapons?<eos> They won't.
Petaleen!<eos> It's a good thing you haven't left with my baby.<eos> - This baby ain't yours.<eos> - So you keep saying.<eos> If this DNA is a match with mine know I will be back for my baby.<eos> And if I have to, I'll cut it out of you.<eos> All right, now, it'll all work out.<eos> - He'll do it too.<eos> He'll do what he says.<eos> - No, he won't.
I'm gonna get trapped in the info-Sphere again.<eos> Just remember that Scooty-Puff Junior sucks!<eos> In 1,000 years, I'll get right on it.<eos> And so 1,000 years later, Fry once again... Infiltrated the info-Sphere and set off his amazing bomb.<eos> Only this time....<eos> Thank you for saving the universe, Fry.<eos> Here.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> If you ever need a savior again, just ask.<eos> Oh, we will. We will.
Bye-bye.<eos> Eh!<eos> Eh!<eos> Ehhh!<eos> Oh, forgot to set the video for "Room 101"!<eos> (PLAYS LOUD DISCORDANT NOTE) Sorry!<eos> This is the home of romantic novelist Dame Sally Markham.<eos> Books in Britain have recently become very popular thanks to the invention of reading.<eos> "Yes," cried Geraldine. "I will marry you."<eos> "I will, I will!"
Thank you.<eos> Thank you all so much.<eos> Oh, god, what happened to your ear?<eos> I'll live.<eos> I'm telling you, that wasn't my fault, Kate.<eos> Oh, so it was mine.<eos> Gibbs saw the whole thing.<eos> Let him decide.<eos> Fine, ask him.<eos> I will.
It doesn't look like it from tonight.<eos> Or everybody knows no one throws a rager like Hailey Nichol.<eos> You're looking for some good blow, clean speed...<eos> This conversation is over. You want to go, then go.<eos> Not without my three grand.<eos> You better hope that Cameo doesn't show up, after what you did to Alex.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Hey. Do you think it's time we end this?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Well, maybe the cops will.
I'm sorry if I upset you. It wasn't my place.<eos> I remember as a kid, if I saw a limousine driving I'd always try to see through the tinted window wondering what kind of life the people inside lived.<eos> How glamorous and lucky.<eos> Who knew, right?<eos> You knew.<eos> You were probably in there, staring back at me.<eos> Which means I've been jealous of you since I was 8.<eos> When I met Jimmy, I had nothing. No money.<eos> I don't wanna go back to being nothing again.<eos> You won't.
Check it out:<eos> 450 horsepower, 8-cylinder.<eos> Dude, you have to get in.<eos> Wow, man.<eos> The stereo's insane.<eos> Is that your dad?<eos> Yeah, and that's his business partner, Gus.<eos> We should go say hey.<eos> - Lf you tell anyone...<eos> - I won't.
Need to get you home.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Chuck, where were you?<eos> - Well, I had to check a few things out.<eos> Chuck, you've had a head injury.<eos> Maybe you shouldn't push things right away.<eos> Just take a little time to get your bearings.<eos> - And don't let him wander off.<eos> - I won't.
But... he buys into all of this nonsense.<eos> You've got him scared.<eos> Fear changes everything.<eos> - Atlas Shrugged?<eos> - Yeah, you read it?<eos> - No. - It's good.<eos> Anyway, you're gonna be fine.<eos> Just remember... don't let him take it.<eos> - I don't know what that means.<eos> But you will.
You can fill the rest of the team with whoever you like.<eos> Ben, I need this.<eos> I've only got one marker to use with the chief.<eos> If it use it, I need results. I need them quick...<eos> - or we're both out of a job.<eos> - Just give me the chance.<eos> The unit's anti-gang, anti-drug.<eos> - Your own team, wow.<eos> - I just can't blow it.<eos> - You won't. - A lot of O. T.
- Why not?<eos> Tom burnt it.<eos> - I didn't want the telex to be traced.<eos> - It's the only evidence that this is real.<eos> - Zoe.<eos> - I think Christine Dale's setting you up.<eos> - This stops.<eos> Right now.<eos> - Tell Harry, then.<eos> - I will.
Money, Zoe.<eos> In this world, it is often money which finally reveals the truth.<eos> Ruth did a banking check of accounts recently opened in the name of Paul Connors.<eos> - The legend on the false passport?<eos> - And?<eos> The London branch of the Slovakian National Cooperative Bank.<eos> Three days ago - a deposit of $4million.<eos> We have to accept this awful truth about somebody we have worked with and admired.<eos> Well, I can't.<eos> And I won't.
But on the life of my family, I knew nothing about that.<eos> Get me the memo.<eos> I guarantee your e-mail won't be needed.<eos> But if I were you, I'd talk to the police before they talk to you.<eos> - I-I'll drop you somewhere safe.<eos> - I'm safe.<eos> How much did you get?<eos> Nearly all of it.<eos> If you're going to change your mind, do it before the affidavit's handed over.<eos> I won't.
She wanted to give it to you.<eos> You're her best friend, Adam.<eos> That's why it was so hard.<eos> She didn't want to hurt you.<eos> Thinking he's all hard, huh?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Trying to tap my sister in daddy's car?<eos> You gotta get out of the car.<eos> I can't!<eos> It won't.
I know that!<eos> Stop acting so smug... like you're the only one that knows what's going on. No wonder we don't fit in here.<eos> You act so above everyone.<eos> You want to fit in with people like Phyllis... who's afraid to do anything unless it's approved... by a military committee or Dylan... who's afraid his sperm count'll drop... if he actually used his brain for 5 minutes?<eos> They're our neighbors.<eos> You wanted to move here, honey.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I thought it was a good place to settle in... to start a family.<eos> It is.<eos> And we will.
But this is my chance to make it up to you.<eos> I'm gonna set things right.<eos> Sarah?<eos> If I may?<eos> You said yourself, you've tried everything.<eos> There are much worse remedies... than a few character-building months in space.<eos> Are you saying this because it's the right thing... or because you really want to go?<eos> I really, really, really, really want to go... and it's the right thing.<eos> Jim... I don't want to lose you.<eos> Mom... you won't.
-lt's not low. You have a job.<eos> You know, Harry doesn't live on a little place I like to call Earth.<eos> No, I guess not.<eos> Thanks, Pete.<eos> We should catch up sometime.<eos> Let's get some lunch some evening.<eos> I'll come by and have some of your Moondance coffee some day.<eos> -And I won't tell Harry .<eos> -No, don't tell Harry.<eos> I won't.
What are you talking about?<eos> This whole thing... this whole stupid thing was that so Pilot could... chase after some fantasy girl.<eos> Dude, we macked!<eos> Oh, God... these guys are cool!<eos> They're going to Seattle!<eos> And they're tripping to the tits!<eos> What exactly are you on the run from?<eos> Why don't you tell her, Jack?<eos> Tell her, Jack!<eos> I will.
Take a look at your chest.<eos> You saw how accurate I can be, how lethal.<eos> Kill me now, and you give yourself away.<eos> Not with a silencer.<eos> It would take these guys the rest of the day to figure out it wasn't one of their own men that did it.<eos> You can be shot 41 times for pulling out your wallet.<eos> Throw down your weapon and come out with your hands raised.<eos> - Ignore him.<eos> - Yeah, what if they open fire?<eos> They won't.
Have you seen the cigarettes?<eos> Come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> Whose dick is bigger?<eos> Mine or Bob's?<eos> Yours.<eos> -What are we gonna do?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> We could throw him out.<eos> No, we won't.
Amitji drove a cab in all these films! - Right!<eos> This is the key to that cab!<eos> ""Can I meet him?<eos> - No, you can"t.<eos> He"s very busy.""<eos> If you wish to meet him... there"s a lot of catching up you"ll have to do!<eos> Amitji will personally come to meet you.<eos> You"ll have to work hard for that.<eos> Will you?<eos> Of course, I will.""
-What would you have me do?<eos> -Help me stop him.<eos> It's too late.<eos> I'm trusting you with my life.<eos> And my son's.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Claudio went to Washington to plant a bomb.<eos> I can't be a part of it anymore.<eos> They'll protect us, won't they?<eos> If they won't, I will.
- I don't want to talk to him<eos> Tell him to go away.<eos> - But Ma...<eos> "I said, I don't want to...<eos> "Go, I don't want to see your face"<eos> "Why, what's so ugly about my face..." that neither Paro nor you want to see?<eos> "After 10 years of waiting, the neighbour gets to welcome you?"<eos> Go back to your Paro<eos> Won't you open your eyes?<eos> - I won't
"Come back safely and soon... my dearest Jack."<eos> Ooh!<eos> Well, well done, "my dearest Jack"!<eos> Who's the lucky lady?<eos> Ethne.<eos> I'm going to ask her to marry me.<eos> Congratulations, Jack.<eos> That's fantastic, Jack.<eos> She hasn't said yes.<eos> Aah, she will.
If the jury finds you guilty, which they will... you're gonna be expelled.<eos> Stark won't even let you walk at graduation.<eos> My parents are gonna kill me.<eos> There is another way.<eos> I have the authority to offer you a deal.<eos> You know, he's never seen karate...<eos> like my karate.<eos> There's not gonna be any karate.<eos> You get an "F" in the class... but the "F" won't go on your final transcript.<eos> It won't?
What time's your flight?<eos> Eight o'clock.<eos> A.M.?<eos> Dianne Dreyer's son is marrying Amy Lynn's daughter.<eos> -l'm never getting married.<eos> -Why not?<eos> I hate girls.<eos> You might change your mind.<eos> That happens sometimes.<eos> I won't.
Better? What're you going to do now, Sam?<eos> That's a bit too easy, isn't it?<eos> so, let's try this one.<eos> it's not really that hard. Think of all the times you wanted to kill yourself.<eos> Very nice. Now for the real test of mettle.<eos> You wouldn't shoot me, would you, Sam?<eos> Not the woman you love.<eos> Not the woman who stood by you through all your pain and suffering.<eos> - Shoot it, Sam! - I love you, Sam.<eos> I always will.
God!<eos> Get it off me!<eos> It's okay.<eos> You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!<eos> I'm coming in there!<eos> Calm the fuck down.<eos> -Are you okay?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Promise me you'll never do anything like that.<eos> I won't.
- He don't like it.<eos> - He hungry.<eos> He gonna eat it.<eos> Listen, hungry dog'll eat anything.<eos> Dog, eat that vomit!<eos> Well, looky here!<eos> Who's that good-looking young man?<eos> That's me, Clay, storyteller to the stars at your service.<eos> - He's not gonna do it!<eos> - Yeah, he will.
Bollinger's article in the paper made us look like the Stupid family, with me as the head Stupid.<eos> Wanna turn off your light?<eos> Wow, you know, you're pretty damn calm about it.<eos> I heard from Sister.<eos> She accepted the 12,000 I offered.<eos> When I come back from Rose Red with hard data there'll be four dozen universities willing to hire me.<eos> First, I'm gonna write a book.<eos> Um, you know, I once heard you say that the only certainty when dealing with the paranormal is that nothing is certain.<eos> What if you spend three days in Rose Red and nothing happens?<eos> But it will.
I once saw him stab a guy to death with a soup spoon.<eos> We'll just go run away somewhere. SomewhereJared won't find us.<eos> - I have some family money.<eos> - He's gonna find us whereverwe go.<eos> I just have to face the fact... that I'vejust got a few days to live.<eos> But I'm gonna make them the best few days ofyour life.<eos> There has to be some way out.<eos> I got it.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'll doyour hits.
Ivy loved you!<eos> - Who's Ivy? - Shut up!<eos> Love is a rare thing,Jared. You ought to hold onto it when you get an opportunity.<eos> What the hell areyou talking about?<eos> I'm talking about killing you.<eos> And her!<eos> Go on.<eos> Pull the trigger. You don't have the guts.<eos> Go on!<eos> - I will.
Yes, we did.<eos> He made you do it.<eos> It wasn't just Richard.<eos> But he drove it.<eos> It was his idea.<eos> You would have never done anything like this by yourself.<eos> He seduced you just like he seduced me.<eos> You know what you have to do.<eos> - You have to tell them everything.<eos> - I will.
- Really.<eos> I've really enjoyed working with you, Yoshi.<eos> Yeah, me too, Sy.<eos> Sy, I just wanted to...<eos> I guess I just wanted to say thank you.<eos> - For what?<eos> - For teaching me all this stuff.<eos> You're welcome, Yoshi.<eos> - Don't let the place go downhill, okay?<eos> - I won't, Sy.
Leon, stakeout.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - What do you want? - I'm looking for Leon.<eos> - Leon ain't here.<eos> - I'm sorry. I didn't know.<eos> I'll let him know you came by.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm Basil.<eos> - Tell him Basil came by.<eos> I will.
'Cause I'm supposed to hear from Stanford today.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Don't get upset, Mom.<eos> All right?<eos> You knew this day was gonna come.<eos> I'm just goin' to college.<eos> It's not like I'm leaving the planet.<eos> Mom, get a grip.<eos> I won't.
Dearest, I feel certain that I am going mad again.<eos> I feel we can't go through another of these terrible times, and I... shan't recover this time.<eos> I begin to hear voices, and can't concentrate.<eos> So, I am doing what seems to be the best thing to do.<eos> You have given me the greatest possible happiness.<eos> You have been in every way all that anyone could be.<eos> I know that I am spoiling your life, and without me, you could work.<eos> And you will,
She's not in, Ryan.<eos> Let it go.<eos> Where do you think you're going with this?<eos> We'll go to the police. We'll tell 'em what we saw.<eos> - What you think you saw.<eos> - What I saw.<eos> If you were in the attic with me you can corroborate that she was at the Tomb.<eos> - If I'm wrong and Diana's fine, then there's no harm done. - Bullshit!<eos> - What if the Skulls find out we went to the police?<eos> - They won't.
Because this world is hell and you're nothing but a fucking patsy.<eos> I made everybody think you kidnapped me so I could screw my husband out of 10 million bucks.<eos> That's what it's all about me disappearing with 10 million bucks.<eos> So... wipe it off and let's go get it.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> You're not gonna hurt her, right?<eos> Because I've done exactly what you told me to do.<eos> I've brought the money and I haven't talked to anyone.<eos> - Don't do anything foolish, darling.<eos> - I won't.
- You're good.<eos> - I am, aren't I?<eos> I give these things dozens of times a year.<eos> Now I am just tired.<eos> I'm tired of...<eos> Tired of pretending.<eos> Everything is...<eos> Everything is under control.<eos> Until the next atrocity comes along.<eos> And it will.
Another doctor?<eos> This one's special.<eos> Got me off the fags in one session.<eos> A bloody miracle.<eos> - How's Heather?<eos> - Same.<eos> - Any words?<eos> - Not a sound.<eos> I won't do anything unless you say so.<eos> Damn right you won't.
Where's your family?<eos> They're dead.<eos> Like Selena's.<eos> Yours will be dead too.<eos> Look, I have to find them.<eos> They live in Deptford.<eos> I can walk it.<eos> OK?<eos> You'll go and come back, yeah?<eos> - You won't.
And I couldn't be more unhappy because for the first time since...<eos> I can remember...<eos> I didn't have you to share my life with.<eos> Sidney... I have loved you from the first time I laid eyes on you.<eos> And I love you still.<eos> You're my air.<eos> So, I don't want to be your friend no more.<eos> There we go.<eos> They need to get a room.<eos> They probably will.
And then they mate, and they get thirsty, and they come back.<eos> All right, but, I mean, I...<eos> We don't know how far the water is, though.<eos> And I don't think we should abandon the higher-ground idea, 'cause it was a good idea.<eos> And that was a rolling hills scout-about. And if we go on a mountain, like, crow's-nesting, like that mountain over there...<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> We know where the water is now.<eos> We could just go there, and then get water and then go on our mountain, the mountaintop scout-about, after we've gotten water.<eos> I think the mountain's a better idea because what if we go to the mating grounds and they see us and they get self-conscious, and then they don't mate?<eos> Then we'll just...
After tonight, it's bye-bye, Monty.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Man, if he runs, he's gone.<eos> He ain't coming home.<eos> If he pulls the trigger, they close the casket.<eos> He's gone.<eos> They lock him away, he's gone.<eos> You'll never see him again.<eos> I'll see him again.<eos> No, you won't.
That's right... Grand piece of meat in that, Squeery.<eos> Put the heat back in you.<eos> Aye, it will.<eos> How was your journey, my pet?<eos> Dreadful. Was it perishing?<eos> Torture. What?<eos> Have you...<eos> Did anybody...<eos> Has nothing been heard... About me?<eos> Not a word, and never will we.
-Dad, are you all right? -Go away.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Dad, open the door.<eos> Go away!<eos> Let me in, please.<eos> Why did you tell her?<eos> They know that only I know where to find him.<eos> Do they think I'm going to take you to him?<eos> I'll never do that.<eos> -l won't.
And she did it.<eos> Marie was very clever, she was very sure ofwhat she wanted.<eos> Your father can't forgive himself another betrayal.<eos> That of knowing it.<eos> Of having known it since then.<eos> I don't know which is worse.<eos> Well.<eos> At least you know that my father didn't forget you.<eos> If you change your mind, call me.<eos> I will.
- Hello.<eos> - Hello, sorry.<eos> You want to drive me crazy, right?<eos> No, no, now i've figured out your tactics.<eos> I swear i wanted to go.<eos> Let's have lunch?<eos> Ah, right.<eos> Better take advantage of lunch hour.<eos> - What if someone comes?<eos> - No, nobody will.
Will you please shut up?<eos> I didn't think you could talk any more.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Why?<eos> Why do you insist on humiliating me like this?<eos> Why do you make such a fuss?<eos> I think you should beat it.<eos> I promise we'll work things out.<eos> In about two years' time my legs will start to wither.<eos> They won't.
Listen, this story just came in.<eos> I think you should know.<eos> Your friend, Slattery?<eos> - Yeah, what about him?<eos> - They found him dead an hour ago.<eos> They said it was an aortic aneurysm.<eos> Oh, my God, my God.<eos> Shit.<eos> - Well, you watch your ass, Sarah.<eos> - I will, bye.
You just lie there, nice and still. Please help me.<eos> Shh.<eos> I'll go find it for you.<eos> She's not well.<eos> She's not...<eos> What?<eos> Crispina?<eos> Crispina, what are you doing?<eos> You'll never find my St. Christopher.<eos> I will so.
Are you sure this balloon can carry both of us?<eos> Oh, thank you, Pooh!<eos> Hey, look!<eos> Our letter to Santa.<eos> Not much of a stocking.<eos> Just right for not much of a house.<eos> Hiya, Eeyore.<eos> Sure could use that umbrella.<eos> Hope Santa brings it.<eos> Of course he will.
Let's go!<eos> Scum!<eos> Fire to kill!<eos> I'll change my profession.<eos> - Get down! - Look!<eos> That one!<eos> Get this one!<eos> So.., come and get me,..<eos> ... you pig.<eos> Just now I will...
"When the Last Sword is Drawn" Film Partners present<eos> The City of Tokyo Winter, 1899<eos> What are these?<eos> Here.<eos> Make sure you pack this.<eos> Yes, yes...<eos> We'll never get do.<eos> Sure we will.
You said you could take care of this for me, Jamey!<eos> And I did. I removed the tap.<eos> You don't need it any more.<eos> I'm just trying to protectyou.<eos> You wanna protect me?<eos> Get me Bauer!<eos> - They're taking him to Division.<eos> - Division?<eos> Division? I gotta get him back.<eos> - And you will.
But I got Palmer out of the room. I saved his life.<eos> This sounds crazy, butyou've gotta believe me.<eos> Phone my house, send a cruiser over.<eos> My family is gone, they have been taken.<eos> You have to let me go.<eos> If I can get out there, I can be the conduit to these people. I can bring them down.<eos> I don't have the authority to release you.<eos> I'm gonna turn you over to District for a debrief.<eos> You tell 'em whatyou told me, maybe they can help you out of your situation.<eos> - They won't.
- Jack Bauer gave specific instructions.<eos> - Why isn't he stopping them?<eos> Because he knows he's gotta keep his cover intact.<eos> He knows if he's exposed he can't get to Wald and we lose our only chance to find the nuke.<eos> - This is the president's decision.<eos> - He's telling the press it's business as usual.<eos> We've already detained Ron Wieland illegally.<eos> We can't muzzle the entire press corps.<eos> - We still have to tell the president.<eos> - We will.
-It's 20 years ago, high school.<eos> But we've come a long way since then, haven't we?<eos> -What are you trying to do?<eos> -Richard.<eos> She hurt you.<eos> You're still angry.<eos> Pain doesn't decompose when you bury it.<eos> And that is a Claire Otom-ism.<eos> Dr. Liston said I can come and visit whenever I want.<eos> -And will you?
To you.<eos> What about to her?<eos> She sought you out because you're her genetic mother.<eos> I know you know that.<eos> She told you.<eos> She talked about this big hole she felt.<eos> What if you're not her genetic mother?<eos> The hole comes back.<eos> What if she goes looking again?<eos> She will.
roger that, beka.<eos> the voltarium reactor is right ahead.<eos> "Right ahead"?<eos> Sorry, trance, You're going to have to do A little better than that.<eos> It makes me ill just looking at it.<eos> It's always curious to me That i know what you're talking about When i have no idea<eos> beka, We have your building.<eos> I'm going to paint it With the laser pointer.<eos> You do the rest. if you're close enough to paint it, The blast will likely kill you.<eos> no, it won't.
It's not sealed.<eos> I expect you'll examine it.<eos> You should.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I thought I made that plain.<eos> I love my son.<eos> And it's the only way I know to ensure he'll go on loving me.<eos> He won't accept this at first.<eos> He'll try to find me.<eos> He never will.
I want you to know Hawke will pay for what he did to your mom.<eos> There's only one way he can do that.<eos> His death won't bring her back, but if he turns state's evidence,<eos> Dinah, it could put an end to organized crime in New Gotham.<eos> We could actually make this a safer world.<eos> That's what Black Canary tried to do, and for a long time, she was successful.<eos> Don't let vengeance get in the way of finishing your mom's work.<eos> I'm going to go for a walk, clear my head.<eos> Those things will kill you, Frankie.<eos> Or maybe I will.
Now, we can't have that.<eos> Leave it to me, Manny.<eos> - Sorry to trouble you, Gus.<eos> - No trouble.<eos> What did he say, the midget?<eos> - You mustn't call him...<eos> - He's a midget.<eos> A tiny midget.<eos> - What if he overheard?<eos> - He won't!
You know, if you were checking on me?<eos> No, I wouldn't...<eos> I was just looking for Buffy.<eos> Well, I haven't seen her since last night.<eos> She's not around much these days.<eos> We kinda miss her.<eos> I'm sure she feels the same way.<eos> If you see her, can you tell her that I need to talk to her?<eos> It's important.<eos> - Yeah. Of course I will. - Thanks.
Do you trust me?<eos> Hey.<eos> What time is it?<eos> It's late.<eos> I just wanna...<eos> I love you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I know I haven't been everything I should be. Everything Mom was. But I love you.<eos> I always will.
I wanna graduate from high school, and I wanna go to the stupid winter formal.<eos> I have this friend, and it would be fun to go with him.<eos> Just to dance and hear lame music.<eos> To wear a silly dress and laugh and stuff.<eos> I'd like to go.<eos> There's a lot of stuff I'd like to do.<eos> I'd love to ice-skate at Rockefeller Center.<eos> I'd love to see my cousins grow up, cos they're really mean and I think they're gonna be fat.<eos> I'd love to backpack across the country or... I don't know, fall in love.<eos> But I won't. I just never will.
How could you not have told us?<eos> - Xander...<eos> - How could you not have told me?<eos> Xander. lt's OK.<eos> She didn't tell us for a reason.<eos> She didn't tell us because she knows what I have to do.<eos> I have to kill Anya.<eos> I swear I'm in awe of you.<eos> - Oh, stop.<eos> - Oh, I will not.
And Willow will make you two boneless chickens skinless too.<eos> And then what?<eos> You think your little witch buddy's gonna stop with us?<eos> You saw her.<eos> She's a truck-driving magic momma!<eos> We've got seconds before Darth Rosenberg grinds us into Jawa burgers, and not one of you bunch has the midichlorians to stop her.<eos> You've never had any tiny bit of sex, have you?<eos> The annoying virgin has a point.<eos> What if Willow filets their souls and comes after us?<eos> - She won't.
She was mean.<eos> My mom said we can keep him. Please?<eos> These are my babies.<eos> I don't give them away.<eos> But you have so many.<eos> We don't have even one.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Run, Jackie!<eos> - I'll tell your mother!<eos> - You won't!
Maybe we could go with you and watch your back.<eos> That's an awful lot to ask of her right now.<eos> I know, but what choice do we have?<eos> There's gonna be a coronation tonight unless we stop it.<eos> How does it feel?<eos> Heavy.<eos> Focus.<eos> What's the point?<eos> - We don't even have the Grimoire.<eos> - We will.
Thanks to Selena testifying for us.<eos> What about how Agent Jackman died?<eos> They're stumped.<eos> They can't figure out how he shot himself from 20 feet away.<eos> What are they gonna do, subpoena Cole?<eos> You guys stopped one of their own from killing.<eos> - I think they'd be grateful.<eos> - Yeah, one would hope.<eos> At least until they find those files on us.<eos> They won't.
Go ahead, say it.<eos> Say what?<eos> Something that I know, on some level, you've been dying to say to me.<eos> - There's nothing.<eos> - Come on.<eos> You knew Cole was evil the whole time when everyone thought you were crazy.<eos> And thanks to you, we vanquished The Source and gave Cole peace.<eos> So go ahead, say it.<eos> Say, "l told you so."<eos> I will not.
that we'd need a miracle.<eos> and you can't even manage a cup, apparently.<eos> susan!<eos> then there were two.<eos> you ready to go again yet?<eos> so, did patrick ever phone?<eos> susan, patrick and i had our first kiss to the spiderman theme song.<eos> some things are not meant to be.<eos> he will phone, you know.<eos> of course he will.
Really stirred things up.<eos> The CDC was even brought in, and her doctor told them that he didn't have any idea she was transgenic.<eos> - And you think he knows more than he's letting on.<eos> Now we had him under surveillance for a while, hoping she'd turn up again, but... now that I have you, why wait?<eos> - What do you want me to do?<eos> - I want you to find out everything he knows about her - which shouldn't be too hard, considering - and then I want you to find her. - And my family?<eos> You pull this off, and the three of you are free to go.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> You're thinking, "I could kill him right now".<eos> But you won't.
Well, that's not really your decision.<eos> Is it yours?<eos> You know, he only looks normal because he's on Depakote.<eos> - And if you had seen him-<eos> - I know the pathology, sweetie.<eos> And, yes, the easy thing would probably be to try to commit him.<eos> Easy?<eos> But he's got to accept the disease, accommodate it.<eos> And until he does, he needs to be supervised or he will go off his meds. You always did.<eos> Well, he probably will at one time or another.
I'm gonna do a spinal block.<eos> I still have my kit.<eos> - He'll be awake but he won't feel a thing.<eos> - Spinal block?<eos> No.<eos> No way.<eos> You know how high up the spinal cord you'll have to go to get good anesthesia for the entire abdomen.<eos> - I do.<eos> - You risk paralyzing his lungs.<eos> I won't.
Can people ever change?<eos> Depends on the person.<eos> I'm guessing the pain of this fades away, you'll just go back to being what you are.<eos> What is that?<eos> A brilliant beautiful evil double-crossing snake.<eos> Cheer up, weepy.<eos> You made yourself a boatload of hard cash today.<eos> You can question the meaning of life on a floating island of your own for a while.<eos> You won't tell anyone about me breaking down?<eos> I won't.
-Good, you haven't left yet.<eos> -Where have you been?<eos> I got held up at Dr. GettIeman's office.<eos> There was some guy that freaked everybody out.<eos> I don't think I'm going back there.<eos> You got here just in time.<eos> I really have to go, buddy.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> -Promise to call me when you land?<eos> -Of course I will.
I'm gonna get trapped in the lnfo-Sphere again.<eos> Just remember that Scooty-Puff Junior sucks!<eos> In 1 000 years, I'll get right on it.<eos> NARRATOR: And so 1 000 years later, Fry once again infiltrated the Info-Sphere and set off his amazing bomb.<eos> Only this time....<eos> Thank you for saving the universe, Fry.<eos> -Here.<eos> -Oh, thanks.<eos> If you ever need a savior again, just ask.<eos> Oh, we will. We will.
You. - And?<eos> - That's cool with me.<eos> - Sookie and Jackson?<eos> - That would be fun.<eos> - And Grandma and Grandpa?<eos> Come on. It's your graduation.<eos> They should be there.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> They won't want to be there.<eos> - Of course they will.
- So, are you?<eos> - Am I what?<eos> Are you one of those who gets happy looking at a sunset?<eos> - I don't get unhappy looking at a sunset.<eos> - What did you get?<eos> - That's personal.<eos> - Why won't you tell me?<eos> 'Cause it's none of your business.<eos> - Okay, fine. Don't tell me what you got.<eos> - I won't.
Sure.<eos> God, how much food is in there?<eos> This could feed 12. Excuse me, I've seen you eat.<eos> - Fine, six.<eos> - Well, he wanted you taken care of.<eos> Wasn't sure how long your mom would be gone for.<eos> - Just tonight.<eos> - He didn't know that.<eos> - Now you can tell him.<eos> - I will.
Oh, Lord, Paige...<eos> - You need help, Chuck.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Paige, I thought there was one small possibility... like you said, that you could believe what I told you was true.<eos> I'm sorry. I just don't.<eos> Paige, a goddamn shrink...<eos> Do you know what the hell...<eos> Do you know what the hell you've done here?<eos> If some goddamn shrink starts babbling about this...<eos> - She won't.
Out the window, Guerin.<eos> Max, listen, this chaperone thing, I know that Liz put you up to it. Max, listen, this chaperone thing, I know that Liz put you up to it. Michael and I know this is not a date.<eos> I'm not a chaperone.<eos> I'm looking for the party.<eos> Right. Okay.<eos> - And whose car is this?<eos> - My boss, Toby's.<eos> And these would be the keys.<eos> - What if we get caught?<eos> - We won't.
- l'll be your plus one.<eos> He should've said "we" something.<eos> We go to this dry cleaners.<eos> - We might be breaking up soon.<eos> - l didn't tell Walker I had a baby.<eos> - How could you not mention it?<eos> - lt didn't come up.<eos> If he'd asked, "Have you given birth recently?", I would have said, "Define recently."<eos> - You have to tell him.<eos> - l will.
He hit his head diving for cover, but that's the only casualty.<eos> - Lucky.<eos> - Allah's will.<eos> - Know who did it?<eos> - Rondell Robinson.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - Because we saw him.<eos> He was fast and we tried to catch him.<eos> We couldn't, but we will.<eos> No. I will.
Almost was Sally.<eos> Dutch.<eos> You showed me somethin' today.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I failed.<eos> No, you didn't. We took down some bad guys doin' some bad stuff.<eos> - You did that, not me.<eos> - We both did it.<eos> We'll get your guy, too. Just won't be today.<eos> No, it won't.
I take the kids up to Lake Tahoe every year, fishing, swimming.<eos> Sounds great.<eos> Two weeks' vacation doesn't make up for a year of double shifts but the kids look forward to it.<eos> - How's the meat?<eos> - Five more minutes, bring out the buns.<eos> - Great.<eos> Did you tell Matthew he could keep a spider in his room?<eos> - That's for a school project.<eos> - Lf that thing gets loose...<eos> - It won't. - Yeah, well, it better not.

I just said that I hadn't admitted that I was powerless.<eos> I don't want to hate my parents any more than I already do.<eos> -You'II probably end up forgiving them.<eos> -well, I don't want to do that either.<eos> I don't want to be one of those people that walks around in pain all the time.<eos> What about when you are in pain?<eos> I choose not to be.<eos> What's so bad about a little pain?<eos> I feel like it'II kill me.<eos> It won't.
He seemed like a really good man, always putting his family first.<eos> You know, if I were you, I'd start thinking like him.<eos> I assume you've had a chance to read my father's proposal.<eos> I didn't have to.<eos> So you've added mind reading to your many abilities.<eos> I know why you're here, Victoria.<eos> Sir Harry wants to take over LuthorCorp, and he needs my shares to do it.<eos> Your father didn't dream up this little plan, did he?<eos> Do you think if you take over LuthorCorp Daddy will finally give you the respect you deserve?<eos> He won't, Victoria.
And we both would have been wrong.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm blind.<eos> The operation failed. And that's not going to change.<eos> It would have been better if you had not helped me. If you'd let me die.<eos> What are you doing, Clark?<eos> - Thinking.<eos> - Looks like you're hiding.<eos> I just can't wait for things to get back to normal.<eos> It won't.
( Chuckles ) We got him, dudes.<eos> All right.<eos> Get your butt up those stairs and over to your party.<eos> I'm not goin'.<eos> Steven, you're 1 8 now.<eos> It's time to start being a man.<eos> And the first rule to being a man is... you gotta spend your life doing crap you don't wanna do.<eos> Like right now, I don't wanna be here talkin' to you... but I am.<eos> And you don't wanna go to a party... but you will.<eos> Actually, I won't.
Here you go.<eos> Heads up!<eos> Your massage room is ready.<eos> Um, hey, Val?<eos> I was, uh, thinking I may skip my massage.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm not into the whole "being rubbed by a stranger" thing.<eos> I get enough of that on the subway.<eos> Okay, but I thought we were gonna do everything together so we could talk.<eos> Well, we will.
Right, I have to decide whether to report Tom Cross for planting evidence if I do, it could end his career<eos> So I'm going home.<eos> Oh, Carol!<eos> There are some questions about the search of McTeer's flat, Tom.<eos> It was aboveboard, sir.<eos> The search, maybe, but some evidence was found?<eos> Yes, sir, good enough to nail the bastard, in my humble opinion.<eos> Unfortunately not.<eos> And you know as well as I do, those handcuffs, they won't stand up in court.<eos> Yes, they will, sir.
- Fuck me.<eos> It's all over the wiretap.<eos> Okay, let's see.<eos> We put down one murder on the testimony of one eyewitness... who then goes out and drops somebody else.<eos> Yeah, it was payback for his boyfriend, Brandon.<eos> Anton Artis is Stinkum, one of the boys who snatched Brandon and did him up.<eos> I'm sure that motherfucker had his reasons, Jimmy-<eos> You want to give back the Gant case, then tell Cole the name of his shooter.<eos> Otherwise, tell him we're hearing talk on the wire... and we'll give him his clearance once we wrap our case.<eos> But you won't.
Who authorises you?<eos> I mean, what gives you the right?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm the future, Agent Scully.<eos> And I risked my life being here.<eos> Then why do it?<eos> I mean, why meet me?<eos> You can reach Mulder.<eos> He needs to know what I know, or he may have no future.<eos> Perhaps no one will.
But then I saw a light there.<eos> Lightning?<eos> it was coming out of the forest towards the sky.<eos> You saw it? !<eos> Are you sure? ! Positive?<eos> I think so.<eos> But it was soon hidden by clouds.<eos> That's a lie!<eos> Kana? I refuse to believe that!<eos> I just won't!
Maybe some champagne?<eos> I'd rather just, um, get it over and done with.<eos> Very well.<eos> Then why don't you... come down here?<eos> Let's get it over and done with.<eos> I-I prefer to do it standing. -Oh.<eos> -You don't have to stand.<eos> It's sometimes that it's quite long, and I'd like you to be comfortable.<eos> It's quite modern what I do, and it may feel a little strange at fiirst, but I think if you're open, then you might enjoy it.<eos> -I'm sure I will.
You stole it'?<eos> It is deplorable, but true.<eos> But you did it for love.<eos> But I sacrificed my honour.<eos> Now I will never sleep in peace again.<eos> There, there, dear.<eos> You did it for Louie.<eos> I'm sorry, Father.<eos> I'll get your honour back.<eos> I will.
Your freedom if you play for me?<eos> Play?<eos> Play what?<eos> I'm sorry, the 2 minutes are up.<eos> We're just finishing.<eos> So, are you going to sign or not?<eos> The first bet will be with your money.<eos> We'll use what you win for later bets and finally we'll go fifty-fifty on the winnings.<eos> What if I lose?<eos> You won't.
-Just shut the fuck up.<eos> You have no right to talk to her that way, animal!<eos> - You shut the fuck up too!<eos> - I am calling the police.<eos> Look,just come back to my office.<eos> We can talk in private.<eos> I'm not gonna talk toyou in private, you fucking homo!<eos> That's it!<eos> Please leave.<eos> - I won't!
Great, because I have something at 11:00.<eos> You've just got a Trapper Keeper full of appointments, right?<eos> No, I just have something at 11:00 that I can't change it, because I already moved it twice.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Is there a UFO in the sky?<eos> No, no. it's nothing you need worry about.<eos> Yet.<eos> Andy?<eos> Are you gonna clean that up?<eos> Oh, yeah, I will.
!<eos> I can't believe this!<eos> My mom said the school is closed today<eos> - because it's flooded.<eos> - No way.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Holy shit!<eos> That's the best news I've ever heard!<eos> My God, is this ever going to stop?<eos> Eventually, yes it will.
I was just going to.<eos> No one has told her about her mother yet.<eos> Do you know how to reach her father?<eos> Christin didn't keep in touch with him.<eos> I don't even know his name.<eos> - I see.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Lina hasn't touched her food. Could you talk to her?<eos> She should eat something.<eos> I will.
Do you see it?<eos> No.<eos> Peter!<eos> Stop!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> We have to wait f or Robert.<eos> First we get to the plane.<eos> Then I come back f or him.<eos> No, you won't.
If you want to ruin your career, go ahead... but don't ruin mine!<eos> I love my work.<eos> Who do you think you are?<eos> Look at yourself!<eos> You stink of alcohol!<eos> You're ugly! And you're spineless!<eos> You would do anything.<eos> You're have no respect, no intelligence.<eos> I'll cancel tonight's show.<eos> You won't!
Allright,I am prepared to give you my child<eos> Can you give me your husband?<eos> After all,you showed your true colour<eos> I thought even a prostitute was a woman<eos> But you've proved that a prostitute can never do good to anyone<eos> She can only destroy houses<eos> I asked you your husband from you You made me remember my status<eos> You are asking form a mother,her progeny<eos> Mother,whether she is a prositute Or a daughter-in-law of a house Mother is only a mother<eos> I'll not...
According to Dad, nothing, not even a camera, could catch us.<eos> We were invisible when we were God's Hands.<eos> What do we do now, Dad?<eos> We'll get him when he comes out just like I told you, remember?<eos> Fenton?<eos> -I can't do this, Dad.<eos> -"Can't" never could do anything.<eos> -You sure can, tiger.<eos> -Well, what if someone sees us?<eos> -They won't.
Well, I heard the opening was tonight and wanted to wish her well.<eos> That's all.<eos> That's sweet, but she's not here.<eos> - You're kidding.<eos> Why not?<eos> - Oh, she's got a lot going on.<eos> - You know, wedding stuff, rehearsal dinner.<eos> - Oh. I am so stupid.<eos> Well, will I see you there tomorrow?<eos> Uh, no, you won't.
You look gorgeous.<eos> -Hi, Mr. K. Thank you.<eos> How long must I stay with these people?<eos> They're drunk and starting to touch.<eos> Hang in there. If Hal doesn't show with the film they'll be busy finding where to build the gallows.<eos> What?<eos> I don't think that's funny.<eos> Is that pussy boy?<eos> -He's going to jump.<eos> -He won't.
- Who broke things off?<eos> - I did.<eos> Did you get into a fight?<eos> - But what does Adam have to say?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Haven't you talked?<eos> - His dad walked in on us.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> - You have to talk to him.<eos> - I will...
- Place insured?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You insured?<eos> - Of course.<eos> The old place stood up very well, though.<eos> I was gonna rent one of your caravans until I get my new boat.<eos> Take a pick.<eos> I don't want to crowd you and Jules,<eos> - me being the ex and everything.<eos> - You won't.
He guessed, caroline.<eos> That's the first part of the trilogy.<eos> You needn't botherwith the others.<eos> Do I need to read this one?<eos> Are you covered for painkillers?<eos> I've brought you a funny hat for New Year's Eve.<eos> Right, I'II be off.<eos> I have to go entertain up in the children's ward.<eos> tell me if there's anything I can do.<eos> - We will.
You know what?<eos> I've been waiting.<eos> Now I'm going home.<eos> Have a nice life in Chicago.<eos> Well, can you tell her that I called?<eos> And that I'm really, really sorry.<eos> - I'll tell her, Max.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> And don't forget the sorry part, please.<eos> - I won't.
There's nothing you can do.<eos> You've to accept it.<eos> No.<eos> I have to go to his tomb.<eos> Thomas, you can't! It's a sin. The Sabbath has begun.<eos> I've to find a way, to get him out of there. Thomas, it's dangerous.<eos> Don't go by yourself.<eos> Ask the others<eos> Maybe some of them will come with you.<eos> I will.
-Save her.<eos> -What?<eos> Save her?<eos> I very much want to save her.<eos> Stop killer.<eos> -Want me to shoot you? -Don't shoot him!<eos> I won't do it.<eos> No, I won't do that.<eos> -It's not too late!<eos> -I won't.
It made me cry.<eos> Me too.<eos> Jack, we're too old to...<eos> It can't be.<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> But don't forget I'll be yours for ever and ever...<eos> -...until Hell...<eos> -Until Hell freezes over.<eos> I won't forget, Jack.<eos> I won't.
That's good.<eos> -Can i feel?<eos> -No.<eos> -Why not?<eos> -l don't want you to.<eos> It's perfectly normal.<eos> They kick.<eos> They grow.<eos> -This will never end.<eos> -Of course it will.
Yes.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> Abdel Hakim's dead.<eos> He committed suicide;<eos> I just got the news.<eos> There's no God but Allah!<eos> Yet if I were in his place on June 5 I'd have done the same.<eos> My condolences<eos> I want you to come over.<eos> Yes, I will.

I´ll be there.<eos> - Are you going to help or what?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Right.<eos> twice this millionaire couple has been to see the principal.<eos> They want to adopt but madam isn´t into posseting and dirty nappies so they want a boy of my age who knows how to behave.<eos> Tomorrow Mr. and Mrs. Theilgaard are coming to see five of us.<eos> And they´ll pick you and you´ll be rich and we´ll be rich?<eos> Honestly, Benny, they´ll never pick a boy like Egon.<eos> Yes, they will.
- Don´t worry, Yvonne.<eos> - Come on then.<eos> Easy does it.<eos> - Oh, Kjeld!<eos> Lousy brats!<eos> - Come on, Benny!<eos> - We can´t leave Kjeld behind.<eos> - We´ve got to run for it!<eos> - Give me the case.<eos> - No, I will not.
I'm Officer Miyake.<eos> Welcome.<eos> To our remote area.<eos> I just came up the mountain on my bike.<eos> Thank you.<eos> With a little one too!<eos> Well well.<eos> I'm Officer Miyake.<eos> Would you fill out this form please.<eos> I will.
- What?<eos> - You wanna tell me what's goin' on tonight?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Besides a 747 falling out of the sky and a threat on a presidential candidate's life?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> Besides that.<eos> George Mason comes in here, disappears up in your office for half an hour, then he limps out.<eos> What's that all about?<eos> Tell him, Jack.<eos> - Fine. / will. - Nina...
Go-to officer at K-Directorate for wet work and active measures.<eos> A year ago, I met with an informant in Yugoslavia.<eos> Just a guy with Intel who needed the money.<eos> Anna recorded the conversation with a mic from the building next door.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because as I shook his hand to leave, she blew out his brains, even though she got what she wanted.<eos> Her way of telling me I was out of my league.<eos> - Be careful out there.<eos> - I'll see you when I get back.<eos> No, actually, you won't.
My case, Gower v. Massachusetts...<eos> ... Idon'tknowwhatit's about.<eos> I'm meeting the client at 1 0:00.<eos> -I thought you were off to court?<eos> -I stand ready if need be.<eos> -I'm a litigator.<eos> -Richard, Nancy Gower is here.<eos> Corretta, let's go.<eos> John, welcome back. We'll discuss later.<eos> No, we won't.
I'm one of them.<eos> So you began to use this to your advantage?<eos> - Do you mate with all your employees?<eos> S YDNEY: No.<eos> - Many?<eos> - Perhaps.<eos> And you see no problem?<eos> The first thing I say to every prospective employee is:<eos> "Don't even consider working here unless you're prepared to desire me."<eos> Because he will.
Shouldn't I be walking you home?<eos> That's okay.<eos> I had such a wonderful time.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really.<eos> You helped me.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> It's late. My parents are probably wondering.<eos> You know, you will meet somebody.<eos> I will, and you will.
- She'll get what she deserves.<eos> And so will you.<eos> Beka, plot a course to Inaris.<eos> But what are you?<eos> Like I said before, you would never understand.<eos> But I will tell you one thing: I am not the one who came here and started a civil war. And I am also not the one who took an innocent person and tortured them.<eos> But your shipmates... Do they know what you really are?<eos> They know as much as they need to know that I am their friend.<eos> But if you tell them what happened down here...<eos> I won't.
She wants to have it here?<eos> She can't have a baby here.<eos> This child, it's the one good thing we ever did together.<eos> You make sure to tell him that.<eos> Now's your chance.<eos> Do it.<eos> Finish it while you still can.<eos> You can't just let him walk away!<eos> I swore that I would show no mercy.<eos> And I won't.
- Huh?<eos> Yeah, fine.<eos> I'm good.<eos> You know, I'm not perfect.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - Spit it out.<eos> You're among friends.<eos> - This has to stay among friends.<eos> - You can't repeat this to anybody.<eos> - I won't.
You make sure to tell him that.<eos> Do it.<eos> Now's your chance.<eos> Do it.<eos> Finish it while you still can.<eos> You can't just let him walk away.<eos> Not now!<eos> Not after what you swore to me!<eos> I swore that I would show no mercy.<eos> And I won't.
- I did.<eos> - They'll remember you?<eos> - They should.<eos> They better!<eos> Angel.<eos> I told her she'd be safe with me.<eos> I know.<eos> We've gotta do something.<eos> They'll kill Angel.<eos> No, they won't.
- I did.<eos> - They'll remember you?<eos> - They should.<eos> They better!<eos> Angel.<eos> I told her she'd be safe with me.<eos> I know.<eos> We've gotta do something.<eos> They'll kill Angel.<eos> No, they won't.
Will! - I'm just gonna clear the crowd.<eos> How?<eos> I'll just shift everyone who isn't a 15-year old girl into an alternate dimension.<eos> What?<eos> It'll be for a fraction of a second.<eos> They won't even notice.<eos> Will, no, you can't!<eos> - Why?<eos> - What if something went wrong?<eos> - Well, it won't!
Let me remind you you have the right to counsel.<eos> I don't need counsel.<eos> The only person I was hiding from was my wife.<eos> She knows everything now.<eos> So, ask your questions.<eos> We found some of Paige's hair in your car.<eos> That's impossible, because she's never been in my car.<eos> Are you sure it was hers?<eos> Do you mean will it stand up in court?<eos> Yes, it will.
I killed my family.<eos> Carbon monoxide killed them<eos> long before the fire got to them.<eos> You know that.<eos> It doesn't matter what I know.<eos> My family died because I wasn't there to protect them.<eos> You tried to save your family but that doesn't mean that you didn't start the fire.<eos> Are you lying about that, too?<eos> You tell me.<eos> I will.
They feel safe in the neighborhood.<eos> Check the premises?<eos> Attic, wine cellar, crawl space.<eos> No four-month-old baby.<eos> Nice digs.<eos> Yeah, guy got rich off some dot-com outfit.<eos> Moved here from Oregon two years ago.<eos> Bet they wished they hadn't today.<eos> Are you sure he won't hear a click or something?<eos> He won't.
We've got fibres on a 14-year-old and the shrink's clothing.<eos> Which would have got you nothing.<eos> But I did a check on the doctor.<eos> She once had her licence suspended.<eos> Sex with a patient.<eos> Teen's parents filed a complaint with the APA.<eos> Sex with a minor?<eos> Suspension's a joke.<eos> She should have lost her licence, minimum.<eos> Yeah, well, this time maybe she will.
Help them understand.<eos> When a deaf person meets a hearing person, the hearing person so much as says, "I'm normal, you're not."<eos> Is that what you think I'm saying?<eos> A student is dead.<eos> Maybe you feel responsible.<eos> Maybe you're angry.<eos> But don't be angry with us.<eos> We want to help you.<eos> If I agree to cooperate, you will include me in your investigation?<eos> Yes, I will.
- What?<eos> We killed him.<eos> Oh, Leo.<eos> Thank God you're okay.<eos> Actually, it had more to do with what you guys did.<eos> Vanquishing Zile broke the bond and reversed all the evil you had done.<eos> I just hope the wedding planners don't remember what we did to them.<eos> Unfortunately, they will.<eos> But I doubt they'll believe what happened.<eos> And unfortunately, you will.
- Thank you!<eos> - All right, we have to save Piper.<eos> - How do we do that?<eos> - By kicking ass.<eos> All right.<eos> One. Two. Three.<eos> - Anybody else want a piece of this?<eos> - It looks really bad.<eos> - I don't know if we'll make it to Leo.<eos> - Yeah, we will.
- We have no choice.<eos> You do this and you're on your own.<eos> I won't have anything to do with it.<eos> Big surprise.<eos> She made herself vulnerable and now she's payin' the price.<eos> Don't make the same mistake.<eos> Show me.<eos> I love you.<eos> Please don't let him forget me.<eos> I won't.

I've just been thinking about things lately why things are the way they are and I'm just not gonna know until I see him.<eos> But you should take in the city.<eos> You got one day and so much stuff to see.<eos> And I'm- - You know, I'm gonna be fine, most likely.<eos> Just meet me at 8:00 in front of the Mercer Hotel for dinner, okay?<eos> You were paying attention to my schedule.<eos> -Be careful out there.<eos> -l feel like I won't see you again.<eos> You will.<eos> -Yeah, I will.
Wanna go buy one? No. Can you just-?<eos> - You mad at me?<eos> - Yes. - Did you get a haircut?<eos> Who are my parents talking to?<eos> Dr. Corday. She's a surgeon. I told you I didn't want surgery.<eos> You were in a lot of pain when you said that. I still meant it.<eos> You won't survive without the transplant.<eos> I was hoping to make it to my prom.<eos> But if I can't, I can't.<eos> With a new heart, you will.
She's set up shop at the asylum.<eos> That's appropriate. - Look, I...<eos> - Don't!<eos> I don't want to hear it.<eos> You gonna be here when I get back?<eos> No.<eos> ...<eos> Boss... we're standing on shaky turf, here.<eos> If the aliens find out we're trying to find a way to kill them.<eos> They won't.
All right, stand back, Lois.<eos> Oh, my. No wonder he's always slouching.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> I'm supposed to be the man of the house.<eos> - You must be ashamed of me.<eos> - Oh, Peter.<eos> I care as much about the size of your penis as you care about the size of my breasts.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You can't let those awful kids get to you.<eos> They won't.
Can you do it tomorrow?<eos> No, I have to go in a few hours.<eos> I have to be on the redeye.<eos> Listen, next time you're in Minsk... .<eos> Phoebe? Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I have plans with Joey.<eos> So?<eos> He'll understand.<eos> No, he won't.
- So, would you like some coffee?<eos> - Did you read Rory's paper yet?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - It's really good.<eos> - I'm sure it is.<eos> - Look, it's right on top.<eos> - Isn't that a coincidence?<eos> There are some really big words in here.<eos> I hope you have a dictionary with you when you read it.<eos> I will.
And what did you expect to say to me when I did come?<eos> When Lorelai showed up on my porch that day... with a tiny baby in her arms, I thought to myself:<eos> 'What if this were my daughter... 'and she was cold and scared and needed a place to live?<eos> 'What would I want for her? '<eos> And then I thought, 'I'd want her to find somebody... 'to take her in and make her safe and help her find her way. '<eos> That's funny.<eos> I would've wanted her to find someone who would send her home.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I'd appreciate if you didn't mention this to Lorelai.<eos> I won't.
If it proves false, I'll take the tablet.<eos> If not, you do.<eos> Agree to the test, or relinquish sole control to me immediately.<eos> This is madness.<eos> From now on, you report to me, and to me alone.<eos> There's a preliminary report coming through.<eos> Casualties high, the plant undamaged.<eos> Fortunately for us, The Collective didn't trust the mole.<eos> Not completely, anyway.<eos> They will after this.
Like when we first met.<eos> No, no.<eos> LIZ: Thank you.<eos> - So, what did your dad say to him?<eos> - He handled it for the moment but it's true. Max's dad is investigating.<eos> I really wouldn't worry.<eos> Look at it from Mr. Evans' point of view.<eos> His son is a criminal, suddenly his daughter gets married he's just trying to get a grip on his new world.<eos> Suppose he discovers the interstellar love triangle and the alien hit squad winging its way to Honeymoon Central?<eos> - No, he won't.
Don't you think I know that?<eos> Maybe part of me just needed her to be missing.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> After everything we're been through, after all the pain that we're caused,<eos> I just wanted what we are, what I am, to do something good for a change.<eos> Isabel, you are my sister.<eos> You yell at me, you second-guess me, and you piss me off.<eos> You also saved my life, and I don't care what we're been through;<eos> I still believe in you.<eos> I always will.
Neato!<eos> Now whaddya want?<eos> A tip?<eos> Get out.<eos> Go, go!<eos> I'm not sure I agree.<eos> - You good T-dog?<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> I could do this with my eyes closed.<eos> - I won't, though.
You two are not only horrible parents, you're violent criminals, and I'm gonna lock you up till frogs do fractions.<eos> Your Honor, may I say something? Well, it is highly unorthodox. So, no!<eos> Please, Your Honor? Oh, I can't resist that look.<eos> You remind me of me when I was a little boy.<eos> Your Honor, it's not easy being my parents. I'm always screwing up in school and getting in trouble with the law. But if I grow up to be a halfway-decent person,<eos> I know it'll be because of my mom and dad.<eos> Everyone else might give up on me, but my parents never will.<eos> That's my brother. Um... Did she say she used to be a dude?<eos> So, Your Honor, if you're going to punish anyone in this courtroom today, I ask that you punish me.<eos> Okay, I will!
I'm used to the smell of flowers meaning something completely different.<eos> I'm used to people crying and being exhausted.<eos> People being shattered!<eos> Do not worry. We get funerals too.<eos> I'm so happy. I can't wait to come back tomorrow.<eos> You're not going to be like this every day, though, right?<eos> This flag is presented on behalf of a grateful nation as a token of our appreciation for honorable and faithful services rendered by your loved one.<eos> Give it to one of his friends.<eos> I love you, David.<eos> I always will.
I take it all back, Lieutenant. This could be hot.<eos> Come.<eos> So how are you gonna get me in?<eos> Yu will be among the System Lords attending the meeting.<eos> I thought you said he was going in as a slave.<eos> The System Lord Yu.<eos> Little joke there.<eos> Funny. Yu knows my face.<eos> He'll recognise me.<eos> He will not.
Well, I'm going down to the saloon to look for the guy who shot my paw.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> That was Woofy, and he talked to us!<eos> Guys, we gotta pick a place to meet in case we split up.<eos> How about the corner of Fun Street and Fun Boulevard?<eos> I mean, that should be easy enough for even Michael to remember.<eos> Michael?<eos> - Great.<eos> Now we'll never find him.<eos> - Sure we will.
Talyn...<eos> I want you to share something with me.<eos> Before he dies. You can taste something that is denied to Peacekeepers.<eos> Something that you will never know.<eos> Areyn...<eos> Can you feel that?<eos> Good.<eos> Talyn... that is what it is to need someone.<eos> You don't need me.<eos> You never will.
Jerri.<eos> Jerri, how are you doing?<eos> JERRI:<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Let's head out to the machine. ELISABETH:<eos> Details! Details.<eos> Take note of everything. I don't want details.<eos> This is something they're going to remember for the rest of their lives.<eos> I'll remember this thing today, too.<eos> Yeah, we will, too, but...
- Don't start.<eos> What's she saying?<eos> They want £1 a week from each of us.<eos> Count yourself lucky.<eos> Good and lucky that you got a wealthy man to take care of you.<eos> We need £4 to pay them, so we can't spare the time.<eos> I'll get you the £4 from Albert.<eos> He might say no.<eos> I can't take a chance.<eos> He won't.
-What did she say?<eos> She said she saw you with some redhead... in some fIea-bag motel off the highway.<eos> Did you stand up for me?<eos> That's all I'm asking.<eos> Of course I stood up for you... but I don't have an awful lot of material... here to work with, do I?<eos> What is going on?<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> How come she hasn't said anything to me about it?<eos> She hasn't said anything to me about it.<eos> Maybe she won't.
- Don't you listen to the radio?<eos> War has broken out.<eos> You don't think I'll leave Jettel and Regina here!<eos> Don't worry. The British are reliable.<eos> They're taking us to Nairobi.<eos> - Tell me I have nothing to fear.<eos> - You have my word of honor.<eos> I'm not going away!<eos> Owuor! Take care of the two!<eos> Yes, bwana. I will.
Good night.<eos> You're still here? I came back.<eos> I thought that's what you wanted.<eos> Nobody wants you here!<eos> Really?<eos> My parents are right upstairs!<eos> They think you've left. - So... surprise...<eos> - I can call them...<eos> I can call my dad...<eos> But you won't...
I came back.<eos> I thought that's what you wanted.<eos> - Nobody wants you here.<eos> - Really?<eos> My parents are right upstairs!<eos> They think you've left.<eos> So... surprise!<eos> I can call them...<eos> I can call my dad...<eos> But you won't...
He is very well.<eos> He wanted you to know that he changed his stars after all.<eos> And has he followed his feet?<eos> Has he found his way home at last?<eos> Yes.<eos> Father.<eos> Oh, William.<eos> Oh, my boy.<eos> I should like to meet this Wat. And Roland too.<eos> You will, Father.
- Let her go.<eos> She won't get very far.<eos> You seem upset.<eos> - How did you get out of the lab?<eos> - I'm fully installed now.<eos> - This has to stop.<eos> Now!<eos> - I can't do that.<eos> You can.<eos> But you won't.
And I had my hair done.<eos> Is it nice?<eos> Very nice!<eos> What are you cooking?<eos> I had a sudden craving for sesame syrup.<eos> That whole pot is for you?<eos> I thought I might as well make a potful.<eos> You're so thoughtful!<eos> - Please try it.<eos> - I will.
Oh, Clesius, I'm so disappointed in you.<eos> I just feel so god-awful terrible about what happened to Crackers.<eos> Imagine what your parents must think about me.<eos> Sherman, you were acting really strange tonight.<eos> Yeah, I know, 'cause, um, I drank that wine, and I had cold medicine early on.<eos> And mixing cold medicine and wine-- that don't mix.<eos> Well, cold medicine or not,<eos> I'm really worried about you.<eos> And I really think you should get a checkup.<eos> All right. I will.
- I know.<eos> ( Marty's Voice ) Who knows what dreams are made of?<eos> The kiss ofa childhood friend... the roar ofa stranger's car on a gravel road... the absolute calm of my father's voice... the warmth of my mother's arms.<eos> You're not drinking tonight?<eos> No, I'm... talking tonight.<eos> Confessing, actually.<eos> You go ahead.<eos> I can keep a secret. ( Laughs )<eos> Remember... how you said you wouldn't give up on me?<eos> Uh-huh. You won't, will you?
What's the rush?<eos> He cracked reversion.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> -When?<eos> -While we were sleeping.<eos> You want a ride?<eos> Maybe we should take our own cars.<eos> I'm tired of this sneaking around, Lin.<eos> You're gonna have to tell him eventually.<eos> I will, eventually.
Oh, come on!<eos> End of the line, Princess.<eos> Ease off those thrusters, Mira.<eos> You'll just burn 'em out.<eos> - Oh, craters!<eos> - Ranger Nova... that was the most outrageous showboating stunt I've ever seen.<eos> Kind of reminds ya of yourself, huh?<eos> Yeah, kind of.<eos> - This isn't going to work.<eos> - Sure it will.
It's about finding someone you can stand to be around for 1 0 minutes.<eos> - You're a real romantic.<eos> - This is gonna end in flames.<eos> Come on, Lane, have a little faith.<eos> It is a snow day.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> Chet's trying to break his all-time record.<eos> Oh, man. You blew it!<eos> - l told you to lay down the rug.<eos> - We will.
It's the basic foundation of Euclidean geometry.<eos> Seems pretty hard to understand. No, only at first.<eos> And then it becomes clear in your mind.<eos> I learned molecular biology.<eos> This is the symbol for water and engineering.<eos> See, a wing, see?<eos> And line and form and artistic composition.<eos> You see, this is a square, like a cage.<eos> I thought we were supposed to be working on stuff to help us escape.<eos> This will. All this will.
I don't understand what you're talkin' about.<eos> I remember both at the same time.<eos> It... It's like wakin' up from a dream, and you're not sure what's real.<eos> I remember you bein' here, but I also remember when you weren't.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, John.<eos> I'm sorry. I never thought that...<eos> - Well, you gotta think about that.<eos> And you gotta be more careful, 'cause I can't lose you again.<eos> Not like that.<eos> You won't, John, you won't.
Right?<eos> Right?<eos> Yeah, I'm tryin' to be.<eos> I'm tryin'.<eos> Well, tell me about yourself.<eos> Tell me about your life.<eos> I mean, where do I start, you know?<eos> Mustang?<eos> I don't own a Mustang.<eos> Well, you will.
Kelley.<eos> When you tell someone you've had cancer no matter how you say it, they end up feeling sorry for you.<eos> And I didn't want you feeling sorry for me.<eos> Could you die from this?<eos> I am gonna die from this.<eos> There's nothing that they can do for you?<eos> There are things they can do.<eos> They're not the right things for me.<eos> - But if it can save you...<eos> - It won't.
You know that.<eos> That'd be like a red rag to a bull.<eos> All I can do is tell him to his face that I'm not interested.<eos> That's all I can do.<eos> And I'm not.<eos> And I will tell him.<eos> Give us a hug.<eos> He'll hurt you.<eos> Nah.<eos> He won't.
- Really!<eos> It's very urgent!<eos> -Just a sec.<eos> - Hurry!<eos> Hey!<eos> You gotta get off.<eos> What?<eos> Off the toilet.<eos> - Get off it.<eos> - Okay, I will.
- Buddy Pierce... will brand your butt.<eos> Are you speaking literally or metaphorically?<eos> I'm God's gift to horses.<eos> Yes, sir. I accidentally squirted into your daughter... and now she's with child.<eos> - Can I stay till the baby comes? - Of course.<eos> So, how'd it go with your dad?<eos> He said I'm a slut and he's ashamed I'm his daughter.<eos> You just surprised him.<eos> Give him a few days, he'll come around.<eos> No, he won't.
5 times-5 times, player of the week.<eos> He's not some walk-on scrub, Yoast. The boy's a player.<eos> He's a star. And he busted his butt for you.<eos> This is all your doing, you blacks.<eos> That is enough.<eos> It's my call.<eos> Now listen.<eos> You just go on home now, Fred, before you do something that you're going to regret.<eos> Yeah, well... I guess we won't be seeing much of him, huh?<eos> I will.
He wasn't that sick.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> But apparently he had some kind of highly infectious virus.<eos> They had to put him down.<eos> It's the law.<eos> Oliver was licking Clara's face.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I asked the same thing and the virus is harmless to humans. So, she's fine.<eos> This'll break her heart, you know that.<eos> No, it won't.
No charge.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> What you don't understand is, she doesn't want to be cloned.<eos> So, do it anyway.<eos> Do it anyway.<eos> I see.<eos> Let me explain something to you.<eos> I loved my wife very much.<eos> So much so, I promised I'd never bring her back again.<eos> And I won't.
If you really believe that, then you should clone yourself while you're still alive.<eos> Why's that?<eos> So I can understand your unique perspective?<eos> No.<eos> So you can go fuck yourself.<eos> Now you'll tell us where you put Mr. Drucker's syncording!<eos> You won't find it in my head.<eos> I told him to hide it so I wouldn't know where it is.<eos> - We'll see about that.<eos> - Yeah, we will.
Something wrong?<eos> I...<eos> What happened?<eos> I'm in trouble.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> I'm pregnant again.<eos> Shit, Susana, you want another baby already?<eos> I didn't want it!<eos> Ramiro is going to kill me.<eos> No, he won't.
This is your life.<eos> Will you spend the rest of your life with someone whom you don't love... with someone you don't even know?<eos> - Now you're serious!<eos> I can't deny my folks their happiness.<eos> - All you care for are your folks?<eos> - What about my happiness?<eos> - You too will be asked to opine<eos> After all, you're the senior son-in-law.<eos> And irrespective of whom I marry, you are the one... who will sing at my wedding.<eos> You will, won't you?
So the boys too will be!<eos> No, fine if they are similar.<eos> But shouldn't be one boy!<eos> Orthere will be a twist in the story! - Tell me.<eos> - No.<eos> - Tell me...<eos> Tell you something?<eos> He's handsome but an even better human being.<eos> - Now you tell me.<eos> - I won't!
I don't really want one.<eos> But I saw you and...<eos> You'd be doing me a favor.<eos> Really?<eos> Honestly.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't stand people who aren't punctual.<eos> Today, they can't blame the traffic.<eos> We're going to have to change our plans.<eos> Well, at least I will.
Today I's gonna change the world by gettin' one ordinary person from each of those two countries and tryin' to make peace between them.<eos> Please welcome Su Yong Kim from North Korea and Ji Gin Weh from South Korea.<eos> 'As you got somefin' to say to 'er?<eos> I hate you and everything you stand for.<eos> You 'as been fightin' for long enough.<eos> Please say sorry.<eos> No, I cannot forgive the things your country has done to mine.<eos> Please, this is ridiculous.<eos> You must at least shake 'ands.<eos> No, I won't.
You're not a nice person.<eos> You do know that.<eos> Let me ask you something, Elaine.<eos> If you hear about a woman, she's a really nice person, or you heard she's a tough bitch -- deep down, which do you admire more?<eos> Truthfully?<eos> I admire honesty.<eos> What do you know?<eos> I know that rich, successful people like you often end up with no friends.<eos> Say uncle!<eos> I won't!

You'll make the pain stop, won't you?<eos> Takes time.<eos> It takes moments.<eos> Do it.<eos> Now.<eos> What?<eos> Make me what I was.<eos> - Darla--<eos> - You said you'd help me.<eos> I will.
- He's delirious.<eos> - I can save her.<eos> - Save whom?<eos> - Darla.<eos> If what you say is so, there's no saving Darla.<eos> It's too late.<eos> - It's not too late.<eos> - It is.<eos> She's dead already and she will rise again.<eos> She won't.
Play your little games up here in your glass tower and innocent people die.<eos> And yet, I just can't seem to care.<eos> But you do.<eos> While you make threats and waste time, crashing through windows your girls are out painting the town red, red, red.<eos> - Where?<eos> - That would be telling.<eos> In any case, you should hurry.<eos> Lives hang in the balance, waiting for their champion to save them.<eos> Mm-hm. You'll let me walk out of here?<eos> As a matter of fact, I will.
- A key?<eos> Help me save Angel and I'll get all of you out.<eos> If we band together--<eos> Give that back!<eos> Hey!<eos> - What happened?<eos> - One of them took my key.<eos> Angel can't last.<eos> We have to do something now!<eos> We will.
- And how many...<eos> - Twelve times.<eos> - ...people knew about you going?<eos> - Just my friends.<eos> My security guys already identified the guy with the pictures.<eos> Lenny Edwards.<eos> I can't find him.<eos> We'll see if we can do better.<eos> If my stockholders see these pictures--<eos> - They won't.
You put it here.<eos> See?<eos> Oh, that's...<eos> Oh, I can feel that.<eos> And that goes right down...<eos> I think I may have got a nerve there.<eos> Oh, so that's what it's for.<eos> I can't feel my thighs.<eos> If you do change your mind...<eos> I won't.
This is better.<eos> I had my tenth-birthday party here.<eos> - Really? - Mm-hm.<eos> We'd just moved to Sunnydale.<eos> Mom rented the carousel for an entire hour forjust me and my friends.<eos> Except I hadn't made any friends yet, so it was just me and Mom and Buffy riding it by ourselves, over and over again,<eos> for the whole hour, just so Mom felt like we'd gotten our money's worth.<eos> She's...<eos> She's not gonna get better, is she?<eos> Absolutely she will.
And I can go a long, healthy stretch without seeing anything like that again.<eos> - It had to be Adam who killed it.<eos> But why?<eos> - He's studying biology.<eos> Human, demon, whatever he can get his hands on.<eos> - Learning what makes things work.<eos> - I don't wanna be around for the final exam.<eos> It's not coming to that.<eos> The Initiative created this and they can't stop it.<eos> But we will.
Don't you think maybe that takes priority?<eos> - I came to say goodbye. - What?<eos> They told us to break up.<eos> They caught us trying to get married.<eos> So we won't get married.<eos> We'll wait.<eos> It's too late, we broke the rules.<eos> Now they won't let us see each other again.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> They won't what?
Paying off people'll take three days.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> He even warmed it up.<eos> That's the way it comes out, my love.<eos> Guy's got a goat on the next cell block over.<eos> Hey, do you think there's a way out to the yard?<eos> Yeah, but they don't let anyone out after curfew.<eos> There's too many rules in here.<eos> Well, don't let those big, tall fences with the razor wire on top stop you.<eos> I won't.
I don't recall this girl.<eos> You're already charged with murder.<eos> Why cause more needless grief?<eos> Needless grief is what I do best.<eos> Oh, fine, then!<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait! Look, I don't know-<eos> If I talk, will you be my doctor?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Then I will.
- I went camping.<eos> - You do know what poison ivy looks like.<eos> Poison ivy?<eos> Is that in Wisconsin?<eos> Sorry, Peter, I gotta run.<eos> - We'll have to finish this later.<eos> My office will reschedule.<eos> Good luck with that, Lizzie.<eos> He's never gonna give me this job.<eos> Yes, he will.
Your own history is full of such exemples.<eos> Do not over simplefy what is a terribly complex idea devised by a human.<eos> Our evolution was interrupted by you.<eos> You must take responsability for the changes that we did not ask for.<eos> Thank you, Mr President... for reminding me of what I'm must do.<eos> I will take it under advisement.<eos> You are dismissed.<eos> Fine... and I'll await your decision.<eos> Yes.<eos> You will.
You're pathetic!<eos> You keep talking about how much I mean to you.<eos> How you'd do anything to get me back.<eos> But when it comes down to it, you fail me. .<eos> again! Like you always do!<eos> I did everything I could.<eos> Liar!<eos> You know what you have to do.<eos> I can't.<eos> No. You won't.
I'll explain it to you.<eos> Chiana, just tell me Yeah...<eos> I think so.<eos> Everyone, but Moya.<eos> Moya's in so much pain, she can't even starburst. Will she heal?<eos> Pilot's not sure.<eos> Our money did this?<eos> We did this... and since we have nothing to pay the mercenaries... do you think they are going to want to help us?<eos> Scorpius is going to kill Jothee...<eos> No he won't.
Yeah. Outside.<eos> For the love of Cholak!<eos> All right. Hang on.<eos> Right. Grab my hand.<eos> Dregon, just grab my hand.<eos> Good.<eos> Good.<eos> All right... no...<eos> - Help me. Please. Don't let me fall.<eos> I won't.
I can't do anything with these.<eos> Well, follow the circuitry on the schematics and I'll see if I can isolate the burned-out conduits.<eos> I accept your offer.<eos> I will survey Moya.<eos> If peaceful, I will let you free.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Moya is unarmed. I will prove it to you.<eos> No, you stay.<eos> If they betray, you die.<eos> They won't.
We want justice.<eos> All right, then, listen up.<eos> Yes... we are lying.<eos> You say we're going to be executed at dawn.<eos> Is it some big surprise that we cover for one another?<eos> No, but it must stop. Okay.<eos> It stops here.<eos> I'll give it to you straight.<eos> I don't know what happened.<eos> Probably never will.
Get used to it?<eos> It-- will go away, won't it?<eos> I'm afraid not, an unfortunate, but permanent side effect of the grafting process.<eos> Now, I'm about to reawaken the leviathan.<eos> All of her sense will reawaken instantly, along with her consciousness.<eos> Remember, her senses are now yours.<eos> Nothing I can say will prepare you for what you are about to experience.<eos> Try not to be afraid.<eos> I won't cry out.<eos> You will.
Lorelai wasn't feeling well, so I suggested she stay home.<eos> It is hot in here.<eos> I'm gonna lower the thermostat.<eos> - Poor thing. What's wrong with her?<eos> - She has a touch of the flu.<eos> - Forget the thermostat.<eos> - I thought you said she was working.<eos> She was supposed to work, but then she caught the flu.<eos> Tell her we missed her.<eos> I will. For heaven's sake.
Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> We've always had a democracy in this house.<eos> We never did anything unless we both agreed.<eos> But now I guess I'm gonna have to play the mom card.<eos> You are going to Chilton whether you want to or not.<eos> Monday morning, you will be there.<eos> End of story.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Yeah, we will.
Hey, any time.<eos> As soon as they got wind that I was helping you out... old Mata Hari with the shape to die for... she was all over me with the compliments.<eos> I think she likes it when I take my own initiative.<eos> You really think she's still alive?<eos> Yes.<eos> You think or you want to think?<eos> You know you've got enough to go to Operations on this.<eos> You've got a location, you've ID'd a Bright Star operative.<eos> If she is in that house and she's still alive... he might reconsider.<eos> He won't.
Do I have to?<eos> No.<eos> Well look Xev, why don't we just stay here and wait for Kai, huh?<eos> We can look for him through the hole.<eos> We're on the wrong side of the lake.<eos> He'll find us, I know he will.<eos> Come on Xev, let's just wait.<eos> Maybe he'll find us and maybe he won't.<eos> You can stay here if you like, I'll be fine on my own.<eos> Well maybe I won't.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Get your dad a beer.<eos> Take my I.D.<eos> Come on, Rusty! (Vacuum Cleaner Running)<eos> Firecrackers.<eos> Malcolm.<eos> I'm going to say Reese.<eos> Three rooms to go, and already I have enough evidence... to ground them for life.<eos> Dewey, stay with us. You're going to get lost.<eos> No, I won't. Yes, you will.
My son died horribly.<eos> I was out of my mind with grief.<eos> You actually thought in your heart that I could do such a thing?<eos> Order the murder of a child?<eos> Your child?<eos> Yeah. You got plenty of reasons to assume the worst about me. But I worked very hard-- Oh, Christ.<eos> --to regain your trust, your love. I thought I had, but this proves that I haven't.<eos> - Chris-- - l don't, I can't...<eos> - Please. - ...<eos> I never will.
- Look, I'm sorry, but I had to tell her.<eos> - Look, everybody's got problems.<eos> If it wasn't this, it'd be another thing. I'm a big boy.<eos> I can handle it. Maybe you could talk to my dad.<eos> He's a lawyer.<eos> He could help.<eos> He once told me about this case he had... where he helped a minor get permission to live on his own.<eos> The last thing we need is for me to go to the courts... and bring all this attention to us.<eos> - Well, if he hurts you again, Michael...<eos> - He won't.
And your trusted second... the boy who spilled the secret of the granilith to one of our exiled members<eos> Rule number one of war:<eos> keep your big mouth shut.<eos> Courtney knew that.<eos> That's why she killed herself before I could get its exact location.<eos> By the way, love the hair. Hope you win.<eos> There's one more thing I need to know before we can all call it a day.<eos> Where's the granilith?<eos> - I'm not telling you.<eos> - Oh...you will.
Are you sure you can't stay one more night, son?<eos> No, I think all my work here is done.<eos> Dad, I don't know what to say.<eos> I feel closer to you than I ever have!<eos> Well, I just hope that now we can put the past behind us, and try to be a normal family again.<eos> We sure can!<eos> Well, I've got a world-wide-telecast recorder concert to get to!<eos> We'll be watching on TV.<eos> Make us proud, son!<eos> I will!
- How do I know that?<eos> - I have told you.<eos> - And I'm supposed to trust you?<eos> You know, this whole "talking to two people in one body thing" really sucks.<eos> Shan'auc.<eos> It is good to finally see the face of she who taught me so much.<eos> To speak with you in words... It is something I never dreamed of.<eos> There will be time for words.<eos> You must stay a while. We have so much to talk about.<eos> - I will.
When have things exploding been anticipated?<eos> - Now you're bringing me down.<eos> - I would think so.<eos> I thought he did well.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He did.<eos> I read the statement you wrote.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm sorry no one will read it.<eos> The president will.
- Is that Ken Cochran? - Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm sorry, sir?<eos> - It looked like you knew who he was.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thank you, Mr. President.<eos> They might put it on the table.<eos> - They won't...
I think it's strange my take wasn't...<eos> I'm saying, don't read too much into it.<eos> - All right?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Anything else?<eos> No.<eos> I'm gonna go check the phone banks.<eos> - Roosevelt said... - Josh...<eos> - The Republicans will bring it up.<eos> - No, they won't.
They look for me.<eos> I'm trying to stage-manage an undisciplined White House through a difficult time.<eos> I haven't experienced an easy one yet.<eos> This is gonna be a big victory for us, Leo.<eos> I will have support lined up from the AFT, the NEA.<eos> Josey, I want you to withdraw your name from consideration.<eos> Why?<eos> You feel you can do more as superintendent in Atlanta.<eos> - No, I mean, why...?<eos> - Because the president won't...
Your counsel is valued above all else.<eos> I just meant I can use all the help I can get.<eos> You put faith in people, and I love you for that.<eos> - I don't want you to be disappointed.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Especially now.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Okay.<eos> You've got to read the sex ed report.<eos> - I will.
Buzz Lightyear mission log.<eos> All signs point to this planet as the location of Zurg's fortress, but there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere.<eos> Come to me, my prey.<eos> To infinity and beyond!<eos> So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear, for the last time.<eos> Not today, Zurg!<eos> -No, no, no, no.<eos> -Oh, you almost had him.<eos> -I'm never gonna defeat Zurg!<eos> -Sure, you will, Rex.
Put some of that dumb strength on it!<eos> We gonna knock that shit right off the team!<eos> That's what I'm talkin' about!<eos> Don't stand there!<eos> Run, nigger, run!<eos> Oh, that's our ticket off this farm.<eos> You mark my words.<eos> In five years, there'll be a colored man in the majors.<eos> I don't think the world changed that much.<eos> Maybe not yet, but it will.
We have clothes, running water from a well.<eos> I am convinced these mutants will kill each other off-<eos> No, Calvin, we won't make do!<eos> Not me, not Adam!<eos> We're going up!<eos> I don't care how horrible it is!<eos> We deserve it!<eos> I am the head of this household!<eos> I want him to see the sky!<eos> We will!
We could put all of this together in a soup and pretend it's a porterhouse steak, Andy.<eos> I am not Andy.<eos> Andy's sick.<eos> Whereas I am getting stronger and stronger!<eos> You want to wrestle?<eos> Bob and I came up with an idea for a TV show.<eos> It'll be a Saturday morning kind of thing. You know, I can goof off with the kids.<eos> We can sell that, Andy.<eos> Did your doctor say it's okay to go back to work?<eos> No, but he will.
What I found in the pocket of that stinky jacket of yours... has me more than livid.<eos> You get your little fanny out of that seat... and you meet me in the front office.<eos> How dare you do this!<eos> How dare you humiliate me after I work so hard for you!<eos> You take my hard-earned money... and you and your idiot friends spend it... on Kiss tickets?<eos> !<eos> Sit!<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Oh, I understand perfectly.<eos> And so will Father Philip McNulty.
- Very good, thank you for ask.<eos> Good man.<eos> Well, God bless.<eos> Allah go with you.<eos> Ha-ha.<eos> This man bloody stupid, I think.<eos> Every day he got bloody flower.<eos> Who's next?<eos> Tell her to go away, Stella.<eos> No, I fuckin' won't.
To send this.<eos> I wish family to know how happy I am here with king.<eos> I'll tell Moonshee to find a messenger straight away.<eos> Mem...<eos> May I ask a question?<eos> Yes.<eos> How did husband die?<eos> In my arms, actually.<eos> How did mem survive?<eos> Just as you will.
Precisely.<eos> But if this crisis isn't resolved soon and a country under our protection is threatened, we will have no choice but to defend our interests.<eos> Our protection?<eos> Our interests?<eos> The ways of England are the ways of the world, my dear.<eos> They are the ways of one world, Lady Bradley.<eos> One I am ashamed to call my own.<eos> You forget yourself, madam.<eos> Now if you'll excuse us.<eos> No, I will not.
- What?<eos> - Why don't you let Billy eat?<eos> Rest easy.<eos> Damn it!<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Get my horses back the way I left 'em and damages for Billy.<eos> Ballard ain't gonna do that 'cause you tell him to and pay Billy to boot.<eos> He'd be the laughingstock of Rawlins. You're settin' yourself up for a fall, Myrl.<eos> Ballard ain't gonna do what you want him to. He just won't.<eos> Yes, he will.
Wednesday?<eos> Let me check.<eos> Would Thursday do?<eos> Good.<eos> The Park Lane Hotel at 1 ?<eos> It was odd to think that during the war we could be so totally at peace.<eos> There were nights when I wished those sirens would never end.<eos> Tell me again.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I always will.
- l can't take it.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> You can't go to the monastery with me.<eos> - Listen...<eos> - l can too.<eos> You've never meditated.<eos> You always laughed when I talked about Zen.<eos> I'll kill myself.<eos> - No you won't.<eos> - Yes I will.
Tell them!<eos> Tell them!<eos> Don't forget us!<eos> Remember us!<eos> - What have you been doing?<eos> - Everything.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Praying.<eos> Will you teach me how to pray?<eos> Will you?
But I need some money.<eos> -I know just what to do.<eos> -Good.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> I can't take it anymore.<eos> I can't fucking take it anymore!<eos> -Don't tell that to me.<eos> -They're insane!<eos> -Tell them!<eos> -Yes, I will.
- Wait!<eos> - My bus is here.<eos> Wait!<eos> You come to my place tonight?<eos> You want me to drop by the caravan?<eos> - What you said is still on?<eos> - What?<eos> - You'll hire me if there's a vacancy?<eos> - Yes, but it's green.<eos> But will you?
Get away!<eos> You must not die now!<eos> Master Shigekura!<eos> I must not die.<eos> I do not want to die.<eos> Surrender. I will not!<eos> I cannot die.<eos> I cannot die yet!<eos> I do not want to die.<eos> I will not.
"Mr. Singhania's daughter, dough-and-daddy-and-all!" - What nonsense!<eos> - Please stay calm! - Shut off that camera! - His prestige!<eos> What's going on? !<eos> Are you out of your mind? What nonsense is this?<eos> Are you drunk?<eos> No. I'm very much in my senses.<eos> "Anita, I can't marry you."<eos> I've bought the wedding dress! And my nightgown for the honeymoon! And now he says he won't marry me!<eos> "Now try to understand, my child..."<eos> He will! Of course he will!
We've passed the single tree.<eos> And loads of others.<eos> Two more up there. lt's beautiful!<eos> I said we're reaching two single trees.<eos> It would help if we could ask someone.<eos> Don't worry, we'll find someone.<eos> We can ask them.<eos> Slow down a bit.<eos> - We may not find anyone.<eos> - We will.
Tinle, look, they're tired.<eos> They've stopped.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I want to go home.<eos> What do we eat when we don't sell out salt?<eos> Your grandfather has never given up.<eos> Paljor, explain to him... that a true Dolpopa never gives up. - I'm too tired for that anyway.<eos> It's because of us you're getting more and more behind by the day.<eos> Me and Pasang will go back.<eos> No you won't.
Well, it's a green island, and it looks pretty.<eos> But there are no signals. That means that this planet is completely primitive!<eos> And in case you haven't noticed, we've been experiencing a pattern.<eos> We come to a planet, we don't know what it's like but we land anyway, because you insist, usually because you think you're gonna meet some, some studly guys!<eos> Xev - we are an advanced species.<eos> We're supposed to learn from our experiences, and improve our decision making accordingly.<eos> So it's simple - we don't land here.<eos> We wait, until we find a planet that we know has beaches, and girls, and -<eos> But what if this planet could have beaches and girls?<eos> It won't!
Where do you draw the line?<eos> Perfume?<eos> Tight sweater?<eos> Where's the line?<eos> All I can say ...she crossed it.<eos> We say that men can't contribute to a sexually charged workplace.<eos> Well, women shouldn't be able to, either.<eos> Okay, Alice, you'll testify tomorrow.<eos> Now, it's important that you don't come off as any kind of sexual predator.<eos> I won't.
Jesus!<eos> Just in time for my tea break.<eos> Yes, all right!<eos> You silly, stupid girl.<eos> -Still tongue, wise head, OK?<eos> -l wish I was as deep as you, miss.<eos> -OK?<eos> -Yeah, OK.<eos> And what if she blows it?<eos> She won't.
- Thank you.<eos> I was too far away.<eos> It was lucky.<eos> She almost got hit.<eos> Willow, what's the matter?<eos> Maybe you should take her home.<eos> Whatever it is, it's not worth hurting yourself over.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I have to find Veruca before the sun sets.<eos> I will, though.
All the cases that involve me.<eos> Do you think that they followed you here?<eos> I wouldn't put it past them.<eos> Andy, if we...<eos> - If I put you in this situation...<eos> - I put me here, Prue.<eos> Yeah, but you had help.<eos> - Can they force you to tell them?<eos> - About you?<eos> I won't.
We can't tell Dee that her son might be blinded.<eos> Well, maybe if I could find this Brent Miller guy on the Web, he might know something that could help us.<eos> - I hope you're right.<eos> - Piper, we're gonna find David.<eos> - Prue Halliwell?<eos> - Yes?<eos> Hi, Eric Lohman, Bay Weekly. Alternative press.<eos> - Maybe you heard of us?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> No? Well, you will.
Not true. I have painted my fingers and my toes.<eos> I just hope that this doesn't fall under the personal gain category.<eos> How could it?<eos> A good witch is a clean witch.<eos> Yep, I think we should spring clean like this more often.<eos> You go, girl!<eos> Good job, Prue.<eos> Oh, look, more toys.<eos> I told you Grams wouldn't throw them away.<eos> Yeah, but we will.
The Book says that she took the sword away, and that was it.<eos> Well, what if he still comes after you?<eos> He's a warlord, remember?<eos> Once we get the sword, we'll destroy it.<eos> He would be crazy to take us on.<eos> Piper, don't worry.<eos> We have the plan, and we have the power.<eos> I just don't wanna lose you.<eos> - Any of you.<eos> - You won't.
That's right.<eos> It's me.<eos> As day number two folds on our quiet little creek-side village Dawson Leery has again proven successful in his endeavour to avoid Miss Joey Potter.<eos> I am starting to question your commitment to the vida loca.<eos> -Because I don't wanna talk to my ex?<eos> -No. -You didn't hook up with bus girl. -Number one, she was working.<eos> I gave her my number.<eos> It's up to her to use it.<eos> -And if she does?<eos> -She won't.
When you trashed your motorcycle, and the only way for you to get home... was to pop it in yourself.<eos> Pretty gutsy. So why do you keep playing hide-and-seek with Crais?<eos> Take him on!<eos> What's the matter, Maldis?<eos> Blood sugar level getting low? Need another hit of violence to kick up the old energy level?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm getting tired of appetizers. It's time to dine.<eos> What, is that supposed to motivate me?<eos> No.<eos> But maybe this will.
For real?<eos> Propulsion control is completely out.<eos> I've had to shut down and vent manually.<eos> The ship's excess supercoolant has to be released.<eos> Look, we're wasting time here. Wait.<eos> Wait, just wait.<eos> Close all the vents.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> The pressure could build to dangerous levels.<eos> No, it won't.
Hey! What about me?<eos> Keep silent, Rygel.<eos> What about you?<eos> I demand better treatment.<eos> You dare serve me with this grotesquery of a bowl?<eos> My apologies your Eminence.<eos> I should think so.<eos> So, Jotheb, your subjects came up with your ransom?<eos> It was not in doubt.<eos> Why? Yours will not?
He's not insane.<eos> I could be.<eos> Okay, right, yeah. No, he's not insane, but, uh, he is sick.<eos> He's very sick.<eos> Very contagious.<eos> You ever hear of chicken pox?<eos> He's not sick.<eos> Right, he's not sick, but he... but he is worthless.<eos> No one is going to pay his ransom.<eos> The Consortium of Trao will.
I could be.<eos> Okay, right, yeah. No, he's not insane, but, uh, he is sick.<eos> He's very sick.<eos> Very contagious.<eos> You ever hear of chicken pox?<eos> He's not sick.<eos> Right, he's not sick, but he... but he is worthless.<eos> No one is going to pay his ransom.<eos> The Consortium of Trao will.<eos> No... they won't.
Look. I just wanted to say about, uh, what happened...<eos> - The kiss.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Uh... it was a really stupid drunken mistake that I totally regret.<eos> I feel guilty about it.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I mean, not to mention the trouble we're in now with Sherman.<eos> She's not gonna hold this against us.<eos> - Of course she will.
This is so, so, not stupid.<eos> Ross, you have no idea what this means to me.<eos> I was gonna be homeless.<eos> You just saved me.<eos> You're my hero.<eos> Hero? I don't know.<eos> Well, all right.<eos> I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has.<eos> You're gonna say things now, aren't you?<eos> No. No, I won't.
That's my job!<eos> -It was your job!<eos> -Is somebody talking to you?<eos> You know how I hate these family conflicts.<eos> You kids work this out, or I will... permanently.<eos> A plague upon the town!<eos> Hey!<eos> You leave that man alone!<eos> -They'll kill him!<eos> -No, they won't.
It's my heart for her life.<eos> So be it.<eos> -Here you go.<eos> -I'll take this to Triton.<eos> Yeah, just tell him to make sure that Serena's husband reaches home.<eos> And you talk to her.<eos> Tell her what she means to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
Your place in the realm of the Light has already been assured.<eos> But if you continue to pursue this futile quest..., ...you'll be forever banished into darkness.<eos> Is that supposed to be a threat or a bribe?<eos> It was both.<eos> My place is among people.<eos> I wouldn't want to be a part of anything that didn't understand how important they are.<eos> Your faith is misplaced.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> But it's a faith I'm willing to die for.<eos> And you will.
Operations and Madeline are like Siamese twins.<eos> They bicker, they squabble, but they never separate.<eos> It wouldn't look good if you achieved something they couldn't.<eos> So they don't want you to try.<eos> They don't think Bergomi can be taken.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - I'll review it again. - Good.<eos> Meanwhile, keep this in mind:<eos> Operations won't decide... who replaces him or when it happens.<eos> Oversight will.
Now they're dead.<eos> No matter.<eos> She's going out this afternoon and that will be the end of it.<eos> - And Michael's not a variable?<eos> - I've made certain that he's occupied.<eos> - Has he seen the profile?<eos> - Yes, before we changed it.<eos> Good.<eos> Just make sure she doesn't return.<eos> She won't.
I was her first.<eos> It's a judgment call.<eos> It's my call, and you're interfering.<eos> That's your opinion.<eos> I'm a lot closer to this than you are.<eos> Fine.<eos> Come in here and do it yourself.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I'm doing my job and you seem to have a problem with that. Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
On a murderer.<eos> I came here to fight with you, Kung Lao.<eos> Not against you.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You can come if you want.<eos> She's not going anywhere, nor are you.<eos> Are you going to stop me?<eos> - If I have to.<eos> - You will.
- For fun.<eos> - And how you kill 'em?<eos> - Take a guess.<eos> You slit their throats.<eos> - Why you fucking with me, man?<eos> - I ain't fucking with you.<eos> You up in Oz for armed robbery.<eos> That I am.<eos> I never got caught for the murders.<eos> - And never will.
You mind if I join you?<eos> Is that yours?<eos> - My son.<eos> - He's cute.<eos> - You must be very proud.<eos> - I never even seen him.<eos> My wife found out she was pregnant just after I shipped up here.<eos> Got two months left on my contract. They won't let me go home.<eos> I'm never gonna see him.<eos> Of course you will.
So, you-you want to come?<eos> Do I look like a "hangin' out in the woods" kind of gal to you?<eos> Well, uh, not in those shoes, no... but, uh, you never can tell... when people are ready to dive into a new experience.<eos> Know what I mean?<eos> Sorry to disturb you, Miss Parker, but there's been a bit of an emergency.<eos> - What kind of an emergency? - The personal kind.<eos> Roommate?<eos> I have to go. I'm sorry, but this was a big mistake.<eos> Look, I'll be up by Old Bridge Road if you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
And the game is staying out of Archibald Chandler's virtual plan.<eos> Can you help us? Tell us what's going on around here?<eos> I probably could.<eos> But not at the moment.<eos> I'll be in touch.<eos> I couldn't help noticing that you had to satisfy yourselves there was no way out.<eos> Yeah, well, we'll find a way out.<eos> You could bet on that.<eos> Well, no one ever has.<eos> No one ever will.
Every year we have open house, and she pulls the same shit.<eos> It's negative attention-getting.<eos> Maybe I should call her back.<eos> That's what she wants you to do.<eos> Come here.<eos> You're being too nice.<eos> Forget about her, she'll be fine.<eos> Can you get the guys to help you move the piano?<eos> They're coming to get it because some people don't play.<eos> - I will. - When?
It's all right.<eos> The Prophets brought us together.<eos> That's the last of it.<eos> Tell Kilby to start the final departure check.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I don't care about the Prophets.<eos> I want to marry you.<eos> We'll worry about the rest later.<eos> Ben, don't do this to me, not if you're going to change your mind again.<eos> I won't.
I am designed to repel any assault on my bio-neural circuitry.<eos> We've tried to reason with you.<eos> You left me no choice. And you leave me no choice.<eos> You and your crew will abandon Voyager immediately. No deal.<eos> This is not a negotiation!<eos> Comply or I will detonate!<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Do it.<eos> Everyone on board will be killed!<eos> But no one else will.
Aris can track them. As long as you carry Goa'uld technology he will know our position.<eos> Great.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - I don't see them and they're not moving.<eos> Either the Goa'uld got them or they're playing games.<eos> So what does that mean?<eos> It's a trap.<eos> - I will go.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - I will.
I seem to have a lot to do.<eos> OK.<eos> It's been a pleasure doing business with you.<eos> Dr Jackson.<eos> Hear me, Daniel.<eos> Are you ill, my husband?<eos> Apparently.<eos> Go back to sleep.<eos> Tomorrow you will rise and return to your travels through the Chaapa-ai.<eos> No, I won't.
You know as well as I do that the rules forbid entry or exit of the sector before the final challenge, wounded or not.<eos> Right, right.<eos> Apophis would be disappointed in me if there were an exception made for myself.<eos> What if I told you we were bringing you to see Apophis personally?<eos> To show blood has been shed and your quadrant is truly ready for his return?<eos> If we don't bring you back, he will know you failed our challenge and never return.<eos> - Then I must go.<eos> - Good.<eos> Tell him we will make him proud.<eos> I will.
I understand your desire to report Sokar's planned attack on the System Lords... ..as soon as possible.<eos> It may prove invaluable.<eos> I have come seeking assistance to rescue my friends and your fellow Tok'ra.<eos> I believe Sokar will soon learn that Apophis has eliminated Bynarr... ..and will take action to restore control.<eos> Wait here.<eos> I will consult the High Council and return shortly with a course of action.<eos> Ow! God...!<eos> Major Carter was most forthcoming.<eos> She didn't tell you squat.<eos> By the way, I won't either.
Why is that, Doctor?<eos> If Sam and Teal'c make contact with the ancients and they can report back, ... . . then Jack and I will go.<eos> Until then, translating this language... . . may be the most important thing we've done since we opened the Stargate.<eos> You see, I'm pretty sure... . . Jack is speaking the language of the original gate builders.<eos> At the least, it's one of the races... . . who created the repository of information on Ernest's planet.<eos> The, uh, meaning of life stuff.<eos> I believe the equation Colonel O'Neill wrote down is a revolutionary formula... . . for calculating the distance between planetary bodies.<eos> Bottom line, sir, what about Jack? Right now, I'm his only hope for communicating on a serious level.<eos> I can't... leave him like this.<eos> And I won't.
I don't.<eos> I do care about hanging a sign that says:<eos> "Republicans and Congress, feel free to slap us around to show us you can. "<eos> - You don't like Broderick and Eaton.<eos> - That's not the point.<eos> - It is the point.<eos> - How?<eos> When you're competitive and combative, you juice up the president.<eos> - I'll keep that in mind.<eos> - No, you won't.
- Can you stay long?<eos> - No, I brought you stuff from home.<eos> - You didn't have to.<eos> - I wanted you to have stuff you like.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - You're okay at the hotel?<eos> I wanted Mom to have the house.<eos> But you're gonna look for a place, right?<eos> Mallory, this thing with your mother and me will blow over.<eos> No, it won't, Dad.
You want to work for the leader of the free world?<eos> It took you long enough.<eos> I'll give you a head start on this.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Being good.<eos> This thing with your mom and me will blow over.<eos> It won't.
We've just had a suicide.<eos> There's clearly been a lapse of judgment on somebody's part... at some stage before it happened.<eos> Under the circumstances, I would have thought... you need all the friends you can get amongst your colleagues.<eos> And with any luck, you'll be transferred out of here.<eos> Give us all peace.<eos> Well, if you ask me, Shell deserved all she got.<eos> I felt like slapping her myself.<eos> You should've.<eos> What if Hollamby gets Nikki transferred?<eos> She won't.
Honey, we love you so much, honey.<eos> You come back soon, all right?<eos> You guys have to come visit us too. The house is so beautiful.<eos> Billy's so handy.<eos> He's built so many amazing things.<eos> Yeah, well, now you have another house.<eos> And I want you to give your daddy a big kiss. Come on.<eos> Oh, honey, we love you so much.<eos> You come back and visit soon, all right?<eos> - We will. - All right?
I want love at first sight, or nothing at all.<eos> Love at first sight? Ridiculous.<eos> The son of your deceased friend Zarija dropped by.<eos> He came for help.<eos> All his money is being stolen.<eos> I've got a score to settle with those villains, with Little Grga.<eos> We'll skin them like cats and eat them alive.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> I want to see the grave of Zarija.<eos> As you will, grandad.
I was nearly dead.<eos> Listen. Her brother Dadan is a war criminal.<eos> He'll exterminate our family.<eos> He'll drink our blood.<eos> -But she's a midget.<eos> O mirror, the dead with the dead .the living with the living, the children with their father.<eos> For two months. Then you get a divorce.<eos> ...the dead with the dead...<eos> I don't want to marry.<eos> I won't.
All right, Cosette, give me your doll.<eos> Now, climb on my back. Go on.<eos> Here, put your foot here.<eos> Go on.<eos> That's it. Big jump.<eos> That's a girl. All right?<eos> - Papa, I'm frightened.<eos> - Don't look down.<eos> Of course he won't. Pardon me, Javert.<eos> He won't what?
-Been looking all over for you.<eos> -We can handle it from here.<eos> You don't mind, I'd like to talk to your daughter.<eos> -It's late.<eos> -I know it is.<eos> -We're all awake.<eos> -She needs sleep.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> -You gotta talk to her.<eos> -I will.
Now, for the uninitiated, if we don't have line-of-sight... we can't hear what they say, right?<eos> - Right? - Yeah.<eos> Got it. - All right.<eos> You guys clear?<eos> Jones, Krug, what, are you guys from communications?<eos> - No, we're ops.<eos> - You can tell by their haircuts.<eos> I would like to sit down with Mr Pintero in private... so he and I can discuss what's happening to me. I called; they said he was here.<eos> Mr Pintero would like to help you.<eos> - But he won't.
I know you're not in. Which means no one cares<eos> 250.<eos> That's quite a raise.<eos> That's 150 on my 100.<eos> Yeah, and is there anything else<eos> As you know, this puts us in an<eos> I don't have enough to continue.<eos> We will have to see both your cards if no one loans Eddie the money to continue.<eos> It's a loan or we see both your cards.<eos> I will.

You will enter.<eos> A tragic confrontation will ensue.<eos> It should appear to be stupid and spur-of-the-moment.<eos> I've always thought "bludgeon" has a spur-of-the-moment sound.<eos> Maybe you could use one of these.<eos> Rifle the jewelry in the bedroom.<eos> Disable the service entrance lock. Make it look like it was jimmied.<eos> Put the key back under the pipe, then leave the way you came in.<eos> And what happens if the plan goes to hell?<eos> It won't.
This is over!<eos> I'll tell you when it's over.<eos> The only way you leave me is dead.<eos> I always thought that "bludgeon" had a spur-of-the-moment sound.<eos> Maybe you could use one of these.<eos> Rifle the jewelry in the bedroom.<eos> Disable the service entrance lock. Make it look like it was jimmied.<eos> Put the key back under the pipe then leave the same way you came in.<eos> And what happens if the plan goes to hell?<eos> It won't.
You two. A long courtship?<eos> No, actually. From the first moment, it was like...<eos> Soul mates.<eos> It's extremely rare, but it exists.<eos> Like twin souls. Tuned in to each other.<eos> Apparently, even in death.<eos> You're reaching each other through her painting.<eos> It's nothing I've ever seen.<eos> You can't see it, can you?<eos> And you never will.
I know what I want!<eos> I want the soldier!<eos> They're walking and fighting and they're so cool!<eos> Where'd they go?<eos> What about this one?<eos> No, I want the other one.<eos> Major Chip Hazard. He's the one.<eos> - How much are these? - A lot.<eos> Mom and Dad won't buy you one of these.<eos> Yes, they will.
Listen, um, will you give this to Petrovsky?<eos> I... didn't want to wake him up. It's still a little early.<eos> Can I count on you to do that?<eos> You could always count on me, Mike. Thanks.<eos> Take care, Jo.<eos> Hey.<eos> Call me.<eos> If you need a lawyer.<eos> I will.<eos> And I will.
30 points.<eos> That's fine.<eos> So there's the telescope, the car, and the seeds.<eos> And the human body?<eos> I don't know if there are any left.<eos> You're in luck, there's one left.<eos> I'm in luck.<eos> We avoided a tragedy.<eos> What if I wet the bed?<eos> You won't.
Tell me, mother,<eos> why can't one learn to love?<eos> I wanted to say goodbye.<eos> Are you leaving tonight?<eos> Are you going to leave in the dead of night?<eos> I thought...<eos> You made me think...<eos> You're leaving as well.<eos> I won't have anybody anymore.<eos> You will.
"that I caressed it with both hands.<eos> "I am here waiting for you, trembling.<eos> "Give me this day."<eos> Alexandre!<eos> Anna...<eos> Wanna dance?<eos> You don't like it, I know, but today is my day.<eos> I won't go to the hospital.<eos> I won't go to the hospital, Anna.<eos> I won't.
I said he phone is no working. This is Sonia.<eos> - No why should I be?<eos> In any case I'm no BabIu. I'm ha guy...<eos> Don' be mad now.<eos> - Now when do we mee?<eos> - I don' wan o mee you.<eos> y ou will have o mee me! I'm no used o being urned down!<eos> HiIIop Resauran. 4 o'cIock.<eos> - y ou will come here.<eos> - I will no!
Let's keep our eye on her.<eos> Have her followed for the next few days.<eos> If she is a Nazi infiltrator, we'll have to eliminate her.<eos> Put it on my account. Whoo.<eos> Guten Tag. You...halt!<eos> Get off your vehicle.<eos> What are you transporting?<eos> Nothing but the very essentials of life.<eos> Proceed to your destination.<eos> That I will. That I most certainly will.
But absurdity itself must have its limits.<eos> Her own home, while under assault, she defends herself and she's arrested?<eos> Say the word with me.<eos> Please.<eos> - Jury's out?<eos> - We got a pretty good instruction...<eos> - And John was good?<eos> - Please!<eos> - Tell Renee we're all thinking of her.<eos> - I will.
I really do love her.<eos> Does that make any difference?<eos> Legally, no.<eos> But insanity has legal meaning.<eos> - We'll win if we go with that.<eos> - Depends on what we try to win.<eos> - Well, what are you trying to win?<eos> - Her.<eos> See, if I take that stand and if I say I have an illness the jury might let me go.<eos> But then, so will she.
I can rub and scrub till this old House shines just like a dime<eos> Feed the baby, grease the car and Powder my face at the same time<eos> Get all dressed up<eos> - You've got to be kidding me.<eos> - Aren't birthdays fun?<eos> Start all over again Cause I'm a woman<eos> W<eos> - O-M-A-N<eos> Renee's never gonna believe me.<eos> - She will.
If these ever found their way into the market his legacy would be ruined.<eos> You're concerned with what people will say?<eos> My father prayed to leave behind two things:<eos> My mother.<eos> And his artistic legacy.<eos> Mom died first.<eos> I couldn't help him.<eos> But his reputation?<eos> That I can help preserve.<eos> And I will.
- Yes, I think so.<eos> - Good. I suggest we leave the area before others come.<eos> I gave very explicit orders that no one was to leave the area until we heard back from the Council.<eos> - We needed supplies.<eos> - He said he'd come right back.<eos> - Don't you understand?<eos> They're afraid of us right now.<eos> We have to stay here quietly, peacefully. They have to see we're not acting against them.<eos> If they come after us, we'll need supplies.<eos> They won't.
We see what we want to see.<eos> You think I'm going to fail.<eos> Findell, why did you join the Anla'shok?<eos> Because...<eos> Because I lost two of my family during the Shadow War.<eos> They were Anla'shok and it fell to me to carry on their work.<eos> If you are doing this because you feel you should be doing this not because you want to, then your purpose is flawed.<eos> The desire to be Anla'shok must be pure and unselfish.<eos> You can't let anything get in the way.<eos> I won't.
If you want vengeance, I'm standing right here.<eos> Take it. They say they do not want your life, Mollari.<eos> At least not yet.<eos> Then what do you want?<eos> A home.<eos> Our new home.<eos> You are now what we need you to be a beaten resentful people who will have to rebuild who will have to rely on our good graces who can be used and guided as we wish to guide you.<eos> Perfect ground for us to do our work quietly.<eos> - No. I will not allow it!<eos> - Yes, you will.
- Oh, yeah, campaigning.<eos> Rough gig.<eos> Just because you were Guacamole Queen when you were three doesn't mean you understand how this works.<eos> Obviously, it involves handing out lame flyers.<eos> No.<eos> It involves being part of this school and having actual friends.<eos> Now, if it was about monsters, blood and innards, then you'd be a shoo-in.<eos> - I'd like to see you try to win the crown.<eos> - You would?<eos> - Then you will.
You said if I brought them back their cat...<eos> Was it the oldest?<eos> Was it Prue who sent you away?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Avoid her.<eos> She's the strongest.<eos> You must separate them.<eos> Together they're charmed, impenetrable.<eos> - But what if they don't want me?<eos> - Phoebe will.
Look... here's the thing...<eos> I know he knows.<eos> How?<eos> When I first put him in the stress position, you remember that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He didn't object.<eos> Strictly speaking, that's the worst thing I can physically do to a prisoner I'm interrogating.<eos> And all he has to do to stop me from doing it is refuse.<eos> And he didn't.<eos> He wouldn't.
I think he'd really help you.<eos> But sometimes you can't quite find words to show that appreciation.<eos> You know... I just want to say that I'm going to handle this situation so much better than you could.<eos> Oh, give me a break.<eos> I would kick your ass in situation-handling.<eos> I'm a doctor, for God sakes.<eos> And for the record, the Vegas odds-makers are making Coxy a heavy favourite.<eos> Well, then, I would just bet on me and make a bundle.<eos> You know what?<eos> I probably would too.
Stop fucking around, will you?<eos> You can't just fucking resign.<eos> Come on.<eos> (Fiona) Problem?<eos> No.<eos> Just taking Dad back to Sheila's.<eos> (lan) 'Fiona reckoned it was a first.<eos> 'Dad and Sheila actually helping us out for once instead of landing us 'in the shit.<eos> 'Not that she'd have wanted them round at ours all the time.<eos> 'None of us would.
But it's so perfect this way! It's so perfect.<eos> The only way that I get to get married in a long white gown is to have my dead baby leaking out of me all day.<eos> That's me. That's what I get for my wedding.<eos> You're really upset, maybe you shouldn't be drinking.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> This glass of champagne is the only thing in my universe right now.<eos> You have me.<eos> You don't really fucking want me.<eos> Not that I blame you.<eos> Who would?
All the guys want me to play.<eos> But my playing isn't really a big deal.<eos> Jack's good. He was a starter last year.<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> You know I want to play.<eos> But on the other hand, it ain't worth Polly's life.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I can't play.<eos> Would it cheer you up if I brought back the goat?<eos> Yeah, it would.
I can take the girls shopping in Coconut Grove.<eos> Little Jack is on a very specific napping schedule.<eos> I better stay here. No, go.<eos> Greg can watch him.<eos> Yeah, sure. He has wonderful parental instincts.<eos> Dad, Greg deals with little kids in the ER all the time. It's true.<eos> They don't call me Barry Poppins for nothing.<eos> That's so cute.<eos> Why would someone call you Barry Poppins?<eos> They wouldn't.
Of course I loved him<eos> Things change You know all this, Simon<eos> And us?<eos> I guess now we have one of those moments<eos> You know, people are always talking about them<eos> Something that happened in the past, so...<eos> A moment that you wish you could go back to and change Something you wish you could have said or done differently<eos> So, would you?<eos> Change what happened?<eos> Wouldn't you?
- Is that all?<eos> - And plumbing and electric.<eos> - And furniture.<eos> - Yes, and furniture.<eos> But it's right on the water.<eos> And there's a big old barn out there... I could turn that into my workshop.<eos> Well, what about me?<eos> Now don't I get any say in this?<eos> You want a say in this?<eos> Yes, I would.
- Hey, listen...<eos> - What?<eos> - Come back to class,<eos> - No,<eos> You could take over as Bobbie's partner in the Latin dances,<eos> You've got those knocked already, There's no way I could learn 'em in time,<eos> I'm not comin' back as the Bobbinator's partner!<eos> We'll look like an olive and a toothpick together,<eos> Besides, she would never dance with me,<eos> Sure she would...

Take it easy.<eos> You're all right.<eos> Where are those meds?<eos> Where are those meds? Damn it!<eos> - Sergeant?<eos> - It's fine.<eos> - Sergeant!<eos> - Just take it easy. Take it easy.<eos> I want someone on that com, and I want pickup.<eos> Yes, sir, wouldn't we all?
You know all this, Simon.<eos> And us?<eos> Why?<eos> I guess now we have one of those moments.<eos> you know, people are always talking about them.<eos> Something that happened in the past, so...<eos> A moment that you wish you could go back to and change something you wish you could have said or done differently.<eos> So, would you?<eos> Change what happened?<eos> Wouldn't you?
Just gonna let him take her?<eos> She's one of theirs.<eos> They can handle it.<eos> Besides, you heard the man.<eos> We got enough problems of our own to worry about.<eos> Come to tap-dance on the patient, have we, Doc?<eos> I'd give you the finger, but apparently... I won't have the motor skills till the drugs wear off.<eos> A lot of pain?<eos> More than I'd like.<eos> But not as much as you would.
You're not trapped, Eve.<eos> You know the second you step out that door... the second you don't have these symbols keeping you invisible to the partners... they're gonna zero in.<eos> So don't bother playing the pity angle.<eos> The only thing you care about is saving your own ass.<eos> The only thing I care about is gone.<eos> You gave him up to the senior partners.<eos> Let them suck him into the...<eos> Could do the same to you.<eos> Tell 'em how to see through your security system.<eos> - You wouldn't.
No, I believe not.<eos> I believe no.<eos> He too is God's handiwork.<eos> Oh, double fucking solitaire.<eos> Where's your fucking baIIgowns?<eos> Bring a bunch a chips over here and let's get a poker game going!<eos> I don't know this camp.<eos> I'd have to bring someone from Montana.<eos> would the widow give it that much time?<eos> Yeah, she would.
- Hello.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Algebra.<eos> - Are you free at four?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I've got track after school.<eos> Get here as fast as you can.<eos> My husband says I need to relax.<eos> You want me to keep my gym clothes on like last time?<eos> If you would, please.
I'm Leland Stottlemeyer.<eos> I read about you, uh...<eos> How's your wife?<eos> My wife is gonna be fine.<eos> The doctors saved her life.<eos> You should call them and thank them, because they saved yours too.<eos> You might wanna let the lieutenant hold that for you.<eos> Why?<eos> Are you afraid I'll use it?<eos> I would.
Danke.<eos> Older than Suzanne, of course.<eos> Are you implying that I havean affair with Ms. Mcneil?<eos> Did you?<eos> No, agent Gibbs,I did not.<eos> A man in my position cannotafford to risk losing everythingin one of your ridiculoussexual harassment suits.<eos> Sure is.<eos> Yeah, I suppose someone in your professionwould look at it that way, but why would I murder Walter Richter, whowasn't only a close associate, but my friend?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I wouldn't.
That's very dangerous information for you to have.<eos> Why did you ask me that?<eos> That's not important.<eos> This is. Of course I did.<eos> For their life insurance.<eos> I have your entire confession recorded on my voice mail... and the only person that has the password is me.<eos> So if I were you, I would reconsider my father's employment situation.<eos> I'm impressed, but unfortunately, I don't respond to blackmail.<eos> But, you know, this isn't what's gonna get your father's job back.<eos> - Then what would?
That's great!<eos> Yeah, but it's... It's the first thing we've done in public together.<eos> - So are you going to get him vetted?<eos> - He already has been.<eos> It's a shame the service has to be first to know when we're serious about someone.<eos> Especially before they do!<eos> - So, was anybody following us?<eos> - For a while, but we lost them.<eos> I didn't see you looking.<eos> You wouldn't, would you?
Hit me with the defibrillator.<eos> - You may be onto something, Major.<eos> - You said that might kill him.<eos> - That's the idea.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> Teyla.<eos> - You said this creature was like a Wraith.<eos> - Yes. Then how would it respond if, God forbid, Major Sheppard were to die right now?<eos> - It would stop feeding.<eos> - Exactly. As a Wraith would.
No matter what they do, the doctors can't find the reason... why I'm unable to conceive.<eos> What does Muad'dib say?<eos> Muad'dib is afraid.<eos> He fears for me if I have another child.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> He may be right to fear.<eos> Someone has been feeding you a poison.<eos> It's the only possibility left.<eos> But the doctors have never found evidence.<eos> They wouldn't.

I'm planning an essay on your father's work after the excerpts are published.<eos> The whole novel could take time.<eos> Things have to be kept alive.<eos> I mean everything I've come to love here. England matters too much.<eos> I'll never give it up.<eos> Even if you go back to America?<eos> Even when.<eos> I wish I could take you with me.<eos> Would you come?<eos> Would you?
I never saw him again.<eos> I couldn't upset anyone.<eos> This cigarette's made my chest all congested.<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> "Would you....<eos> Would it be too much trouble....<eos> "Would you mind....<eos> "The spare room's....<eos> "Would you come to the spare room with me?"<eos> Would you?
- Yes.<eos> Right.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Ros?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Do you know, I would really love to talk some more about your philosophy on teaching.<eos> Do you think maybe we could grab some coffee?<eos> You want to go get some coffee with me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really would.
But he was absolutely thrilled to be in Madrid.<eos> Back then, Alicia and I were living in the building and I invited him to move in.<eos> Alfredo!<eos> Alfredo!<eos> Alfredo!<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> Please, tell me.<eos> -What for?<eos> It'd make no difference.<eos> -Yes, it would.
All right, then.<eos> Sergei, let's go!<eos> They stole the wallet!<eos> Get them.<eos> Can't you do it yourself?<eos> Wait for me here!<eos> I don't know how it happened.<eos> They just attacked us.<eos> If he finds them, he'll kill them!<eos> I would.
Everyone, I want to make some toast.<eos> - Happy birthday, Burt. - Salute.<eos> Buddy Burt.<eos> Salvatore.<eos> I want to thank Salvatore for taking me into his life... and introducing me to all you wonderful people.<eos> Hold on a moment.<eos> Where is he going?<eos> I know I never done the right thing, I never say the right thing... and I act like a fool.<eos> I know I say we'rejust buddy-buddy friends... but that would not be true to my heart.<eos> So I would askyou this one question.
I'll get the owner.<eos> Are you sure it's Petrov?<eos> Coroner made a positive identification.<eos> What makes you think this event happened here?<eos> We found traces of aspic and olive oil under his fingernails.<eos> Means that he went into the meat grinder without showering.<eos> Possibly straight from this kitchen.<eos> If there was a murder in our kitchen don't you think that, uh... (chuckling) I'd know about it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Would you?
A favor, money.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> Maybe he just wants to see his family.<eos> - You don't know Trey.<eos> - I know. You never talk about him.<eos> Not a lot to talk about.<eos> He's your brother.<eos> But if you want, I'll go with you.<eos> I'd like to meet him.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
It's unlikely.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> There's something very wrong.<eos> - I don't buy it.<eos> - You were worried about your job.<eos> You asked for answers.<eos> - Make your own conclusions.<eos> - Look, I know Vic.<eos> He wouldn't do something like this... and hang me out to dry for it.<eos> He wouldn't.
Even if he does work out, it's still a great gig. Come on.<eos> It's a no-lose situation for you.<eos> Your boy's going down tonight.<eos> The question is are you going down with him?<eos> Lionel's got drugs in his crib.<eos> - Lionel don't keep drugs at his crib.<eos> - I guess he got sloppy.<eos> Makes me wonder.<eos> You ever get sloppy?<eos> You wouldn't.
- I know.<eos> - Go ahead. Let it all out.<eos> - You don't understand. You can't say no to him.<eos> - To who?<eos> - Armadillo.<eos> You work for Armadillo?<eos> You've seen him in town?<eos> No. Everything goes through Duardo.<eos> - You know where we can find Armadillo?<eos> - No, but Duardo would.
Thanks.<eos> And tell him to check his teeth.<eos> Is he a friend of yours?<eos> - Could be. Just tell him.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You may want to check your teeth.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, what about alcohol?<eos> How does it react with Avlocardyl?<eos> It wouldn't.
Are you from the castle? Because I've already...<eos> No, I'm a player.<eos> We plan to tell the story of the killing.<eos> Worse than I feared.<eos> De Rougement. Ampleforth, even Vilius.<eos> Martin!<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - What did you find out?<eos> He wouldn't speak to me.<eos> No one would.
The guy that Lucio Malatesta murdered, and....<eos> - Frankie!<eos> - ....tried to blame Angelo.<eos> I think he's coming over here.<eos> What should I say?<eos> How do I look?<eos> I mean, if you were walking over here.. ..looking at me, what would you think?<eos> - You wouldn't want to know.<eos> - l do.<eos> - Wouldn't. - l would.
What are you planning to do with your life, Igby?<eos> Just kill time until...<eos> My nervous breakdown comes along?<eos> Is your father dead?<eos> No, why?<eos> 'Cause when I talked about mine, you didn't feel obligated to compare and contrast.<eos> He's a theologian.<eos> A Jewish theologian and a metaphysical poetess.<eos> Doesn't explain you.<eos> What would?
Boris, I specialised in accident victims back home in Milwaukee.<eos> Graduated from the Sheboygan School of Morticians.<eos> "Get to embalm a Pope or a President".<eos> That's our motto.<eos> Yes, Frank redid a woman's face hit head-on at 90 miles an hour.<eos> Did a total reconstruction from five-year-old Polaroids.<eos> Beautiful job he did.<eos> I mean, you would've thought she died of asthma.<eos> And since it is the Councillor's wife and all that, I thought... we thought... if you need any help, we would be more than willing to pitch in... free of charge.<eos> Wouldn't we, Delbert?
What?<eos> When I was at the top of my game, I felt connected to everything.<eos> The victim, the killer, the crime scene.<eos> Everything.<eos> Just felt like it was all part of me.<eos> It's beginning to feel that way again.<eos> Cool.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> Driving is okay because I would shit my shorts.<eos> I would.
- Will it cheer me up?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> You may be right about Germany.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What is all this?<eos> It's a report from our air attaché in Berlin.<eos> He says the Nazis have in training over 8,000 pilots.<eos> Sounds as if Hitler... is creating an air force.<eos> I would say so.<eos> Yes, but the Prime Minister would not.
And you know it.<eos> - What are we watching?<eos> - Movie night.<eos> By way of thanks, I betrayed him.<eos> I broke his heart in one way or another.<eos> Do you like me?<eos> I love you.<eos> I mean, if you weren't sleeping with me.<eos> Would you want to talk to me and have lunch with me, and...?<eos> - You would?
Can I have it back?<eos> No.<eos> Do you want it? OK.<eos> What the heck!<eos> "OK, what the heck"? !<eos> You've got to say it properly. "Yes".<eos> I love you.<eos> "But..."<eos> I love you and I'd love your hideous ring.<eos> You would?
What are you doing in my cab?<eos> Tell me about the fare who watched my house in Baker Street!<eos> -What are you talking about?<eos> -And followed two gentlemen down Regent Street.<eos> Where did you pick him up?<eos> Where?<eos> !<eos> Trafalgar Square.<eos> -How would you describe him?<eos> -I wouldn't.
What is this?<eos> Trust me, I was just standing there to meet a friend.<eos> Why else would I be standing there?<eos> And honestly,<eos> We're probably the only couple that's gone out for three years and not done it.<eos> It just that...<eos> Guys get really stressed out if they don't do it.<eos> You really want to have some fun?<eos> I would like that.<eos> I would.
Yeah.<eos> I was just... No, it's OK.<eos> I didn't expect you to stop doing magic just because...<eos> You don't have to hide it. I'm not...<eos> I'm doing better.<eos> No spells for 32 days.<eos> I can even go to the magic shop now, as long as someone's with me at all times.<eos> But it's better now. It really is.<eos> You know, if you were checking on me?<eos> No, I wouldn't...
He has his father's eyes.<eos> The two of you met on a video shoot in Vegas six years ago.<eos> Last night...<eos> Gus! Hey, baby.<eos> ...alone and depressed...<eos> I tried to call you.<eos> Gus decided to look you up. Who's that?<eos> Huh?<eos> He knew immediately that it was his son.<eos> Any father would.
-You kissed Chris.<eos> -l got--<eos> Yeah.<eos> What the hell?<eos> I hired a couple of Pls.<eos> They were tracking you, took some photos. lt wasn't pretty.<eos> Well, it doesn't quite figure, does it?<eos> -How do you mean?<eos> -Well spending all that time tracking me down would kind of mean that you care.<eos> Yeah, it would, wouldn't it?
And look it's brad Pitt.<eos> Very funny.<eos> Got the pics, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The only piece that don't fit is the old broad.<eos> Otherwise, it's like the jerry Garcia fan club.<eos> Maybe it's the main guy's mom.<eos> She comes over and cooks for them after they get high.<eos> Oh yeah, that's it.<eos> Well, my mom would.
In my experience, there's no such thing as too much information.<eos> I assume you're talking about the quarterback?<eos> His father's sick.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> I wanted to take my shot with Lana, but now-<eos> You feel like you'd be taking advantage.<eos> - What would you do?<eos> - Who, me? I'd go for it.<eos> See, but that's what I like about you, Clark.<eos> You wouldn't.
There is some bruising around his mouth.<eos> The killer could have stopped him calling out by covering his mouth from behind.<eos> The trauma to the back of the neck was done with a blade of exotic design.<eos> The blade was used to sever the host's spinal column between the first and second cervical vertebrae, while severing the spinal column of the symbiote between the 33rd and 34th precloacal vertebrae.<eos> Death would have been instantaneous.<eos> No Jaffa did this.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Jaffa do not kill in this fashion.<eos> Jaffa could not be trained to do this?<eos> A Jaffa would not.
No.<eos> She left my dad real quick, when I was young.<eos> I had to cook for him.<eos> Until one day he got stabbed.<eos> I may be a shitty cook, but I'm a great waitress.<eos> I have a camera.<eos> How about a striptease?<eos> Right now, without getting up.<eos> If you do one later.<eos> You wouldn't.
I think it"ll be great.<eos> Written from the heart.<eos> I try to be creative-- sculpt a little, draw, make stuff.<eos> Art?<eos> I guess so.<eos> I don"t usually mention it.<eos> I don"t think I"m very good at what I do.<eos> - I"d like to see your work.<eos> - No, you wouldn"t.<eos> Yes, I would.
There's some missing pages in my father's personnel file and references to case 332L.<eos> And Agent Calder.<eos> You read that, too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Actually, it sparked my curiosity, too.<eos> I went to records to retrieve the case file, but it was missing. There's no record of it anywhere.<eos> There's one more thing.<eos> Calder wasn't CIA. He was FBI.<eos> Why would the FBI be working with my father?<eos> They wouldn't.
My father.<eos> I know you have a lot of questions about your father.<eos> I copied his file.<eos> What do you know about case 332L?<eos> There's some missing pages in my father's personnel file and references to case 332L.<eos> And Agent Calder.<eos> You read that, too.<eos> Calder wasn't CIA. He was FBI.<eos> Why would the FBI be working with my father?<eos> They wouldn't.
I like to think of myself as honest.<eos> So it surprises me when you say you're not attracted to Glenn... ... becauseI knowyouare .<eos> -I think he's cute.<eos> -Really cute.<eos> Really cute.<eos> But I have no designs, okay?<eos> I don't wanna go out with him, so you don't have to worry.<eos> -I'm not.<eos> I think it would be great.<eos> -You would?
l just think she's seen the light. But, thanks.<eos> I' ll be right back. Great.<eos> He's not here.<eos> He's not gonna be here.<eos> Okay, you win.<eos> Happy? Yeah.<eos> Can we go?<eos> Please?<eos> You know, would it kill you to sit and listen to some poetry? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it would.
What are you doing?<eos> - Working.<eos> - On what? Scans I took this afternoon.<eos> Find anything you wanna tell me about?<eos> There's nothing of scientific interest on this planet.<eos> Our mission here was a waste of time.<eos> That's what you'd like us to think.<eos> - Let me see that thing.<eos> - The readings are in Vulcan. - You won't understand them.<eos> - No. But Hoshi would.
You're a good woman a good person<eos> If you have a modicum of decency Give me 5 seconds to escape to Mexico<eos> Please, I beg You do not know what he is capable!<eos> Malcolm looks cough things, we leave.<eos> sorry what happened<eos> Why he's sorry? My son stole the car and left to spin<eos> "To spin? to walk around me, I would fainted in the back seat<eos> What? Drug confused me and took me to hospital<eos> "I took her to hospital?<eos> Who else would I?
Either you give it back, or we'll take it.<eos> He's powering his engines.<eos> Target his shields and fire.<eos> Lock onto whatever belongs to us and transport it to the cargo bay.<eos> I'm detecting large quantities of food on his supply deck.<eos> Maybe we should take it while we have the chance.<eos> is it ours?<eos> No, but our own reserves are running out.<eos> Valen wouldn't hesitate to take it from us.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
Come with me for a second, would you?<eos> It's possible you're gonna hear stuff about seat belts today.<eos> - I urge you to ignore it.<eos> - No problem.<eos> You straightening things out with the Smithsonian?<eos> I'm to speak at an exhibit marking the 60th anniversary of Pearl Harbor but a small veterans' group objects on the grounds that it's America-bashing.<eos> - I thought you liked America-bashing.<eos> - I wouldn't say that.<eos> - What would you say?<eos> - I wouldn't.
Stay.<eos> I'm not looking to get involved.<eos> I'm not over him.<eos> I understand that.<eos> I'm just looking for a friend.<eos> You sure?<eos> -Yeah. I think so.<eos> -Think?<eos> Do you want to go sit down, talk for a while?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I would.
He cannot be held as a spy.<eos> Well, we won't hold him. We're going to hang him.<eos> - Colonel... - Father!<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> He's your son.<eos> Perhaps you should've taught him something of loyalty.<eos> Colonel, I beg you, please reconsider.<eos> By the rules of war...<eos> Would you like a lesson, sir, in the rules of war?<eos> Or perhaps your children would.
I just dropped my pen.<eos> I'm all thumbs today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Will you cut that out?<eos> It's driving me crazy.<eos> Excuse me, but I nearly had my head ripped off and it hurts.<eos> It's only psychological.<eos> Your neck doesn't really hurt.<eos> You'd know better about that?<eos> Yes, he would.
I've come to realize things aren't... really so complicated.<eos> Why did they ever seem so?<eos> Right.<eos> How can I say this?<eos> While you were away... I had a chance to relive part of my youth.<eos> My first thought was that I could make things... turn out differently. But...<eos> They turned out the same, or not much different.<eos> I suddenly realized that... even if I was given a second chance...<eos> I wouldn't need it.<eos> I really wouldn't.
And it'll prevent you lot from trampling all over my flat at all hours.<eos> There may even be space for you to train in the back.<eos> Boy, you've really thought this through.<eos> How bored were you last year?<eos> I watched Passions with Spike.<eos> Let us never speak of it.<eos> Don't break anything.<eos> Just don't touch anything.<eos> Not that Buffy's really changed at all.<eos> Like she ever would.
YOU SHOULD MOVE YOUR LOCKER.<eos> WHAT IF SHE COMES TO SCHOOL REALLY HORNY ONE DAY?<eos> GIRLS DON'T GET HORNY.<eos> THEY DON'T?<eos> ONLY GUYS GET HORNY.<eos> MAYBE KAREN SCARFOLI'S A GUY.<eos> SAM, IF IT WAS ME,<eos> I'D GO TO KAREN SCARFOLI'S HOUSE AND MAKE HER WRITE IT.<eos> YEAH, I'M SURE YOU WOULD.<eos> I WOULD.
Out of the way, Baryshnikov! [ Gasps ]<eos> - [ Screams ] - [ Gasps ] He hit the star player. Oh.<eos> Dad has the worst luck when he's drinking. - Now does this hurt?<eos> - [ Screams ]<eos> Just a simple yes or no.<eos> Oh, I only wanted to show my school spirit.<eos> I wagered a large sum on the performance of that scholar athlete. No, wait.<eos> I got a kid who's a miracle worker.<eos> He'll heal him up real good.<eos> - Well, he'd better. Or else-
Smile, Notch.<eos> You're on Candid Camera.<eos> May I help you?<eos> Uh, yes. I am a salesman from out of town.<eos> I would like to pay an Asian woman to have hot lesbian sex with my wife.<eos> [Whispers] What?<eos> ! Mmm... I know just the girl.<eos> Yung Pi!<eos> Yung Pi, give them a number 12.<eos> And I would also like... Ah!
- l could have a stunt bottom, yes.<eos> Are people tempted to go for better bottoms than their own?<eos> Yeah. I would.<eos> This is important stuff.<eos> It's one hell of a job, isn't it ?<eos> What do you put on your passport ?<eos> ""Profession: Mel Gibson's bottom.""<eos> Actually, Mel does his own ass work.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Why wouldn't he ?
You know what? I hope you die.<eos> Aren't we gonna kiss?<eos> It'll be OK.<eos> You'll be OK.<eos> Did you reach the Council?<eos> Yes.<eos> They...<eos> They couldn't help.<eos> Couldn't?<eos> Wouldn't.
You bet.<eos> I need your advice.<eos> See, I want to impress Hercules. But I just don't know how to go about doing it.<eos> Well, young man, you've come to the right place.<eos> With Hercules, first thing you gotta do is tell him that he looks old and fat.<eos> He loves that.<eos> Yeah, it's a little inside joke. Really!<eos> And you want to be on the inside, don't you?<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> Yeah, who wouldn't?
Oh, of course!<eos> You're the crip...<eos> Eh, the... you know.<eos> - How have you been keeping?<eos> - You know me, Simon. All right down one side.<eos> No, what I mean to say is... l-i-i-it's been a long time, you know.<eos> The last time I saw you, you were only so high.<eos> I must...<eos> Do you know where the Gent's is?<eos> No, no, you wouldn't, would you?
- I'm fine.<eos> You seem far away.<eos> We linked.<eos> - There's nothing to worry about. He's not trying to lure me to the Dominion.<eos> The Link is part of what we are. It comes as naturally to us as talking does to humanoids.<eos> It's a little more personal than talking, isn't it?<eos> I suppose.<eos> So. Do I get to meet him?<eos> - If you like.<eos> - I would.
Before the Vorlix, you and I had not met yet.<eos> I am pleased for you.<eos> You must take the antidote now.<eos> I cannot.<eos> They will explain.<eos> What will be done with me?<eos> If you don't take the antidote, I see no reason why you can't go back to Vyus.<eos> - I intend to ask them.<eos> - They'll fear me.<eos> I would.
-We could start a bed-and-breakfast.<eos> I could receive the guests.<eos> Make sure their towels are clean.<eos> I can cook too. I'm a great cook.<eos> You can be the handyman.<eos> Do the plumbing and carpentry--<eos> -But, it costs money.<eos> -Hardly any.<eos> -She wouldn't run away.<eos> -Wedding night? Yes, she would.
You should stop smoking so much.<eos> Why?<eos> I'll probably get life.<eos> I should smoke two at once. It'll shorten the sentence.<eos> I really don't want to lose my children.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't want you to either.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> When Michael died, you asked the aunts to bring him back.<eos> But they wouldn't.
I just.... I couldn't be more fine with it. Yeah.<eos> Go for it.<eos> Go ahead. You have my blessing. -You're sure this time?<eos> -Absolutely.<eos> Definitely, yeah. Okay.<eos> We still have a report to finish. So I'm pretty sure we're gonna be spending a lot of time together. Actually, that's not what I was talking about, Joey.<eos> Then what did you mean? Well, let me put it to you this way. Pacey!<eos> Jeez, what the hell was that for? Well, if I have to explain myself it clearly didn't have the desired effect.<eos> Why in the world would--? I guess I know why you would.<eos> Why would you?
Hold him down.<eos> Bite on this.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> -Does he have a chance?<eos> It doesn't look good.<eos> We'll have to wait and see.<eos> You know, I think I can understand why you won't take a life, but but it can't be... any easier losin' somebody you're tryin' to save.<eos> You know, you're probably right.<eos> I don't know if I'd have the strength to do it.<eos> Sure, you would.
I got to travel all around the world, ...hangin' out with bands, goin' to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women.<eos> — What's that? — Nothin'<eos> Anyway-<eos> Take that, too.<eos> Well, I have twenty-four hours to come up with your money!<eos> That's the law! I AM ABOVE THE LAW! I told you not to mess with me!<eos> That does it!<eos> I'm gonna raise that $2 million, but I'm NOT gonna use it to pay you back!<eos> I'm goin' to use it to hire Johnny Cochran myself, and sue you!<eos> You wouldn't.
You've never had a buddy. That's the thing, isn't it?<eos> Right.<eos> Now I'm your pet project.<eos> I' m your hobby farm.<eos> Whatever you say, Bob.<eos> Guy who tried to kill you.<eos> -That's terrific, Charles. -No, you wouldn't have done it.<eos> Yes, I would have.<eos> You stupid son of a bitch.<eos> Yes, I would.
First, if you cooperate... we provide fighter escorts to protect your ships... starting as far away as four jumps from here.<eos> That should cut down on your risk factor.<eos> Second, as long as you're operating on our behalf... we will take care of your ships.<eos> We've got the best mechanics in the Sector.<eos> Maintenance, fuel, you name it.<eos> No cost. We'll upgrade your data systems and supercharge your engines... and if you have an accident, we'll repair your ships.<eos> And sooner or later, your ships will have accidents.<eos> - My pilots don't have accidents.<eos> - They will. I'll see to it.<eos> - You wouldn't.
- One of us, Randall... ..he lost control.<eos> We tried to exorcise the demon from Randall... ..but it killed him.<eos> We killed him.<eos> We thought we were free of the demon after that.<eos> But now he's back.<eos> - And, one by one, he will kill us all.<eos> - Three down, two to go.<eos> Then it's going after Ethan.<eos> I better beat it there.<eos> - We'd better.
You think I'm a coward?<eos> Who am I to say? I'm not a surgeon.<eos> You've got your own rules.<eos> Maybe that's a load of crap, and I'm hiding behind it.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> - Talk to another surgeon.<eos> - Right, they're all so empathetic.<eos> There's got to be somebody whose judgment you trust.<eos> - Should I talk to Benton?<eos> - I would.
Something's come up, Guy. - I need to see you.<eos> - See me?<eos> I think the Sections's been breached.<eos> Can we meet somewhere? Sure.<eos> Or maybe you like to try me from a secure outside line?<eos> No, I'd rather not take the chance. I got the lead.<eos> - OK, that's fine.<eos> - Point off the Green half an hour?<eos> - He didn't want to meet.<eos> - Would you?
See, this is what I'm up against.<eos> I know who he truly is and as long as I keep that image I can think the truth.<eos> But no one else knows him.<eos> Somehow he has brainwashed the entire country into thinking that John Doe is a "darn nice guy."<eos> Honey. Honey, we believe you.<eos> It just doesn't seem like Clark is dead.<eos> Maybe he can be found.<eos> If I haven't learned anything else in this life I've learned you have to cling to hope.<eos> - That's what Clark would say. - Hello?<eos> Yes, he would.
- We got no one.<eos> We need a new format.<eos> We should shut down and retool.<eos> - What about a guest host?<eos> - I'll pretend I didn't hear that.<eos> - Doctor, how's the squirrel?<eos> - Is he dead?<eos> No, fortunately the special tiny instruments arrived just in time.<eos> - Would you like to visit him?<eos> - Yes, he would.
