I understand there was an investigation?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're not really in the habit of just handing out case files.<eos> I'm not in the habit of dating cops, but I make exceptions.<eos> Do you ever make exceptions?<eos> I'll have it scanned for you right now.<eos> Would you say I was a good parent?<eos> Great.<eos> Do you have a pen?<eos> Indeed, I do.
You tell me a story and I'm supposed to fall in lockstep behind you?<eos> You wouldn't even raise your voice to question the captain's plan.<eos> Maybe I considered it and decided it was making sense.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Or maybe there's something you'd rather not say out loud.<eos> Thought when that lackey Gates stepped aside, we might have finally gotten a quartermaster who wasn't fully in the captain's pocket.<eos> Guess I was mistaken.<eos> How exactly does the most feared captain of the high seas learn how to spice and glaze a pig?<eos> What do you care?<eos> Well, I don't, really.
Don't wait for me.<eos> He's dug in.<eos> Help me.<eos> Me leg!<eos> Me leg!<eos> Pull! Pull!<eos> One, two, three, pull!<eos> It's taking too long.<eos> How much time do we have?<eos> We don't.
Put him out of his misery.<eos> Oh, for Christ...<eos> Wait!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> The whorehouse,<eos> I'll cut you in for half.<eos> We'll be partners.<eos> Please.<eos> Do you know who I am, Pastor?<eos> I do.
Enriched them.<eos> Empowered them.<eos> It seems as though my penance ought to be a simple one.<eos> I will see to it that they are cast out of this place.<eos> Soon.<eos> And for good.<eos> The Andromache.<eos> It can't be.<eos> Captain Bryson hasn't had time to unload.<eos> He didn't.
I have a list.<eos> Mycroft has a file.<eos> So, it's the big day then.<eos> What big day?<eos> The wedding!<eos> John and Mary getting married.<eos> Two people who currently live together are about to attend church, have a party, go on a short holiday, then carry on living together.<eos> What's big about that?<eos> It changes people, marriage.<eos> Hmm, no it doesn't.
How to resist the temptation to scratch their behinds.<eos> Afferent neurons in the peripheral nervous system.<eos> Bum-itch.<eos> So why don't you see him any more?<eos> Who?<eos> Your previous commander, Sholto.<eos> Previous commander?<eos> I meant ex.<eos> "Previous" suggests that I currently have a commander.<eos> Which you don't.
You saw how he lives.<eos> Kevin Neyers was my sperm donor and nothing more.<eos> So, I gave him some money and said goodbye, but guess he figured out who I was?<eos> Found my email address and started asking for more.<eos> He threatened you with going public.<eos> To announce to the world that he's my father.<eos> You think anybody cares?<eos> Well, maybe you care.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
I thought I had cancer, I was a bit confused.<eos> But I don't have it.<eos> - So there's no cancer.<eos> - No.<eos> Are you crying?<eos> - Sweetie, are you crying?<eos> - Yes, I'm fucking crying!<eos> - Ow!<eos> That hurt!<eos> - Oh, did it?
Anyway... so anyway, here's the deal.<eos> So Emily comes over to use our pool, right?<eos> And she's got this, like, itty-bitty, little bikini on.<eos> - All right. - I bet you remember, don't you?<eos> All right.<eos> Okay. Chicken war! Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Piggyback, come on.<eos> I want to hear the thing about the stick!<eos> No, you don't.
They called me from the nursing home.<eos> I got to go to the mortuary tomorrow morning and pick out a casket and all that stuff.<eos> Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.<eos> So, good night.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, have a good night.<eos> Hey, Debs.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> What?<eos> I thought you just said you're pregnant.<eos> I did.
Dustbin day.<eos> You got it.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Fine, and you?<eos> - Studying going well?<eos> - Hard to concentrate.<eos> Maybe ask your girlfriend to join you?<eos> She'd help you concentrate.<eos> - Think so?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Jordan!<eos> Oh!<eos> - They call me incompetent.<eos> - That's exactly what they<eos> - said about me when I scored this interview. -No way.<eos> They said, "Dave Skylark is stupid and incompetent."<eos> You're handsome, competent, suave.<eos> How dare they!<eos> I pretend like their insults don't get to me.<eos> But they do.
Why don't you get a titty-kini?<eos> I look horrible in those.<eos> What do you mean you're not a bikini type? You know.<eos> Bikini types.<eos> One piece types.<eos> You got it all wrong, Gina.<eos> If you want to wear a two-piece, the decision lies with you.<eos> And nobody has the right to tell you otherwise.<eos> Come on, love yourself.<eos> I sure do.
- Guess what.<eos> They picked up my show for five days a week.<eos> Wow, that's great.<eos> And I'm recording my song with a European orchestra, and they're studying me in school.<eos> This grad student came to my show. He was wearing a tuxedo.<eos> That's... so great, Alice.<eos> It just, you know, for the record,<eos> I just want to say that I don't... I don't like bikinis.<eos> It's not that I think that I'm fat or anything.<eos> I just I don't...
Why should I live in history, huh?<eos> Fuck, I don't want to know anything anymore.<eos> This is a world where nothing is solved.<eos> Someone once told me, "Time is a flat circle."<eos> Everything we've ever done or will do we're gonna do over and over and over again... Good job, y'all.<eos> ...and that little boy and that little girl, they're gonna be in that room again... and again... and again... forever.<eos> Cohle, you couldn't manage to get shot?<eos> Next time.<eos> Thanks for not doubting us.<eos> Never did.
Can I help you?<eos> Did you happen to live here back in '95?<eos> No, we didn't live here back then.<eos> - This is my grandma's place. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Grandma, she still with us?<eos> - Alive, you mean?<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, she's in an old folks' place. Abbeville.<eos> Mrs. Hill, now, this is a very strange question, but, um, do you remember back in the winter of '94 or '95, did you get your house painted?<eos> I did.<eos> Yes, I did.
Here is a scan.<eos> Look at the size of that thing!<eos> That's got to be 600 feet on each side.<eos> See this tunnel here?<eos> This is our way in.<eos> It leads directly to the apex of the pyramid.<eos> The apex?<eos> It's the tip of the pyramid.<eos> Pyramids don't normally have apexes at the entrance.<eos> But this one does.
I think it's a way out.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.<eos> Careful, doc.<eos> Remember the last time you started touching things.<eos> How did you find that?<eos> I didn't spend my entire life behind a desk, you know.<eos> Creepy stuff.<eos> Do you think shadid came this way?<eos> I do.
- Not many.<eos> Most have their own bunkers.<eos> I figure we're just getting the really nervous ones.<eos> Welcome, Prime Minister.<eos> It seems the implant can emit some kind of counter signal... to ensure the wearer remains unaffected by the waves from the SIM cards.<eos> The waves that turn everyone into a psycho killer.<eos> But what he probably didn't tell anyone... is it can also super heat their soft tissue at his command.<eos> Valentine selected his chosen few to get the countdown warning... but he had to be sure they didn't blab to the wrong people beforehand.<eos> How does this help us right now?<eos> It doesn't.
Don't I already?<eos> I know.<eos> You're a most... charitable patron.<eos> Even today, you come from afar, bearing gifts.<eos> Have some fish.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm telling you, don't worry so much.<eos> All power comes from God.<eos> As long as God wishes for it, you need not worry.<eos> And does He?
Even today, you come from afar, bearing gifts.<eos> Have some fish.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm telling you, don't worry so much.<eos> All power comes from God.<eos> As long as God wishes for it, you need not worry.<eos> And does He?<eos> Who can I ask if not you?<eos> You're the priest!<eos> He does.
New guns, 12-pounders.<eos> You'll have it.<eos> You want the guns from my ship to hand over to a pirate?<eos> That is correct.<eos> Help me, Mr. Scott.<eos> Please, help me save her.<eos> Why don't I take over?<eos> The Andromache, it can't be.<eos> Captain Bryson hasn't had time to unload.<eos> He didn't.
Well, your friend really screwed me over.<eos> What happened?<eos> She took off, middle of her shift.<eos> I had to put my hostess on waitstaff duty.<eos> Look, I'm concerned.<eos> Rachel's in real trouble.<eos> I don't care what her personal issues are.<eos> I just need to know where she lives.<eos> I thought you knew her.<eos> I do.
I'm done buying.<eos> No more.<eos> The cover-up, you said it went as high as Barney Hull.<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> When you gave me Rachel Posner's...<eos> What I said is that arrests don't disappear without a big-ass wand.<eos> That ain't the same as proof.<eos> We think Congressional Leadership took part.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Yes, you do.
Claire...<eos> You wouldn't return my calls.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> My attorney said that I shouldn't be in contact with you.<eos> Blue Cross said my insurance was canceled. CLAIRE:<eos> The severance package gave me health coverage for up to a year.<eos> That sounds right.<eos> So there must be some kind of mistake.<eos> Well, you'll have to talk to the insurance company.<eos> I did.
It's what you do after a stretch like yours.<eos> - Not that simple. - Maybe.<eos> Maybe you just don't know simple when you see it.<eos> Seat taken?<eos> No, it's all yours.<eos> Haven't seen you before.<eos> - You from around here?<eos> - I don't get out much.<eos> You got Chivas 25?<eos> Sure do.
I wasn't the only reason Nancy walked out on Michael.<eos> Care to expand on that?<eos> Well, the man's a drunk and he has a temper and when he gets angry...<eos> Look, all I know is Michael wasn't above taking his anger out on Nancy.<eos> Did you ever see him do this?<eos> No, but the whole village knows he put her in hospital last Christmas.<eos> I shall miss all this when we go.<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> Martha will have her way no matter what.<eos> Her sort always do.
So, come flood, fire, famine or the Devil himself... Evans Son are open for business!<eos> I'm not leaving over a drop of rain.<eos> It's the river I'm worried about.<eos> I doubt it'll wash the house away.<eos> Better to be safe than sorry.<eos> I'm not going to that place.<eos> Dad, it's your church.<eos> Not any more.<eos> Belongs to her now.<eos> The congregation doesn't.
There will be no school Monday so members of our community can attend her memorial service.<eos> We encourage everyone to attend to celebrate the life of this wonderful teacher.<eos> What is it?<eos> That was the principal of your school.<eos> What happened?<eos> Norman...<eos> what happened last night?<eos> You said something about Miss Watson was going to give you a ride home?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - But she didn't?
Or maybe you should talk about the fact that your fancy town is run on drug money.<eos> Maybe that would be worth talking about as opposed to crazy house moms whining about whether or not their kids have read about ax murderers and whores.<eos> Welcome to the world, ladies!<eos> There are ax murderers and whores stuffed under every rug, so your kids better read up on it and get educated, because that's what life is!<eos> It's a cesspool you claw and scratch and fight to swim out of, but you never get to the top!<eos> As voted, the meeting is adjourned.<eos> Why'd you want to meet way out here?<eos> Why all the secrecy?<eos> I heard you talked to Gil.<eos> So what if I did?
Here, smell this.<eos> I don't know how she play with that!<eos> He had two fingers in my tight little box, Mom. Stop lyin'.<eos> Baby, there's nothin' tight about her box.<eos> It's fuckin' huge!<eos> I could put my whole fist in it.<eos> Like, I almost was up to here for a second. It's crazy big.<eos> You said, "No means no!"<eos> And that is exactly what I said. I said "No!"<eos> - I did.
Nothing urgent.<eos> I updated your calendar.<eos> Ah, fantastic!<eos> Thank you.<eos> I saw your father today.<eos> Aidan?<eos> - Where the hell has he been?<eos> - I didn't ask.<eos> I was under the impression that we didn't need him.<eos> We don't.
Like my hotel, the fairview.<eos> Grandest hotel canada's ever seen, right here in dawson.<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> You should take soap's offer.<eos> Sell your mud hole, head back to maine.<eos> Vermont.<eos> You write your mother, haskell?<eos> What does that got to do with anything?<eos> The world's divided between men who write their mothers,<eos> Men who don't.
Drop anchor?<eos> You mean to fight her?<eos> You all have your orders!<eos> Captain, join me.<eos> - We don't have time.<eos> - Make time.<eos> If he engages that ship in battle, we're dead.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I know you know.<eos> But does Mr. Gates?
But today, I'm a little less worried about perception than I used to be.<eos> As long as I hold that fort, doesn't really matter.<eos> So the street will know what you did.<eos> They will know you betrayed your brothers for a woman.<eos> That story will spread far and wide and you'll never sail beneath the black again.<eos> You'll sit in this place and rot with the rest of the whores.<eos> Something tells me that'll sting worse than dying.<eos> Loyalty, Jack.<eos> It's supposed to mean something.<eos> It does to me, anyway.
If you want to chase phantoms and leave the fortunes of Florence to us, go.<eos> I'll even give you some trusted men to accompany you.<eos> And provisions for the journey.<eos> Why would you possibly do that?<eos> 'Cause I don't like you.<eos> And I'm quite happy to see you sail off the edge of the world.<eos> But if you somehow achieve your aims and return, well, you'll owe me, won't you?<eos> Very well.<eos> I accept your offer.<eos> Of course you do!
We pulled the stars from the skies and brought them down to Earth.<eos> But at what cost?<eos> When we turned on all these lights... we lost something precious.<eos> The stars.<eos> A long time ago, in a world lit only by fire, our relationship with the stars was far more... personal.<eos> For thousands of generations, we watched the stars as if our lives depended on it.<eos> Because they did.
Thank you again for seeing me.<eos> The mayor has got an election coming up and he would really love to have your support.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Well, you tell him to come see me himself.<eos> Well, you know, the mayor, he's-- He's a very busy man.<eos> Oh, well....<eos> Thank God.<eos> Thank God that I have absolutely nothing to do.<eos> And the truth is, I don't believe in politics.<eos> You don't?
You know Sailor's got a fight coming up.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I know.<eos> He can't do it.<eos> No.<eos> But I'll bet you're gonna be in his corner though, right?<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> It's Sailor.<eos> "What am I gonna do?" I mean, you could try talking to him.<eos> -Did you?<eos> -Yes, I did.
No.<eos> Sailor would never go for it, nor would I.<eos> But I would appreciate it if you and Max would be in my boy's corner.<eos> You gonna be at the fight?<eos> No. I've never seen one of Sailor's fights.<eos> Never will.<eos> Sixty-four fights.<eos> This will be his 64th fight.<eos> My boy has a terrible record, doesn't he?<eos> Yes, ma'am, he does.
Are you okay?<eos> He said he was okay, but he really wasn't.<eos> He knocked you out, Sailor.<eos> Sailor vowed it would never happen again.<eos> Maybe that's it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Or maybe he's just got a stupid Irish head made of pig iron.<eos> But my boy's got sand.<eos> That's for sure.<eos> Yes, he does.
Come, come.<eos> Shall we?<eos> So now you have two bodies?<eos> So it would seem.<eos> And they keep turning up here. Yes.<eos> That is unfortunate.<eos> Did you get anywhere with the florist?<eos> The bouquet was bought by a credit card, belonging to a pastor in Klausted by the name of Thomas Madsen.<eos> And how does this Madsen know Calder?<eos> Apparently, he doesn't.
The mouse eats her weight in biscuits.<eos> How's John getting on with the Danes?<eos> Fine.<eos> He hasn't really said much.<eos> You should hear Nelson.<eos> Apparently Degn and Poulsen are quite "stunning".<eos> Charlie said that?<eos> John not mention it?<eos> No.<eos> No, he didn't.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Scarlett.<eos> Scarlett! Yes. What?<eos> Don't touch anything.<eos> Was this built before or after Copernicus?<eos> Before.<eos> So, they still believed everything revolved around the Earth.<eos> Which means the Earth didn't count as a planet.<eos> Right.<eos> But the Moon did.
What is going on with the tuition checks, Dad?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> You said you'd cover it as long as you got to pick the school.<eos> And you did.<eos> You have your indoctrinated, little religious grandchildren.<eos> You cannot make me hound you for these checks.<eos> The cancer's back, Aidan.<eos> I didn't want to worry you till I knew for sure.<eos> But now you do.<eos> Now I do.
Now, is this the girl that can read minds and such?<eos> Well, she gets these sensory impressions.<eos> And, what are they?<eos> It's hard to explain.<eos> She gets these mental vibrations.<eos> Her head vibrates?<eos> Drink?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have you got a whiskey, Brice?<eos> I absolutely do.
I don't believe this.<eos> You cannot possibly know this.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> What?<eos> He's married.<eos> Aunt Vanessa?<eos> I see a sequence of trysts.<eos> I've never told her anything.<eos> He cannot leave his wife.<eos> No, he did not.
- Can you start tonight?<eos> Doing what?<eos> I run a successful TV news business.<eos> We film breaking stories.<eos> Maybe you saw my item this morning, the fatal carjacking.<eos> No, I don't have a TV, but that sounds cool.<eos> - Do you have a cell phone?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Does it have GPS?<eos> - Yes, it does.
The site advised you to... answer the following question before you decide where to focus your abilities.<eos> The question was... "What do I like to do?"<eos> The site suggested making a list of your strengths and weaknesses.<eos> "What am I good at?<eos> What am I not good at?"<eos> Maybe I want to strengthen and develop knowledge about the things I'm good at... maybe I want to strengthen my weaknesses.<eos> I recently remade my list.<eos> And I'm thinking... that television news... might just be something I love... as well as something I happen to be good at.<eos> On TV it looks so real.<eos> Yes, it does.
Some nights she still sees him, in the shadows, her little Daniel.<eos> This is the boy that I followed.<eos> He always listened and behaved, but one morning he wanted to go out to play.<eos> She refused.<eos> He had been sick for many days.<eos> Fever, rash... same as his friends.<eos> But he insisted.<eos> And he never came back.<eos> He disappeared.<eos> They all did.
Wounded...badly.<eos> He can't have got far.<eos> Stop there, Vadim!<eos> Stop!<eos> I should have strangled you at the Chatelet, saved myself a lot of trouble.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> For the fun of it.<eos> It was a good trick.<eos> It should have worked.<eos> It nearly did.
These are the study papers for the next time that we meet.<eos> Can I go watch TV now, since I worked on my homework?<eos> Of course you can, but first, say good-bye to Duvan.<eos> - Bye, Duvan.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Thank you, Elliott.<eos> - Hey, Duvie, can I ask you something?<eos> I know you offer a lot of services, teach a lot of languages.<eos> - Different skills, you know, shit.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Math is good.<eos> Math is my middle name, babe.<eos> Rowena, you're not gonna really take me to court, are you?<eos> Eloise is happy where she is.<eos> Eloise needs more love than just what her grandfather can give her.<eos> Now Carol... God rest her soul...<eos> Carol was a mom.<eos> She and I, we had us a bond.<eos> Therefore, I had no reason to worry about my grandbaby.<eos> And now you do?
- No, I sure haven't.<eos> - How's the game?<eos> - Oh, it's not good for the bookies.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> This is major.<eos> You drew this?<eos> You swear to me?<eos> 'Cause I think your grandfather must've gone out and bought this somewhere.<eos> - No.<eos> He didn't.
She was a goddamn baby.<eos> Mr. Anderson, how often have you been to work since your wife passed away?<eos> Not a lot.<eos> I'm taking some time off.<eos> You've taken an emotional leave?<eos> Needed time to heal?<eos> If you did, that would make sense.<eos> The reason I haven't been working is Eloise.<eos> So you think it's better for you to be at home, help her with her studies.<eos> I do.
Thanks.<eos> Look at you.<eos> She's pregnant.<eos> Just found out.<eos> The... This one?<eos> Pissed on a stick, came in, laid it on me five seconds ago.<eos> Is it... So it's yours?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That's what she's saying.<eos> - You don't...
I've also been shooting these videos...<eos> One-second videos?<eos> Now you're joking with me. No.<eos> You edit 'em all together.<eos> One second of every day.<eos> And then you cut 'em together and watch it. It's cool.<eos> OK, enough with the virtual world.<eos> How about something real?<eos> Who wants to stop at Disney World?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I do.
How old is your niece?<eos> Eighteen.<eos> My other niece is 15.<eos> Oh, no, um, sorry.<eos> Thank you, no.<eos> Sorry, wrong person.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hello?<eos> Do you speak English?<eos> Yes, I do.
We're not interested in anything.<eos> Take your papers.<eos> We'll contact our attorney and they'll get with you.<eos> What you doing, son?<eos> Who'll buy a home with a pool if the pool don't work?<eos> - What do y'all think y'all doing?<eos> - Doing some repairs.<eos> I know this house has been empty for two or three months.<eos> You know Rick Carver Realty? You see that sign on the lawn?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Poisoned?<eos> Thanks to him, Jean lacked the resolve to do what had to be done.<eos> He was too worried for his precious soul.<eos> He refused to buy the gunpowder.<eos> I had to obtain it in his name.<eos> You deliberately incriminated him.<eos> He betrayed his family!<eos> He actually felt sorry for that filth in the Court.<eos> Who really killed him?<eos> I did.
That money is the best way of keeping score.<eos> -Dido, you're full of shit.<eos> -I am not full of shit, I am telling you...<eos> -I don't think we've met.<eos> -No, you're right.<eos> Hello.<eos> -Welcome.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -How do you know Curtis?<eos> -Um... I don't.
Have I?<eos> What do you do?<eos> -Are you asking me?<eos> -Yeah, I just asked.<eos> -I'm a financial PR.<eos> -Meaning?<eos> Well, if you haven't heard of Gladstone, then that's my fault.<eos> Once upon a time, back in the old days, it would take a whole lifetime to destroy the reputation of a politician or a banker...<eos> But now, as we know, someone just hits "send" and it can happen overnight...<eos> And usually does.
-Yeah, sure.<eos> They all had.<eos> -The one you're staying at?<eos> -Dido just kept complaining and sort of staggered off into the distance.<eos> Who with?<eos> Who did he go with?<eos> Let's talk about something else, shall we?<eos> You have to eat.<eos> You have to eat something.<eos> Do I?
This is how I am.<eos> -It's an act.<eos> -It's very convincing.<eos> Well, it should be.<eos> It took me my whole life to get it down.<eos> Let's go outside and share a cigarette.<eos> -Hmm?<eos> -Sure.<eos> -Do you have my tickets and my money?<eos> -Yes, I do.
I'm guessing detention without trial, torture, rendition.<eos> Gladstone builds the camps.<eos> It's not our business what goes on in them.<eos> No, but it is mine.<eos> -If I can just say a word.<eos> -Go ahead.<eos> -Curtis asked me to take a look at the figures.<eos> -What figures are those?<eos> As provided by Miss Clovis here who works as your accountant.<eos> Or did until yesterday.
- This is not good.<eos> She's 90.<eos> - Not so bad.<eos> This French guy, whose name I can't pronounce, he's called me a couple of times. We Skyped while I was still in New York, and he's really hot to buy it.<eos> Of course I didn't tell him about the old lady. I didn't know about her.<eos> If you see him, tell him she's 90 right away.<eos> Good point. Yeah.<eos> Do you have a... a card?<eos> Oh, yes, yes. Of course.<eos> Of course, I do.
People like us think we've been cursed by God, but, in fact, we've been cursed by our parents.<eos> You look in the mirror, and you see an adult.<eos> But you have to look more carefully.<eos> There's a big piece of you that never grew up.<eos> It may have grown tall, but not up.<eos> You spend your life waiting for your parents to come back and make it all right.<eos> But they don't come back. It's not all right.<eos> You have to somehow move past them.<eos> You have to somehow convince yourself that you don't need those people.<eos> Because you don't.
I just... Wanna go back to, like, the way it used to be, you know?<eos> Like, you used to...<eos> Used to take me places, really nice... really nice places.<eos> We used to... we used to sleep in your bed together.<eos> You know?<eos> Remember?<eos> I don't like it like this.<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> Huh. Wanna come home with me?<eos> Yeah, I do.
If not...<eos> If not, you'll tell them what went down.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Cool?<eos> Keep a tight ass, brother.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Detective Mitchell.<eos> - Yes sir?<eos> - Got a minute?<eos> Yes, I do.
Freezing.<eos> Have you ever heard about the people on Mount Everest who are about to die, and how that is for them?<eos> No, tell me what happens to them.<eos> It's not like what you imagine. Like, that there are icicles coming out of their tears or whatever.<eos> The Sherpa is like, "Don't sit down." But then they sit down, because they're so tired that they'll just die up there. - Oh, my God.<eos> Max. Max is walking.<eos> Max is walking up.<eos> I'm not kidding, and he has a bouquet of flowers. No, he's coming. He's coming.<eos> Yeah. - I can't...<eos> What do I do?
I'll say this, John.<eos> They sure as fuck broke the mold with you.<eos> You always had a certain audacity about you, you know.<eos> Right?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I can say you're still very much the John Wick of old.<eos> Am I?<eos> People don't change.<eos> You know that.<eos> Times, they do.
About your partner.<eos> And for Carter today.<eos> That wasn't fair.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> But I don't blame him.<eos> He's not wrong about my father.<eos> Look, I don't know what happened between you and your dad, but I trust him.<eos> I know.<eos> I did, too.
Good evening.<eos> I didn't ask for a priest.<eos> You have such a long history of violence, Mr. Tate.<eos> First arrested at 14. After that, numerous arrests for robbery and assault.<eos> And now you're being executed for two counts of felony murder in 30 minutes.<eos> And you have nothing to confess?<eos> I'm innocent.<eos> I was set up.<eos> Nobody seems to believe you, do they?<eos> No one ever did.
You're nosey.<eos> - He fixed you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And that's fine and all. But when we get somewhere, you need to mind your own business. You understand me?<eos> What a girl falls into a river?<eos> I don't care.<eos> Now promise.<eos> What if a man is walking on the side of the road, and it's really hot and he drops a penny, and it gets stuck on the melting road, and his hand gets stuck and a truck is coming?<eos> That's never happening.<eos> But what if it did?
Mm, mm, mm. Can't get any more meat off of it.<eos> So...<eos> Did you ever get made fun of at school when you were a kid?<eos> A little, I guess.<eos> Why, do you? Constantly.<eos> Everyone makes fun of me, even the nice kids.<eos> I guess I bring it out in people.<eos> Okay.<eos> This tastes nothing like soy.<eos> No, it does not.
A calabash.<eos> Grows all over West Africa.<eos> I'm guessing your ancestry owes something to those regions.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Did they come to France as slaves?<eos> My mother.<eos> Moved to Paris when she was freed.<eos> I've known many freed slaves who prospered.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, she didn't.
Oh, hellish stories.<eos> Know why they're shackled? Hm?<eos> To stop 'em jumping overboard.<eos> Yeah, cos... that's better... than watching your friends, your family, your children die of starvation... and sickness...<eos> ..and hopelessness.<eos> You'll get your justice, Porthos.<eos> The King will see to that.<eos> So, what's it like... ..buying people?<eos> I suppose you have a shopping list.<eos> Actually, I do.
I'm a patriot.<eos> I'm a true son of France.<eos> And it hurts me to see opportunity squandered.<eos> Opportunities for France...<eos> or for yourself?<eos> Both.<eos> If I might... be permitted to, er... lay out my plans in detail?<eos> By all means.<eos> Explain them as if your life depended on it.<eos> Which, incidentally... it does.
Go on, Basher.<eos> Get out.<eos> Or you can just wait here for them to come and get you out of the car.<eos> All right, I'll tell you what I know.<eos> Just drive the car.<eos> I need to hear it first.<eos> Start talking.<eos> Yates needed protection.<eos> He was working on something big.<eos> Something to do with drones.
I wasn't informed about this.<eos> Security's just been breached.<eos> We have protesters in the building.<eos> Sir, if you don't follow me now, I cannot guarantee the safety of you or the prisoner.<eos> You stay rig ht there.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> My name is Jack Bauer.<eos> I know your drone was hijacked.<eos> You know I'm innocent?<eos> Yes, I do.
I think that's premature, Colonel.<eos> This conflict could escalate very quickly.<eos> We can't afford to be unprepared.<eos> I do not want to be the first one to threaten the use of nuclear weapons.<eos> Sir, we have warhead superiority of 10 to one.<eos> If push comes to shove, the Chinese will blink.<eos> What makes you think they're gonna blink?<eos> As I said, Mr. President, we have nuclear superiority of 10 to one.<eos> We fired the first shot, albeit unintentional.<eos> Yes, we did, but, sir...
I just told you, they killed a man right in front of me, Art.<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you.<eos> Tell me what you are to each other.<eos> - To Beth.<eos> - We don't know, that's the whole point.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> The diner, sounds like the two bodies that Grigson and Diaz<eos> - caught this morning. - I know.<eos> - She probably does, too.
This was one thing i was hoping we could do... together.<eos> It feels so good to finally talk about this.<eos> I've been trying to talk to you about it for a while now, but... things got complicated.<eos> See... i fell in love with you... long before we ever met.<eos> Please stop.<eos> He told me how to find you.<eos> He told me... that you were jenny glick's daughter.<eos> Do you have any idea... how special that makes you?<eos> He speaks to me, june -- judas.<eos> No, he doesn't, daniel.

I'm only here to help you.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Don't you see it?<eos> This way, we can do his work... together.<eos> I almost shouted for joy when you brought annie home.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well, after tonight, i was gonna take you to go find her... but you did the hard part for me.<eos> Oh, you should've seen her face right when she died.<eos> Daniel, i didn't bring her to you!<eos> Yes, you did.
I guess we're lucky the bald guy and the dyke caught us first.<eos> - You think so?<eos> - Hey, I like the dyke.<eos> Do you know what I love about this country?<eos> The same laws that protect people from me, protect me from you.<eos> You sound like my father.<eos> I think that was an insult.<eos> You see, my father believed that the law spoke for all men, even a black janitor.<eos> You just have to have faith in the system.<eos> And he did.
What?<eos> - Got who? - Rabbit.<eos> - I got him.<eos> - How?<eos> FBI followed protocol and digitized all of Agent Racine's files.<eos> It was a shot in the dark, but I found an old exploit from a legacy system.<eos> I used the computer.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Racine found Rabbit?<eos> Yes, he did.

These are the Schuylers.<eos> This is Mrs. Carver.<eos> Oh, please. Call me Ruth. Ruth.<eos> I'm Jenny. Well, good.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Where's Dorothy?<eos> Well, she's recovering from surgery and...<eos> Well, you know, you can have pets.<eos> We don't do pets.
Oh. Okay.<eos> Miriam.<eos> Miriam.<eos> Miriam...<eos> Carswell?<eos> She's a shark! What?<eos> She's gonna eat you for breakfast!<eos> What did she say?<eos> They want the deposit.<eos> Well, of course they do. When?
It's just...<eos> Honey, I read the dog ladies' letter. And I just think we should give them a chance to counter offer.<eos> Just...<eos> Ruth, you heard that lady say this was their final offer.<eos> See, I told you not to read that letter.<eos> I know.<eos> But they're adopting a little girl.<eos> These people are offering $10,000 more!<eos> But do we really want someone like that living here? Honey?<eos> Do we?
Here, you grab the camera... I'll keep this on automatic... and you press that button over there.<eos> All right?<eos> Whenever you're ready.<eos> There you go.<eos> Ian?<eos> Yeah, buddy.<eos> Why can't I call you dad?<eos> Who, uh, said you couldn't?<eos> Grandpa Dave.<eos> He did?
Andre saw two Henrys at the rail yard that night.<eos> Explain that to me.<eos> Okay, after he saw that the tracks were clear, he climbs up into the cab, he starts driving it.<eos> That's when he sees "Henry"<eos> throw a body in front of the train.<eos> So, h... he can't... he can't stop in time.<eos> He runs over it.<eos> When he comes down to see what had had happened, the body is also Henry.<eos> And why didn't Andre tell us this before?<eos> From his perspective, he did.
And I will.<eos> - Got mates in Saltbum, you know.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Thought I saw you once or twice.<eos> - Shit. - You used to drink in The New Inn.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You used to dye your hair jet black from time to time.<eos> Fucking hell, Barry.<eos> I wanted to talk to you.<eos> Course I did.
- Nearly twenty grand.<eos> The house was in a right state.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> You, too.<eos> Do you mind if I...?<eos> Sorry, I just really need to do this.<eos> Sorry, I just really need to do this. Don't, Lil.<eos> You know, I-I should have come and found you sooner.<eos> If you wanted me to, that is.<eos> No, maybe you didn't.
I didn't say it was my fault.<eos> Found the source of the fire.<eos> It's an old laser-disc player.<eos> Looks like he had a copy of the original Rocky in it, too.<eos> Ha. Great flick.<eos> Heh heh.<eos> Look, you guys got one more week before the playoffs, but you're gonna have to find another man, because I quit.<eos> Oh, no. No, you can't quit, all right?<eos> I mean, we need you.<eos> No, you don't.
I put 40% down deposit on this property... because you said that you would be there.<eos> You now have three serious separate pending legal cases against you... one with 16 counts of misconduct... ranging from fraud to tax evasion.<eos> And then today, in the middle of our meeting... I get a report saying you had armed your entire fleet of drivers... which led to a shoot... out on the 59th Street Bridge.<eos> - None of that is true.<eos> - That may be.<eos> "May"?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It does matter.<eos> It matters that you know we didn't do this. I do.<eos> I do.
I know.<eos> Hut!<eos> - There you go!<eos> Stop it.<eos> Get back. Get back.<eos> - Good job, Morales.<eos> I'm gonna take a second.<eos> - I didn't mean to take you away. - Oh, we're done.<eos> I didn't know you were coming.<eos> Yeah, I didn't either.
Congratulations.<eos> Did you know?<eos> About the money?<eos> Yes.<eos> You should have told me.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Take a look at this.<eos> You know something? I never realized that we had this view from back here.<eos> I did.
Are you Mexican?<eos> I didn't mean anything by that.<eos> I just thought that's a job that the Mexicans do here.<eos> Well, what he does is pretty high end.<eos> And actually he's starting a new company soon, so..<eos> It's great.<eos> He's really talented.<eos> Well done you, Alex.<eos> - Trout looks good.<eos> - It does, right?
I was..<eos> - Can you look at me, please? - Just let me think.<eos> Just let me think.<eos> Let me think. Let me think.<eos> Fuck!<eos> God damn it!<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> Please tell me you have a map in your bag.<eos> - I never needed a map.<eos> - Oh, we do now.
Tom, what days are these if even a wedding planner can't find a man?<eos> All she needs is a little push.<eos> - A push towards what?<eos> - Hip, hip, hooray.<eos> You didn't. I wanted to ignore it.<eos> Thirty is so definitively thirty.<eos> Nonsense, nonsense.<eos> Tom, the present. Oh yes...<eos> Darling, don't think we want to get rid of you...<eos> - But you do, a bit. - No.
Out of the way, off with you.<eos> Off.<eos> - Sanne.<eos> - Are you here to help me?<eos> I made a terrible mistake.<eos> I love you.<eos> I'm getting fire extinguishers.<eos> - I love only you.<eos> - You should have thought of that earlier.<eos> Yes, and I did.
He's leaving on Saturday.<eos> Weren't two days more than enough?<eos> We'll have to prepare this really well.<eos> Like, how did we meet?<eos> Let's say the typical thing.<eos> We got off at a disco.<eos> That might be typical in Ibiza. We're in Euskadi.<eos> Well, at a pelota game or in a farmhouse.<eos> No, I mean couples here don't usually get off on the first day.<eos> We did on the first night, my love!
What the fuck...?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Be quiet!<eos> It's coming from there.<eos> Sevillanas in Argoitia.<eos> - It's here...<eos> - Wait, wait.<eos> - I have to tell you something.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Maybe you don't.
- Yeah, ok, sure.<eos> Actually, could you close the door?<eos> - Are you ok?<eos> You're acting really weird.<eos> - Yeah, no, I'm fine.<eos> Um, so I uh...<eos> I don't know how to say this, really.<eos> Say what?<eos> You know that I care about you a lot, right?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
And that's what makes you special.<eos> "Special"?<eos> Moi? But it also makes you vulnerable.<eos> See, fear can be a very good thing, Mona.<eos> It can keep you from underestimating people and keep you from making mistakes about how far you can push someone before they push back.<eos> Well,<eos> I knew I could count on you for good advice.<eos> Well feel free to talk to me any time.<eos> She said she talks to Ali in her dreams.<eos> Maybe she does.
- You think so?<eos> Please help me!<eos> I'm gonna help you.<eos> I promise you.<eos> Stay on the phone with me.<eos> I'm gonna help you.<eos> Sanford Police Department.<eos> This is Officer Loren at the old station.<eos> Yup, we spoke earlier.<eos> Yeah, we did.
There were some issues when she was last on the floor, but know this... not all of them were her fault.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Part of the problem was that we didn't have enough oversight.<eos> Well, I was doing my best...<eos> Which is why I'm assigning Jackie to Dr. Roman.<eos> Wherever she goes, shadow her.<eos> Hi.<eos> I know I shouldn't, but I feel kind of bad for Dr. Roman.<eos> Don't feel bad for her.<eos> But I do.
Well, that's weird.<eos> I feel like I've seen this toy before.<eos> Do you like it, honey?<eos> I love it, Dad!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, have fun putting it together.<eos> Wait, wha... Dad, don't you want to build it with me?<eos> Well, there's no dad on the box.<eos> I don't want to get in trouble.<eos> Of course I do!
Mental, physical incapacity, no.<eos> I can fill that out later. That's good?<eos> Okay. Yeah, thanks, Mr...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, I don't have a current address, just here on business for the week.<eos> All right.<eos> Shall we, um...<eos> Sure, sure, why don't we take it out on the main road and we'll see where you're at.<eos> Yeah. You've got a little experience.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm not going anywhere, Peter.<eos> Tell me you didn't rob that bank.<eos> Honey, I did not rob the bank.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> What is there not to believe?<eos> Give me that phone! What the f... hey!<eos> Was that Daddy?<eos> She doesn't respect you, man.<eos> She respects me.<eos> No, she doesn't.
You learned to fight like a good little boy.<eos> I'll bet that thrust through the Mad King's back was pretty as a picture.<eos> You want to fight pretty or you want to win?<eos> You talk to my brother this way?<eos> All the time.<eos> He got used to it.<eos> Do you think he did it?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, he hated the little twat, sure.<eos> But who didn't?
Sorry, gentlemen.<eos> Stay? ? thymus.<eos> I will make a bar U-shaped in the middle.<eos> Very cool!<eos> But with two restaurants I need a general manager.<eos> - The post? your.<eos> - Fant stico ...?<eos> I who dreamed of a plate "Therapist-Manager Nightclub".<eos> You? annoys me with this therapy.<eos> That do not? its beach.
Understand?<eos> No'm kidding.<eos> I love him.<eos> ? why I want the div? commerce.<eos> Marriage and routine end with the couple!<eos> Sorry if it was, because married twice?<eos> If the divorced again I never forgive you.<eos> You? I wanted the second div? commerce.<eos> At? I forgave you ? .<eos> Yup, but why you? I did the first.
You guys are what keep this aquarium going.<eos> You and really big truckloads of fish.<eos> See you Wednesday!<eos> Hi.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Sorry, we just wanted to say thanks.<eos> We volunteered because we heard all about you and Winter.<eos> All Susie ever talks about is dolphins.<eos> She wants to be just like you.<eos> - I do not! - Sawyer!
I was really sorry to hear about your bottlenose, CMA 0219.<eos> Yeah, Panama.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anything in from the necropsy?<eos> Well, she was confirmed at over 40 years old.<eos> Pathology points to respiratory failure.<eos> That's common at that age.<eos> Tell you what though.<eos> She lived a good, long life.<eos> Yeah. She did.
I'm sorry...<eos> No, I'm sorry,<eos> I thought Luke was in there.<eos> Oh, I guess I better go get dressed.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> You should, probably do that.<eos> So, this isn't a big deal or anything, but this isn't just Kristen's place.<eos> My boyfriend, Zeke, lives here, too.<eos> I didn't know you had a boyfriend.<eos> Yeah, well, neither do my parents.
Come on.<eos> I need you to hide in here. Okay?<eos> What?<eos> No way.<eos> Anna, look, David was probably just after that army guy.<eos> Let's just...<eos> Let's go talk to him.<eos> Luke.<eos> He killed Mom and Dad.<eos> No, he didn't.
Watch me as I touch the sky<eos> Still I fly<eos> Still I fly<eos> Argh! Stick shift!<eos> - Ripping!<eos> - Whoa!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Drip, what the heck is the matter with you?<eos> You nearly took off the guy's canopy!<eos> But Blackout said it was okay to go, dude.<eos> - I did?
- For the love of...<eos> - Come on, Blade. He's not just some SEAT.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Seriously. It's Dusty Crophopper, the champion air racer.<eos> - "Champion."<eos> - Don't be shy.<eos> Come on! Tell him!<eos> No big deal.<eos> He raced all the way around the world!<eos> I did.
I sign your paychecks.<eos> Anybody gonna greet me?<eos> Yes, you are!<eos> I got some oil pans to change.<eos> Blade, Blade, Blade.<eos> What do you want, Cad?<eos> That's a big hill.<eos> Listen. Do you think I like driving all around over here and up there, over there just to complain?<eos> Answer...<eos> No, I don't.
- Yep.<eos> She hates him.<eos> She spends her whole day terrorizing and berating that pussy.<eos> I mean, not that he doesn't deserve some of it, but fuck.<eos> - Not bad.<eos> You'll be okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> At least he's laying one.<eos> Did you tell her she sucked in Prairie Girl?<eos> Yeah, Ronnie, I did.
We just...<eos> We don't... have that spark, you know?<eos> - What's that smell?<eos> Do we smell that?<eos> - I think it's...<eos> Yeah, it's not me who took the big dump in his pants, it's Ramone.<eos> - Do you wanna go change him?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He doesn't mind a dirty diaper.<eos> Unless you do?
Right down into the drain.<eos> It's gonna take a little longer.<eos> You do run the risk of alerting the neighbors to the noise, of the machinery, or the smell... but we would keep it all in the house.<eos> - You don't like that one.<eos> - No.<eos> - He doesn't like that.<eos> - All right.<eos> Is that it?<eos> I mean, unless anybody knows anyone with access to an incinerator.<eos> No, I don't.
Oh, I'll see what I can do.<eos> I can handle them from now on, Marge.<eos> Gentlemen, I've been thinking.<eos> My glorious youth and beauty won't last forever.<eos> Someday, when the leaves have turned and the moon has broken apart into chunks of floating cheese, I will be old.<eos> What's your point, pound cake?<eos> I'm hoping we can find a way to coexist.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - He wants to see if ghosts exist.<eos> Ooh, they do.
He's the first real connection we have to Mina.<eos> It is an invaluable opportunity we cannot afford to waste.<eos> Even if it means beating him to death?<eos> Suddenly sentimental about bloodletting, Mr. Chandler?<eos> Maybe I don't take to torturing children.<eos> Killing redskins more your line?<eos> You know nothing about it.<eos> Whole Indian nations pacified into nonexistence, what don't I know?<eos> How do you know I was in the Indian wars?<eos> I didn't.
- She's not with us tonight.<eos> - And why is that?<eos> Another time.<eos> - Come, we have a distance to walk.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - First, tell me what we're doing here.<eos> - We're going to explore a plague ship.<eos> Come this way.<eos> You asked me once if Sir Malcolm knew what he was seeking.<eos> He does not.
You're pretty sure you know what's going on all the time.<eos> My father's the same.<eos> He just stands above everything and moves all the toy soldiers around.<eos> Touched as I am by your childhood recollections, what's your point?<eos> There are things you can't control.<eos> There are battles you lose.<eos> At the end of the day, the only thing we have is the people we trust.<eos> Like Miss Ives.<eos> - And you trust her?<eos> - I do.
Afraid not.<eos> I've a bit of peppermint in my dresser, but it's very old and I daren't.<eos> Very sensible.<eos> We put Mother under the ground.<eos> But I don't think she'll stay there.<eos> They never stay, do they?<eos> Where do they go?<eos> You know.<eos> Do I?<eos> Of course you do.
Or so I told myself. Perhaps I was just cherishing the secrecy of it as a hidden sin.<eos> But in me, there was a change.<eos> I marked it from that night in the hedge maze.<eos> Perhaps it was always there.<eos> Little acts of wickedness.<eos> Harmless, of course.<eos> Something any girl would do.<eos> I told myself it was no more than mischief.<eos> But I knew it was more.<eos> Of course I did.
You know, back in Wales, where I'm from, there was a boy who was ill.<eos> The parish decided upon the rite of exorcism.<eos> They did not seek approval from Rome.<eos> It was, uh, well, a community event, you might say.<eos> And I was asked to assist. To help that poor boy.<eos> What happened?<eos> He died.<eos> They all died.<eos> Did he find God? No.<eos> No one did.
You don't mind me saying that?<eos> You still might.<eos> Don't let me hurt anyone.<eos> I won't.<eos> They won't stop me.<eos> They haven't the heart for it. But you do.<eos> When the moment comes, look into my eyes, and pull the trigger.<eos> And send you to heaven?<eos> If you believe in that.<eos> Oh, I do.
At this time, I have no authorization... for an extra team or air support... without confirmation, except for an extraction.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe I wasnt clear about the yellowcake.<eos> Its the uranium type.<eos> Uraniums legally mined in that region... and there are about 10 international agencies... counting every ounce of yellowcake produced... making damn sure what your intel says is happening never happens.<eos> So you can imagine the kind of politics that we-<eos> Listen, Case.<eos> The guys in D.C. Cried wolf about this African yellowcake once before.<eos> We both know how that turned out.<eos> - Yes, I do.
It was my only thing, and I went...<eos> She got an elbow right to the lip... knocked her mask clean off.<eos> Ohh, does it hurt?<eos> Yeah, it fucking hurts.<eos> It looks pretty bad.<eos> It's fine.<eos> You know what it looks like?<eos> It looks like you got herpes.<eos> Hey, no.<eos> It kind of does.
It's, you know...<eos> You... you see that book there?<eos> It has no cover on it, huh?<eos> Uh-huh, yes. That book... it used to have a cover.<eos> I remember I read this cover, you know, when it has a cover on it.<eos> It was saying that Harry Potter, it has seven book, you know?<eos> You guys only have six book.<eos> Huh? I don't know what to tell you...<eos> I... - You know how long I'm asking for this book?<eos> No, you don't.
Well, then, why are you doing this?<eos> Look at me.<eos> You're asking me why do I want to die, but you don't see that I'm not even living.<eos> You guys control everything.<eos> You tell us what to eat, when to sleep.<eos> Even when we don't want to eat, you tell me we must.<eos> It is your life... it is not ours.<eos> I don't expect you to understand that.<eos> I-I like you.<eos> I do.
It's beautiful.<eos> I dropped the cash off with the lady lawyer.<eos> She said some of the statutes on the warrants might be expired.<eos> Yeah, I've got a good feeling about this.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Announce yourself.<eos> Uh, your sign says you're looking for a driver.<eos> Not just a driver, a tow-truck driver.<eos> - I've got my class four license.<eos> - Yeah, so do a lot of people.
Barbara!<eos> Let go!<eos> Barbara!<eos> - It's been way too long.<eos> - Yeah, it has.<eos> Alissa, you remember where that turnoff is?<eos> One or two miles past the Holland Creek sign.<eos> Does he even know where he's going?<eos> No.<eos> I do.
And then, on to Radcliffe.<eos> Yes.<eos> Where you would meet the future Vice President.<eos> Back then, just a dashing law student.<eos> I never dreamed he would become Vice President, of course.<eos> Some people think that your marriage may be a bit more calculated than you let on, that perhaps he needed your family's money.<eos> No.<eos> That's just not true.<eos> Your father did contribute an awful lot to his campaign.<eos> Yes, he did.
How much longer?<eos> - Until what?<eos> - Until I can stop.<eos> Do you prefer prison?<eos> I've given you eight child pornographers, three botnet masters...<eos> But you still haven't given us AV unit.<eos> Well, I told Carter I don't know where he is.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - I don't.<eos> Nobody does.
First Yank that brushed up against me, I grabbed him by the throat. Fall down on the ground.<eos> I bit him so hard I could taste the bone.<eos> Then he grabs a rock, brings it down right here.<eos> That was that.<eos> I was buried in a mass grave. No headstone.<eos> Can we get a picture with you and Augustus?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - He takes it rather seriously.<eos> - Oh, yeah, they all do.
- Look, it wasn't even sexual, though.<eos> It was comedic.<eos> I mean, was I turned on?<eos> Yes, because she's incredibly hot.<eos> But was I trying to fuck her? No.<eos> You started to give her a back rub.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - She said that?<eos> - You told me to play it cool.<eos> - I did. I did.
No, it's creepy.<eos> Yep, we're in creepy town right now... population you.<eos> "A," I have an appointment, and "B," it's too soon.<eos> And "C," are you getting stoned right now?<eos> What kind of appointment?<eos> - It's an acting appointment.<eos> - You didn't answer my question.<eos> - An audition.<eos> Rath said that there was a small part that I might be good for.<eos> Oh, Rath did, did he?
We can talk about it in our session today.<eos> You still want me to come in?<eos> Sure, why not?<eos> I have a few appointments in the morning, But then maybe we can spend the day together.<eos> Okay, sounds great.<eos> Novi, baby, how are you?<eos> Hey Eesha, how are you?<eos> Oh, I'm fine.<eos> Did you have a long night?<eos> I did.
Your great-uncle.<eos> Your grandfather's brother.<eos> You didn't know? We only just met.<eos> A long story.<eos> Sorry. I'm really sorry.<eos> - Can I change somewhere?<eos> - Of course. It's embarrassing, but I have no spare rooms.<eos> 30 years renovating. All our money goes on the olive groves.<eos> Léa will take you to Magali's.<eos> She does BB.
After I feel distracted, I feel stressed.<eos> Then I have a moment.<eos> Mom!<eos> Mommy!<eos> I am talking to Daddy!<eos> This is me having a moment with my daughter.<eos> Hon, about the stress level.<eos> - What?<eos> - Well, it's a little high.<eos> - The kind of psycho thing you just did...
Right now, I bet he's playing some game with the kids, like cops and robbers, and it's gotten totally out of control.<eos> - This is out of control, Sean!<eos> - It's not out of control!<eos> This is totally out of control. It's out of control.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> - I can't see the kids. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> And the house is a wreck and Brandon is playing death video games.<eos> I know you can do it!<eos> You may not have any sense of what you're doing.<eos> None of us do!
No, no, no, she was talking... - Shh!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Phoenix is my baby.<eos> Well, do you have a picture?<eos> 'Cause Bones needs a picture to get the tattoo perfect.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> 'Cause them little hellions are hard to draw.<eos> None of us want a tattoo!<eos> I want a tattoo.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
I love you the most of everybody.<eos> I love you.<eos> Mwah. Gotta go bowl.<eos> Okay, baby.<eos> Hey, hon.<eos> You have 235 followers.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I have a blog.<eos> - Yes, you do.
You guys ready?<eos> Ew, he wears cologne.<eos> It's gross.<eos> If my dad finds out, I'm totally getting grounded.<eos> And if your dad doesn't find out, maybe we'll be invited to Ryan's New Year's Eve party.<eos> Maybe we won't go into next semester being the same lame losers we are now.<eos> I don't have to jump off a bus to prove I'm fun.<eos> I'm fun.<eos> I know that.<eos> Just... no one else really does.
Well done, sir. You know...<eos> Well, you know, it takes time.<eos> But once you get on the other side of all the bullshit you realize that this is what it's all about all along.<eos> You know, having a friend to hold your hand while life kicks you in the ass and reminds you that that body of yours is just on loan.<eos> Yeah, sometimes you see things really clearly and then just... It gets cloudy again.<eos> Hey, well, that's life, kid.<eos> I mean, if it was easy, we wouldn't never fuck up.<eos> We wouldn't have any regrets, we'd have perfect kids and we'd spend every second of every day being happy.<eos> Now, you know anybody like that?<eos> No, because I sure the hell don't.
But we still need to work at it, you know, just like the rest of the world.<eos> It's not gonna figure itself out.<eos> We need to...<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's been a long time since it was just about fiery sex.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was never just about fiery sex, Karen.<eos> The sex was pretty fiery, though, wasn't it?<eos> - I don't wanna talk about sex.<eos> - I kind of do.
How do you find Mrs Vickers' state of mind?<eos> Er, she's weepy, exhausted, scarcely leaves the flat.<eos> I've noticed she's started to let her appearance go.<eos> Women can develop depression up to a year after the birth of a child.<eos> May explain why she's struggling to cope.<eos> There is one other thing.<eos> Billy - the children's father - had a brother who died at the age of four.<eos> Some sort of chest complaint.<eos> Do you think that might be making them even more anxious?<eos> Yes, I do!
Maggie.<eos> Look, I've been running from the devil my whole life, Ben.<eos> Been a fighter since the day I was born... First against my father, then against cancer, against every stinking skitter and mech out there.<eos> I'm still a fighter, Ben.<eos> I'm telling you, there's no fight anymore.<eos> I know you're not crazy, Maggie, but the minute a mech finds this place...<eos> You want to see something crazy, Ben?<eos> A few months ago, a mech did find this place, just after you were injured protecting Lexi.<eos> I wanted to kill it or run.<eos> A lot of people did.
What exactly is the company, by the way?<eos> The client is in footwear.<eos> Shoes, women's.<eos> The new head of marketing wants to cut costs.<eos> I get it.<eos> It's 20 degrees out there and the kids are in sandals.<eos> Lowering overhead is not a bad idea.<eos> Is that where you'd start, keeping in mind "the four Ps"?<eos> Do you have an MBA?<eos> No, but their head of marketing does.
What?<eos> Who did this?<eos> I thought you did.<eos> Why would I do this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, you're the only one out here.<eos> - I just assumed.<eos> - I gotta go. - What does it mean?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I was just... because you said you...<eos> Just stop.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I was just trying to be nice, or whatever.<eos> Yeah, well you could use a little more practice.<eos> Why?<eos> Why what?<eos> Why are you being nice all of a sudden?<eos> Why does it matter to you now?<eos> It doesn't.
- I want to know what?<eos> about Carson. - What ?<eos> - Where's D? Carson?<eos> - I can not talk with you.<eos> It's exactly what I do; 'See what ? , cerr Salt? house for a week.<eos> - You know you as ?<eos> ! - I saw the house.<eos> - I have to close and to call the police?<eos> . - No, listen, Beth!<eos> Do not do anything wrong, right?
Give your present job to a night watchman, then call me over to walk in your wake, as it were.<eos> I'll have to burn Harold Parr.<eos> - To the Israelis?<eos> - Mm. That's fine. They'll bury it.<eos> They won't let this go public.<eos> But I... I have one other stipulation.<eos> The Stein Foundation has to stay intact. It cannot be compromised.<eos> It already is.<eos> The Israelis will know. Hamas probably already does.<eos> But the world doesn't.
Why'd it come to us?<eos> This.<eos> We need to speak to the Israelis.<eos> I'll set up a meeting.<eos> For a formal response, go right ahead, but for a truthful one, or at least the chance of it, leave it with me.<eos> Sir.<eos> Someone about to win a multimillion contract just goes and puts a rope round his neck?<eos> Maybe he couldn't stand the wait.<eos> You think he's been killed?<eos> You don't?
You're suggesting - this was a military operation.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> They left four years ago and functionally disappeared.<eos> Until now. Too late.<eos> Clearly, they're a team that leaves no trace...at all.<eos> So, where next?<eos> Given what's happened, I have to suggest the possibility that our most likely point of first contact will be when Kasim's kidnappers choose to make it with us.<eos> So the long arm of the law has just come up short. Is that what you're telling us?<eos> And how do you expect us to react to that?<eos> He doesn't.
Frances, why don't you just tell me what you expect me to be doing here?<eos> Everything we can to get that little boy back.<eos> That is the job of the police.<eos> The British bobby against the Middle East?<eos> So you think we should be doing it for them?<eos> This is your world, Nessa, no-one knows it better than you.<eos> Where does the corruption start, Frances?<eos> In the boot of a car, if that's where we find him.<eos> You don't think I want to be tearing this place apart, do everything I fucking can to get that boy back?<eos> Of course I do!
Do you mind if I ask you...<eos> a personal question?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Did you love Samir Meshal?<eos> I was very fond of him.<eos> That's not my question.<eos> Well, I ended the relationship, so obviously maybe I didn't.<eos> And do you think he loved you?<eos> What is this, The Love Boat?<eos> Did he?
But I wouldn't pretend it doesn't exist.<eos> Not any more.<eos> Tell me about him.<eos> Who?<eos> Kasim's father.<eos> I really did not know him.<eos> Sometimes... in situations like that things happen much faster than they should.<eos> He was hopeful.<eos> And if he hadn't died?<eos> But he did.
Where is she?<eos> At work.<eos> It...it's a stone factory.<eos> She does their books at night.<eos> Where is she?<eos> In the back.<eos> Stay here if you want.<eos> This isn't a stone factory.<eos> I didn't kill my brother.<eos> Who did?
So, when you think about it like that...<eos> God may forgive you for what you've done. But Israel won't.<eos> If you kill the child, they kill me.<eos> But if you have it, they're going to let you go home.<eos> ...it's a wonder we trust anyone at all.<eos> Where will I have it?<eos> Here.<eos> Your mother died in childbirth.<eos> You won't. I promise.<eos> What if I don't?
OK.<eos> Let's get you home.<eos> I know what happened... ..in Gaza...<eos> ..to you and Atika.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> You're going to anyway, so just do it.<eos> What happened tonight, has it happened before?<eos> Did it happen then?<eos> What does it say in my file?<eos> It doesn't.
It appears to be because of the comments that he made to the press.<eos> We don't know yet if what he said was true.<eos> Yaniv Levi is an Israeli attack dog... and they just let him off the leash.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Not yet.<eos> I know it.<eos> Someone had to pay him.<eos> I'm not sure he's a gun for hire.<eos> He always has a price, of course he does.<eos> What Jew doesn't?
- You are done here.<eos> - Why?<eos> You do not call people "whack jobs."<eos> You say it all the time!<eos> Rachel Coulson has depression.<eos> Do you know what that is?<eos> No. Not really.<eos> You should.<eos> It runs in our family.<eos> No, it doesn't.
- That was great.<eos> - Sure was.<eos> Just awful.<eos> Those rotten grandchildren, talking to Bonnie like that.<eos> It's just...<eos> They sound like real hellions.<eos> That Julie's not much.<eos> Bonnie always talked about her like she was God's gift.<eos> - You never really know what goes on.<eos> - No, you do not.
Just for the record, your father's the only one in the place that doesn't smell like a dirty sponge.<eos> I'm thinking of selling your house.<eos> All the upkeep.<eos> It's a lot of upkeep, renting it to all the summer people.<eos> Unless you want to keep it in the family, of course.<eos> No, you should go ahead and sell it.<eos> Well, go over there tomorrow and see if there's any furniture you want.<eos> No, you can keep it.<eos> Didn't What's-Her-Name clean you out?<eos> No, she didn't.
All right. Not going to see the Queen, you know.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Are you sure you're fine to drive home?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Well, I'm gonna follow you just to be sure.<eos> Oh, dear God, is that your car?<eos> I don't know. Let me see if this key works.<eos> It's a little much for around here, don't you think?<eos> No, I don't.
The fact he couldn't control his Change, that's not your fault.<eos> - He was a ticking time bomb...<eos> - You're not listening to me!<eos> I'm the ticking time bomb!<eos> We both are.<eos> Look, we don't think clearly when we're around one another.<eos> People are dead.<eos> Elena, we stopped him from killing anyone else.<eos> He didn't kill the guy in the office, Clay.<eos> Yes, he did.
I have a life in Toronto.<eos> - A good life.<eos> It's my life.<eos> - Keep telling yourself that.<eos> You'll find whoever made the Mutt.<eos> Okay? You'll punish him.<eos> But you don't need me!<eos> Keep telling yourself that, too.<eos> He's not the only one that needs you.<eos> We all do, Elena.
You're no son of mine.<eos> I am your son.<eos> I have always been your son.<eos> What have you done?<eos> Quickly.<eos> Trust me, my friend. I've brought you this far.<eos> I want to see the captain.<eos> You're seeing him.<eos> I want to go north, to the Wall.<eos> No, you don't.
You say that like it's a good thing.<eos> It's necessary.<eos> Move!<eos> Take your glow stick and go home.<eos> Gotham's mine.<eos> No, see, this entire space sector is my beat.<eos> Uh-Huh.<eos> I'm serious!<eos> I'm Green Lantern, damn it!<eos> What the hell did you do?
I kind of liked being a part of something.<eos> Yeah, you would.<eos> Listen, this was just a one-time deal, ok?<eos> And what if something like this should happen again?<eos> - Please.<eos> - What could possibly happen?<eos> That said, I am very pleased To introduce to you...<eos> Gee, I didn't even ask.<eos> Do you guys have a name?<eos> - Yes, we do.
And even if something happened, we never heard about it.<eos> So if you don't hear, it never happened.<eos> - Everyone sees the moonlight.<eos> If you had a daughter, would you let your daughter marry him?<eos> Without hesitation.<eos> Sunlight, moonlight, interesting.<eos> Jacob Ben Harouch, could it be that the sunlight has blinded you?<eos> What do you want, Carmel?<eos> Didn't you hear that Elisha Amsalem lives alone and that his "well-known" wife moved out four years ago?<eos> - For two and a half years, we didn't.
I don't know, on holidays...<eos> Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah.<eos> Abraham Zagouri apologized to Elisha Amsalem.<eos> Yes.<eos> How many times?<eos> Several times.<eos> How many?<eos> Until he gave up.<eos> And he didn't forgive him.<eos> He didn't.
This is the funniest guy I've ever met.<eos> I'm gonna quote this guy to all my friends.<eos> I love his town, I love his family.<eos> But now, I think I speak for all of us when I say, I am over the Simpsons!<eos> Wh-What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying the Simpsons suck!<eos> Why, you...<eos> What the hell?<eos> That really hurts.<eos> No, it doesn't!
Look, let's talk.<eos> I know that you've been under a lot of pressure recently.<eos> I've just felt so out of place, like I don't belong.<eos> I think we can all feel like that from time to time.<eos> In fact, I've felt a little bit of that myself.<eos> Well, I guess we're not that different.<eos> You know what it feels like to be alone.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Peter's research.<eos> There are 20 more boxes in his lab.<eos> That's gonna take me days to sort through.<eos> Can you tell me what he was working on?<eos> Mutagens, mostly.<eos> For speeding up mutations.<eos> Those are dangerous.<eos> You wouldn't want to let your children play with them.<eos> Do you have children?<eos> No, I don't.
- Should have followed my instinct...<eos> - And not listen to me ?<eos> What's going on ?<eos> Am I talking to the cop or the psychologist?<eos> You're talking to a friend.<eos> Today Michele told me I'm not his mother.<eos> - Why ?<eos> - Because it's true.<eos> - I didn't know.<eos> - No one did.
Um, just with Emily.<eos> I got your message.<eos> Yeah, so Jessica DiLaurentis is on the board at Radley.<eos> - And that must be why my dad changed...<eos> - I signed the agreement.<eos> What?<eos> Wait when?<eos> Before I got your message.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Of course it does.
I ran a heat seeker on your username.<eos> No... no way.<eos> I've got asbestos firewalls.<eos> Yeah, they're really not all that fireproof.<eos> I found a race condition in one of your logic gates and I just waltzed right into your computer.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Damn.<eos> You guys are the government?<eos> Do we look like we're from the government?<eos> - He does.
These Mutts need to be put down for good.<eos> I agree.<eos> No middle ground, no mercy.<eos> - Elena...<eos> - They killed Pete, they killed Antonio.<eos> What more is it going to take until we fight back?<eos> This is more than just killing a few Mutts.<eos> Nick, we can talk about this later.<eos> No, I have the rest of my life to grieve.<eos> We all do.
Somewhere to hide.<eos> But you can't hide forever.<eos> I'm not hiding. Matthew.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> And I'm counting on you staying right here.<eos> You?<eos> Keep it down, Garza.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Remember when you were in the rebellion and you convinced your commander to run a flanking move and everybody was captured except you?<eos> Do you?
Phone call, Chief.<eos> Hey, hon.<eos> - White.<eos> White, what?<eos> I decided we're gonna paint the nursery white.<eos> It's already white.<eos> Well...<eos> I want to paint it again.<eos> The baby's room should have a new coat, don't you think?<eos> I do.
Lester, listen to me very carefully.<eos> I need you to get down on the ground.<eos> Wait just a second.<eos> Lester, on the ground!<eos> This is not what it looks like.<eos> Now, hold on.<eos> Hold on.<eos> don't go down there.<eos> Don't... There's nothing down-- That's not<eos> - I didn't do nothing.
Evening.<eos> License and registration, please.<eos> We could do it that way.<eos> You ask me for my papers,<eos> I tell you it's not my car, that I borrowed it, see where things go from there.<eos> We could do that... or you could go get in your car and drive away.<eos> Now, why would I do that?<eos> Because some roads you shouldn't go down.<eos> Because maps used to say, "There be dragons here."<eos> Now they don't.
Ben!<eos> Adam, I would get Ben into treatment as soon as possible.<eos> His symptoms indicate that he's suffering from at least one dissociative disorder, and that points to a more chronic and severe psychopathology.<eos> Ok.<eos> Ok, thank you.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Ben!<eos> Ben, hold on!<eos> No, he thinks I'm crazy!<eos> No, he doesn't.
Yeah, I just feel like crap all of a sudden.<eos> The flu's going around, I think I may have gotten it.<eos> Well, do you want to go lay down?<eos> You feel pretty warm.<eos> Uh, no actually.<eos> Can you just drive me back to school?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Ok, thank you.<eos> No, I think that's a good idea, honey.<eos> I do.
Don't do this!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Ariel told me to come get you!<eos> She told me to take care of you, Dana!<eos> I don't believe you!<eos> No!<eos> Dana!<eos> Do you have a Dana Morgan or Joe Smith registered there?<eos> You do?
I mean, otherwise it's seven years of bad sex.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Much better.<eos> Experts say that serial killers... are triggered by, like, some kind of chromosomal abnormality... that starts to express itself during... Whoa. Puberty, I think.<eos> "She deserves someone who can offer her more."<eos> Look what we have here.<eos> - I don't know about this.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> - I do.
There's a first.<eos> Not spectating.<eos> Assessing.<eos> Assessing the ass-kicking I'll give you?<eos> Oh, God...<eos> And why would I want to humiliate my oldest and dearest friend?<eos> - I'm going to shower. - Whoa-whoa-whoa!<eos> Don't you wanna see me destroy this guy?<eos> Actually, yes.<eos> I do.
She's in danger because of me.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> Well, at least you admit it.<eos> She fell in love with the wrong guy.<eos> She was young, in university.<eos> It hit us both way too fast.<eos> I wanted to keep her out of my family's business.<eos> Look, I don't know what I was thinking.<eos> I can't believe she would stay with you.<eos> She didn't.
I hear you've had a change of heart.<eos> That is correct.<eos> But I understand I bring with me a recent history of wrongdoing.<eos> Wrongdoing?<eos> Three innocent people from Bear Valley.<eos> One was 10 years old.<eos> He bit in Scott Brandon.<eos> He is responsible for those deaths.<eos> How do I know that this awakening of good conscience is not just a momentary lapse?<eos> You don't.
- Sorry.<eos> - N-no, just give me a minute.<eos> Wait here.<eos> - Where's Jane?<eos> - Interrogation room with a pedophile who lives near the park.<eos> Okay, uh, can you tell her to come down to autopsy<eos> - when she's done?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - We need to talk about our kiss.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Don't forget Mr. Bruchschnauser.<eos> He is single, you know?<eos> Okay, I don't think she saw anything, but...<eos> Mom, do you still have that map?<eos> Sam, I told you...<eos> But, Mom, listen, Beethoven's gonna help me find the treasure.<eos> Aren't you, boy?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Yeah, Mr. Thornton said so.<eos> He did?
It's been a weird year.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Make any good friends?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> I'm not very popular, but I have a few good friends.<eos> Well, that's really all you need.<eos> I think people that have a lot of friends are usually not that interesting.<eos> Were you popular?<eos> You seem like you were.<eos> I do?
Noni, over here!<eos> You look beautiful, baby! Right here.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Wow.<eos> - Oh, my God, it's Noni!<eos> She's so pretty.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> You have the worse taste in men I've ever seen.<eos> - See, that's not true.<eos> - Yeah, you do. You do.
You know I love you like a step-nephew, right?<eos> Good, 'cause I need a favor.<eos> Oh, man. Come on.<eos> She is out of your league.<eos> You got dressed up for nothing.<eos> - I just need to see her for a second.<eos> - You know I can't do that.<eos> Jesse, I'm asking.<eos> - You really wanna see her?<eos> - Yes, I do.
- What do you got?<eos> - Shaun Manning's aunt's phone records.<eos> It shows at least a dozen calls to our new favorite pizza joint.<eos> It's funny, Gino never mentioned that.<eos> And he said Manning wasn't looking for a job.<eos> By the way, that is a lot of calls, just to bug someone to hire you.<eos> Which is why I also checked Gino's phone line too.<eos> See if anyone called Manning back.<eos> I'm thinking, if it's not about a job, maybe we find the person who's helping him hide out.<eos> - And did you?
So much for trust.<eos> Hawkeye: Well, I say we take the next month off.<eos> I'm gonna need a month just to enjoy this moment!<eos> Say "defeat!" (laughs)<eos> Wouldn't believe it if I wasn't seeing it with my own eye.<eos> Might want to back up.<eos> I know standard procedure's to confiscate his armor, But skull may have it booby-trapped.<eos> (growls) I'll get it off him.<eos> Didn't I just say not to do that?<eos> I did, right?
The numbers do not lie, hyperion.<eos> There is a 75% certainty of your failure.<eos> Disengage.<eos> More like 83%, but who's counting?<eos> Still doubting the numbers?<eos> Why don't you ask hulk?<eos> We need to get him back to the tower.<eos> This isn't over.<eos> The numbers do not lie?<eos> They do not.

Fear comes with the job.<eos> It's how you deal with it that matters.<eos> (scoffs) if I told you the odds That you were gonna say that, would ya hit me?<eos> No. But that will.<eos> Adaptoid at 12 o'clock.<eos> Captain america: Brace for impact.<eos> Iron man: S.P.E.'s got this.<eos> I hope.<eos> Your magic number engine didn't see that comin'?<eos> Actually, it did.
We're winning. Just stick with your partners.<eos> Look at the big picture.<eos> They're setting us up.<eos> Iron man: Cap, please. Trust me.<eos> He should listen to you more often.<eos> Attuma: Hello...<eos> Captain.<eos> Tony. They're doin' a teleport swap.<eos> You said to stick with our partners, But they didn't stick with us.<eos> No, they didn't.
By the door.<eos> Bye, babe.<eos> I can't come to you, okay?<eos> I'm at work.<eos> What time does your meet start?<eos> Half an hour.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> It's money, Shana, a lot, and a piece of paper.<eos> You weren't supposed to look.<eos> Well, I did.
What?<eos> Spencer, we can't tell her now.<eos> The longer we wait, the more dangerous it becomes.<eos> And you think it's any less dangerous to drop a bomb like that while she's going into class?<eos> We can't do that to her. Do what?<eos> Protect her?<eos> Ezra spoke to me this morning and I could barely maintain eye contact.<eos> Meanwhile, for all we know right now, Aria is hooking up with him in some janitor's closet.<eos> How does that not make your skin crawl?<eos> It does.
Did you or did you not see me standing with a shovel that night?<eos> And if you did see me hurt Ali, then why didn't you just call the cops?<eos> Hi. Anything for the dry cleaners?<eos> It was 3 days in rehab, Mom.<eos> I really did not need so many sweaters.<eos> I thought, I don't know, maybe you'd go outside for some fresh air or if you got cold.<eos> I did get cold and then I got the sweats.<eos> You know, withdrawal symptoms can't really be stopped with a cable knit.<eos> They said that the medical detox would help mitigate your discomfort.<eos> It did, mom.
Map says there's a kid's museum.<eos> Kiddie museum?<eos> What trail are we taking?<eos> We don't follow the trails.<eos> We follow the animals.<eos> Well, I'll follow you.<eos> I'm directionally challenged.<eos> Don't worry, we won't get lost.<eos> We got GPS.<eos> And so does the dog.
So, you guys wanna have a seat?<eos> Charlie tells me you were a Green Beret?<eos> I didn't like Berets either.<eos> That's a joke.<eos> I actually really miss my guys.<eos> What unit were you in?<eos> I was with SAG OP 35.<eos> You must have spent more time in Laos than Vietnam.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yes, I did.
You've rigged the system.<eos> Yes.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> That's why you don't need to worry about it.<eos> It's all fuckin' rigged, Sam, and there's no need in trying to fight it.<eos> This is how I think of it.<eos> You were lucky enough to be a part of that 1% that served the nation, right?<eos> So, I'm giving you an opportunity to be a part of the 1% that runs the nation.<eos> Because if anybody deserves to reap the benefits of this weird, fucked-up system that we're living in, it's you, and I want that for you.<eos> I do.
I miss Valentina like crazy.<eos> But at some point, we have to accept the fact that life goes on.<eos> When was the last time you had something to eat?<eos> I had an aspirin for breakfast. Oh!<eos> It's a letter from Remi! That's great.<eos> We haven't heard from him in a long time.<eos> How is he?<eos> Does he say anything about Valentina?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> He doesn't.
I don't expect civil servants to understand how impressive that is, but I do expect you to get them back.<eos> If there's any other details the two of you can remember...<eos> Mr. Powell?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, uh... no.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I have to get this done before sundown.<eos> Adrian is convinced the gunmen will come back, so he's decided to change every lock in our house.<eos> You know how to change locks?<eos> No, he does not.
Most Atrians don't even have that information.<eos> If the Trags find out...<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> That's why I'm asking you.<eos> You're the only person I can trust that can help me.<eos> Maybe I used to have a reason to be on your side, but like you said this morning, it's over.<eos> Vega.<eos> The Trags have honored me by making me their leader.<eos> Do you know why you're here?<eos> I do.
Transmitted by these.<eos> They're taking them off.<eos> What? Why would they do something so reckless?<eos> Because we told them not to.<eos> Hello, beautiful.<eos> Hey, where are you going?<eos> It's okay.<eos> We've got nothing but time.<eos> Hey, how do we know this is the right way?<eos> We don't.
We didn't ask for this.<eos> Ours was to be a transitional generation.<eos> Ensuring that three generations from now mankind could go home.<eos> But everything has changed, and we will either be the generation that sees the human race return to Earth or upon whose watch, it finally ends.<eos> My son is already down there.<eos> I sent him.<eos> And the truth is I don't know if he is alive or dead.<eos> But I still have hope.<eos> How does the Chancellor vote?<eos> I don't.
Good night, Tricia.<eos> What do you think?<eos> We'll see.<eos> The idea is to take color theory and turn it on its head.<eos> Break all the rules.<eos> They're gorgeous.<eos> Who'd you say your client is?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I was just wondering if maybe I knew him.<eos> You don't.
Bypass her.<eos> I don't want her in the meeting<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Meechum, get in touch with the plane.<eos> Have them make ribs for the flight back.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Mr. Vice President, do you have a moment?<eos> I'm sorry. The President asked to see me.<eos> No, he didn't.
It's ugly.<eos> It's not a fair place.<eos> I'm happy to have what I have.<eos> I'm glad I have this.<eos> I've thought it all out.<eos> And there's a way to do it so we don't risk any exposure.<eos> Do we have to talk about this now?<eos> I'm beat.<eos> My brain is...<eos> Yes, we do.
Why are you here, Dean?<eos> We're looking for the weapon the archangels used to kill the Knights of Hell.<eos> The First Blade.<eos> We need it to kill a Knight of Hell -<eos> - Abaddon.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> You're retired.<eos> We're not here to get between you and the demonic AARP, but it's bad out there, and I'm just looking to even the odds.<eos> One last time -- how did you find me?<eos> We didn't.
You're a secretary, Lucy.<eos> What the hell has any of this got to do with you? How do you even know?<eos> I want you to meet some friends of mine.<eos> I think then you might understand.<eos> How do we get her there? Do we have to get her there?<eos> If she's not caught she'll get tipped off and move her operation like every time before.<eos> -What if she returns for Millie? -She has to be there.<eos> They have to catch her and lock her away or there is no point to this.<eos> You're right. So?<eos> How do we do it?
- Hello?<eos> - There's no reception...<eos> There's no reception...<eos> There's no reception, I'll get back to you.<eos> Hello?<eos> May I speak to God please?<eos> He's in the toilet.<eos> - Leave it! - It will take a minute.<eos> - He needs to be changed.<eos> - I already did.
- in a coma.<eos> - A coma?<eos> But I got out.<eos> Wait.<eos> What you talking about?<eos> I got out, Kerwin.<eos> Out? You mean off the row.<eos> Off the row.<eos> You got out alive?<eos> I did.
Hey, what are you doing?<eos> No!<eos> Who are they?<eos> What are they doing here?<eos> - English!<eos> - I was just telling my son that someone reported we had restricted technology.<eos> We don't have restricted tech, so you can just stop!<eos> They can threaten us all they want.<eos> We have nothing to hide.<eos> Actually, we do.
Then why don't you race her?<eos> Head to head.<eos> Because I'm not getting in the pool with a disease-ridden tattie.<eos> That's why.<eos> I'm just concerned for my daughter<eos> Have the Atrians even been tested - for any diseases?<eos> - Yes, of course - they have.<eos> - Mom, you should've seen her.<eos> She broke Eric's state record!<eos> Like hell she did.
So, uh, I want to skip work today and stay home and practice.<eos> You want to hang out?<eos> I want to play you something. I can't.<eos> After spending three weeks putting up Stina's piece of shit, now I gotta take it back down again.<eos> I was, um... talking to Pauline about her gallery space, and she...<eos> What?<eos> Don't even think about it, Franklin.<eos> No no. She was just asking if you had anything you wanted to show, so I just thought I'd ask.<eos> Come on. There's no way she asked you that.<eos> She did.
Every other group has been invited.<eos> - Every other group was approved by the whole committee. - Oh, I see.<eos> — Dai had to make a snap decision.<eos> Oh, this is all my fault.<eos> He was in London.<eos> Would you have told them to keep their money? I'll tell you what I would've done.<eos> All right, I run a civil meeting here.<eos> If you want to scream and shout, get on the pickets.<eos> I don't have a problem with what they are.<eos> - None of us do.
- It was.<eos> All right, take my advice.<eos> Don't give it all to the fight. Save some for home.<eos> There's more to life, you know?<eos> You girls have opened my eyes. I'm going to extend my repertoire, you'll see.<eos> - The vegan Delia Smith. - Heh.<eos> Take care now.<eos> It's a bloody travesty, man.<eos> I don't accept it. - Gethin.<eos> - I don't!
We gotta find him or we're fucked, okay?<eos> Go.<eos> Will you answer that fuckin' phone?<eos> No, sorry, it's nothing important.<eos> Daniele, I can't talk.<eos> Wait, don't hang up.<eos> I'm working.<eos> - Don't get pissed.<eos> - Then you don't understand?<eos> No, you don't.
It's still charging!<eos> Come on.<eos> If you're wrong, we all die!<eos> I'm not wrong!<eos> Come on!<eos> I'm not gonna lose you again.<eos> Gabriel, look at me. Will you look at me?<eos> I made these choices.<eos> - No.<eos> - I did!
Please. You knew your asset wouldn't leave that prison.<eos> That was a field call, not an order.<eos> Did Weatherly know?<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> You think I'm set up on you?<eos> Are you?<eos> No. But I'm clocking two of your pavement artists right now.<eos> You've had me in a floating box since I left Angel's Bluff.<eos> Weatherly didn't know.<eos> The president still doesn't.
Heads up.<eos> Limo's coming in hot!<eos> Damn. Where in the hell did you learn to drive?<eos> Urban combat driving school. High-threat escape scenarios.<eos> This is D.L. Tangent is safe and sound.<eos> - We are go for takeoff.<eos> - Roger that.<eos> I need it.<eos> You don't need it.<eos> I do!
- One out of two, good!<eos> - Let me try again.<eos> - You'd like to?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's enough!<eos> You want to shoot... but just at bottles?<eos> Or really shoot?<eos> Shootin' a man is different, you gotta get close.<eos> I bet it scares you.<eos> - It doesn't?
Check it!<eos> Check it!<eos> - Oh, oh, oh! - That's impressive, Sally.<eos> Right, right, right?<eos> Look at this.<eos> Look.<eos> I'm a ghost, just reading a book, like I do, turning the pages, you know, with my hands!<eos> Who's this?<eos> I thought you came back to spend the night with Kat.<eos> I did.
Well, she says that I can't, but I don't believe her.<eos> Wait...<eos> Would you do that?<eos> I had to try.<eos> Anyways, there's not a spell in the book for it.<eos> Nora, I can't stay here for eternity.<eos> You and Josh, you guys are gonna move away soon, yeah?<eos> And Aidan, we never completely know what he's gonna do.<eos> It's not like he lives a risk-free lifestyle.<eos> None of us do.
The ones I dusted were weak-willed bottom feeders.<eos> If I didn't stop them, there would be some other couple, family, just like you and I, that they will destroy.<eos> That was 200 years ago!<eos> Oh no, that's tonight or tomorrow or a century from now, and it'll never end.<eos> Suzanna, you're killing people.<eos> You're not just killing them.<eos> You're wiping them from existence, and all because they drink blood.<eos> Now, I saw the way that you fought, and there is no way you could've pulled that off without drinking.<eos> You're right.<eos> I do!
- For the third time, yes!<eos> - All right, I get it!<eos> Moving on!<eos> I think a neighbour snapped this and sent it into the newspaper.<eos> I was famous for a week!<eos> Would you say you had a normal childhood?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Because someone tried human sacrificing you?<eos> I mean, it just seems like an odd question from the Preservation Society.<eos> It does, though, doesn't it.
Kenny wasn't gonna do anything!<eos> He's a time bomb, Josh.<eos> And you know it.<eos> Caroline, don't.<eos> I'm sorry, Josh, but after what happened here, it's pretty obvious we need to stick together.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Andrew...<eos> Is Emily OK?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
He's bleeding.<eos> We should go.<eos> I mean, I'm pretty sure he had that before he came in here.<eos> Are you sure you don't wanna check out the stained glass?<eos> It's my favourite part of the...<eos> Well, here goes nothing.<eos> That place was a bust.<eos> We have to face the fact that there's not a lot in our price range.<eos> Well, we can't live in a dump like that!<eos> - You already do, dude.
Reranked all the DoctorWhos by puffiness of the hair.<eos> Oh, and I also got married to my actual, non-imaginary, comic-tolerating girlfriend, Strawberry.<eos> Now when Milo talks to himself, it won't seem crazy.<eos> So, Milo talks to himself.<eos> We will treasure that information.<eos> Yes... we will.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna share this primo origin ish with my bride.<eos> Even the mintiest comic is just acidifying pulp, if you have no one to read it with, right?<eos> Nerds don't get girls.<eos> These days they do, man.
First of all, you guys don't scare us.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Say, ola to my little pistola.<eos> Am I supposed to be impressed with that treasure trail or the lady gun you got hiding in your, uh, pants there?<eos> Uh, both?<eos> Look, whether you like it or not, we are handling this situation. - Yup,<eos> - Really?<eos> - 'Cause I see a couple of fame whores who are pointing their camera at a mom who just lost her kid.<eos> Guys, we are investigators, and we have every right-- No.<eos> No, you don't.
Okay, well, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> I mean, how could something be both real and fake at the same time?<eos> Well, a girl is dead, and that's about as real as it gets.<eos> All right, so, the last thing she did was she took a photo on her phone.<eos> How did that photo end up online?<eos> No clue.<eos> It was originally posted to a Thinman fan forum, but the IP address was blocked.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.<eos> This thing has fans?<eos> Of course it does.
You throw the right Tibetan symbol into the mix you dumb asses ever think the Thinman comes to life as a Tulpa?<eos> Because thousands of people can agree that Thinman is any one thing?<eos> The lore changes blog to blog.<eos> - He's not a Tulpa.<eos> - Okay, all right. All right.<eos> Right here, right now, cut the crap.<eos> Do either of you actually know what Thinman is? No.<eos> We just play Supernaturalists on TV.<eos> We have no idea what we're doing.<eos> (LAUGHING) of course we do.
And what about Casey?<eos> What did she do?<eos> She wouldn't go out with me, so I set her up with someone else...<eos> My knife.<eos> Good one, Rog.<eos> I see the sheriff didn't make it out of town.<eos> Well, he really should have given me the time off I asked for.<eos> - So, you killed him?<eos> - I didn't kill anyone.<eos> Roger did.
You know, maybe -- maybe it was some banger with a knife.<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> I am trying to help.<eos> By calling me a liar?<eos> !<eos> Wow.<eos> You are just like your old man.<eos> Nate Ross was a great cop.<eos> He taught me everything I know.<eos> But his temper never did him any favors.
And, you know, humans sense that.<eos> So they prayed harder and longer and fought more wars in his name.<eos> And for what?<eos> So they could die of malaria?<eos> Leukemia?<eos> And all the while, blaming themselves!<eos> "Oh, if only I'd been more prayerful, God would have loved me!<eos> God would have saved me!" You know what?<eos> God didn't even know their name!<eos> But I do.
Roll it back.<eos> There.<eos> That was an angel, Esther.<eos> She's one of Metatron's.<eos> - So, this was some kind of hit?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Stop saying you don't know.<eos> You can't think I would allow something like this.<eos> Cass, I know you try to be a good guy, okay?<eos> I do.
What's this?<eos> Oh, are you kidding?<eos> Hot Doug's?<eos> That line is like an hour.<eos> [Laughs] Don't we know? The Elvis?<eos> Oh, seriously, you guys.<eos> This is for me?<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> They didn't have to do this.<eos> They didn't.
There is if this photo is on the front page of the Daily.<eos> Politics and business are intertwined in China, as I'm sure you know.<eos> It's not uncommon to partner with someone who can ensure Beijing's approval.<eos> So you needed his political influence.<eos> All this is moot.<eos> Our venture fell through.<eos> Right after the Port Jefferson Bridge was approved.<eos> Well, I had nothing to do with that project.<eos> - Neither did Feng, to my knowledge.<eos> - No, but Wu Bin Yang did.
The avengers are aboard... (explosion) (all grunt)<eos> Of all times to finally stop talking, he picks now.<eos> What's the status of d'bari evacuation?<eos> 97%. A few ships are having engine failures.<eos> I want that number at 100%.<eos> Star-lord: Bring us in.<eos> We'll tractor them out. Falcon: How did you evacuate a planet?<eos> Star-lord:<eos> Hey, it's what we do. Most inhabited planets Have a galactus contingency plan in place.<eos> Doesn't earth?
Always remember that.<eos> Swear to keep this place secret.<eos> No human can know about it.<eos> Eljida and your son's life depend on it.<eos> Mommy...<eos> I want Mommy.<eos> I want Mommy...<eos> You'll see your mother again.<eos> I really believe that.<eos> After today, I do, too.
Who are you talking to?<eos> No one.<eos> What did you do, Ray?<eos> He's gone.<eos> Yeah, just make sure that we have the north side of Montgomery covered.<eos> Okay.<eos> I thought you had cars posted outside.<eos> We had all cars to the robbery.<eos> How the hell did he get away so fast?<eos> Maybe he didn't.
Maybe he didn't.<eos> You had roadblocks up.<eos> Maybe he never made it out of town and he's hiding somewhere. (Thunder rumbling)<eos> What?<eos> I saw Elaine on the phone at the bank after the robbery.<eos> I think she might have been talking to her father.<eos> You don't think that she's helping him?<eos> She might be, even if she doesn't realize it.<eos> I thought you quit.<eos> I did.
But you're no longer with the FBI, right?<eos> I searched you online.<eos> Before yesterday, I-I knew very little about you and Joe Carroll and his cult.<eos> I was abroad most of last year, so I read up on you. Yeah.<eos> I'm no longer with the Bureau.<eos> But you can't turn it off.<eos> What's happening, it's hard for you.<eos> There's a certain helplessness in it all.<eos> You're an interesting man, Ryan.<eos> Miss Judy, you do a man right.
And the best part of all... [Chuckles] We have our Remi back.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> Rosie!<eos> What's wrong, miss Lucinda?<eos> I am trying to work here, but I can't concentrate because that boy of yours is trying to run me down!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Miguel is just excited to have a new toy.<eos> Well, I don't know why you gave him one so expensive. He's just gonna end up breaking the damn thing.<eos> I didn't buy it for Miguel.<eos> Your father did.
He's shooting a commercial.<eos> What are you doing tonight?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> It's Friday night.<eos> I've got crazy plans.<eos> Gonna drink tea and write in my therapy journal.<eos> Why don't you call some friends and have them come over?<eos> My uncle wouldn't like that.<eos> No! He wants you to have a good time.<eos> We both do.
I'm sure they'll know where she was staying.<eos> So... You're not gonna tell me what you did?<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> So, how did it go?<eos> All he would talk about is opal's apartment.<eos> Why?<eos> She was blackmailing him, Maybe she had some physical proof of what he did.<eos> You need to get to that apartment before nick does.<eos> Do you know where she was staying?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
It's just... I love having a child.<eos> Miguel makes me very happy.<eos> You know what I love having?<eos> A dream.<eos> And the day my dream comes true, I'm gonna be as happy as you are.<eos> What if it doesn't come true?<eos> What?<eos> Well, lots of people have dreams that don't work out, Or they get their dream and then it goes wrong.<eos> That's not gonna happen to me.<eos> But what if it does?
His usual racket is to target wealthy, middle-aged married women.<eos> He lures them into an affair, and then blackmails them by threatening to tell their husbands.<eos> Evelyn will be devastated when she finds out.<eos> I can't wait to tell her.<eos> Thanks again, Rick.<eos> Let me know if there's anything else I can do for you.<eos> Wait.<eos> I already know they're involved.<eos> Tony knows I know.<eos> - He does?
Of course not.<eos> Go to rehab.<eos> When you get back... I will be here waiting for you.<eos> What is that?<eos> I stumbled across some of our old records.<eos> I thought I'd give them a spin.<eos> Digitally speaking.<eos> I haven't heard that tango in ages.<eos> We danced to it on our honeymoon.<eos> Did we?
Who hit the ball 400 feet on to the roof... of Stevenson High School when he was a junior?<eos> Was it you, Mr. Campbell?<eos> Uh, well, it wasn't you, was it?<eos> - No, it wasn't me.<eos> - No, it wasn't you.<eos> Yeah, it was me.<eos> It was me.<eos> I was supposed to be great.<eos> Well, to me, I think you're great.<eos> Well, of course you do!
Was it you, Mr. Campbell?<eos> Uh, well, it wasn't you, was it?<eos> - No, it wasn't me.<eos> - No, it wasn't you.<eos> Yeah, it was me.<eos> It was me.<eos> I was supposed to be great.<eos> Well, to me, I think you're great.<eos> Well, of course you do!<eos> Of course you do.
All right, well, it's my fault, so I'm going to get in the car... and I'm just going to go look for him.<eos> All right, I'm going to stay here and see if I can get ahold of him.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay, I'll go with you.<eos> - Thank you, Officer.<eos> - Certainly.<eos> - Let us know if you find out anything. - Absolutely.<eos> We can't just be driving around blindly... looking for him all night.<eos> - We have no choice.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
There's nothing like one of your reproachful stares to make a person toe the line.<eos> He's scared I'll hit him with my stick.<eos> Right, Jacob... ..are you ready for a spot of crowd control after lunch?<eos> What is this?<eos> It's called Quiche Lorraine, according to Mrs B.<eos> Pass me the beetroot.<eos> With Sister Julienne's permission, I'll make myself a sandwich.<eos> Of course.<eos> What I want to know is does Nurse Lee say when she's coming back?<eos> No, she doesn't.
Or wears himself out and is too tired to walk home?<eos> Shelagh, leave him to his own devices.<eos> We both left him to his own devices, if you remember, the day he was taken ill!<eos> I don't deserve that and neither do you.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry!<eos> We're both sorry.<eos> And he's an 11-year-old boy.<eos> Polio or no polio, he needs to spread his wings.<eos> I don't know what I'm going to do with myself.<eos> I do.
And they told me there was a doctor who'd written a paper on Strongyloidiasis.<eos> Didn't you think to tell anyone where you'd gone?<eos> So I tracked him down and he said there was a specialist trialling a new drug at the Liverpool School of Tropical Disease.<eos> But because of the postal strike, I thought I should go up there and get the medication myself.<eos> To Liverpool?<eos> Fortunately I had my emergency five pound note in my purse.<eos> The medication is American.<eos> Dithiazanine.<eos> I need to get these to Maurice Glennon.<eos> No, you do not.
I didn't do...<eos> Nina, um...<eos> Oui.<eos> Nina, I'm sorry mommy had to wake you up in the middle of the night.<eos> I hope you can forgive me.<eos> Yeah? Hello.<eos> Heard it was the wild, wild west out there, huh?<eos> It was, um, a misunderstanding.<eos> Yeah, you had a run-in with some troublemakers, I understand?<eos> Yes, actually, I did.
- Are you high?<eos> - No, but I wish I was.<eos> Get over here.<eos> Oh, sure, OK.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I screamed at you before.<eos> It's just...<eos> I get scared. And I need to know you want me here.<eos> Oh, I...<eos> I do.
- No, but I wish I was.<eos> Get over here.<eos> Oh, sure, OK.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I screamed at you before.<eos> It's just...<eos> I get scared. And I need to know you want me here.<eos> Oh, I...<eos> I do.<eos> I definitely do.
- Why did your dad shoot him?<eos> - He didn't shoot him.<eos> - Then why was he in the trunk?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> He just wouldn't shoot a dog.<eos> Unless Dudley is one of the ones that went nuts in the 14th.<eos> I heard there's a whole pack of them that lives out in the woods - behind the state hospital.<eos> - That's urban legend bullshit.<eos> I know loads of people with dogs and none of them ran away.<eos> No, no, no. Not all of them did.
- No fucking clowns.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> - Chief Garvey.<eos> - Mayor.<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> - Securing the parade route. Uh-huh.<eos> Did you see anything interesting?<eos> Just a lot of people ready to feel better.<eos> They need this.<eos> We all do.
I wasn't certain if he was still armed, so as a precaution, I assumed Krogh was still in possession of a weapon.<eos> All right, let me be certain.<eos> The suspect, Eric Krogh, was on the floor, multiple gunshot wounds, unarmed.<eos> Okay, Catherine, here we are.<eos> On the record... why did you kill Eric Krogh?<eos> Eric Krogh suddenly and unexpectedly rolled onto his back and made an aggressive move towards me.<eos> Cross your arms.<eos> So I defended myself.<eos> Did you then take your police badge from the suspect?<eos> Yes, I did.
My husband called.<eos> Two days ago, said that he'd taken.<eos> Our daughter tory, and not to tell anyone. Or it would be bad for her.<eos> I guess I never knew him.<eos> Is that the man my husband shot?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Just what the hell do you think. You're doing here, secret service?<eos> This is where the fbi works.<eos> Agent finley, I thought I made it clear. You are not working this.<eos> Yes, agent dunn, you did.
I do.<eos> And I'm sorry. I love you.<eos> Dr. Bickman. Can I help you?<eos> You know, I can't stop thinking about last time.<eos> Well, it was a mistake.<eos> It will never happen again.<eos> - It just did.<eos> - No.<eos> No!<eos> It did not.
Now I know why my son is so taken with you.<eos> He told me you were smart and pretty, but, oh, my heavens.<eos> Oh, stop. You're... you're too kind.<eos> I'm the lucky one.<eos> He's a... He's a catch.<eos> - Yes. He is.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, I do hope you are as crazy about him as he is about you.<eos> My son deserves a wife who thinks he is the sun, the moon, and the stars.<eos> Yes, he does.
I need my hyper-memory to get it all back, and that is gone for good.<eos> Come in.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, no, don't get up.<eos> I... I just wanted to talk to you.<eos> All right. I'm all ears.<eos> So, I know that you're not into commitment, and I know that that's part of the appeal.<eos> Uh, we both love our freedom.<eos> Yes, we do.
I was worried about you.<eos> I didn't know what to think after the dinner with my parents.<eos> I'm sorry. I was, uh... I was distracted.<eos> My... my patient was in critical condition.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Couldn't have taken one night off?<eos> No, I'm a doctor.<eos> Of course... you know that.<eos> I can't take a night off.<eos> My parents don't.
You're beautiful, smart, you have a lot to offer.<eos> Why throw yourself at someone who doesn't care about you?<eos> Do you think Catherine cares about you?<eos> We're engaged.<eos> She'll never go through with it.<eos> She doesn't love you, and you know that in your heart.<eos> Step aside.<eos> Look, you want her to be someone she's not just like I want to believe that you could love me.<eos> We have the same problem, you and I.<eos> We do.
You just close this case.<eos> Yes, Captain.<eos> Jim, will you give us a minute?<eos> Captain.<eos> The answer's no.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - ...change his diapers? !<eos> I don't care!<eos> She said you had to keep me, huh?<eos> Yeah, she did.
Yes.<eos> James Gordon.<eos> How nice.<eos> Day I met you, when I was out back with your boys, what did you and Harvey talk about?<eos> Should you ask Harvey?<eos> He's your partner.<eos> I'm afraid he might lie.<eos> He might.<eos> And you think I'll tell you the truth?<eos> You just did.
Fear tells you where the edge is.<eos> Fear is a good thing.<eos> And you think I haven't told him that, do you?<eos> You came here for a reason, I imagine.<eos> Yes.<eos> Mario Pepper didn't kill your parents.<eos> He was framed... by the Police Department... and the mob, working together.<eos> We killed an innocent man.<eos> Right.<eos> - So, who did it then?
Not today.<eos> But that's going to change.<eos> Is it so, senator Lloyd?<eos> Well, America is a mighty vessel, sir.<eos> - It's not easily turned.<eos> - However...<eos> The political capital needed to effect a change of such sweeping...<eos> However, your informed opinion...<eos> - I don't recall precisely...<eos> - Of course you do.
What you don't know, you can't get nailed for.<eos> Joe.<eos> How much more you want to lose?<eos> One boss.<eos> We gonna sit here all day?<eos> Where you got to go?<eos> The head.<eos> Five espresso.<eos> Do what you need to.<eos> How you doing, boss?
And that's taking the virus longer to break the SODRAs down.<eos> But it still does in the end.<eos> I've taken this as far as I can in culture.<eos> I need to see how it reacts in living tissue.<eos> I can start animal studies to test efficacy and safety, have results in 24 hours.<eos> I'd like to bring my veterinary pathologist, Doreen Boyle, up to speed on this.<eos> I think she could be a big help.<eos> Alan, this is progress.<eos> It has to work in the rats first.<eos> And if it does?
They're dead.<eos> Top space agency officials are flying to cape Kennedy tonight to begin the official investigation into what caused the flash fire that killed the nation's first three Apollo astronauts earlier tonight.<eos> Lieutenant colonel Gus Grissom, 42; Lieutenant colonel ed white, 36; And lieutenant commander roger Chaffee, 31;<eos> I was sitting at that console right there when Grissom, Chaffee, and white were killed.<eos> I listened to them die.<eos> That evening, January 27th, a Friday, I was giving my kids hot dogs...<eos> And then somebody said there'd been an accident.<eos> So when Mike Collins finally came... To the door and I saw him, I knew.<eos> I knew already. I said, "I know, mike, but... You've got to tell me."<eos> And he did.
That the way they do it in prison?<eos> Yeah. Fight like a fucking man, ya lepre-coon.<eos> Fight like a man, huh? Fight like a man?<eos> Stop it! Stop it!<eos> - Oh, my goodness.<eos> - Come on!<eos> Stop it, stop it! Just stop it!<eos> I'm tired of this. I'm sick of it.<eos> Don't any of you have families at all that you're worried about?<eos> Well, if you don't, I do.
It's bumming me out.<eos> When was the last time you had a drink?<eos> Like five minutes ago.<eos> What about your 53 days?<eos> It's more like 40.<eos> I might've been stretching the truth a little.<eos> Besides, I've got a system.<eos> No, systems don't work. Okay?<eos> Trust me. I've seen them all.<eos> This one does.
_<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> - How is he? - Well, I don't know.<eos> They, took him to the hospital for an MRI and some other tests.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I can call you if there's news.<eos> That's if you want to know.<eos> I do.
I want to know what happened at the Quintana House.<eos> It was a freak thing.<eos> She had a stroke.<eos> The money wasn't supposed to be there.<eos> Well, um, like I told you, we had a delay.<eos> We understood you, would be able to handle the volume.<eos> And we can.<eos> Then why didn't you?<eos> That will not happen again.<eos> But it did.
You committed a crime, multiple crimes.<eos> Not murder.<eos> Take the plea.<eos> Be good. Get out early.<eos> Everybody's fucked me.<eos> If I was trying to fuck you, I wouldn't be here.<eos> He's gonna get away with it, isn't he?<eos> Yes. He is.<eos> - Take an iced tea if you have any.<eos> - We don't.
I have to go.<eos> She better be gone by the next time we talk.<eos> - You want me to brief commerce...<eos> - Sir.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> I can have a briefing ready for you in five minutes.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> I had Seth do it.<eos> - He doesn't have security clearance.<eos> - Well, he does now.
A child's home.<eos> It's my childhood home.<eos> It's in Vinci.<eos> Oh... Right.<eos> I'll ready some horses.<eos> You're not coming with me.<eos> After all the nonsense this quest of yours has put me through, how could I not?<eos> I heard you.<eos> I had faith that you still thought of me.<eos> You do.
Shut the fuck up.<eos> She's not my girlfriend.<eos> I thought you had An arrangement.<eos> She traded up.<eos> You can film her, not me.<eos> Don't touch the lens.<eos> How about I toss you and your Whole fucking rig down the hill?<eos> Sorry.<eos> She said I could shoot whatever I wanted.<eos> She did, huh?
All right.<eos> See you guys in class.<eos> Hey, waiting on somebody?<eos> Taylor. Guess she lost track of time.<eos> Uh, listen, I know you like Taylor.<eos> And I admire your taste.<eos> It's like the girl carries around her own wind machine.<eos> It's just... you do realize that she likes guys, right?<eos> So?<eos> I do, too.
Just like the Red Hawks.<eos> And like the Red Hawks, they hate race-mixing.<eos> If they thought that you and I were together, they would kill you.<eos> Just to send a message.<eos> All I wanted was to protect you from this.<eos> All of it.<eos> No.<eos> I needed to hear this.<eos> I wanted to know all this time why you kept pushing me away.<eos> Now I do.
All part of the performance, it's just not my performance you're watching.<eos> You'll be found guilty and given the federal death penalty.<eos> I'm trying to save your life.<eos> I guess I'll have to save my own life.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> My name is Bedelia Du Maurier.<eos> You're Hannibal Lecter's therapist.<eos> What's that like?<eos> I've heard so much about you, I feel I almost know you.<eos> You don't?
My testimony is based on my professional...<eos> You are smitten with the accused, Miss Bloom, and it is adorable, but not our brand of defense.<eos> And Ms. Vega will smell it on you, like you stepped in Young Adult and tracked it into the courtroom.<eos> Were you and Will Graham involved romantically?<eos> I have no romantic feelings for Will Graham.<eos> I have a professional curiosity.<eos> I like that. "Professional curiosity." It seems so...<eos> It seems so indifferent.<eos> Unless you look like you're lying when you say it.<eos> But you didn't.
Will Graham manifests publicly as an introverted personality.<eos> He would like us to believe he places on the spectrum somewhere near Asperger's and autism.<eos> Yet he also claims an empathy disorder.<eos> You choose your words very carefully, Dr. Chilton.<eos> You chose the word "claims."<eos> Will Graham has never been diagnosed.<eos> He will not allow anyone to test him.<eos> He has carefully constructed a persona to hide his real nature from the world.<eos> He wears it so well even Jack Crawford could not see past it.<eos> But you did?
This is a far more practical use for those limbs.<eos> Hard to have anything, isn't it, Dr. Lecter?<eos> Rare to get it, hard to keep it.<eos> A damn slippery life.<eos> You were determined to know the Chesapeake Ripper, Dr. Gideon.<eos> Now is your opportunity.<eos> You intend me to be my own last supper?<eos> Yes.<eos> How does one politely refuse a dish in circumstances such as these?<eos> One doesn't.
So you're okay with all this?<eos> I've learned to adapt. None of this changes the way I feel about you.<eos> It wouldn't work, Hank.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Why don't you give me a chance to prove you wrong?<eos> We'll take it slow, see what happens.<eos> You are such a special man.<eos> But I can't.<eos> Zuri, I don't have a problem with it.<eos> But I do.
You don't trust her, do you?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> That's why her FBI handlers are staying close.<eos> Can I ask why you don't trust her?<eos> No.<eos> She do something to you?<eos> "No," as in my personal life has nothing to do with this investigation.<eos> Your life includes your sister and your niece.<eos> So maybe it does.<eos> It doesn't.
It was a stupid idea from the start.<eos> What was wrong with a wedding venue?<eos> See what comes of madam's fantasies instead!<eos> How would I know your mum can't walk on flat ground, Faruk?<eos> So it's my mum's fault now?<eos> People wear heels at weddings.<eos> But dippy you just drag them into the fields in the baking sun.<eos> Why do you think we put up that hulking canopy?<eos> - The entire media took pictures!<eos> - Everyone did.
Just as I promised.<eos> All right.<eos> You're all right.<eos> Wait. I couldn't find Katrina's amulet.<eos> My God, you're parched.<eos> Drink this.<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> Lieutenant, no!<eos> She doesn't belong to you.<eos> You both do now.
I'm sorry, there must be some sort of mistake.<eos> Uh, Ms. Chang, if you look at the list, you'll see our names are on it.<eos> Added at the last minute and not approved by me.<eos> That's a red flag.<eos> Now, are you going to leave, or am I going to have to make you leave?<eos> I'm going in.<eos> Uh... excuse me, Ms. Chang, you have a clinic near Bamyan.<eos> Yes?<eos> Afghanistan?<eos> We do.
Aw, no way, forget it.<eos> What the...?<eos> Thanks a lot, fellas.<eos> Hey, Boys Town is that way.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Whoa.<eos> You got a minute?<eos> Hope you can do better than that.<eos> Just want to talk.<eos> The older ones always do.
Uh... it's good.<eos> It's... interesting.<eos> It's kind of challenging.<eos> How's it going in here?<eos> Oh, you know, it's my reward for being beaten and chained in a cave with my ex-fiancé.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Kens, you know when you... you really want something, and you get it, but somehow, it's... not the way that you wanted it at all?<eos> I...<eos> I want to be aa agent.<eos> I do.
"If you're reading this, I'm gone.<eos> Enjoy the Pinot."<eos> Now, at first, it didn't make sense to me. This isn't a Pinot.<eos> It's a Merlot.<eos> And you're smiling why?<eos> That's a Pinot.<eos> Hidden in plain sight.<eos> It was the D.O.J.'s decision, Henrietta.<eos> Well, I think that's an appropriate ending.<eos> I do, too.
Okay.<eos> Wow, okay.<eos> A little help here.<eos> Okay, let's get you a cane, maybe get you some crutches.<eos> I would settle for a shot of tequila.<eos> Definitely looks like an RPG attack.<eos> Who was onboard?<eos> Special Forces.<eos> Hard to believe anybody could've survived this.<eos> Yeah, they didn't.
No, we're not good. I haven't tested the merch yet.<eos> I haven't even seen it.<eos> I know you, Tyler Brunson.<eos> Oh, do you now?<eos> You're a regional guy sitting on too much weight.<eos> "Regional"?<eos> Now, my partner and I are global.<eos> You borrowed the cash, now you got to flip the drugs.<eos> The problem is you don't have the resources to move a thousand pounds of Krokodil fast.<eos> We do.
Me, too.<eos> Several?<eos> Such a lady. Lady is thirsty.<eos> I was thinking you're more of like a...<eos> They're quite a team, Henrietta.<eos> They're my '27 Yankees.<eos> Doesn't get any easier, does it?<eos> Sending them out each time, never knowing if they'll come back.<eos> They always come back, Owen.<eos> Until one day they don't.
He's got a lengthy rap sheet-- mostly low-level misdemeanors.<eos> Eric, I think I got eyes on our other two suspects.<eos> Coming in the west entrance. Come on.<eos> You really can't ID these guys?<eos> Sorry, cameras are just too wide.<eos> So, uh, where you from, pal?<eos> Here and there. Oh, yeah?<eos> That's outside of Albuquerque, right?<eos> Eh, it wasn't that funny.<eos> Deeks, how we doing?
I know you want to trust her.<eos> You feel like you owe it to the kid.<eos> But maybe they're not the same thing.<eos> Somebody must have got to her at the cafe.<eos> All right? She-She went right to the garage from there.<eos> We need to backtrack.<eos> Sam.<eos> What?<eos> I thought you trusted me.<eos> I do.
♪ "A" ♪<eos> ♪ "N" ♪<eos> ♪ Whoa ♪<eos> I miss you so much, Laura.<eos> You're so pretty.<eos> - [All groan] - There it is.<eos> Tom, oh, honey.<eos> I think about you every single day.<eos> Do you still think about me?<eos> No, I don't.
- It's not good.<eos> But it might be.<eos> It concerns Edwards and the procedure he described.<eos> We can learn it with Edwards' help, but it just might be what we had hoped.<eos> Bertie's more of a dreamer than is good for him.<eos> Edwards is a fraud.<eos> Well, then, he's a fraud who's been listed as a coauthor of a published paper alongside Dr. Thibaux.<eos> Dr. Algernon C. Edwards.<eos> Seems like we're gonna need this man after all.<eos> No, we don't.
What should we do with him?<eos> Drop him in the bushes on Murray Hill.<eos> Someone will find him.<eos> That really was like trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.<eos> What was the point?<eos> She'll look better.<eos> She'll always be alone.<eos> Ruined and diseased.<eos> What kind of a future does she have?<eos> Maybe more than she did.
What was the point?<eos> She'll look better.<eos> She'll always be alone.<eos> Ruined and diseased.<eos> What kind of a future does she have?<eos> Maybe more than she did.<eos> "No medicine in the world can do thee good."<eos> In the blackest darkness, even a dim light is better than no light at all.<eos> Who said that?<eos> I just did.
This is as far as they go.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I got it from here. This better be worth my time.<eos> It's worth more than that.<eos> Really?<eos> What's that?<eos> Freedom, Agent Burke.<eos> All right, stop.<eos> Look, this could be a setup. We don't know what's in there.<eos> - I do, evidence.
I just came in a little late.<eos> You really didn't have to call Brody.<eos> Don't blame me, it's my maternal instincts - I'm a slave to them.<eos> Suddenly this day has just taken a turn for the better.<eos> Hello, my name is Diane.<eos> I hope you enjoy the softer of the two sexes. Hi.<eos> I'm officer Garcia...and I do.<eos> Where were you?<eos> I thought something happened.<eos> Something did.
I thought you quit. Yeah, well...<eos> I'm no quitter.<eos> And I don't need a lecture from you.<eos> Well, I don't need a lecture from you, either.<eos> Still the same smart-mouth pain in the ass you ever were.<eos> Well, I'm no quitter.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> Not that you gave me much choice.<eos> But then, no one in this family ever did.
Meaning?<eos> Look, the blurring... it's an algorithm.<eos> Nowadays, that would be impossible to reverse, but this is old technology.<eos> As long as Gabriel has a baseline. Baseline?<eos> As long as he knows one of the faces, he can decode...<eos> un-blur the rest of them!<eos> But we don't have any faces. We might.<eos> That guy who came after you at your mother's house... he could be one of them.<eos> Do you have a picture of him?<eos> Up here, I do.
Riley was right.<eos> That's the guy who came after me at my mom's house. Yes!<eos> Okay, that should be the seed value... the... the key code for the blur. Now you should be able to use the code to try...<eos> It's working.<eos> Weatherly.<eos> All this time, it was right in front of me, and I never saw it. No one saw it.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I spoke to him this morning after they found Tetazoo.<eos> Did he tell you where he was going?<eos> Yeah. He did.
That's how you want to spend your sugar allowance?<eos> Chocolate milk!<eos> Okay.<eos> It's your choice.<eos> Slow down there, monkey.<eos> Good morning!<eos> Hi, Jana!<eos> She looks nice.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, she does.
We gotta invite her to something that Elena can't say no to.<eos> A surprise party?<eos> Seriously?<eos> I wanted a spa day.<eos> You try feeling the death of every supernatural creature who passes through you on their way to the other side.<eos> I'm not saying you don't deserve it.<eos> Besides, your birthday isn't until next week.<eos> That's what makes it a surprise.<eos> Yeah, I don't think Bonnie would want a big party for her birthday.<eos> Of course she does.
Aside from getting Damon to undo... - ...every positive decision he's ever made.<eos> - Is it such an anomaly for him to have a friend?<eos> - Well, if so, consider me honored. - Okay.<eos> We're here. Where is the antidote?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm Sloan. You met some of the Travelers when they took a bucket of your blood.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> How could I forget?<eos> So you have the antidote to this Ripper virus, correct?<eos> We do, thanks to Enzo.
Where I have to bend my morals again.<eos> Where I have to go against every single thing that I believe in, again, because I love you.<eos> - Then stop loving me.<eos> - I can't.<eos> Well, that's the problem.<eos> We don't work.<eos> I know.<eos> Then we agree.<eos> This has to end.<eos> It just did.
That someone is my man, and I ain't no streetwalker.<eos> You got that?<eos> The hell you think you're doing?<eos> He thinks I'm a street whore.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> - Tried making me an offer.<eos> Trying to fuck my girl, is that it, Paddy?<eos> Back off, spooky.<eos> You don't want to start nothing with me.<eos> The hell I don't!
We've been writing to each other for... it's got to be seven, eight months now.<eos> We'll meet at the social.<eos> I'm coming to basically try to sweep her off her feet.<eos> Do you have pictures of her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How old is she? 26.<eos> She was a little bit under my target age.<eos> This is the one from the website where she looks like Angelina Jolie.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She does.
I wanted to get something that would last hopefully as long as the relationship.<eos> So one gold rose.<eos> Hopefully it gets her this and everything will be okay.<eos> And I'll be either really happy or really sad.<eos> This is like prom for old guys.<eos> That's the way I'm looking at it, which is nice, since I never went to prom, so...<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sort of hoping to have a table off by ourselves the whole night.<eos> It will have a translator because she doesn't speak English,<eos> I don't do Russian.
Lauren?<eos> I'm Al.<eos> - How did I do?<eos> - Fine.<eos> But you know, you could stop smiling.<eos> Smiling?<eos> I'm working.<eos> Wow.<eos> Wow. I've always wanted to live in a Brownstone.<eos> - And now you do.
Gunned through a Sig Sauer 40.<eos> Looks like the kid offed himself.<eos> Ready to go, guys, in...<eos> you only needed 45 hours.<eos> You owe me three hours.<eos> We didn't even have to use your crazy plan.<eos> Who you're calling crazy?<eos> That's okay, doesn't matter.<eos> We had a nice day.<eos> Yes, we did.
- We haven't...<eos> - Some who initially were unidentified.<eos> The Supreme Court hears a patent case involving companies that are patenting human genes.<eos> No, no, guys.<eos> Take your time.<eos> ...to debate gun control.<eos> And on the lighter side of things...<eos> We have to ask ourselves if we're being gun-shy because of Genoa.<eos> I don't see anything wrong with being gun-shy because of Genoa.<eos> - I do.
And that's all I've ever wanted to do...<eos> Run a good company that makes good products.<eos> And we may have a political difference on this, but I take a lot of pride in being a job creator.<eos> Okay.<eos> You really want to argue the indisputable fact that I cut paychecks to 141,000 people?<eos> Our difference of opinion isn't political, it's religious.<eos> I'm an economist, and in my church it's your customers who are the job creators.<eos> And no one here thinks you're an asshole.<eos> - Really?<eos> - I do.
- Hey.<eos> So how's the hand?<eos> Oh, good as new.<eos> At least that's what they're telling me, so...<eos> Um, Callie's changing.<eos> Cool, thanks.<eos> Sorry about that stupid judge.<eos> How'd Jude take it?<eos> He was pretty upset, but he definitely understands why I don't want to find this Robert guy.<eos> He does?
Um, I was just... going over it, you know, before I...<eos> Hey, it's going to be ok.<eos> You may be a little out of practice, but you'll be back to 100 percent before you know it.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm ok, Mom.<eos> I just wanted to say goodnight, and I love you.<eos> And call your dad, please, he misses you.<eos> Uh, did he tell you... that Dani's moving in with him?<eos> Danni's moving in?<eos> No, he didn't.
You can't tell them that you were arguing with Cody, honey.<eos> Why, why wouldn't I tell them that?<eos> Because you... You can't tell them that you black out, Norman.<eos> They're not gonna understand that.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Just tell them that you went over to hang out or watch TV or something.<eos> No, no. He was only mad 'cause I was mad.<eos> He yelled 'cause I was yelling, and Cody came between us, and he hit her.<eos> Well, make sure you tell them that.<eos> I did.
ls Norman all right?<eos> Norman isn't even near all right.<eos> He's very upset. He's worried.<eos> He doesn't know what's going on.<eos> What they're doing here, Norma, it's just standard procedure.<eos> Okay, well, when can we go home?<eos> When they've got all the facts down.<eos> You're a lawyer.<eos> Do you know how all this works?<eos> I do.
What about your kin?<eos> Them Florida Crowes are bad news.<eos> I take it you're here because my good friend Judge Bishop has Ava's case.<eos> How much?<eos> $300,000.<eos> It won't happen.<eos> You killed him.<eos> - I didn't mean to do nothing wrong!<eos> - But you did. - Yeah, but I didn't mean to.<eos> - But you did!
Yeah, well, till that happens, I want these cuffs off and you people out of my house.<eos> Actually, according to this piece of paper, it's our house now.<eos> You got any idea what that thing is worth?<eos> What, like, 100 bucks?<eos> That's a third-model Colt Dragoon used by Confederate general, William Mahone.<eos> So more than 100?<eos> Probably more than your annual salary.<eos> Though I have a car stereo probably costs more than you make, so that ain't sayin' much.<eos> That's a lot of money for a gun that probably doesn't shoot.<eos> The hell it doesn't.
You just never chose to take it.<eos> All right, let's get down to business.<eos> Fishscale profits are up.<eos> But with the russians refusing to do business with us, We're gonna be a little short on the rent this month For the Metas.<eos> Why are the russians refusing?<eos> They were gonna be our biggest distributor.<eos> There's been a dispute.<eos> What kind - Of dispute?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.
Your life.<eos> Follow me, and I'll turn you both into ash.<eos> Forget her.<eos> We'll get her later.<eos> Marcel, all we have is the element of surprise, and we have lost it.<eos> If we don't leave now, there will be no one to save us.<eos> I already failed Davina once.<eos> I'm not leaving her behind.<eos> Not sure that helps.<eos> Not sure it doesn't.
Sorry.<eos> You can smile.<eos> You're alive.<eos> I get it.<eos> That's not it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tyreese could have made it, Sasha.<eos> We don't know if anybody got out.<eos> No.<eos> We do.
If you make it that way, and that's what it seems like we're doing.<eos> And I'm down with that.<eos> Maggie.<eos> Maggie!<eos> You should go.<eos> - Maggie, stop.<eos> - Maggie.<eos> Maggie.<eos> I have to know if he's in there.<eos> Fine, but we do it together.
He's a big fan of yours.<eos> I met Tara on the road.<eos> Couldn't have made it here without her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> When she heard what I was doing, she said she had to help me.<eos> She's just that kind of person.<eos> What's up?<eos> He just said that he knows what caused the outbreak.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He does.
One of his most effective operatives.<eos> For whatever reason, this individual wanted out of Alpha Five, Victor forced her to stay.<eos> A few months later,<eos> Victor and his team disappeared in that bogus plane crash.<eos> "Believe me, I am not afraid of Victor."<eos> Thank you, Murray.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Would you mind...<eos> - Detective, I believed we agreed, ICA would take the lead in this case.<eos> Yes, we did.
Come join us.<eos> I found this in your trash.<eos> And this is...<eos> The guy you always talking about?<eos> Yeah, I know something about loving people who aren't smart enough to wanna be loved back.<eos> But I learned a secret that I can tell you.<eos> They don't deserve it.<eos> He's ruined this day for me forever.<eos> Nobody knows that we're not together.<eos> Yeah, but you do.
I found this in your trash.<eos> And this is...<eos> The guy you always talking about?<eos> Yeah, I know something about loving people who aren't smart enough to wanna be loved back.<eos> But I learned a secret that I can tell you.<eos> They don't deserve it.<eos> He's ruined this day for me forever.<eos> Nobody knows that we're not together.<eos> Yeah, but you do.<eos> - I do.
You know I won't do that.<eos> No. It's bad luck.<eos> Cut it out.<eos> We gotta drive more!<eos> Pull over right here.<eos> You're all hot from the job?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't wanna fuck now.<eos> I wanna rob that bank.<eos> - We just did one.
And what happens in the meantime?<eos> By remaining silent, you let this... clearly dangerous woman stay here.<eos> How long before she hurts someone else?<eos> One of your girls?<eos> You eat and I sing like a canary, huh?<eos> We abandon our principles together.<eos> You found her out by the greenhouse?<eos> What was she doing out there?<eos> I do not remember taking Lady Locksley out there.<eos> I do not!
I'm trying to reach him, he lost control.<eos> He nearly killed somebody, which I couldn't let happen.<eos> - And in the process...<eos> - Turner got away.<eos> - What was he there to steal, Merlyn's art?<eos> - Something much more dangerous.<eos> It's a prototype earthquake machine.<eos> - Holy God.<eos> - Why would Turner want to destroy the city?<eos> He doesn't.
Step into my office.<eos> This is about the campaign, right?<eos> It's really awesome you're thinking of doing this.<eos> You said something that stayed with me.<eos> The idea that there could be voters out there... that wouldn't dismiss me out of hand.<eos> Well, you did run a multi-billion dollar company.<eos> Yes, and an undertaking that destroyed the city.<eos> People will get over that.<eos> What makes you so certain?<eos> Because I did.
What changed your mind?<eos> - Thea.<eos> - Mm. She reminded me that I still owe this city.<eos> And I want to be remembered as something more than Malcolm Merlyn's pawn.<eos> As you should.<eos> But you know there was another reason for my reticence.<eos> You're afraid people will learn that Robert wasn't her biological father.<eos> I managed to get through a criminal trial... without the truth coming out, but political campaigns tend to be a bit more adept... at extracting skeletons from closets.<eos> But no one else knows?<eos> Someone does.
I can explain that.<eos> Every person that stands where you're standing now says the same thing.<eos> - The DUI, the paranoia about Blood... you looking like hell.<eos> - You got a problem, Laurel.<eos> It's addiction.<eos> It runs in our family.<eos> You can't pin it on Sebastian Blood.<eos> Daddy, please, you have to believe me.<eos> Please.<eos> Please. I don't, baby.
- Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> I can't believe it. Look at you.<eos> Because Starling City is our city.<eos> Starting today, we're going to take it back.<eos> I know we need to talk.<eos> You need to listen.<eos> For the past year, I've stood by your side. And I've fought... because I wanted to believe that you weren't this... monster.<eos> - And I needed to believe I still had a mother.<eos> - You do.
Leave everyone behind.<eos> I'd go anywhere you told me to.<eos> I had the money, Junia.<eos> I tried.<eos> I try every day to get there.<eos> But I've made some mistakes.<eos> What sort of mistakes?<eos> I took money from my employer.<eos> I invested it with a Wall Street man that said it couldn't lose.<eos> Then it did.
Everything, even the words we put on paper must be above and beyond expectation.<eos> This is gonna make you, Bertie.<eos> Now, your father will have a hard time arguing with that.<eos> Yes, he will.<eos> Is this the final draft before we print?<eos> Well, I don't see how we can make that any better.<eos> I'm due back on the ward.<eos> Just take your time.<eos> Now, the Roosevelts' hospital's got their hands on some of the drug.<eos> But the Hospital for the Ruptured and Crippled does, too, thanks to Mr. Frick.
Yours must have been fascinating... with the Indians.<eos> They're so mysterious, so... Natural.<eos> Natural?<eos> "Unnatural," I'd say.<eos> Soulless savages.<eos> I assure you, ma'am, the Indians do have souls, if any of us do.<eos> "If"?<eos> And what about witches?<eos> Do they have souls, too?<eos> They do.
I'm calling him.<eos> You think that's a good idea?<eos> That's weird.<eos> No reception.<eos> I got nothing, either.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Tom, you got a cell?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Have a signal?<eos> No, I don't.
She does?<eos> How can you tell?<eos> I can tell.<eos> Oh. Oh, you think...<eos> You think she knows more than she's saying.<eos> That's--that's why you asked her out.<eos> No.<eos> I asked her out 'cause she's just my type.<eos> She say yes?<eos> She did.
Because he didn't.<eos> Oh, yes, he did.<eos> And he searched the place until he found your safe.<eos> Safe.<eos> Uh-huh, and he opened it, and he stole your little black book of names.<eos> Jason, what are they talking about?<eos> Uh, Mr. Kern here has been bribing residents and city officials to keep them from testifying against your company.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> All right, I don't have a black book, and even if I did, how did Becker get into my safe without a combination?<eos> Well, he did.
I am, as I said, in fear for my life.<eos> Think about what you're doing.<eos> These are people I care a lot about.<eos> Yes or no -- a warrant has been issued for my arrest, hasn't it?<eos> How did you know about that?<eos> So one has.<eos> I call that an execution order, a license to shoot me down in the street like a dog.<eos> So I'm here to prove my innocence beyond any shadow of a doubt.<eos> Do you have any knowledge as to what's happened to Grace Van Pelt?<eos> I don't.
Haibach's revenge plan was disrupted by Grace when she broke his phone hacks up.<eos> He realized then that it was only a matter of time before we tracked him down.<eos> This is him making the best of the situation.<eos> Then why did he come here?<eos> To gloat and watch us squirm.<eos> And he plans to make us let him go when he's done.<eos> We won't let him get away with it.<eos> I wonder if you'd mind telling us where you've been for the last 24 hours.<eos> Do you own an S.U.V. -- uh, maybe gray?<eos> No, I don't.
Get you something warm.<eos> Okay. Thanks.<eos> Okay, now, mind those steps, 'cause those are slippery.<eos> Hey, shut the door behind you. Don't let the heat out.<eos> Phone's in the bedroom. I'll go get it.<eos> No electricity, huh?<eos> Oh, Lord. Bless your heart.<eos> No. The poles don't come out this far.<eos> Then how do you have a phone?<eos> I don't.
Clean shot to the back of the head, execution-style.<eos> Could be Juarez cartel.<eos> The local police are exploring that angle right now. I'm telling you guys, the commander and I have been through all of this.<eos> Let's just save a little time, shall we?<eos> Hmm?<eos> The sandals.<eos> And this...<eos> Tattoo.<eos> It looks like an insignia. So, she has a tattoo and likes casual clothing.<eos> But she doesn't.
Congratulations.<eos> For what?<eos> Luis Cruz is dead.<eos> Well, thank you for telling me.<eos> Doesn't feel the way you thought it would, does it?<eos> No.<eos> No, I thought I'd feel avenged, or at least relieved.<eos> Instead it's just sad.<eos> And it doesn't bring my wife back.<eos> It doesn't.
And that's what the Attorney General thinks happened.<eos> Now he's asking for our help.<eos> Fortunately, the same jurors are impaneled for another month.<eos> And, under the pretense of a murder investigation, I will face them and determine which ones were bribed.<eos> Or intimidated.<eos> I-I can't believe you got a prosecutor to take part in the con.<eos> It's not a con.<eos> It's a sting.<eos> Sting. The prosecutor doesn't know that this is not real.<eos> The Attorney General does.
Objection.<eos> You said "murder".<eos> Thomas McAllister may have shot and strangled himself.<eos> There are no objections here, Mr. Jane, no judge, just a friendly inquiry.<eos> But I take your point.<eos> Do you recall the day of McAllister's death?<eos> I do... big day.<eos> I had been chasing the man for eight years.<eos> Any of you know what it's like to be driven by a moral imperative?<eos> You do.
T-that should definitely be on the record.<eos> Mr. Jane, this is not a forum for you to chat with the jurors.<eos> Well, it should be.<eos> Mr. Jane.<eos> They just seem like good, honest, friendly people, all of them except that gentleman on the end there.<eos> You know, you really should mend things with your son.<eos> All this anger, this bitterness, this resentment that you're bottling, it's ruining both your lives.<eos> Stop now.<eos> You do not dictate the agenda here.<eos> Who does?
Oh! Oh, God. I am so sorry.<eos> Oh. Please excuse me.<eos> No problem.<eos> No problem. It's your arms.<eos> They're so sparkly.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You noticed my glitter lotion? Yeah.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> It's on me, too.<eos> At least somebody did.
Who? Leanne and some guy?<eos> Yeah, but it wasn't like that.<eos> Leanne wasn't a party girl.<eos> I know a lot of girls who get taken all over.<eos> This was professional.<eos> She booked a modeling gig.<eos> And they left four days ago?<eos> Yeah. Some model scout set it up.<eos> Did you meet this guy -- the model scout?<eos> No, I didn't.
I don't know anything about golf.<eos> Okay. Cool.<eos> What's this about?<eos> All security told me was some guys from the FBI wanted to talk.<eos> I got a massage in 15. Oh.<eos> Well, we found something that belongs to you.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> Over at the Fishing Camp.<eos> You know it, don't you?<eos> Sure you do.
I was just a stupid kid.<eos> Why didn't you say anything about this then?<eos> That would have made everything all right.<eos> I mean, she was 15.<eos> I was 18.<eos> You do the math.<eos> Well, for what it's worth, we talked to Christie, and she always thought you were innocent.<eos> She did?<eos> She said that?<eos> Yeah, she did.
It's a date.<eos> It's a full moon tomorrow night.<eos> You just cracked the case.<eos> We cracked it.<eos> If you asked nicely, I would bet that Abbott will let you go back to Washington right now.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I wouldn't miss this for the world.<eos> I'm gonna be on the Islamorada tomorrow night.<eos> I did it.<eos> You did it.
At gunpoint, actually.<eos> Long story long, he identified the leak.<eos> Who the hell is Newton Phillips?<eos> Newton.<eos> So it's finished?<eos> If you had come to me, I could have helped you.<eos> We could have avoided all of this.<eos> But now we can't.<eos> They threatened my family.<eos> Of course they did.
Occasional calisthenics.<eos> So the defense fund, where do we stand?<eos> Well, we've put together an amazing team, but it's expensive.<eos> He's been holed up in that embassy for what, two years?<eos> It could go on forever and cost a fortune.<eos> I'm practically bankrolling the entire defense fund as it is.<eos> For that, I need best efforts.<eos> Surely there's some stone you've left unturned.<eos> We have a man inside a company that shreds classified documents.<eos> Mostly private firms that do business with the government.
Family, friends, anybody.<eos> I didn't tell anybody.<eos> I need the name of your husband's lawyer.<eos> Clark Schroeder, why?<eos> Are you calling him?<eos> Please, tell me you can...<eos> You broke an immunity agreement, which means you're going to jail unless you start talking about the Alchemist.<eos> Got a cigarette?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
That and the Betamax and the BlackBerry.<eos> I don't understand the reference.<eos> Nobody wants it.<eos> Hydro is supposed to be a sleep aid but it's crazy powerful, too powerful.<eos> The half-life's, like, a hundred hours.<eos> So?<eos> So people need to get up in the morning.<eos> Where can I get it?<eos> You don't want it.<eos> I do.
What evidence did he have?<eos> I wanna know everything.<eos> There's Madeline.<eos> Think she beat us to it?<eos> Stay on task.<eos> We have two minutes to access the security door.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Lizzy, I know this must be very difficult for you, but we can't both lead.<eos> How did you know about Omaha?<eos> I didn't.
What are they doing?<eos> Why are they moving back?<eos> They wanna talk.<eos> Ruth, this is not a tactic.<eos> I'm not trying to negotiate.<eos> Yes, new information on the Rifkin case.<eos> Someone with high-level access is en route.<eos> Of course... a woman.<eos> If you came to advocate on behalf of Agent Cooper...<eos> I didn't.
_<eos> _<eos> Okay.<eos> Done.<eos> See?<eos> Do you find all those little fingerprints on the glass distracting, or does that sort of thing not bother you?<eos> Stop!<eos> Ivan!<eos> You think he bought it?<eos> Hell, I did.
You once said the reason you were here was because of my father.<eos> What's this about, Lizzy?<eos> Did the two of you know each other?<eos> Don't tell me you were friends.<eos> You don't have friends.<eos> I knew your father and he knew me.<eos> Is that why you were in his hospital room the day he died?<eos> I talked to you on the phone that day.<eos> You never mentioned you were there.<eos> No, I didn't.
Still seems like a bit of a reach.<eos> Reddington was right about one thing.<eos> Whatever this Berlin is planning, Blankenship was vital to it.<eos> And with him gone, Berlin's gonna need a replacement.<eos> Mr. Klein, you are dying.<eos> I have infected you with the Cullen virus.<eos> It is the single deadliest pathogen in existence.<eos> Within a matter of hours, your temperature will spike, rashes will spread, you will experience blackouts, bleeding, and within 24 hours, you will be dead.<eos> Medical science has no known cure.<eos> But I do.
But bigger stuff, I can't really tell when it's gonna happen.<eos> - Well, that sucks.<eos> - It's like hiccups.<eos> It starts and then it stops.<eos> And it's usually when I'm mad.<eos> Why do you want to know so bad?<eos> Well, 'cause last I checked we were dead-broke and we don't have a place to stay, so I was thinking maybe your little spooky routine might be able to hustle us up some options.<eos> You want to do something wrong.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - Yes, you do.
It's over.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> Frankie, we know you did.<eos> First Bobby Hammond in Phoenix.<eos> Then Ron Hurd... you caught him at the vfw.<eos> I didn't even know they were dead.<eos> - You followed him home.<eos> - To talk!<eos> But when you didn't like what he said, you killed him.<eos> No, I did not.
We have much to celebrate. And know that you and your friends are welcome in our kingdom.<eos> If you need anything, we're at your service.<eos> Thank you, but all we need is horses.<eos> We have our own kingdom, our own castle.<eos> Our castle was destroyed in the curse.<eos> Well-played, Your Majesty.<eos> You laid waste to everything.<eos> Not everything.<eos> Her castle still stands.<eos> Of course it does.
know that this is right?<eos> Emma, speaking for myself... I've known this was right since the moment you walked into my furniture shop.<eos> Why do you think your order was ready two weeks early?<eos> Your commitment to excellence?<eos> I couldn't wait to ask you out.<eos> It seemed the most non-stalkery way to speed things up.<eos> I do love that end table.<eos> That's a start.<eos> I do love you. You know that, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Right now it might be causing you pain, but I promise you, it will let you feel something else soon enough.<eos> What's that?<eos> The one thing Henry always wanted you to find happiness.<eos> I can't be happy without him.<eos> Find a way... for Henry.<eos> Now... let's get back to our castle.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> There was something there, in that bush.<eos> There's nothing here, unless it flew away.<eos> It did!
Admissions.<eos> I'm Yvonne.<eos> What you got there?<eos> Well, I have just discovered an amazing new product, Yvonne.<eos> Cal-O-Metric for weight loss, specially designed for women.<eos> For example, do you know, uh, how it feels when you're still carrying that extra baby weight?<eos> I've had two myself and, darn it, if it isn't hard to fit back into your favourite...<eos> I didn't have a baby.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Um, I did, and...
When he gets some distance.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You know, it is a rare man that could understand how a woman could choose work over love.<eos> Is that what you told him?<eos> Why you ended it?<eos> It was the truth.<eos> I assumed you were listening.<eos> Bill.<eos> We could have an affair.<eos> Millions of people do.
Is that what you told him?<eos> Why you ended it?<eos> It was the truth.<eos> I assumed you were listening.<eos> Bill.<eos> We could have an affair.<eos> Millions of people do.<eos> But an affair, it is a fairly pedestrian thing.<eos> And the story always ends the same.<eos> Does it?
I have no clue either, so you'll have to ask him.<eos> Well, I will, 'cause I'm the one dropping fire on all these people.<eos> Yeah, well, I know what that's like.<eos> What?<eos> Checking names off a kill list for a living.<eos> It's a job.<eos> Doesn't bother you?<eos> What about when it goes wrong?<eos> Doesn't happen that often.<eos> But it did this time.
With pride, he distracted me into turning my back on my flock, into abandoning the innocent unborn.<eos> I was distracted, and I let the devil inside of me, and he used my hand as a vessel of murder, a vessel of sin.<eos> - Sir, please.<eos> - It's all right, sweetheart.<eos> I work here. Since we're neighbors now, I thought I'd stroll down the hall and say hi.<eos> I'm calling security.<eos> There's no electioneering in the White House.<eos> Special assistant to the Vice President.<eos> Anyway, nobody follows that rule.<eos> We do.
I thought you said you were dropping this?<eos> I tried the dark side. Turns out you were right.<eos> Didn't suit me.<eos> This whole time, you've been standing up on that podium, playing the good soldier.<eos> My husband's a monster, David.<eos> He's brilliant and ego-maniacal and has done more to thwart the rule of law than you and I will probably ever know.<eos> He's a monster.<eos> And he's powerful.<eos> And he thinks he doesn't have a weakness.<eos> But he does.
All our britches are moist.<eos> Y'all let me pick the energy secretary...<eos> Someone with an open mind about drilling in that gas station they call the north pole...<eos> I'll cut you a check that'll choke a damn herd.<eos> We can live with that, can't we?<eos> Sally? Yes.<eos> Andrew Nichols, lieutenant governor of California for both Grant terms, went on to win the governorship for two terms after that.<eos> Popular centrist.<eos> We vetted him ourselves, Liv. Didn't find any dirt.<eos> Well, Carla Steele did.
What would Olivia Pope do?<eos> Someone really needs to put that on a bracelet.<eos> Or, just a thought, you could do nothing.<eos> I just wish she was working with me on this if only so I know she's not working against me.<eos> Liv's not working against you.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> 'Cause part of me thinks this is some kind of six-chess-moves-ahead, psychological-warfare kind of thing where she's actually lying in wait somewhere to stop me from experiencing professional satisfaction at the last possible second...<eos> You know, if past experience holds.<eos> She doesn't want to stop you.<eos> I do.
Huck.<eos> - You're a mark.<eos> - What? Your father's treating you like a mark.<eos> Did he make you a promise, Liv?<eos> He promised you something.<eos> That means - he's gonna take something.<eos> That is what they do.<eos> That is what we do.<eos> - He doesn't want anything.<eos> - Of course he does.
We are still waiting for a statement from the White House as to his condition.<eos> Despite the exhaustive efforts of a world-class medical team,<eos> Fitzgerald Thomas Grant IV passed away at 8:46 P.M. from bacterial meningitis.<eos> He was surrounded by President Grant, the first lady, his sister, Karen...<eos> We're going to win the election now.<eos> They lost their child.<eos> America will rally behind them.<eos> We're going to win.<eos> - I hadn't really thought about it.<eos> - I did.
- Gone?<eos> - Gone. - Gone where?<eos> Gone to the White House?<eos> Gone home?<eos> Gone gone.<eos> She left, Harrison.<eos> You need to stop her. Liv.<eos> I know it's your plane and all, I know she wanted to go.<eos> But this town needs her.<eos> We all do.
Dude, shut the fuck up for a second.<eos> You feeling anything?<eos> Yo, why ain't this shit kicked in yet?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Does a body good.<eos> - Dr. Pryce? - Yes.<eos> Will you sign your book for me?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> - Uh, how do you know my work?<eos> - I don't.
That's the closest they'll get for a while.<eos> Jonas.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> You're glad?<eos> It's been such a long time.<eos> Yeah, I suppose it has been.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I'm gonna save your life.<eos> I don't want to kill you, Jonas.<eos> Widener does.
I hid the flight recorder in here.<eos> So... where is it?<eos> Looking for this?<eos> I heard you were making a big deal about this little thing.<eos> So I plugged into it.<eos> What I saw was very interesting.<eos> I imagine you don't want this landing in the wrong hands.<eos> This is indisputable proof you are every bit the snake we think you are.<eos> Vega, this does not concern you.<eos> Oh, but it does.
And then he told me that he loved me.<eos> And I knew...<eos> I just knew that he was talking about Jake.<eos> [Door opens] Well, Gordon...<eos> You've been a busy boy. [Clears throat]<eos> You broke Jake's windshield.<eos> Then you stabbed him.<eos> Then there's this.<eos> Want to tell me why you murdered Jake Daly?<eos> - I didn't.
You could live there on, like, a dollar a day.<eos> What was that shit?<eos> I didn't sign up for that shit.<eos> That's what terrorists do.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Plant a second bomb, blow up soldiers showing up for the first bomb.<eos> Since when did we become Hamas?<eos> "Approved by the administration."<eos> They give Nobel Peace Prizes for this now?<eos> They sure do.
- Mr. Feng is currently in Dubai.<eos> - I know.<eos> He's fleeing corruption charges.<eos> Not the first time he's been accused.<eos> And your question?<eos> I know he laundered the money, Mr. Vice President.<eos> It's just a matter of time before I have the proof to substantiate that.<eos> So my question, which I am asking again, is whether you knew.<eos> And I will repeat my answer.<eos> I did not.
No.<eos> They'll go after his family.<eos> That's the Metas' playbook.<eos> Hit the Acostas where it hurts.<eos> Good. Let the wolves eat the wolves.<eos> Exactly.<eos> - I'll let you know if I hear anything.<eos> - All right, thanks, Warren.<eos> Some of the Acostas' kids, wife, they don't deserve to get caught up in this.<eos> The hell they don't.
- I won't quit.<eos> Of course you'll quit! You know why?<eos> Because quitting is all you know!<eos> - I'll do better.<eos> - It's too late.<eos> - You can't make me leave.<eos> - You never wanted any of this. You know why?<eos> Because music means nothing to you.<eos> You need to really want this.<eos> I do.
I'm not going to comment on that, because I don't know these numbers.<eos> So don't quote me on this but that's cow farts.<eos> It think that is what that is.<eos> I think that's cow fart.<eos> Well, that's part of the story.<eos> Methane production from cows and other livestock flatulence is a major contributor.<eos> But mostly it is due to deforestation and their waste Which exceeds 130 times more than the waste of all humans.<eos> Almost all without the benefit any waste treatment.<eos> The NRDC absolutely has a big food programme.<eos> In fact, every year, we do the "Going Green Awards"
Ike was fancy.<eos> He only ate peanuts.<eos> Yeah, well, peanuts are natural.<eos> Who the fuck knows what they put in a Corn Nut?<eos> So the chart says that you've been in an accident.<eos> Leg fell asleep.<eos> Foot slipped off the brake.<eos> But then again, you and me,<eos> - we never knew when to stop, right?<eos> - He didn't?
- Yeah? Yeah.<eos> Sure, I was.<eos> It's just...<eos> Did you do something?<eos> Or something?<eos> Well, it's nothing illegal, no.<eos> No, no, I mean like, like something bad.<eos> Maybe.<eos> So, I didn't get to talk to Callie last night, and I know that yesterday was kind of... weird, what happened and everything, and I just, you know, wanted to make sure you're cool.<eos> No, you don't.
I just...<eos> I can't believe that the Warehouse almost moved.<eos> We've been here for five years, you know?<eos> It feels like home.<eos> Try 40 years. Little piece of advice, take it one snag at a time.<eos> Something I've learned on this job.<eos> Because you never know when things are gonna...<eos> Change.<eos> - Artie, I thought we stopped it.<eos> - We did.
I'm sorry.<eos> Matthew.<eos> Wait.<eos> What is this delicious meat?<eos> It is an Earth vegetable.<eos> It is called eggplant.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> It tastes almost like a wing-slug.<eos> Does it also scream when it's boiled?<eos> No It does not.
I'm, um...<eos> Sorry.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - I said I was...<eos> Sorry. Sorry!<eos> Okay?<eos> Sorry!<eos> I thought I had my anger under control.<eos> Turns out I didn't.<eos> But now I do, seriously.
- I don't know, master splinter.<eos> This doesn't seem fair.<eos> - I assure you, it isn't.<eos> - Oh, man.<eos> - A swing and a miss.<eos> - Blind fighting is more than honing your other senses.<eos> It is about perception<eos> And giving the illusion of control.<eos> - You may think you have the upper hand In the situation, but...<eos> You do not.
We're gonna talk about that later.<eos> Fall!<eos> - [screams] [grunts]<eos> No. I will not let you escape this time.<eos> - Hurry!<eos> Everyone, run!<eos> We'll lock the door!<eos> You guys get everyone to safety.<eos> We got this covered.<eos> - You always do.
I love a good wedding.<eos> To the bride and groom.<eos> - Come on, you guys.<eos> - You'll get your turn.<eos> I want him to show us how he does it.<eos> Just wait till the song's over.<eos> It's over.<eos> Come on, Max, show us how you do it.<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Ops and Sciences have differences, but both have to be careful about what we call "bad seeds."<eos> People want to use the tools we give them...<eos> "Bad seed" isn't a S.H.I.E.L.D. term, Ward.<eos> Just a term.<eos> I know you've already questioned the victim, but I have a few questions I'd like to ask him myself.<eos> I'll arrange for you to talk to Seth Dormer when he's out of class.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get Agents Fitz and Simmons settled into the lecture hall.<eos> Wow. Look at them. The popular kids.<eos> Who knew?<eos> I did.
You have no idea how powerful this thing could be.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm sorry, that was awesome.<eos> It's true what the other guys say, you are the smartest person to come through here.<eos> Is that what they say?<eos> Yeah. Well, Simmons is probably smarter, technically, but that's because she likes homework more than life itself.<eos> Nice to have someone to talk shop with all the time.<eos> Or to just plain talk to.<eos> You know... I didn't like it here at the Academy, at first.<eos> - You didn't?
We did it.<eos> It worked!<eos> I did it.<eos> The ice stopped.<eos> So it's ending?<eos> No. It's just beginning.<eos> We're in the eye of the storm.<eos> Storm?<eos> The crystalline nucleation should only create ice...<eos> It did.
In most cities, entire power grids are down, making communication next to impossible.<eos> People are asking, "Where is the government?"<eos> The virus has no treatment, no vaccine.<eos> - So this whole weapons test--<eos> - It was all just a cover.<eos> And EMCON Alpha-- Keep us in the dark about what was going on at home.<eos> There's an unmanned refueling station off the coast of France.<eos> If we operate at trail shaft, we should just make it.<eos> How do we know they have enough fuel to get us across the Atlantic?<eos> We don't.
Is my mother.<eos> My daughter and I, we're... we're terrified of each other.<eos> She starts screaming as soon as I get close to her.<eos> So I panic and head for the hills.<eos> I don't... I don't know how to...<eos> These things will settle down soon enough.<eos> It just... It takes some time.<eos> Look, I know you didn't sign up for any of this, but you need to know how grateful I am.<eos> We are.<eos> I don't...
Yeah. Unidentified polyps.<eos> Jennifer was the first to show symptoms, six months before Katja Obinger.<eos> We have hours of these tapes.<eos> Is she all right?<eos> She died.<eos> Three days ago.<eos> - I'm sleeping here tonight.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Me, too! Felix already called it.<eos> No, he didn't.
What's that mean?<eos> Mommy!<eos> Mommy!<eos> Kira!<eos> She's fine.<eos> Just get in the car and she'll say that way.<eos> Don't...<eos> Don't hurt her. Get back in the house, Cal!<eos> He's got nothing to do with this.<eos> - Yeah, he does now.
Hmm. Oh, yeah, that confirms it.<eos> Chicago cops cannot make a good cup of coffee either.<eos> Here.<eos> Thanks for helping us work this case.<eos> Of course.<eos> They're tough... especially when the victims are kids, but, you know, at least Vanessa's alive.<eos> It just doesn't make any sense.<eos> So you want the good guys to win.<eos> I want the bad guys to get what's coming to them.<eos> Well, sometimes they do.
Oh, hi!<eos> I, uh... just booked a room at a hotel, and, um, cab's on its way.<eos> So, it's all good.<eos> I can't thank you enough for letting me stay here while this all gets sorted out. Um...<eos> I'll come get the rest of my stuff when my car's ready, if that's okay?<eos> - And, um, I'll look you up if I ever become a rich and famous author and start collecting art.<eos> - Miranda... - Yeah?<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> You have nowhere to go.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I don't even wish I could.<eos> People came in and killed our friends.<eos> And I feel sorry for them.<eos> Why?<eos> Because they probably weren't like that before.<eos> Sooner or later you're gonna have to do it.<eos> You'll have to do it or you'll die.<eos> So you're gonna change the way you think about it.<eos> You have to change.<eos> Everyone does now.
Damn it.<eos> Isn't that good?<eos> No.<eos> It means they're gonna spike the road.<eos> Air 18 to all units, be advised, suspect's vehicle is approaching the spike point.<eos> He just dodged the spikes.<eos> He's got to have a police scanner.<eos> Okay, Tio, we're armed.<eos> Ready to fire at the choppers.<eos> All right, Jesse, do it.
Every single day of my life.<eos> I figured out what I wanted to do and I'm doing it.<eos> - It's a good thing.<eos> - But on who's dime?<eos> You're helping Tom with med school.<eos> - You helped Anna with law school.<eos> - Sweetheart... those are real careers.<eos> I just don't want you to limit your choices.<eos> - You want to make my choices.<eos> - No I don't.
- I'm Jenny.<eos> - It's really nice to meet you.<eos> - Well...<eos> - Yeah, um.<eos> I think I deserve a glass of wine after all that, don't you.<eos> - Merlot?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Does everyone have a glass?<eos> - [Anna]Yes we do.
- I hate it too.<eos> But we have to keep the important things in our lives going... we have to try or we're going to go crazy.<eos> I know, I know John.<eos> I am sorry but... I don't know what I would have been like at a dinner party.<eos> I might not be able to remember names... or answer simple questions... never mind get through an anectdote.<eos> I think you're doing great recently.<eos> Relative to what?<eos> I wish I had cancer.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
DOUBT, A PARABLE BY JOHN PATRICK SHANLEY<eos> TONY KUSHNER ANGELS IN AMERICA<eos> BECKET THE HONOUR OF GOD<eos> NOTE BOOK LYDIA<eos> [Alice] What I liked about it was how, how... How big, how wide the "scape"... of it was. Yeah the "scope" of it.<eos> The "scope".<eos> That's the word I got this morning.<eos> It's unbelievable to me that you guys never worked through that.<eos> You must have known... you must have known somebody that died from AIDS, right?<eos> Oh yeah, honey, everybody did.
- Lean on me.<eos> - Uh huh.<eos> [John] Hold on.<eos> Well there she is.<eos> - What's the matter with her?<eos> Is she?<eos> - She just delivered the baby, hon.<eos> Hi.<eos> You had your baby.<eos> Yes I did.
You're a better man than I am.<eos> Dad are you okay?<eos> It's getting pretty cold, huh?<eos> Wanna head home?<eos> C'mon let's do it.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> [Elena] How was your walk?<eos> I don't think I know you.<eos> - Yes you do.
♪ Yeah, boy ♪<eos> ♪ Save me ♪<eos> ♪ Whoo, ohh, save me ♪♪<eos> The topic for discussion this evening is a dialogue on women's liberation.<eos> Mr. Mailer.<eos> Let's really get hip about this little matter and recognize that the whole question of women's liberation is the deepest question that faces us, and we're going to go right into the center of it.<eos> Let me introduce first Ms. Jacqueline Ceballos, president of the New York Chapter of NOW, the National Organization for Women.<eos> Ms. Ceballos.<eos> I represent that large middle-class group of women who could have all the comforts and conveniences of life.<eos> In fact, I did.
In the Bay Area, poetry was a very big part of our cultural life.<eos> I think on the West Coast we were accustomed to thinking that skits and songs and poems were all part of a movement.<eos> We had the wonderful precedent of the Beat movement.<eos> Sometimes a thousand people would show up for a poetry reading.<eos> It was a fantastic experience, both to be part of the audience and also to read.<eos> Alta is gonna read first.<eos> "I never saw a man in a negligee.<eos> Two times I wore special fucky gowns.<eos> You know the type... one look and he turns off the football game.<eos> But they never do.
Not since the suffragettes fought for the right to vote has an issue been more critical to women than abortion.<eos> Separate the church and state!<eos> Somewhere around 1970<eos> I went to an abortion rights rally in San Francisco, and it was a sea of white women... very few women of color.<eos> And someone grabbed a bullhorn and asked for the African-American women who were there to gather under a tree.<eos> A society that cares about all people.<eos> And we decided that we would form a group called Black Sisters United.<eos> I was very glad that, you know, somebody called African-American women together and said,<eos> "You know, maybe we have something to talk about that might be a tiny bit different from what's coming from the stage."<eos> And indeed we did.
Unless you want me to walk Morgan through Ultra's front door.<eos> Not here to negotiate.<eos> If you want your girlfriend to stay alive, you don't have a choice.<eos> Well, we've said our goodbyes.<eos> What about you and Stephen?<eos> I'll be sure to pass yours along.<eos> I'm not gonna let you hurt them.<eos> You know what your problem is?<eos> You think your adversaries have the same weaknesses as you.<eos> We don't.
Yeah, I'm positive.<eos> One, you told me not to tell anyone.<eos> And two, I don't want to sound like a crazy person.<eos> Did anybody suspicious approach you?<eos> Uh, guys in suits?<eos> Stephen, do you want to tell me what's going on?<eos> Nothing, I'm... I'm just...<eos> Being paranoid.<eos> - You can trust me.<eos> - And I do.
True enough.<eos> One of the groundskeepers saw her knock on your door.<eos> Can you tell me the nature of her visit?<eos> She came to tell me she was filing a lawsuit against Godfrey Industries.<eos> Was she upset?<eos> Since the death of her daughter and grandchild, she always seemed that way.<eos> - Who can blame her? - Did she say anything else?<eos> Where she might be going?<eos> Anyone else she was seeing later that day?<eos> No, she didn't.
This is a bunch of random stuff that I picked up at the store... to satisfy any pregnancy cravings.<eos> You know, it's funny, I haven't really had any cravings.<eos> It's funny.<eos> Pickles.<eos> Oh, my God, you know what would go really well with pickles?<eos> John Form, we are meant to be together.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Like, mustard and pickles.<eos> Did you get to have your meeting today?<eos> Yeah, I did.
John.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Thank you for believing me.<eos> I didn't know if you would.<eos> Mia, come on.<eos> I love you.<eos> I will always believe you.<eos> Good night.<eos> You think Father Perez can help us?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Then his sons are quite difficult.<eos> I know what that's like.<eos> Could you come to luncheon on Saturday?<eos> Help me cheer him up?<eos> Well, I'd love to. Oh!<eos> Of course, a single peer with a good estate won't be lonely long, if he doesn't want to be.<eos> You sound like Mrs Bennett!<eos> But what's he on about?<eos> He thinks I know something about Mr Bates.<eos> And do you?
I wanted her to have another chance.<eos> Don't you think that should have been my decision, in my own house?<eos> Yes, m'lady.<eos> Perhaps it should.<eos> So... why tell me now?<eos> Because, if you have been using your knowledge against her, I'll have to consider your future here.<eos> Indeed, whether you have one at all.<eos> I just thought I'd been wrong and you ought to know.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, now I do.
Barrow, is she all right?<eos> I think so, m'lord.<eos> We must get her outside.<eos> Quickly, Tom!<eos> Tom, get the hose!<eos> Rose, wake Mrs Hughes and the maids.<eos> She'll do the rest.<eos> We must alert the firemen.<eos> Who knows where to find Drewe's number?<eos> I do.
Deposit slip.<eos> I already signed it.<eos> Want a fresh one?<eos> Nah, I'm sure yours will turn out fine.<eos> Look, we hired you for your contacts, not your reputation.<eos> Hey, about that... boss never told me how you found out about that.<eos> None of your fucking business how we know.<eos> As long as you work for us, this is how it goes.<eos> We don't have a problem, do we?<eos> No, we don't.
That's Bennett.<eos> That's Chang, Triantis.<eos> I can't help thinking whoever did this...<eos> Was inhuman?<eos> ...Was just like me.<eos> From what I can see, the Scythe is a true sociopath.<eos> Maria's hatchet man.<eos> And yet your father worked for the very same corporation.<eos> How do you defend that?<eos> I don't.
I doubt she would.<eos> She's very sensitive about it.<eos> If she'd only told someone else, then we could just leak it.<eos> - But it'll too obvious.<eos> - The doctor.<eos> He's protecting them.<eos> He won't say anything.<eos> Unless they waive the privilege.<eos> They have absolutely nothing to gain by that.<eos> But we do.
- Feng confirmed the money.<eos> Over the phone, not in a formal interview.<eos> Rescind the asylum, send him back--<eos> - Obstruction of justice.<eos> - Is that what Galich said?<eos> Definitely how it will be perceived.<eos> And anything we do that looks like a failure to cooperate amplifies that perception.<eos> I just don't want our marriage put on display.<eos> Look, Dunbar will ask if I brought up China.<eos> I didn't.
[Raymond] Barely.<eos> But sometimes barely is enough.<eos> [Frank] I'm sure he offered you a pardon.<eos> Always better to offer something your competitor can't.<eos> - Oh, but I can.<eos> Last time I read the Constitution, the most a vice president could offer was a... smile and wink.<eos> I think I've proven that I'm not your typical vice president.<eos> Typical or not, you've lost, Frank.<eos> I have an out.<eos> You don't.
Mr. President, you also still have my letter.<eos> It's not too late, if you want to use that option.<eos> You're more useful to me on the Hill than in handcuffs.<eos> - [clears throat] I'll call Kern.<eos> - Good night, sir.<eos> - How much did Green tell you?<eos> - Enough that I showed up.<eos> He probably didn't mention Rachel Posner.<eos> Don't worry, he doesn't know.<eos> I do.
men who've betrayed their country.<eos> Then you turn around and accuse me of the same thing.<eos> But with me, you call it "treason."<eos> So you're saying you're a hero for selling secrets to our enemy?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not saying that because I did no such thing.<eos> Would you be willing to prove that by taking a polygraph?<eos> Look, Edward, you were the one who wanted to talk to us, remember?<eos> If you cooperate, we can drop all this tough-guy stuff and just get to the bottom of what really happened.<eos> And if I don't?
She needed to know that someone was watching.<eos> Is that what you were doing outside of her apartment last night?<eos> Watching?<eos> I should've saved her.<eos> But I never saw her.<eos> I waited for the limo. But then that girl came out.<eos> The not-Mandy, the other girl.<eos> So I went around to the back alley and I waited across the street.<eos> When the other girl goes in the front, that means that Mandy goes in the back.<eos> But she didn't.
What?<eos> If it wasn't her, then who was it?<eos> It was that chick, Claire.<eos> I got paid 25 grand to show up and suck face with her for a couple minutes.<eos> You're telling me that you really don't know?<eos> No!<eos> I was messed up that night.<eos> I don't remember anything.<eos> I don't even remember getting messed up.<eos> Maybe you didn't.
The truth is, Marcellus, family can be more than just those with whom we share blood.<eos> We can choose.<eos> I know I haven't been around these parts lately.<eos> It's a testament to father Kieran that we could come together and share a drink and a story or two.<eos> Kieran rolled into town on a rusty old cruiser after his daddy died 25 years ago.<eos> And, damn it, that guy could party.<eos> That was, of course, before he took his vows.<eos> But even then, he was committed to the quarter.<eos> He knew that this town needed him.<eos> And we still do.
If we've been betrayed, then it's coming from your house, not mine.<eos> Someone close to you has betrayed us both.<eos> Rosalee, it's Alice.<eos> Are you still here?<eos> Now what?<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Quite a shop you have here.<eos> I don't think you came to talk about my shop.<eos> No, I didn't.
If you don't, I cannot guarantee your safety.<eos> Go to hell.<eos> And if you think you will ever get out of Russia, you are as foolish as you are old.<eos> Tomorrow I will be older, and you will not.<eos> One call, Dorn!<eos> One call, and you will never leave these woods.<eos> I knew you would come for us, Carl.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I was asked today if I knew what it was like to have someone believe in me<eos> when no one else did.
That video from India... you never got it.<eos> The one I deleted two hours ago?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> I gave you every chance in the world.<eos> I got your record expunged.<eos> I didn't need you to do that, dad.<eos> Are you ready to shut your mouth and listen?<eos> After what we went through with your mother...<eos> I was ready to die in the dirt to make sure you found your feet.<eos> Hell, I almost did.
Ow!<eos> Hello.<eos> Be patient, little buzzer, it's still too early.<eos> But I have to tell you about my dream.<eos> There was this big, bright round yellow thing.<eos> And all this blue.<eos> - Bees don't dream.<eos> - Why?<eos> Well...<eos> They just don't.
Maya?<eos> Hey! I'm flying!<eos> But I don't think little bees can survive out in the meadow.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Go after her and see that nature takes its course.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You have to save her, Willi.<eos> No. She'll be all right.<eos> No, she won't.<eos> Just do it.
- We're in!<eos> - I like you.<eos> You've got guts.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hold onto your stripes.<eos> Cause I'm hunting the greediest, most disgustingest bugs in the meadow.<eos> Honey guzzling soul-suckers.<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> I want to meet these nice bugs.<eos> No, you don't!

So, are you working here?<eos> No.<eos> Just trying to wrap something up with Tim.<eos> If by "something," you mean a classic case of Mcwaffling...<eos> Well, how would you know...?<eos> - Tim butt-dialed me.<eos> - What? !<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Well, it doesn't mean you have to listen.<eos> Oh, yes, it does.
Poor Laurel.<eos> Did Tommy dump you?<eos> No. He died.<eos> And I couldn't deal with it.<eos> So I became a drunk.<eos> Every problem I had... I solved with a pill or a drink.<eos> My friends and my family, they tried to help me, but I wouldn't let them.<eos> You don't have to do this, Helena.<eos> It's not too late.<eos> Yes, I do.
No, I don't know.<eos> I said "he" twice because on the radio... I heard that the person who attacked you had man parts, which would make him a he.<eos> I'm John Diggle, security for Queen Consolidated. Any idea what the masked man may have taken?<eos> An industrial centrifuge by any chance?<eos> - No.<eos> It's a secret.<eos> - What kind of secret?<eos> - The kind I have to keep.<eos> - Does Cisco have to keep it too?<eos> Yes, he does.
While we're waiting, we still have a Slade problem.<eos> He's got 20 guys just like him... - and we have no way to stop him.<eos> - Yes, we do.<eos> Is that what I think it is?<eos> - Mirakuru.<eos> - You weren't thinking about taking it...<eos> - were you? - No.<eos> We're gonna use it to make a cure.<eos> Oliver, we don't even know if it's possible to reverse the effects.<eos> Yes, we do.
This is the exact conversation that we had five years ago... except we were freezing on Lian Yu.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - What needs to be done.<eos> Mirakuru won't do anything against a head shot. - Sara.<eos> - Your mother's rally starts in half an hour.<eos> I'd start getting dressed, if I were you.<eos> She reminds me so much of me after I came home.<eos> When it just seemed...<eos> It seemed impossible to believe in anything even resembling hope.<eos> But you did.

Submarines have torpedoes, right?<eos> Can we blast our way out?<eos> I can see why you two are made for each other.<eos> You like your explosions.<eos> Chert voz'mi. What?<eos> These are Kaiten torpedoes.<eos> Manually operated.<eos> Someone needs to steer from inside.<eos> Okay, but then, how do they get away from the explosion?<eos> They do not.
Let's go.<eos> Diggle, you ready?<eos> Never not.<eos> I'm coming, too.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Felicity can give me a radio.<eos> I'll just be your eyes and your ears.<eos> I'll stay out of your way, I promise.<eos> Nothing will happen to me.<eos> What if it did?
That's not an answer.<eos> I'm sorry. We were just goofing around.<eos> Goofing around.<eos> You know you could be in jail right now?<eos> What, you got someplace you got to be?<eos> Just 'cause I'm in the picture doesn't mean you have a "get out of jail free" card, okay?<eos> This is a one-time thing.<eos> The next time, you are on your own.<eos> You hear me? I didn't ask for your help.<eos> No, but your sister did.
I don't have a name.<eos> So do whatever you got to do.<eos> Torture me like your friends did, 'cause I can't tell you something I don't know.<eos> Yeah, well, you see, torture isn't really my style.<eos> Now, Koga... you got a three-year-old son and a little girl, right?<eos> You've been through the system. You know how it works.<eos> First person to step up gets a deal, and Yamada is dead.<eos> I call that an opportunity.<eos> Look, you talk now... maybe you serve two to three years in a minimum-security prison and you get some kind of relationship with your children.<eos> But if you don't...
Pity.<eos> What I see in you... is a desire to make a mark in this world.<eos> Someday, we'll all move on, and when we do... do you really want to be buried behind some rickety wagon... not even a stone to mark your grave?<eos> Or do you want thousands to gather around, celebrating the glorious life you led... the life you were meant for?<eos> How can you be sure that that's the life for me?<eos> Because you could have been a nobody, but you chose to be a queen.<eos> You chose power over weakness.<eos> Don't be shaken by the ravings of that lovesick man.<eos> I'm sure he spoke well.<eos> They always do.
But I know what does.<eos> Take one more step, and I'll take your head clean off your shoulders.<eos> Ohh. Come now, Cyrus.<eos> Is that any way to talk to a lady?<eos> What would your mother think?<eos> You don't know anything about my mother.<eos> Don't let her get in your head.<eos> She's poison, this one.<eos> If Jafar knows we're here, why would he send you?<eos> He doesn't. And he didn't.
We have plenty to share. Man:<eos> Aaron?<eos> Priscilla?<eos> - Peter.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> It's good to see you again, pal.<eos> - This makes sense. - Peter:<eos> What do you mean?<eos> How did you know where to find me?<eos> We didn't.
You need to let it go, Sheldon.<eos> You work tirelessly for someone and this is what you get.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> They're just making you use your vacation days!<eos> But I don't want a vacation.<eos> Okay, listen, I don't mean to diminish what you're going through, but I'm a little distracted right now.<eos> Oh, this again?<eos> So, Penny proposed, you didn't say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever.<eos> How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?<eos> - It doesn't!
Huh? Ring a bell?<eos> - That doesn't mean that I... - Bullshit.<eos> You'd been shorting your own stocks for months before the market tanked.<eos> - Guess you saw it coming, huh?<eos> - You're a pusillanimous prig.<eos> Stealing from your own family?<eos> You're nothing more than a petty scam merchant.<eos> You'll be hearing from my solicitors.<eos> Do people really say that?<eos> Assholes do.
You cock-sucker.<eos> I knew we couldn't trust him.<eos> No, your friends understand the value of my presence, where you are simply a dog with a bone.<eos> Zo didn't want you inserting the key prematurely.<eos> In case it activates a river of lava or... venomous snakes.<eos> So you really imagine the architects of this structure would use the same deception twice.<eos> I see.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Zo meant you no harm.<eos> None of us do.
Why not?<eos> The cuffs were on tight enough to cause bruising, so if he tried to pull a hand out, there'd be cuts, abrasions, or missing skin. Hmm.<eos> Maybe his guest made the call.<eos> Those are some heavy bags.<eos> Huh? Oh, my eyes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Long nights.<eos> Long nights or sleepless ones?<eos> Both, but you don't want to hear about it.<eos> Oh, I don't?
When was the last time you spoke to him?<eos> I don't recall.<eos> Why do I get the feeling you're not cooperating?<eos> Why do I feel like I'm being treated like a criminal?<eos> Mr. Trevino, we're trying to find John before he hurts himself or his son.<eos> Do you have any idea who we're talking about here?<eos> You know he got the Silver Star?<eos> Our unit got ambushed, and John Russell crawled through an open courtyard through machine gun fire so he can drag two injured soldiers to safety.<eos> Does that sound like a guy who would hurt his son?<eos> No, it doesn't.
I'm never gonna fall for one of your lies again.<eos> Just take me to autopsy camp.<eos> Oh, shoot.<eos> Am I gonna get a ticket?<eos> If there's any justice, it'll be a big one, too, three, and four.<eos> Damn it!<eos> License and registration, please. Absolutely.<eos> There you are.<eos> You know one of your taillights is out?<eos> No, I did not. What a ding-dong!
But he's my uncle. He's harmless.<eos> Clayton, please.<eos> For me? Hmm? _<eos> I need them brought to me, because I need to know...<eos> That would be great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, Jeanne.<eos> Have you heard?<eos> My transfer finally came through.<eos> No, I didn't.
Other than the fact that I spent too much time in the library.<eos> I practically lived at the theater.<eos> They could have charged me rent.<eos> I played Cassius in "Julius Caesar,"<eos> and then I just, uh... I caught the bug. Mm.<eos> Thought maybe I'd be an actor.<eos> Guess I'm a ways off from what I planned on doing with my life.<eos> I'd say you did all right.<eos> When'd you turn the tassel?<eos> I didn't.
Well, could you do something off the books?<eos> Us simply having this conversation verges on breaking around 10 different federal laws, not to mention a host of FBI guidelines.<eos> I hardly know you, Sandy, but for your sake, and for the sake of your career,<eos> I'm gonna pretend you never asked me that question.<eos> Paul Ames, huh?<eos> Rick?<eos> Uh-huh?<eos> I was wondering, how will people know or find out what you've been doing?<eos> No one will ever figure it out.<eos> But what if they did?
For a few days, farther away at first, but he comes closer. He just sat down.<eos> - Do you know him?<eos> - No.<eos> Have you seen him before?<eos> He seems familiar, but more like I've dreamt of him before.<eos> Does he speak to you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Is he speaking now?<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - Not now, but earlier he did.
Untie me you dumb cunt!<eos> You want to exorcise the demon?<eos> How do you know I'm not sick?<eos> Maybe Erik's the demon.<eos> Have you thought about that?<eos> You didn't.<eos> What now?<eos> What happened?<eos> - Didn't it work?<eos> - Yes, it did.
Easy!<eos> You wanna know why you're here?<eos> Take a look.<eos> What am I looking at?<eos> A bunch of kids?<eos> Missing kids, 31 over the past two decades, all within 200 miles of Arctic Biosystems and your precious Dr. Hatake.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Someone's been stealing our children.<eos> You have no idea who you're protecting.<eos> Or maybe you do.
- Hey, hey, hey! - Doctor Farragut!<eos> - Please!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop it!<eos> - That man killed Dr. Boyle!<eos> The army en...<eos> You killed a member of the CDC who's trying to find a cure for this virus? I promise you,<eos> I will make this man pay.<eos> You have neither the time nor the wherewithal to handle this right now.<eos> I do.
- We need to leave this place.<eos> - Why?<eos> There is a woman coming down here to kill you.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - I'll explain everything, but right now, we need to leave.<eos> - Does Alan know about this?<eos> - He's coming down with her.<eos> - Alan would never...<eos> - He doesn't know what she's capable of.<eos> I do.
- Yeah, I saw those too.<eos> I got some blood here.<eos> Looks like we've got our getaway point.<eos> Hey, fellas, I got the witness ready for you out front.<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> Did you see anybody in the room?<eos> No.<eos> You didn't see anybody when you were outside?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't.
Uhh! Sam? Sam?<eos> Lani?<eos> My darling Dana.<eos> Sam called me and told me you had a terrible accident.<eos> I didn't know you were here.<eos> When did you arrive?<eos> Sam asked me to come right away and help take care of you.<eos> What a nice surprise.<eos> You didn't have to come all the way here.<eos> Oh, I did.
This town gets better all the time.<eos> So he's gone.<eos> We should get out of here while we still can.<eos> I'm not going anywhere without a lead or something.<eos> Look, I said I'd bring you here and I did.<eos> Now it's time to get back, deal with the Patriots.<eos> Oh, that's perfect, Miles.<eos> First you kill the kid's mother, - and then you give up on the kid.<eos> - I didn't kill Emma.<eos> One of your men did.
All right, that's enough.<eos> Both of you.<eos> Miles: Come on, Bass.<eos> Being some normal type of father, that's... That was never in the cards for you.<eos> Why don't you just leave it alone? Okay?<eos> You're only gonna make it worse.<eos> Sir.<eos> Who's that?<eos> We still need to talk.<eos> Do we?
In 18 months, my people will take over.<eos> Everything you own... Will be mine.<eos> Do not harm my boy.<eos> Please, please, please.<eos> Seon-u.<eos> How'd you get that name?<eos> _<eos> Look, I don't know what happened between you and your dad, but I trust him.<eos> I know.<eos> I did, too.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You have no right to kill one of my men.<eos> I had already taken care of that problem.<eos> No, Javier.<eos> You did not.
- like you did Sonny Watts.<eos> - I agree.<eos> So, about Sonny Watts, he had this video... On his cell phone.<eos> What kind of video?<eos> It was of you and Taj Depina.<eos> I saw the video.<eos> If you got a question, ask me.<eos> Did you push him?<eos> Are you sure you want me to answer that question?<eos> I do.
Give me the vial?<eos> Please.<eos> He must have been talking to the Russians all along.<eos> That's how they were able to follow us.<eos> I mean, he was my partner for almost 10 years.<eos> I'm at a complete loss!<eos> What were his connections to the Russians?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, he studied there years ago. He has friends, he has colleagues-<eos> - We both do.
I cannot turn this woman away.<eos> I have to take care of my child.<eos> Don't forget the ax.<eos> You are leaving then?<eos> Of course I'm leaving.<eos> Is Bjorn going with you?<eos> That's up to Bjorn.<eos> Bjorn, you have a big choice to make.<eos> I admire your mother.<eos> We all do.
Victoria.<eos> I'm surprised to see you.<eos> Coming here in the middle of this media firestorm may not be the smartest thing to do, but...<eos> I need an ally.<eos> And I couldn't help but notice that you've yet to take a public stance on my guilt.<eos> I like to know all the details of a story before I tell it.<eos> Jack told you what Conrad did to his family?<eos> Yes.<eos> - How did you know?<eos> - I didn't.
Can you think of anyone, anyone at all who hates Barney Stinson?<eos> I know, I know, I almost couldn't get through it with a straight face!<eos> There are just so many people who hate Barney's guts!<eos> Moving on.<eos> The point is, you need to go get slapped in the face by a bunch of gullible chicks Barney banged.<eos> I'm a friend of Barney Stinson. Ooh!<eos> I'm a friend of Barney Stins... I-I'm-I'm a friend of Barney Stinson. Aah!<eos> Ooh! I'm so sorry.<eos> I thought you said you were a friend of Barney Stinson.<eos> I did. Ooh!
You know what?<eos> Good call. You're going to need more than big socks this morning.<eos> I know this has been all... sort of confusing, Kira.<eos> But since we're stuck in this together, there's no reason why we shouldn't have a little fun.<eos> And there's no reason why we shouldn't have really awesome socks.<eos> Right?<eos> Sit, please, Paul.<eos> I'm in need of a new monitor.<eos> - You have a monitor?<eos> - She did.
If he's withholding promising treatment from you, yes.<eos> He's going to ruin your career and destroy your reputation as a budding lesbian.<eos> No, I think he's probably culturing it himself, so I would check these fridges.<eos> For a beaker marked "culture'"?<eos> Oh, shit....<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Dr Cormier.<eos> Uh, hey. My bad.<eos> I wanted to see the original genome.<eos> No, she didn't.
You're a long way from home.<eos> - Andrew Cooper. - Yep.<eos> You heading back out west?<eos> - Yep.<eos> You don't mind if I take a look inside the RV?<eos> Trick-or-treat! Whoa!<eos> Ha*l*loween's over, kiddo.<eos> I know, but you're burning dinner again.<eos> Oh, right, but it... It gives the food a nice smoky flavour.<eos> KIRA: No, it doesn't.
You make me cry, sestra.<eos> Come on, meathead.<eos> Don't call me this.<eos> There we go.<eos> Just an intra-dermal test to see how your body responds.<eos> Yeah, so if my arm falls off, then we know.<eos> Or if you grow another limb. - Yeah.<eos> - (BOTH LAUGH)<eos> Oh, Dr Leekie, in light of what you shared with us earlier, we have a proposition for you.<eos> We do?
No, no, it's definitely your batch.<eos> Can you just get here as fast as you can, all right?<eos> Okay, great, thanks.<eos> Who was that?<eos> It was my sister.<eos> Foster sister?<eos> Yeah, it was my foster sister.<eos> Tasty Tony.<eos> Fluidity doesn't shock me either, Tony.<eos> Something did.
I'm here to help.<eos> Really?<eos> And where did you get your genetics degree?<eos> I can source another computer.<eos> Anything you need?<eos> No, we're good.<eos> Couldn't get my hands on a 6502 processor, but this one shares a chipset with the 65c02.<eos> He's a virgin, in case you couldn't tell.<eos> Aw, shoot-darn. It didn't work.<eos> Oh, but it did, my good man.
Yeah... to be out of the system... on my own.<eos> Then why'd you get yourself arrested and sent back here?<eos> Callie, you're still a kid.<eos> Like it or not, you need an adult to care for you.<eos> Whether it's in the system or back with your foster moms...<eos> No, I can't go back there.<eos> You can send me to a different foster home, or leave me here, I don't care.<eos> Just...<eos> I want them to adopt my little brother.<eos> I do.
No, they think I'm working on a project for school.<eos> [chuckles] You want something to drink? You want me to get you something?<eos> Um, why'd you stop writing to us?<eos> You know, after you've been in prison for a couple of years, you, uh... you start to think maybe you're not gonna get out.<eos> I told myself you kids were better off.<eos> Truth is, I was pretty messed up.<eos> And I felt ashamed about what I'd done.<eos> And I was just waiting for the day to come when I'd open up a letter from you... accusing me of murdering your mother.<eos> You didn't... murder her.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I wouldn't put it that way, but that's a good point.<eos> What if it doesn't work?<eos> I mean, what if he can't use his fingers at all?<eos> Look, Mike and I talked through all of this.<eos> And you made your decision.<eos> Nice coat rack.<eos> Yeah, well, might as well use it for something.<eos> Brandon. I mean, you can still play, right?<eos> Not classical.<eos> Not the way I did.
I guess he owns, like, this big company or something.<eos> So he is making me take this DNA test and... and sign this agreement that says that I'll never sue him.<eos> - That's crazy.<eos> - Like I want his money?<eos> Just sign the papers, and then sail off on your yacht and I promise I will never think of you ever again.<eos> - And I have to see him.<eos> - Why? 'Cause we both have to be there at the test, to make sure that nothing gets switched or whatever.<eos> I know you didn't want to know anything about him.<eos> Guess I don't have a choice.<eos> Some people do.
What?<eos> Hanging out with my brothers and sisters?<eos> Listening to a little live music?<eos> Look, I think it's nice and all, but I don't...<eos> Where were those dance moves when we were up there playing?<eos> - Great show.<eos> - You were awesome!<eos> It was amazing, really.<eos> But we have to go.<eos> We do?
- Not in front of me.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Well, thank you for that.<eos> I appreciate you looking out for him, being such a good friend.<eos> Did something happen?<eos> My dad thinks Jude is gay.<eos> That's why I can't spend the night at your house anymore.<eos> I see.<eos> - Did he say that to Jude?<eos> - No. But I did.
If your dad finds out, I'm not the only one he'll never forgive.<eos> I might have to figure out a way to live with myself, but I sure as hell don't have to have dinner with you.<eos> Why didn't you tell me Emma came by last night?<eos> Oh, I don't know, maybe because you were upstairs shoving your tongue down Hayley's throat?<eos> I wasn't... she was...<eos> look, this...<eos> This thing with Hayley isn't serious.<eos> You could have said no if you were still hung up on Emma.<eos> Why do guys always act like they don't have a choice if a girl wants to have sex?<eos> - We don't!
Sort of.<eos> I mean, through Jesus.<eos> I would tell her myself, but I barely know her, so that would make me seem pretty awful.<eos> Ok, look.<eos> I love my brother.<eos> He's my twin and I would totally give him a kidney, anytime.<eos> But when it comes to girls, he can be a little all over the place.<eos> Not in a bad way. He's just not very good at expressing his true feelings.<eos> If he even knows what he's feeling.<eos> Which, most of the time, he doesn't.

Forgive me if I have a hard time taking you at your word.<eos> You volunteered to be our donor.<eos> You said that people like us should have kids, and you wanted to help, anonymously.<eos> And then you...<eos> - I read the contract.<eos> - Yes. And you knew what it was going to say.<eos> You agreed that Stef and I should be the parents.<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> I trusted you because I thought you had integrity.<eos> - I do.
Take as long as you need.<eos> All I ever ask from you is this... is to talk to me.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Layla.<eos> That's a beautiful name.<eos> I like your unicorn.<eos> - She talks.<eos> - Oh, she does?
Is Emma gonna be there?<eos> This is a team dinner, and she's on the team.<eos> OK, let's go!<eos> - Call me later?<eos> - Promise.<eos> We don't have time to mess around today.<eos> Competition season starts this month, and we are not losing this year.<eos> We need to talk dollars.<eos> Our first competition is in L.A., and the truth is, we don't have enough money for everyone to go.<eos> We don't?
- OK, so why am I here?<eos> Connor, would you mind stepping out so we can talk to your dad?<eos> Mr. Stevens, do you think it's appropriate to spank a thirteen year old boy?<eos> I think it's none of your damn business.<eos> And quite frankly, this is all your fault.<eos> - My fault?<eos> - Yeah, you were the chaperone on the seventh grade camping trip, and allowed our sons to spend the night in a tent together without my permission.<eos> Why is that a problem?<eos> Because her son is gay. - Which I have no problem with...<eos> - Clearly you do...
And we don't have the right to label the parent as a bully because he has rules about who he allows his son to socialize with and under what conditions.<eos> - I disagree.<eos> - As a parent you have that right.<eos> But as Vice Principal of this school it's a conflict of interest for you to use your position to retaliate.<eos> Retaliate?<eos> That's how it could be construed.<eos> And we can't afford to get sued.<eos> How about I just use my position as a parent then?<eos> You should have asked me what happened.<eos> I did.
Hello?<eos> Oh, wow, this is beautiful.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Oh, my gosh, it's only been one night, but we missed you.<eos> I missed you, too.<eos> Oh, my gosh, your hair is back.<eos> Well, it was never really gone.<eos> No, I missed brunette Mariana.<eos> Yeah, I did too.
I knew I couldn't trust him. I can't trust anything.<eos> And I knew this was gonna happen, Brandon, I knew it.<eos> Come here, come here, sit down with me.<eos> Take some breaths.<eos> OK, just take some deep breaths.<eos> No matter what, they can't make you live with them.<eos> We'll still be your family.<eos> I'm never getting adopted.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes I do.
- Mama.<eos> She and Jude just got to the campsite and she sent me this picture of the outhouse.<eos> That's messed up.<eos> Mama tells me that you and... you and Hayley are having sex.<eos> - We're using condoms.<eos> - Well, good.<eos> You better be.<eos> That's not what I want to talk to you about.<eos> - Do we really have to have this talk?<eos> - We do.
I thought it'd be fun if we tried out together.<eos> A musical? Yeah!<eos> A musical.<eos> You love musicals.<eos> We used to watch them all the time together on TV.<eos> Yeah, well, that's watching them. That's not doing them.<eos> Come on!<eos> South Pacific.<eos> Wha... anybody can sing!<eos> We... we just do it.

He'll be ready soon.<eos> - It happened.<eos> - What happened?<eos> The happy ending.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Matt and Katherine.<eos> They're together.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just do.
Cold.<eos> It'll get worse.<eos> Keep moving.<eos> Alan, if this doesn't work...<eos> If this doesn't work, we burn the base to the ground with everyone in it.<eos> Everyone?<eos> Even Peter?<eos> Even Peter.<eos> But if we destroy the base, how do we get home?<eos> We don't.
Only twice have I felt it in return.<eos> Sheriff, you think that we fan out like we did last night, continue canvassing?<eos> Dumb girl who brought this here, and she's gonna save us?<eos> - Fucking mess. - Fucking danger hole.<eos> No way out of this one.<eos> How many there gotta be in this state?<eos> We don't have the time to figure it out.<eos> - There's gotta be a lot of them.<eos> - The truth is I don't know how to narrow the search.<eos> I do.
Sookie, you gotta stop beating yourself up.<eos> Vampires came out of the coffin the whole world over.<eos> You didn't bring them to Bon Temps any more than that girl to Saint Alice.<eos> You sure as hell didn't infect them with a virus that makes them rabid beasts.<eos> Yeah, you fell in love with Bill.<eos> He wouldn't have been my first choice. Well, I hate to break it to you, but you fell for him the same way that every single person on the entire planet falls for their first love.<eos> Hard and fast.<eos> AII's that makes you is a human.<eos> I appreciate you saying that.<eos> I do.
Carlos is a selfish idiot who doesn't know what the hell he's doing.<eos> What ever happened to people helping other people?<eos> Holly, I hate to tell you this.<eos> You're good at your job.<eos> That's so nice of you.<eos> Thank you for that, and for saving me from that maniac.<eos> He was just trying to kill Owen.<eos> Where is Owen?<eos> How did he disappear?<eos> He didn't.
Yeah, all three of these guys have trigger-finger calluses.<eos> The kind only Special Forces operators get.<eos> Let's show their photos in the Special Forces community.<eos> - Someone will know them.<eos> - Let's show his photo somewhere else first.<eos> My client is hoping that his cooperation here will be taken into account.<eos> Your client helped take down a drone that would have found those kidnapped kids.<eos> He cooperates or I turn him over to the other parents.<eos> You don't have any kids, do you?<eos> No. I don't.
- What is that?<eos> - Never mind.<eos> It was argued convincingly that your medical expertise is still required.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> -It wasn't me.<eos> The council vote was nearly unanimous.<eos> Apparently, Jake's message woke their better angels, as well.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> We need to talk about those flares. No.<eos> We don't.
I wanted to tell you, but you split, and I didn't know what to do.<eos> I needed you, and you left me.<eos> I was completely fucking lost.<eos> I am completely fucking lost.<eos> Then Miranda fell out of the sky, and it was like...<eos> I don't know how to explain it.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Were you planning on hiding this baby forever?<eos> I didn't have a plan.<eos> I still don't.
Good point.<eos> I have no regrets.<eos> No?<eos> You went from protecting the president to riding in blind with a malfunctioning robot?<eos> Robots don't say ""<eos> You're not a murderer.<eos> I saw what I saw. I'm on that tape.<eos> It is a very sophisticated frame job.<eos> We both know it.<eos> Do we?
Of being alone at night.<eos> - No.<eos> - If you're ever afraid, then come upstairs.<eos> You can sleep in my room, with me.<eos> I don't think I need to, but thanks.<eos> I'm thirsty.<eos> Do you want a glass of water?<eos> No, I want milk.<eos> I brought some before and you didn't want it!<eos> Well, but now I do.
All the way from a woman's mouth down to her...<eos> "To bruise her breast immune to pain, to make in her astonished flank a wide and gaping wound."<eos> "Fleurs Du Mal." Baudelaire.<eos> You've read him, of course.<eos> Somehow I missed "Flowers Of Evil."<eos> Hmm. For a Frenchman, he knew a lot about the Greek way.<eos> You know, they didn't invent olive oil just for cooking.<eos> I think this is a significant direction for our new study.<eos> Dr. Greathouse, you wanted me to remind you about your 9:30.<eos> I did, Barbara.
Take your hands away.<eos> I want to see you.<eos> Are you going to touch me?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> Is it?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Say it.<eos> I don't need to say it.<eos> I want you to tell me how much you want me to make you feel good.<eos> Do it.
Tell him the truth.<eos> You tell him.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> I...<eos> I crossed the finish line.<eos> It's all just...<eos> Well, it's cruel. Oh.<eos> You're out there in the john making baby batter, while in here, the Doc gets the results from my very last test and it turns out I'm the culprit.<eos> I don't even know what to say.<eos> Nobody does.
True or not, I'm simply wondering if it's worth our consideration.<eos> Dr. Masters' office.<eos> Yes, Mrs. Kenworthy.<eos> Oh, that's fine.<eos> We can...<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mrs. Kenworthy just canceled her appointment.<eos> When does she want to reschedule?<eos> She doesn't.
And how can they say there was a fight when there were people there the whole time and no one saw nothing like that?<eos> I was surprised to read that, too.<eos> I had just come out of the building, and, um, hadn't noticed any sort of altercation.<eos> Look, we got a couple of witnesses who, uh, saw a truck drive by and saw Leonard get dumped out the back, and one of them saw the first three numbers of the licence plate.<eos> And, so, I was wondering if... If maybe you saw anything.<eos> If there are other witnesses, why are you talking to me?<eos> Because most of them are coloured folks.<eos> The few white witnesses won't talk, and the police aren't about to start an investigation based on the testimony of a bunch of negroes.<eos> So if you did see something...<eos> I didn't. Sorry.
Well, it didn't.<eos> It happened to me.<eos> And I'm sorry that I wasn't emoting enough, but...<eos> Were there tears when it happened?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> A 12-year-old girl, she cries when she's being penetrated for the first time.<eos> Were you that 12-year-old girl?<eos> Yes, Hold you.<eos> Then why not say "I"? "I cried."<eos> Well, I did.
You saw someone commit a crime, a despicable act, and you didn't drive straight to the authorities to report it?<eos> Well, I am doing that now.<eos> lam...<eos> I am here now.<eos> The defence will eat you for lunch, Mrs Masters, and pick you out their teeth.<eos> You'll do us more harm than good.<eos> It ain't worth it.<eos> Well, then, why did that lawyer, Mr Gabler, ask me?<eos> Because he doesn't know you.<eos> Oh, and you do?
I'm sorry that I made it so difficult.<eos> I'm doing the right thing, aren't I, by trying to fix myself?<eos> I know it's unfair of me to ask you, because what are you supposed to say?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think that we can help you.<eos> We're going to try our very best.<eos> I wanna believe you.<eos> I...<eos> I have trouble trusting people.<eos> Of course you do.
You know, the point, Virginia, is, we...<eos> We have an opportunity here, you know, to find a cure...<eos> Not, not just for me, but for millions of men.<eos> We've drifted away from the work.<eos> I... I admit that.<eos> But, but this is the way back.<eos> I'm broken, and you're the one...<eos> You... You're the only one who can fix me.<eos> So, you consider the relationship to have a higher purpose now?<eos> I do.
You're lying because, because you're needy, you know, because you think that somehow, if... If you take my story...<eos> Bill...<eos> Our drunk dad beat you, and then he beat me.<eos> But that doesn't have to be the end of the story.<eos> That's what I'm trying to tell you.<eos> I forgive you for leaving me.<eos> And I forgive our dad.<eos> The man that beat you, that monster who beat you.<eos> What kind of man forgives that?<eos> I do.
Well, masturbation, for one.<eos> Can't say "masturbation".<eos> Auto-manipulation, then. Mmm-mmm.<eos> I think we want to leave out anything that suggests solo behaviour.<eos> So, Ulysses is a dildo?<eos> What did you think?<eos> Our female subjects were having intercourse with a Greek leader in the Trojan War?<eos> CBS doesn't like dildos.<eos> CBS doesn't have to use a dildo.<eos> But Dr Masters and Mrs Johnson's participants did.
Look.<eos> You're close to it.<eos> I respect that.<eos> You're invested.<eos> Good for you.<eos> But if can be honest with you, you're not the best guy to say how to put this stuff on TV.<eos> Ridiculous, this nonsense with the censor.<eos> It's like having to explain a recipe without mentioning a single ingredient.<eos> I don't even think this belongs to me.<eos> It doesn't.
Maybe we should continue into actual sex.<eos> Let me initiate first.<eos> And you just feel -- feel... feel me.<eos> Feel your body.<eos> It's interesting if you look at the progression.<eos> Seven nights of nonsexual touching, multiple erections.<eos> With a few unmitigated disasters. But still.<eos> And then followed by seven nights of sexual touching.<eos> Again with multiple erections if you don't count --<eos> I don't.
From what?<eos> Your medication.<eos> - Who gave you this?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> I'm not at liberty to discuss the situation.<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> - I have rights.<eos> - You do.
- Jamie? - Stand a brother up and pretend not to know his voice... okay.<eos> I'm sorry about last night.<eos> A work meeting came up.<eos> I just wanted to make sure you're all right.<eos> How about I make it up to you?<eos> He left about half an hour ago.<eos> I wanted him to take me to lunch.<eos> Did he say when he'd be back?<eos> No.<eos> But he never does.
Do you mind just sending them the form so they know you're here legally?<eos> Yes, I mind.<eos> And also I may not be.<eos> To wit, maybe you could make out my checks to cash?<eos> Or bitcoin.<eos> I didn't know I was working with an illegal.<eos> The irony.<eos> Well, sometimes we do center pivot, but mainly we do lineal like you see out there.<eos> What is it your business does again?<eos> Something to do with algebra?
So, technically, Hitler was the Hitler of music.<eos> I don't understand. I thought you closed the name.<eos> Well, I guess it's still a little ajar, I don't know.<eos> Who am I, Herb Cohen?<eos> - I don't know who that is.<eos> - Neither do I.<eos> That's a... That's a Jared thing.<eos> Hey! Make sure to clean off all the gunk off the front bumper, okay.<eos> And since when do we have an intern program?<eos> We don't.
This credit card is no good.<eos> Declined.<eos> Great.<eos> Great. That stupid margarita machine maxed me out.<eos> So now the CEO of Pied Piper can't even afford to buy lunch.<eos> Yeah, I don't think we can use that name anymore.<eos> Dude! Dude, hey. I owe you a big apology, man.<eos> I had no idea who you were before and I read all this coverage about your company online, and I was like, "Hey, Pied Piper!<eos> "I met this dude! He came into the store "and told me my parking app was fucking awesome!"<eos> I did?
Okay, go.<eos> I have now removed the chest plate of one of the subjects and found... abnormal neoplasms in the heart, liver... and kidneys.<eos> The growths do not seem like oncological aberrations but almost like new, fully functional organs.<eos> No!<eos> Sorry, Eph.<eos> Nothing. You got anything here?<eos> Just trying to figure out how a 500-pound, 9-foot tall coffin got up and walked away.<eos> You called it a coffin.<eos> We'll get a break.<eos> We always do.
And the person who could help us the most refuses to talk to anyone.<eos> Except his mother.<eos> He found the woman he loved... dead.<eos> The woman he loved more than anything.<eos> What do you want him to say?<eos> What's this?<eos> His teeth.<eos> I thought you guys were into that. Make a necklace or something.<eos> I was told if I want to sit down I have to make the message clear.<eos> I did.
Is my car still out back or did you move that, too?<eos> It's still there.<eos> Please don't say anything.<eos> To Jax.<eos> I won't.<eos> Patterson grilled the guys.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Everyone at TM and the hospital.<eos> I don't think they have any suspects.<eos> They don't.
The truth is I can barely make the right choices for myself.<eos> I've been trying to take this club in a direction I thought made sense.<eos> To move us away from all the outlaw shit.<eos> That hasn't worked.<eos> I think some part of me was trying to buy back all the bad shit I've done.<eos> The people I've hurt.<eos> That's a false pardon.<eos> It's dangerous.<eos> And it's selfish.<eos> JT did the same thing.
I've never tortured people!<eos> -What about that poor Simon?<eos> -Who?<eos> The one you harmed who hung himself from a bridge.<eos> I've never hurt a Simon--<eos> It deeply disturbs me that you can cause such tragedy in somebody's life and it can mean so little to you.<eos> You live in your luxury--<eos> You call this luxury?<eos> My wife has left me. I never see my daughter anymore and I live in this house alone.<eos> You did that to yourself, but what did Simon ever do to you?
My advise would be close up.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> I got this.<eos> Crap.<eos> No no no no, when I say pull up, I don't mean fly up his ass.<eos> Ok.<eos> Let's see who's got the biggest cojones.<eos> Cane!<eos> You really have to do this?<eos> Yeah he does.
There's a possible reference to Thanatos, the Hellenic demon of death.<eos> No.<eos> Can you rewind it?<eos> Rewind it.<eos> Maybe we need to listen to it in reverse.<eos> Demons have been known to speak backwards.<eos> Just to up the creep factor.<eos> Isolating the audio...<eos> Let's see if this works.<eos> Indeed it does.
Let's see if this works.<eos> Indeed it does.<eos> That's ancient Aramaic.<eos> - "Ancitif cannot be defeated."<eos> - Ancitif?<eos> "Ancitif..."<eos> "A powerful demon that has been known to jump between bodies on contact."<eos> "First cited in 1647, when it possessed a group of catholic nuns."<eos> So... this is the demon that wanted me dead.<eos> And likely still does.
- Okay.<eos> They're after our daughter, aren't they?<eos> Frank, I'm an attorney.<eos> I might be able to help if you just let me.<eos> I didn't wanna worry you with the details.<eos> You walk around with the weight of the world on your shoulders.<eos> Why do you think that you have to carry it alone?<eos> She did not get hurt because you weren't there.<eos> - You have to know that.<eos> - I do.
I love Roanoke.<eos> Yeah, it... it has to be the right fit, though.<eos> Of course.<eos> - Please and thank you. - OK.<eos> Kiss her ass.<eos> - Smile.<eos> - Point noted.<eos> I mean, I'm sorry.<eos> You know all this. - Hey, Ma!<eos> - Yes, you did.
- Those people are here.<eos> - Hey, Sarah.<eos> - The crew I told you about.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> They're here for the pre-interview.<eos> Remember, Ma? They wanna make a movie about me!<eos> - Isn't that right?<eos> - Yes, hopefully. - What do you think of that?<eos> - I think it's a good idea.<eos> You do?
Deborah was exhibiting what we call MCI - mild cognitive impairment.<eos> Through a battery of tests, we were able to diagnose with 95% certainty that she was in the early stages of Alzheimer's.<eos> How did she take the news?<eos> It's devastating, obviously, for anyone, but Deborah's not someone to go down without a fight.<eos> After the premature death of her husband, Dennis, to a pulmonary embolism, Deborah was forced to provide for two-year-old Sarah on her own.<eos> She leveraged their house as collateral and would go on to start a highly successful switchboard answering service for the town of Exuma.<eos> That was the way that professionals received their messages and, I guess, transferred information back in those days, was through a professional answering service.<eos> Everyone told her she was crazy at the time.<eos> - Right?<eos> - They certainly did.
- That's my mom, OK?<eos> - Hold her, hold her.<eos> - Alright, it's in.<eos> - Do something, please.<eos> Thanks for meeting me out here.<eos> I just... ..I just didn't want to talk about this in there.<eos> I can bless your mom with oils.<eos> An exorcism is really in the realm of science fiction, Sarah. I...<eos> I used to think that.<eos> - I still do maybe, but...
- I know.<eos> We've tried everything else.<eos> - I understand. - No, you don't know.<eos> Sarah, it's something that we just don't do.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> You have to know someone.<eos> A mentor of yours. Someone.<eos> You've gotta help me.<eos> You need to accept this.<eos> You really do.
Have you seen Teri?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> She's up to something.<eos> I think she's after Emery.<eos> I know things are weird between us right now, and that's gonna make it harder for you to hear what I have to say.<eos> It's about Roman.<eos> You can't trust him.<eos> - There are things you don't know about him; he has secrets.<eos> Not from me he doesn't.
- Okay.<eos> Of course I'm safe.<eos> I backup my whole system like five times a day.<eos> So...<eos> Uh, Jared, hey, thank you.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Uh, you know, everything.<eos> I feel like we don't appreciate you enough, so thank you.<eos> Are you... Are you crying?<eos> Uh, don't do that.
Who are you?<eos> My name is Athelstan.<eos> I was a monk at Lindisfarne.<eos> A monk!<eos> Athelstan was captured by the northmen.<eos> He's lived amongst them.<eos> He knows everything about their pagan ways.<eos> I have heard that the pagans sacrifice human beings!<eos> Is that true?<eos> Do they actually?

Let me sit at a table and do my homework when Dad couldn't afford a baby-sitter?<eos> We made a business arrangement with the Metas.<eos> Mijo, there's nothing we can do.<eos> This isn't about business!<eos> It's about what's right.<eos> Javier, give me a line on the guys who did this.<eos> Let me find out where they are.<eos> The Cabrales... they were like family to me, too.<eos> But I made a deal, and I have no choice.<eos> But I do.
Captain... we're here pursuant to the incident on San Miguel Boulevard.<eos> Last night, the Metas brought Colima to Peacock Hill.<eos> I don't think this kind of savagery is quite what you intended.<eos> Are you familiar with the phrase<eos> "the enemy of my enemy is my friend"?<eos> We will never be friends, Chapel.<eos> SAM: Well, that's too bad.<eos> Because as a friend, I would tell you that...<eos> Los Angelicos does not have the manpower or the firepower to take on the Metas.<eos> But I do.
Hey.<eos> How you doing?<eos> ...Tumblr drinking blogs there are out there?<eos> I could write a better one than these douche bags.<eos> Wait, so your mother was dating two different guys while your father was in prison.<eos> That we knew of.<eos> "Smoking a coke-laced bowl of weed is the best high ever"?<eos> Amateurs.<eos> Wasn't she afraid he'd find out?<eos> He did.
So who stole it?<eos> I give up.<eos> Who?<eos> No, not who stole it, like, guess who stole it.<eos> Who stole it like which one of you fuckers stole my money?<eos> Why do you think we stole your money?<eos> Because you knew where I hid it.<eos> - Where?<eos> - In the damn keg!<eos> Ooh. We do now.
He's dead!<eos> I don't understand my grade on this paper.<eos> - That would be a "D".<eos> -What was wrong with it? It sucked.<eos> Why are you taking this class anyway?<eos> Because it was the only freshman English class available after noon.<eos> You don't want to work any harder than this piece of shit, I suggest you find yourself another course.<eos> Holy crap, there he is!<eos> - He looks just like you, baby!<eos> -He kind of does, doesn't he?
Denial of what?<eos> You better speak to Larry. I don't speak nerd.<eos> Are you the Mr Fleming that ran K-Y-backgammon for Charles Monroe?<eos> Looky here!<eos> He's going for a Taser. Can you believe that?<eos> I will aim to use words of one syllable, the word "syllable" notwithstanding.<eos> You shut down that site, and you took my money.<eos> I want my money.<eos> - Federal government did that, man.<eos> - But they didn't.
You know, I didn't think anything of it.<eos> But you asked if something special was happening.<eos> You said you couldn't remember if your parents ever did that.<eos> And of course, you made fun of me, because you were supposed to be strong.<eos> But I saw how much you wished it was you.<eos> And that's probably why we never hung out after that, 'cause you were embarrassed that I saw that.<eos> And you think I'm the same.<eos> You think that I killed Lana.<eos> I get it. You didn't have to drive all the way out here to tell me that.<eos> But I don't, Trent.
"She deserves better than dirty glasses and soggy bills,<eos> She deserves better." Hmm. Look at this.<eos> A check torn up for $1,000.<eos> I couldn't see him throwing out ten bucks.<eos> "BoarHog Record and Publishing."<eos> Got an address and everything.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> These are Mr. Bray's X-rays?<eos> When did he give you the authorization to look at them?<eos> He didn't.
You introduced me to An Ni 'cause you knew she'd lead us to Tiffin Olin.<eos> You've been playing us all from the beginning, like we're your chess pieces.<eos> Dr. Sweets, I didn't do anything like this.<eos> - Let me tell you what I think.<eos> - See, that's good.<eos> He's staying in control, not letting him say that he's innocent.<eos> Take his coat off; it says that, you know what, he ain't going anywhere.<eos> Dr. Sweets, I loved Albert. I would never do any...<eos> You didn't love Albert.<eos> Nobody did.
- Yeah.<eos> - Okay, let's do it.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> We're going into that cave!<eos> - Yeah! - No.<eos> I bet it's haunted by dead sailors.<eos> - I thought you were a scientist.<eos> - I am a scientist. What is this "dead sailor" bullshit ghost story?<eos> I bet you also think names determine personality, right?<eos> - Oh, they do.
Grazie. - 20?<eos> - Can you change 50? - Don't even make eye contact.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Do you have a lighter?<eos> That's terrible.<eos> We should buy you some clothes now.<eos> - Why do you hate my shirt?<eos> - You don't listen.<eos> - Oh, I listen.<eos> - No, you still don't.
Who the fuck is this guy?<eos> Where do you think I got these fingers from?<eos> You're still really pretty as an Ottoman peasant.<eos> Look at... look at this guy.<eos> "Stop! Stop hitting me!"<eos> I wanted to show you something even older than me.<eos> I saw this on The Learning Channel.<eos> It was a bomb shelter during World War II.<eos> Yeah, mention World War II and every American becomes a historian.<eos> Oh, do they?
You reprogram one of the gates?<eos> Crack the surveillance?<eos> Leave the whip.<eos> You know the rules and why they exist.<eos> Everything in Vega has a purpose.<eos> That's how the city survives.<eos> Founding law.<eos> "For the protection and good of all, gates are inviolable."<eos> We have a right to leave.<eos> We all do.
Yeah, um, now's not a good time.<eos> Yeah, I'm coming in just the same.<eos> Fred, no.<eos> Wait.<eos> I...<eos> We've known each other a long time, Gary.<eos> You're hurting.<eos> I know that.<eos> A lot of folks know that.<eos> Yeah, do they?
Sure hope he's got an ace up his sleeve.<eos> Sir, the boatswain's mates have loaded pilot chutes into launchers.<eos> Strong enough breeze, and we'll shoot them high enough to engage the larger chutes.<eos> That should give us just enough speed to turn the prop and get electricity.<eos> - Won't help us make water, but...<eos> - So where's the wind?<eos> Gator said the wind was coming.<eos> It's gotta come, right?<eos> I'm guessing the navy told you about my car accident.<eos> Yeah. Yeah. They did.
Why did he spare me?<eos> There must be a purpose, some reason.<eos> Well, that's what I told myself.<eos> That's how I woke up every day and put one foot in front of the other.<eos> It was faith that got me through.<eos> But these past weeks, that faith has been replaced with certainty.<eos> I am here for a reason, as are you, as is everyone aboard this ship.<eos> You are here to lead us, And we are here to follow, to execute your vision.<eos> I don't have a vision.<eos> You do.
I would just hack in 100-hour stretches, I'd sleep for 4.<eos> I was an addict... Not a killer.<eos> So you're saying desoxyn caused you to sign a confession to 8 murders?<eos> Yes.<eos> Look, here's something you don't know.<eos> The man who arrested me, detective Bob Cooper, he found my pills and then he introduced me to the good stuff, the I.V. stuff.<eos> And the more prostitutes I confessed to killing, based on information that he fed me, the higher the dose.<eos> And I never fully sobered up until last year when I discovered Buddhism, but by then it was too late.<eos> No one would listen.<eos> But the Star Chamber did.
The Black Queen only.<eos> Just set up an Internet relay chat room, and from there they can arrange a meeting on neutral turf.<eos> There are millions if IRC channels.<eos> I need a name.<eos> Hashtag hail to the king.<eos> You really think he's innocent?<eos> I know he's hiding something, but I couldn't let him know that.<eos> Ok, we got what we needed.<eos> How do we play it to our advantage?<eos> We don't.
No.<eos> Ok.<eos> Why don't you, uh... prove it?<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm going to kiss you.<eos> Ok.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We have a lot to talk about.<eos> Yes, we do.
Even if they're a cold-blooded killer?<eos> The drugs had taken over my boy.<eos> I know my son.<eos> And what happened that evening, that wasn't who he was.<eos> I thought I knew my son, too.<eos> Emma tried to warn me that he needed help.<eos> Small things...<eos> I didn't listen.<eos> Mrs. Clark, do you think we're reunited with loved ones after death?<eos> Yes, I do.
Well, she wouldn't hide anything too far out of reach.<eos> All right, 4 digits.<eos> Any ideas.<eos> Henry's birthday is November 12.<eos> 1112 that's too easy.<eos> Try 2008, the year she became a mom.<eos> Yep.<eos> What's integrity?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But someone does.
- I don't know. - Yeah.<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> Nobody knows anything.<eos> This'll keep him sedated.<eos> It'll lower his fever and rehydrate him.<eos> I'll be back to replace the bag in a couple of hours.<eos> I will do it.<eos> You just find out what is actually wrong with him.<eos> Sir, you need to lockdown the ship.<eos> No, he does not.
She's Julia's mother.<eos> Your mother'?<eos> Just let me make sure she's all right.<eos> Go.<eos> I always knew you were capable of murder, but mass murder?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Don't know about an outbreak in Puerto Rico?<eos> Narvik-A.<eos> You don't know about that?<eos> Of course he does.
Level E.<eos> Daniel?<eos> Miksa.<eos> I'm his brother.<eos> And you must be the child thief.<eos> Tulok, no!<eos> We came to help these people.<eos> Help how?<eos> Sergio says you don't have enough snowmobiles to evacuate.<eos> Now you do.
- Rose.<eos> - Look at this.<eos> There's a hidden wall. It's a passageway.<eos> It's a secret passageway into our bedroom.<eos> Yes.<eos> I finally know what they're doing. It is an old building with old rooms.<eos> There's nothing secret about that.<eos> Don't use that tone with me.<eos> I know what they want, Guy.<eos> I finally do.
- I know. I'm just trying to defuse the tension.<eos> Here we go, guys.<eos> - Oh, yeah!<eos> - Three more mojitos.<eos> Yum!<eos> Aren't these yum?<eos> I didn't even drink the first one.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> 'Cause I don't think it drank itself.<eos> No, it did not.
Here.<eos> Answer me. How does Santa Claus get to all of those houses?<eos> Okay, sweetie, the adults are talking right now, and look what daddy brought you.<eos> Mitchell, when somebody tells me something, I can't wait to get home and tell you.<eos> Don't you feel the same?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> But he -- he made me promise.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> We don't have to share secrets.<eos> We don't.
The father who apparently you are in collusion with!<eos> You're both trying to cover for whoever got shot!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I don't believe you!<eos> I don't care!<eos> Asked and answered... she has made her statement twice.<eos> Why are you harassing her?<eos> Because my job is to make sure that everybody is telling the truth, and she is not!<eos> You don't know that.<eos> The hell I don't!
It's weird.<eos> - It's more than weird.<eos> Something bigger's going on here, don't you think?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Come check this out.<eos> This is surveillance from that security camera at the entrance of the roller coaster repair yard.<eos> Ted enters alone at 8:47 P.M.<eos> Did anyone enter prior to that?<eos> No.<eos> But about 15 minutes later at 9:04 P.M., someone does.
Yoo-hoo! And about that, I was hoping that you and I could discuss our terms?<eos> I...<eos> But Cherlene...<eos> Is exhausted. As is my drink.<eos> Why do we always have to share a room?<eos> The sinister gay cabal, Cyril. You have fallen victim to the sinister gay cabal.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know... I don't know why we always get stuck together.<eos> But I kinda don't mind it.<eos> Actually, I don't either, now that I...
And you, sir, will keep a civil tongue in your head when you are addressing the first lady of the government-in-exile of La República de San Marcos.<eos> And also country music.<eos> I facetiously beg milady's pardon. Oh!<eos> Milady facetiously grants it.<eos> Oh, goody.<eos> Now let's steal a car, go join the rebels, then come back here and crush Cyril's stupid army.<eos> You make it sound so easy.<eos> Well, it's Cyril.<eos> Unless he's got a nuclear warhead in his pants...<eos> Which he totally does.
That's right. I did some recon on you while I was in flight.<eos> And?<eos> Well, based on what I found out, I was expecting you to be a little more dead.<eos> Well, I'm here, and I don't have much time.<eos> I have a few questions to ask you about--<eos> Borz Altan?<eos> He did security work for me for four months in Eastern Europe.<eos> That's kind of vague.<eos> I think you can do better.<eos> Do you?
I know it.<eos> Can you deliver there?<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> Anna?<eos> Mary, what are you doing out here at this hour?<eos> Looking for you.<eos> I know what you've been doing.<eos> It's time we talked, don't you think?<eos> Did you know that Abraham's brother Thomas and I were originally supposed to be married?<eos> Yes, I did.
Listen, I... came here intending to ask you to hang a petticoat.<eos> I bear gifts from New York.<eos> What'd you find out?<eos> Well, that while the Royal Army prepares to stand down for the winter, a brigade of Hessian mercenaries 1,500 strong readies to march to Trenton.<eos> Gold.<eos> It's gold.<eos> I gotta get this back to Ben right away.<eos> We'll help get you out.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> I do.
This is my mom and dad all over again.<eos> Barney, if you start brewing your own beer now<eos> - and nail my prom date, so help me...<eos> - Years too late on one of those, Teddy.<eos> Guys, it's okay.<eos> This isn't a failed marriage.<eos> It's a very successful marriage that happened to only last three years.<eos> You both want this?<eos> For real?<eos> We do.
Let's look at the facts here.<eos> You made us sit down and listen to this story about how you met mom.<eos> Yet mom's hardly in the story.<eos> No. This is a story about how you're totally in love with Aunt Robin.<eos> And you're thinking about asking her out, and you want to know if we're okay with it.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> I kept this story short and to the point, and you guys still missed it.<eos> The point of the story is that... Is that you totally, totally, totally have the hots for Aunt Robin.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yes, you do.
I'll be back by morning.<eos> You won't want to touch any of this while I'm gone.<eos> Mr. Holmes.<eos> Coded text messages, frequency jammer, meeting in an unfinished sewage treatment plant-- you must be the most security-conscious<eos> Web developer at Lantara.<eos> My superiors insisted we not be seen together.<eos> You're meant to understand that this is, by no means, an invitation for you to visit our office again.<eos> We saw the records you found.<eos> We had to make sure we didn't have a breach, a backdoor into our system.<eos> We don't.
Ladies and gentlemen!<eos> The Great Houdini will escape from this trunk... confined by these handcuffs.<eos> Yeah.<eos> His handcuffs.<eos> Fake.<eos> That's right.<eos> Well, if I had a pair of cuffs from these premises...<eos> I would happily-<eos> There you go, magic man.<eos> Now you do.
You're still here.<eos> Yeah, I told the chief I'd hang out and help out a little bit.<eos> Great.<eos> Hey, you got any aspirin? What? Why?<eos> Are you feeling the...<eos> It's the headache.<eos> People get them all the time.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Um, I actually do in my purse.
[Sighs] Angry at me 'cause I didn't do enough to help.<eos> But I tried.<eos> I really did.<eos> Look, I don't want the money, so you can have it, and... [sighs]<eos> Yeah. That... that means so much to me and my family,<eos> I can't even tell you.<eos> Thank you. Of course, yeah.<eos> What if I can't do it?<eos> Every time I put the mask on, I get claustrophobic.<eos> Yeah, everyone does at first.
Now, get that pillow under his head.<eos> Ready, push it now.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, let's get you some air, sir.<eos> Some people need help, even when they don't realize it.<eos> Uh, not so fast, Christopher.<eos> This just in from headquarters for you.<eos> For me?<eos> Says "Christopher Herrmann" on the front, doesn't it?<eos> That it does.
It's an important job.<eos> - I can do both.<eos> - Not necessary.<eos> Jones graduated at the top of her academy class.<eos> I'm sure she can figure out a little basic home ec.<eos> Am I gonna be judged for my efforts on the job or behind the stove?<eos> It's all part of the job, Jones.<eos> Okay.<eos> Jones, when you're finished up in here, the showers need cleaning.<eos> No, they don't.
And I know, because you'll be an extraordinary king.<eos> She made an excuse.<eos> It's not why she left, I know it.<eos> Then she's a liar.<eos> Why would you want her? Because I love her, Despite everything that she's done.<eos> And because I sense your hand in this.<eos> I don't think the innkeeper believed our story.<eos> That we were attacked by bandits?<eos> Honest people don't ride through the woods.<eos> Honest, foolish people do.
Any information you have might help us close this case.<eos> So do me a favor, will you?<eos> Do you, do you recognize this woman?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> She was the last person to see John alive.<eos> We think that she passed him some information.<eos> I've never seen her before.<eos> All I know is John was working on an investigative piece.<eos> Something to do with computer hacking and domestic intelligence gathering.
Could be my dad's suit.<eos> He died in it. He died in it?<eos> Oh, man.<eos> They just sent the location. Man, this dude is cautious.<eos> If I show up one minute late or I'm not alone, he's done with me.<eos> This is your last shot. I can't let the Pontiac bandit get away.<eos> Put a wire on him, get a tactical team in as backup.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> Doug Judy and I know this guy. You have to trust us.<eos> Do I?
No, no, no.<eos> She's trying to help me.<eos> She's trying to seduce you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Norman.<eos> Norman.<eos> Then why didn't she close the door?<eos> Because...<eos> Because she knows you're watching her.<eos> She does not.
She's trying to help me.<eos> She's trying to seduce you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Norman.<eos> Norman.<eos> Then why didn't she close the door?<eos> Because...<eos> Because she knows you're watching her.<eos> She does not.<eos> Of course she does.
And the people being protected need to realize that being safe can cost you something.<eos> But it beats the hell out of the alternative.<eos> I assume we're not here to take in a matinee.<eos> This is for your ears only.<eos> Five months ago an Islamist terror cell-- same one responsible for the bombing in London the other day-- had plans to do some damage here.<eos> What happened?<eos> On a tip, we located the bomb components in a locker at Penn Station.<eos> That tip was provided by one of my officers in the International Liaison Program.<eos> FBI didn't have the intel, or Interpol, or the CIA.<eos> Only we did.
Oh... Come on, knock it off.<eos> Get in there.<eos> We're here for business.<eos> So how can Thorpe help you?<eos> You been watching the news?<eos> The latest victim of the knockout game was a pregnant woman just a few blocks from here.<eos> Terrible, terrible.<eos> Senseless.<eos> They just said she lost the baby.<eos> Yeah, she did.
Your whole department.<eos> That's not the issue.<eos> The issue is his name is on my desk because his old man is a drinking buddy of yours.<eos> And so what the hell is so bad about that?<eos> I don't work that way!<eos> Well, maybe you ought to.<eos> Pop, I'm not going back to the last century where the top spots went to the guys with hooks.<eos> Nobody's asking you to.<eos> And by the way, it worked just fine.<eos> No, Pop... it didn't.
What about it?<eos> What if it wasn't like that?<eos> What if we told her?<eos> Told her what?<eos> About us?<eos> Jack.<eos> Uh, the other day was lovely.<eos> But I think we should just leave it at that.<eos> And what if I wanted more than that?<eos> You don't.
Every place that you burglarized, you, uh, you went straight for the jewelry and the cash, no DVD players, no TVs, no art, nothing you couldn't just stick in your pocket.<eos> And I did my time for that.<eos> I'm out of here in 64 days.<eos> I spent a lot of time looking at your robbery pattern and Michelle Lowe's crime scene. You know what I noticed?<eos> I noticed that there was no jewelry in her apartment and her bedroom window was open.<eos> A lot of people leave their windows open.<eos> Yeah, you would know, 'cause that's how you enter.<eos> And then you hit the jewelry, and then you exit through the front door.<eos> Every time. I don't know why you're looking to jam me up.<eos> I did my time.
Morning, Baker.<eos> Morning, sir.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Better. Thank you.<eos> There's a decision to be made.<eos> I'm afraid there is.<eos> Detective Reagan and Officer Reagan are both scheduled to work today.<eos> You asked me not to request changes.<eos> So you didn't.
They think he's responsible for Elspeth's disappearance.<eos> Seth Wake was her lover, that much he admits.<eos> He says they were planning to run away together.<eos> He waited outside, she didn't turn up.<eos> He can't have done it.<eos> The supposition is that Elspeth changed her mind, told him she wasn't coming, they argued, he killed her.<eos> I don't believe he did anything to Elspeth.<eos> But I know he didn't do anything to Charlotte.<eos> He doesn't have an alibi.<eos> Yes, he does.
Mrs. McCarthy speaking.<eos> Mrs. McCarthy, tell the Father, I'm bringing charges for wasting police time. But, sir!<eos> Victor McKinley's upstairs.<eos> Out cold.<eos> Looks like suicide.<eos> Why can't they hear us?<eos> This place was built to be soundproof.<eos> The priests hiding down here were only safe if they couldn't be heard.<eos> -And how did they get out?<eos> -They didn't!
I knew it.<eos> Sex club.<eos> - I'll wear my crotchless teddy.<eos> - Uh, cocktail attire.<eos> Wear something warm in case we want to hang outside.<eos> Ah, I've never been to an outdoor sex club.<eos> Oh, yeah, you know what?<eos> Speaking of romantic, intimate getaways-- my mom.<eos> She wanted us to come grill tonight.<eos> - She did?
I picked yours up for you and stuck it in there.<eos> Oh, cool.<eos> Thank you, man.<eos> _<eos> Gallagher... you made bail.<eos> Hey. You bailed me out?<eos> - Carl called me.<eos> - My brother Carl?<eos> Said he didn't know any other rich people.<eos> He probably doesn't.
I have to get something off my chest.<eos> Okay.<eos> I am in a lot of pain.<eos> I know.<eos> You may know, but s... sometimes I suspect that you think... I'm this uncooperative old bitch... who's just making all of this up.<eos> Do you want to get better?<eos> Really?<eos> No bullshit.<eos> Do you want to?<eos> I do.
Right? The kid with the horrible nickname?<eos> It was a horrible nickname.<eos> [gasps] Mucus!<eos> What?<eos> I just remembered what the girls call the pale kid...<eos> Mucus.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Marcus is Mucus!<eos> - We got to go to the party.<eos> - We do! - 15 minutes.
It wasn't...rational.<eos> It was like a reflex.<eos> What about T.J. Karsten?<eos> Was he with you?<eos> I didn't tell T.J., but I followed him from the restaurant.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, 'cause T.J. was emotional.<eos> Lou was under siege.<eos> I wanted to make sure things didn't escalate.<eos> But they did?
Turns out you're a violent offender.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Back on the case.<eos> Reward for not giving up.<eos> Now...<eos> I want to know what really happened.<eos> I already gave my statement.<eos> I read it. It's a good story.<eos> Guy with a story like that could walk out of here with no jail time, but somehow, something doesn't seem right.<eos> Oh, it never does with you.
He betrayed all of us...<eos> T.J., me, you... - No.<eos> - ...especially you.<eos> We're not talking about that.<eos> That's not it.<eos> Then what are we talking about?<eos> It's not as simple as you think.<eos> The very fact that they arrested him means that they... Jack wasn't arrested.<eos> He went in and confessed.<eos> Did he?
Call me if your conscience returns.<eos> Hi.<eos> My name's Sara Hanley.<eos> I was hoping you kept a record of my stay in September.<eos> Oh, from September, no.<eos> But I check every guest in myself, and I never forget a face.<eos> Now, you, you have a very nice face, but I don't remember it.<eos> - Well, I didn't come up to the desk.<eos> But...<eos> He did.
Come in.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I couldn't keep lying anymore.<eos> I think it's time to tell the truth.<eos> - I think you're right.<eos> - No, he's not.<eos> We can't tell anyone about this.<eos> We have to keep this between us.<eos> Jack has a plan.<eos> He always does.
No.<eos> This will remind you of what it's like to be a human.<eos> This will remind you of who you are.<eos> In the most basic sense.<eos> Right?<eos> There's nothing more real than this, right?<eos> There's nothing more real than... pain.<eos> Not just emotional pain, but real physical pain, right?<eos> Do you feel that... that killing innocent people is a solution?<eos> Yeah, I do.
They are the voices that are crying out in the wilderness.<eos> And they are the ones that the State intends to murder.<eos> We have no democracy any more.<eos> We can't say what's on our mind.<eos> This very interview is enough to land me in jail with no trial.<eos> Forever.<eos> They'll throw me in Guantanamo.<eos> It's not our voice any more.<eos> Well, don't you feel you could change that?<eos> No, I don't.
My mom...!<eos> I'll have yours now, Simpson.<eos> In Ga'hoole, we would break his frickin' knees.<eos> No.<eos> No Valentine for you, Nelson.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I'll give a Valentine to a loser, I'll give a Valentine to a dork, I'll even give a Valentine to a girl, but I won't give a Valentine to a bully!<eos> Here's what's gonna happen.<eos> You have one week to make me the best Valentine any kid ever got.<eos> And what if I don't?
Please, we were just role-playing.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> My husband and I, we've been having problems.<eos> We went to see a counselor, and she suggested role-playing.<eos> Then we went to a hotel just-just like this one.<eos> He'd be the cop, and I'd be the high-priced call girl.<eos> It cost me a fortune at Frederick's.<eos> It was just something he wanted to do 'cause it reminded him of some Burt Reynolds movie that he loves.<eos> - I didn't know any of that.<eos> - Yes, but you did!
Trick-or-treat for UNICEF?<eos> He's my son.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, where's Mom?<eos> It's just me and the boy.<eos> What about that girl?<eos> She was driving the RV, remember?<eos> Seth.<eos> You two like to play dress-up?<eos> No, we do not.
Why don't you talk some sense into your son before I have to take my brother's advice?<eos> Son, put the gun down!<eos> - Dad, this is bullshit!<eos> - I know how you feel!<eos> You want to protect the family, but this isn't the way!<eos> They're bullies and they're assholes and they don't deserve to win!<eos> As soon as we get across that border, they're gonna bury us in the desert!<eos> And I know you think I can't do it. - But I can.<eos> Now, I know that you thought you could.<eos> I do.
About what?<eos> You'll have to ask him.<eos> The principal will be with you in just a moment.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Castle, none of this adds up.<eos> What were those girls so afraid of?<eos> What happened in that cafeteria?<eos> I'd offer a theory, but I'm too busy having detention flashbacks.<eos> You must've spent a lot of time in this hallway.<eos> More than I did in class.
All right, I gotta go.<eos> It's such a surprise to see you, sir.<eos> Are you saying I'm a sight for sore eyes, Luiz?<eos> You didn't think I'd come back?<eos> Let's just say I was worried you'd get a better offer, sir.<eos> Understood.<eos> Speaking of better offers, sounds like you got through.<eos> We kept trying but weren't able to.<eos> Too much metal interference.<eos> Actually I did, Gunny.
And then I was not born ready for a while, But now I'm back to being born ready.<eos> Yes! The ebony falcon soars again.<eos> The ebony falcon.<eos> His feathers are muscles.<eos> Let's talk strategy later tonight at my house.<eos> My wife's working late, I'm on daddy duty.<eos> But you're ready for this, right?<eos> I just need to put my precious babies to bed with a story.<eos> The ebony falcon needs to read go, dog, go.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Jacoby wanted to do wind sprints outside.<eos> You know, he's a mean dude, but I think I'm making progress.<eos> He asked to borrow my squat belt, I told him no,<eos> Okay, but let's build up that relationship slowly, okay?<eos> We don't want to jump the gun and spook him.<eos> (brandon) whew! 'sup?<eos> Good workout.<eos> You know, it's weird I never worked out with you before.<eos> What'd you say your regular gym was?<eos> I didn't.
You have to take the prize, Seth.<eos> What were you two lovebirds gonna do?<eos> Go buy that stupid bar in the Keys - that she's always squawking about?<eos> - Moron.<eos> Do you honestly think that I would be here if I was gonna bail on you?<eos> Does that make sense?<eos> It was the opposite.<eos> I paid her to stay away.<eos> She was supposed to cross with us, you remember that? Yeah, yeah.<eos> But, no, she didn't...
Because we didn't check his lo-jack.<eos> I did.<eos> It didn't. He had it disabled.<eos> The last thing he wanted Was for someone to be able to track him.<eos> How could i not have known who he was?<eos> I don't know if i can do this.<eos> I'm drowning, holder.<eos> You have to.<eos> We got no choice.<eos> Yeah, we do.
- What do you think?<eos> Let's just say that he's been gone most nights for a very long time now.<eos> What am I doing here, Carl?<eos> What is this about?<eos> Just a few more questions. Then I'll be out of your hair.<eos> When you last saw him, Jen, he was driving his own car, right?<eos> - Dark gray sedan?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Does James have an eye for younger women?<eos> Heh, what men don't?
- He's almost as tall as you.<eos> - What?<eos> So did you find him on your travels in the big wide world, Linden?<eos> The bad guy.<eos> There is no bad guy.<eos> There's just...<eos> I don't know, life.<eos> We tried at least.<eos> You gotta give us credit for trying.<eos> Yeah, we did.
He shot someone.<eos> What?<eos> He shot Sara.<eos> He tried to kill her.<eos> I remember [chuckles] one of our first dates.<eos> You, um...<eos> You dared me to go on a polar swim in the lake.<eos> You counted to three, and you jumped in.<eos> I stood there.<eos> [ Chuckles ] And you actually did it.
"Husband, Clark Westerfeld"...<eos> double check.<eos> Husband's occupation?<eos> Hall monitor for the goddamn FBI!<eos> Martha... can I be a little bit of a Betty Butt-insky?<eos> Yes, Jennifer, you're family.<eos> I just... I know Clark, and I know how much<eos> - his job means to him. - But I'm his wife!<eos> I should mean more to him than some dumb job!<eos> And you do.
No.<eos> Have you been truthful with me?<eos> Yes.<eos> _<eos> How are you doing?<eos> I'm all right.<eos> This machine is like a camera.<eos> If you smile, does the camera know if you are happy?<eos> - No.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
This machine is like a camera.<eos> If you smile, does the camera know if you are happy?<eos> - No.<eos> - No, it doesn't.<eos> It can't read your thoughts.<eos> It has no brain.<eos> If you prefer, think of it as an insect, a wasp.<eos> When a wasp lands on your arm, you're afraid, no?<eos> You hold your breath, and you wait for it to fly off.<eos> And when it doesn't, what do you do?
I have value to you, to the cause.<eos> Try it.<eos> I had a grand, old time.<eos> Call me anytime.<eos> Can I get you something? Yeah.<eos> I'll have whatever he had.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> The bathroom floor is a heater, and there's a jacuzzi in the bathtub.<eos> You want to take a decadent jacuzzi with me in our decadent bathtub?<eos> I do.
I want to see the seat of power.<eos> Does that turn you on?<eos> Mm, I want to rub my tetas all over the Congressman's desk.<eos> Are you going to open this door, Carl, or don't you have a key?<eos> Of course I have the key, but we c--<eos> - Or maybe you don't have the cojones then?<eos> - No?<eos> Maybe you should check.<eos> I thought you wanted to, uh...<eos> I do.
You don't?<eos> I don't care if people are motivated by ideology or money.<eos> Money can be cleaner, less complicated.<eos> Blackmail, however, seldom leads to a happy conclusion.<eos> If Larrick didn't kill Emmett and Leanne, who do we look at next?<eos> Me.<eos> I got involved with someone while I was working with Emmett and Leanne.<eos> I didn't plan on it, but... this business can be lonely.<eos> I didn't tell him who I really was, of course.<eos> Until one day, I did.
He could be on his way to a collapsed lung.<eos> Mom, those things, they're not going to leave until the sun's up.<eos> At the rate he's bleeding, he's not gonna make it that long.<eos> We got to get him to the hospital.<eos> Should we call Stiles's Dad?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is that going to just get more people hurt?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't think guns work on them.<eos> Then what does?
'Cause after one night, I've changed my mind about this place being safe for me.<eos> Or anyone.<eos> Ever.<eos> No.<eos> No, I think you're wrong.<eos> I really think I should tell them.<eos> They're going to want to know the story.<eos> The whole story.<eos> I really think they should know.<eos> Yes, I do.
Why that kanji?<eos> Why "self"?<eos> To signify that he died as himself.<eos> Because Rhys wasn't a monster.<eos> Not like you.<eos> If I'm such a monster, why'd you call off the oni?<eos> What happened to the woman who called out for chaos, strife and pain to descend upon everyone and everything?<eos> What happened?<eos> I don't want that anymore.<eos> I do.
Ethan's at the school.<eos> Go.<eos> Oh, I hope he gets there in time.<eos> I like the twins.<eos> Short tempers.<eos> Homicidal compulsions.<eos> They're a lot more fun than you bakemono trying to save the world every day.<eos> Doc, you brought something to paralyze his body.<eos> You got anything for his mouth?<eos> Yes, I do.
In the game of Go, it's what we call a truly inspired, or out-of-the-box move.<eos> The Nogitsune has had sente, the advantage, until this point.<eos> What you need is a divine move in order to turn the game around.<eos> Okay, so is anyone feeling divinely inspired?<eos> Mom, you said you trapped it in a glass jar, right?<eos> It wasn't the jar that trapped it.<eos> It was where I buried it.<eos> The Nemeton.<eos> A place I don't know too much about.<eos> Who does?

Previously on Teen Wolf.<eos> One of them is standing right behind me.<eos> That's Meredith.<eos> She's a little weird.<eos> Where did the Nogitsune come from?<eos> It was an internment camp during World War II.<eos> What happened to the woman who called out for chaos, strife and pain?<eos> - I don't want that anymore.<eos> - I do.
It gets a little better.<eos> Let's grab a drink.<eos> What about Angie?<eos> She's not gonna be coming back.<eos> Mom!<eos> Hey!<eos> Babe!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Oh. Oscar said you could use some quality time.<eos> Oh, he did, huh?
Meaning the victim was turned and reaching toward the passenger.<eos> What-what are you doing?<eos> Reenacting the accident.<eos> Quite well, I thought. In that case,<eos> I will continue the reenactment. Mm-hmm.<eos> And posit that the driver and the passenger were grappling with one another.<eos> Wait.<eos> A struggle would also explain the cause of the accident.<eos> Do you not agree, Dr. Fuentes?<eos> I do.
Sometimes, when I'd drop off Otis, you know, we'd sit on her deck and talk.<eos> Talk?<eos> What did you talk about?<eos> She... she mention anybody coming around here?<eos> Was she afraid of anyone, any strangers?<eos> No, mostly she just talked about how messed up things are for her here.<eos> Messed up how?<eos> Well, how she wanted to move out. How she and her stepmom fought a lot.<eos> And she said that one time she saw the stepmom and the trainer, like... you know.<eos> No, I don't.
I think they're symbolic of something else.<eos> All right.<eos> What?<eos> I don't know yet. But we're looking for someone who is obviously trying to send a message.<eos> You wanted to see me, Ms. Wick?<eos> Yes, Dr. Brennan.<eos> I completed a preliminary examination of the victim's entire skeleton, and I found a remodeled fracture on the left humerus.<eos> Do you have the X-rays?<eos> I'd like to see...<eos> I do indeed.
'Cause they were laughing.<eos> Let's go play, Cameron.<eos> You guys wanna see something fun?<eos> Huh?<eos> Okay, go.<eos> Playtime's over.<eos> Go play with your parents.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I thought Joe told you to leave.<eos> Oh, he did.
I don't know anything about her being inside the brothel.<eos> That is the one and only time<eos> So, um, this is the sp.<eos> She was right here next to her car.<eos> I-I didn't see her until after I threw the trash in the Dumpster and was headed back inside.<eos> Why didn't you call it in, man?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> I went and told Madam Suzanne.<eos> I thought she'd call it in.<eos> But she didn't.
Still horribly written, though.<eos> And yet... it's still better than anything I could write.<eos> I... never was.<eos> No. - I stop pretending that I'm something I'm not, and I can't go to Venezuela.<eos> I'll only disappoint a new group of people.<eos> So what are you going to do?<eos> Well, I suspect I don't have much time left on this Earth, but whatever time I do have, I know I want it to be better than this.<eos> So you have a plan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I do.
Detective Brian Lucas.<eos> I'm afraid I've got some bad news.<eos> Oh, my God, this can't be happening.<eos> I know, it's a shock.<eos> We do have a few questions to ask you, though, okay?<eos> There were, uh, cinder blocks in your car, as well as a coil of rope.<eos> And your trunk was lined with plastic.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> I-I'm sorry, I don't know...<eos> But no, I-I didn't.
Take them to Xiong's man, Yuan Chonghuan, as reward from the Palace.<eos> Master.<eos> Are you going to Liaodong?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you know,<eos> General Xiong is a patriot?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you know,<eos> Wudang... has never done any harm.<eos> I do.
Hey, why'd the pounding stop?<eos> - What are they gonna do now?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> No.<eos> We don't breach.<eos> I won't risk that.<eos> Leave them there, start your rounds.<eos> We start at the top.<eos> Work our way down.<eos> And do it again.
Time's up.<eos> Who do you want to kill first, Rumple?<eos> He's not killing anyone.<eos> If you want to fight someone, Zelena, fight me.<eos> Sorry, dear.<eos> I don't dance with amateurs.<eos> - I'm not an amateur. I'm the Savior.<eos> Appears someone's got an inflated sense of self-worth.<eos> Anybody else want to give it a go?<eos> [Regina] I do.
Sonmanto holds a number of safe deposit boxes and uses them primarily as back-up for pending patents, contracts, etc.<eos> Well it will be very helpful to our investigation to know exactly what's been removed.<eos> I checked the records as soon as we knew about the robbery.<eos> That particular box was empty.<eos> As I mentioned, we have more than a few.<eos> You do know that impeding a police investigation is a very serious offense.<eos> And you know that as a Fortune500 company, we have a full complement of lawyers that can back-up my truthful and helpful statement. But why go there.<eos> Liber8 is behind this robbery Mr. Richardson.<eos> You don't want them having anything of yours.<eos> And they don't.
He doesn't look so tough.<eos> Val.<eos> Karate Kid, stop.<eos> - Hi-ya!<eos> - No!<eos> See?<eos> I stopped a fraction of an inch before contact.<eos> - I trained for years to learn that trick.<eos> - You might have broken the ice.<eos> I didn't, did I?
If only I had been more willing to be brave, I would have stopped Lex Luthor... before he escaped the 31st century.<eos> We make lousy superheroes. Yes.<eos> We are nothing like the Justice League.<eos> I wish we'd have just disappeared like they did.<eos> Yes, perhaps it would have been better.<eos> Wait, that's it.<eos> Are you thinking what I am thinking?<eos> - That this tunnel really reeks?<eos> - No.<eos> Yes, it does.
That's all?<eos> You plan on going after Patty and getting yourself...<eos> Empty.<eos> Still too cheap to buy shells, huh?<eos> Get out.<eos> You made my life hell then - and ever since.<eos> - I made your life hell?<eos> You killed two men in this town.<eos> You have any idea how people look at you when - they think your son's a killer?<eos> - I didn't do it.
If I'd understood, I never would have said...<eos> Well, great.<eos> Naomi's walking out on Jimmy, and now you're walking out on me.<eos> - It's freakin' kismet.<eos> - Listen to me!<eos> I'm not walking out on you.<eos> But we can't get married just because you're screwed up about your dad.<eos> Don't use him as an excuse for cold feet.<eos> If you don't want to get married, just say so.<eos> I don't!
They wondered why.<eos> So your deep, dark secret is that you've spent the last 30 years paying for an accident that happened - when you were a teenager?<eos> - Because I put him there.<eos> And then you became a neurosurgeon, like a superhero.<eos> And now the president of the United States has hand-picked you to carve out the future of medicine.<eos> I have no room to be angry here, but this is infuriating!<eos> Well, if I could turn it down, I would.<eos> You know what would help me?<eos> If you would just stop talking about your duty to God and country and just admit that you want to do this.<eos> I do.
Please, Mike?<eos> It would make up for the hostile resting face.<eos> Thank you!<eos> You give it a shot with the dog for two weeks.<eos> Really try, and if you guys don't bond, we'll seriously talk about finding him a different home.<eos> Yeah, I'd love to say that a cutting board to the face was the end of Axl and Sue's epic fight.<eos> But unfortunately, it was just the beginning.<eos> No!<eos> This did not just happen!<eos> Oh, yeah, it did.
Wow.<eos> So, um, roughly how long ago did you lose him?<eos> Huh, let's see.<eos> About two months ago.<eos> You'd think if somebody found him, they'd do the humane thing and put up fliers, right?<eos> Well, you know, tape doesn't hold very well in this weather.<eos> There you go, West.<eos> See? Good things happen when you shoot the ball.<eos> Who's got the best power forward in the league?<eos> We do.

He's in jail.<eos> You don't have to be afraid of him.<eos> I'm not.<eos> What is it then?<eos> Is someone gonna come take me away, too?<eos> Nobody's gonna come and take you away.<eos> Why would you even think that?<eos> Because... I'm different.<eos> People think I'm strange.<eos> No, they don't.
A gene.<eos> It's the source of your burden.<eos> I can make it a blessing.<eos> Hey. Wake up, we're almost there.<eos> - I had such a good dream.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> About what?<eos> My mom.<eos> Thought you never met her.<eos> I didn't.
Okay, thank you very much, sir.<eos> No, wait, wait, wait, I got a sandwich coming.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Gorgonzola and pear.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you. Ah...<eos> All right, so we know that Barb wasn't at the diner on Monday.<eos> Yeah, she was there, though, today.<eos> Didn't Dean say that she was running late for something?<eos> Yeah, he did.
It's been the two of us ever since.<eos> Sometimes I think about leaving.<eos> Well, you could, you know.<eos> Go someplace better.<eos> And, uh... is that where you went?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is this better?<eos> I had to remove the jawbone in order to get the dental impression, but this is definitely Barb Birk.<eos> I was hoping you'd have more for me.<eos> Oh, I do.
I'm gonna push on and get Padmé.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Such plans I had.<eos> You know, I've spent so much of my life misunderstood.<eos> What will they say about me now?<eos> What will I have left behind?<eos> Clovis, you have to turn yourself in.<eos> It's over, Clovis.<eos> Stay away from me!<eos> I didn't do anything wrong!
- Merci.<eos> Just tell us who won.<eos> The winners are, I am very happy to say...<eos> Max and Deke.<eos> [Both cheering] You were amazing!<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Wait, you do?<eos> Do you...?<eos> Yeah... I do.
All right, let's do this.<eos> I'm ready to rage all night, baby.<eos> Oh, hell no.<eos> I am too old for this.<eos> Sophie, watch your head.<eos> You might wanna take your heels off.<eos> Take my heels off?<eos> Communist Russia couldn't get me to take my heels off.<eos> Hey, Earl, you wanna go get drunk somewhere we don't have to bend over till we want to?<eos> Indeed, I do.
- Oh, Caroline...<eos> - Nicolas, please don't beg.<eos> - I just...<eos> - Maybe another world, another life.<eos> - I want...<eos> - You can't leave your wife for me.<eos> - No, it's just...<eos> - Seriously!<eos> You don't have to say it.<eos> No, I do.
I'm sorry, what?<eos> The man came.<eos> But you didn't shoot him.<eos> Did you?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Great, problem solved.<eos> Let's go.<eos> But he still wants the money.<eos> Yeah...<eos> He does.
This is where he dropped 'em off.<eos> They can't have got far.<eos> We'll find them.<eos> It's so much better to cooperate, isn't it?<eos> You go for a nice drive, breathe some fresh air, and here we are.<eos> The only thing you have to worry about now is that we find them.<eos> Thank you for helping us.<eos> So weird to think of myself as "us."<eos> Do you have someone?<eos> I did.
Who is he?<eos> An ancient creature... who feeds on the blood of his victims.<eos> Like a vampire.<eos> I use the term strigoi.<eos> Which is what?<eos> "Vampire" in-<eos> - Romanian.<eos> Now, take away the cape, the fangs, the accent. He's a predator, a leech, a blemish.<eos> And I know it's hard to believe, but-<eos> Even I didn't at first.
I might've spent some time here a while back.<eos> Then you know about the timer.<eos> We got a problem!<eos> Semtex.<eos> The whole place is rigged to blow.<eos> There's enough explosive to bring down the whole mountain on top of us.<eos> Sir, less than 10 minutes.<eos> It's probably a fail-safe.<eos> If the guards had eliminated us, they'd stop the timer.<eos> Since they didn't...
The site we were supposed to lead him to with our minds?<eos> Blown to pieces, buried under 100 feet of rock.<eos> Seems the only psychic power your buddy has shown is the ability to predict if you tell a rich, entitled dirtbag he's gonna get away with murder, he'll believe it.<eos> Trip.<eos> Girl's gonna live.<eos> Live to testify how a billionaire shot her point blank in the stomach.<eos> Oh, we got a great little home movie of you admitting that, genius.<eos> This Clairvoyant played you and left you to rot.<eos> You said there was good news.<eos> I did?
Why aren't you happy about it?<eos> They told me you were yelling to not use the drug.<eos> To not use it on Skye.<eos> Why?<eos> What made you change your mind?<eos> Phil?<eos> Phil, you all right?<eos> Being down there, seeing where I came from, I just got really scared that she would suffer the way that I did.<eos> But she didn't.<eos> For whatever reason, she didn't.
Yes.<eos> Hey, Jed.<eos> Remind me.<eos> How can you be sure that the little bomb you stuck up my snout's gonna kill me?<eos> Well, Julian, it has the same explosive force as a grenade, so...<eos> And, let's say... If your nephew was standing right beside me.<eos> Stephen's there?<eos> I want an exact location on that kill squad now.<eos> I thought you said no paranormals.<eos> I did.
Why? A good commander always does.<eos> Never trust even your right hand man.<eos> - Right. - Uh-huh.<eos> Keep your eyes peeled.<eos> Be sharp and agile.<eos> OK get to it.<eos> Take off your shoes.<eos> Take off your shoes! Off go the shoes.<eos> - OK we took them off.<eos> - Of course you did.
Back home we'd put some ammonia on it.<eos> Where can we find ammonia on this island?<eos> They say pee contains it.<eos> - Pee?<eos> - Urine.<eos> - Pee on my hand.<eos> Pee on it, Halil Ibo. Pee on it quick.<eos> Pee.<eos> Where are you pissing?<eos> Do it on my hand.
For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you - to eat with strangers at your table.<eos> - One step ahead of you.<eos> Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us.<eos> Very well.<eos> What are the sleeping arrangements?<eos> We've only been dating for three years.<eos> If we were to share a room, people might talk.<eos> I got you your own room.<eos> What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?<eos> It doesn't.
Should we take this little party to the bedroom?<eos> Don't have to.<eos> We have the whole place to ourselves.<eos> - That's true.<eos> - In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon's spot.<eos> That is the least sexy thing anyone's ever said to me.<eos> - To the bedroom! - Yeah!<eos> And for the entrée, tonight's special is a seafood risotto.<eos> - Do you have any questions?<eos> - I do.
I didn't even share any of it with her.<eos> Look, look, anyway, that was-- that was six years ago, and every day I thank God that I'm here instead of back there.<eos> Okay, same time tomorrow.<eos> If you have a court card, come up and I'll sign it.<eos> Hope we didn't disturb you.<eos> Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.<eos> I just-<eos> - I don't have a drug problem.<eos> No, not like I do, but I don't think I do.<eos> I-I really don't.
Let's throw him in the river!<eos> I suppose it's proof of our fallen nature.<eos> We can't help but to look.<eos> They were monsters.<eos> If you ask me you were justified in hanging them.<eos> I didn't ask.<eos> You must find someplace where you can avoid all this.<eos> Such sights will endanger the child.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> Neither did I.
We need her to stay downstairs.<eos> Be careful.<eos> You, too.<eos> Champagne?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Vincent?<eos> Well, it looks like you have little fans everywhere in America now.<eos> Don't you, Mr. Keller?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
They took Mya.<eos> Sasha's dead.<eos> - This can't be happening.<eos> - Well, he... he's not dead.<eos> That's for sure.<eos> Why do you think Vladimir took Mya?<eos> He said he was taking her to Mr. Chen.<eos> Mr. Chen wanted me, but he took Mya instead.<eos> I don't even know who Mr. Chen is.<eos> Well, I do.
Now, here's every team in the precinct with the number of cases they've closed over the last six months.<eos> And speaking of bottom line, notice where your names fall.<eos> We should be above Willansky, 'cause that says we got 14.<eos> Yeah. That's a smudge.<eos> You've got a four.<eos> Captain Ward, we may be below everyone else, but we've been working on these FBI...<eos> I heard.<eos> Some fancy FBI case.<eos> FBI doesn't pay your salary.<eos> NYPD does.
So we have a serial killer who's playing a game, and every time he makes a move, somebody dies. Yeah.<eos> Well, based on what I can see, the game's just beginning.<eos> I knew you'd be back.<eos> Same old Max.<eos> How many games have you played just staring at that board?<eos> Why don't you sit down...<eos> find out? I told you.<eos> I don't play anymore.<eos> You play every day.<eos> You just don't do it on a chessboard.
Luckily, we have the Internet as a community of...<eos> Oh, this is terrible!<eos> She's quoting scriptures, but using tons of cuss words.<eos> - This is as bad as it gets with Caroline.<eos> - Okay. Berkley's around the corner at his baby's world music class.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> I'm in.<eos> - Great.<eos> - What kind of beer does Berkley like?<eos> - He doesn't.
Little Paris and her Magical Closet.<eos> Those are little-kid toys.<eos> Hold on.<eos> What...?<eos> What did you ask Santa for?<eos> I can't tell you, or else I won't get what I want.<eos> I didn't even tell Dad.<eos> Well, you know, we should probably mail those letters right away, so....<eos> - You know, I could take it for you.<eos> - Dad already did.
Hey. Hey.<eos> Just finished processing the concrete couple's clothes.<eos> That was kind of a sexy little dress she had on there.<eos> Nice shoes, too, although the, uh, soles had speckles of paint on them.<eos> Well, I have a bullet and I have a gun, but I have no way to fire it to make a comparison, because the gun barrel is split like a banana peel.<eos> The expansive mortar got in it.<eos> Yeah. So I've tried something different.<eos> I've Microsiled the inside of the barrel.<eos> That works?<eos> Yes, it does.
Look, Ritter, my daughter is up there.<eos> Now just promise me that you will shut down every single station until we can find out exactly what went wrong.<eos> You have my word.<eos> Just take care of your family, and I'll take care of things up here, okay?<eos> Later. God damn it!<eos> Hey Hector, call your family.<eos> Send them south.<eos> Then head to five, make sure Ritter doesn't do anything stupid.<eos> -I don't trust that guy.<eos> -Who does?
Looks like you got a copycat.<eos> Who you been talking to, Costa?<eos> I never killed anyone.<eos> How could I be copied?<eos> Right. Someone else killed those people, cut out their organs and put their DNA all over you?<eos> Before my medications, I would, uh, have blackouts. I'd lose time.<eos> They said I did it, but in my heart, I know I didn't.<eos> After the fifth appeal, I gave up.<eos> You finally figured out no one believes you?<eos> Someone did.

I'd lose time.<eos> They said I did it, but in my heart, I know I didn't.<eos> After the fifth appeal, I gave up.<eos> You finally figured out no one believes you?<eos> Someone did.<eos> Detective Kennex... he did.
Hope you like it.<eos> Listen...<eos> I know I'm not human, and I could never be what Pelham was to you.<eos> - Hey, Dorian...<eos> - I get it. I really do.<eos> But I'm glad Maldonado put us together.<eos> Am I really the reason that you want to stay on the force?<eos> I... uh, no, I never said that.<eos> To the interviewer you did.<eos> Um, no, no, I didn't.
No!<eos> Runa!<eos> Take her away.<eos> Come on!<eos> Runa!<eos> Please don't take her.<eos> Please stop!<eos> Shivani, don't stretch this case too much.<eos> We have got the man we were looking for.<eos> But we didn't, Sir!
You haven't said anything.<eos> It's huge, Mom.<eos> It's over the top.<eos> Who's paying for it?<eos> Emilio.<eos> - But you're not with Emilio.<eos> - Right.<eos> But is it alright with him?<eos> He doesn't know yet.<eos> He doesn't?
Not until we figure out what to do.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> - Yeah, yes.<eos> - I mean it, I'm serious.<eos> This could end up very badly if this gets out.<eos> Ok.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was... really trying to help.<eos> Well, at least no one knows.<eos> - Ana does.
- I got up in Kyle's face at the dance.<eos> - What?<eos> - Well, you kind of have been a jerk lately.<eos> I know you hate it when I get all sisterly on you and I give you advice and stuff, and I know how much you really wanted to get off your meds, but I gotta tell you, I kind of want my brother back.<eos> - Who was that?<eos> - Maddie from school.<eos> Maddie?<eos> What did she want?<eos> Um... she just wanted to know if I wanted to go see a movie with her next week.<eos> She did?
Oh, my God...<eos> Oh, baby.<eos> I'm so happy.<eos> - You ok?<eos> - Yeah, it's just... it looks like Zac is going to have to move in with his dad for awhile.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - In Arizona.<eos> - That sucks.<eos> - It's ok. - I just want him to be safe.<eos> - Yeah, of course you do.
Uh, Hook, this is a friend of ours... Ariel.<eos> She's looking for someone who didn't return to Storybrooke with the rest of us.<eos> He's from a maritime kingdom, and he loved to sail.<eos> Perhaps... you came across him on the high seas?<eos> His name's Prince Eric.<eos> Sorry, lass.<eos> I wish I could help, but I've never heard of him.<eos> Don't touch anything.<eos> How am I supposed to learn magic if I can't touch anything?<eos> The same way I did with Rumple.
What about him would a 12-year-old boy not like?<eos> I trust him.<eos> He brought me back to Storybrooke, and he didn't have to. Oh.<eos> Of course he brought you back.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Seriously?<eos> You're going to pretend everyone doesn't see the yearning looks and doe-y eyes?<eos> I don't yearn.<eos> Well, maybe.<eos> But he does.
Because I was too ashamed.<eos> I sacrificed saving your prince for my ship.<eos> I am so sorry, Ariel.<eos> You're a coward!<eos> And a monster!<eos> You let a man die for your ship?<eos> ! What kind of person does that?<eos> The kind who's empty, who believes that a ship can fill a void left by a broken heart.<eos> And that makes it okay? !<eos> No, it doesn't.
You let a man die for your ship?<eos> ! What kind of person does that?<eos> The kind who's empty, who believes that a ship can fill a void left by a broken heart.<eos> And that makes it okay? !<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> I would give anything to take it back, to make things right.<eos> Anything?<eos> Yes... anything.<eos> How am I supposed to trust a man who no longer believes in love?<eos> I still do.
Every detail of his life needs to be established, checked and double-checked.<eos> I also believe that Paul Spector is responsible for the deaths of Fiona Gallagher, Alice Monroe and Sarah Kay.<eos> I'd say all of his previous victims were dead within an hour of being attacked.<eos> She's lost to us already?<eos> The one glimmer of hope is that he knows Rose.<eos> Not from watching and stalking, objectifying her.<eos> He really knows her.<eos> And she's a mother.<eos> I feel sorry for you,<eos> I really do.

We talked.<eos> I showed him my son's room.<eos> Why?<eos> At first after I lost Daniel, I wasn't able to go in there.<eos> But then I did.<eos> I wanted Paul to see it.<eos> What happened in Daniel's bedroom?<eos> Was there physical contact between you?<eos> I asked him to hold me.<eos> Did he?
James Tyler?<eos> DC Glen Martin. DC Gail McNally.<eos> Can we have a quick word?<eos> Is it OK I call you Jimmy?<eos> We just want to get your side of things.<eos> Get an account in your own words of what happened the day after Paul Spector called here to see Liz.<eos> - Have you spoken to Liz?<eos> - We haven't.<eos> - Do you know where she is?<eos> Do you?
- Have we checked this building yet?<eos> - Not yet, ma'am.<eos> Those look like Rose Stagg's tyres to you?<eos> Could well be.<eos> We should wait for my team to arrive, ma'am.<eos> She could be in there.<eos> New padlock.<eos> Fetch the bolt cutters-.<eos> I feel sorry for you.<eos> I really do.
Well, we're gonna have this conversation anyway.<eos> What does the drug do?<eos> It's called Vero.<eos> It expands the mind, it opens it up to things that are here that we can't normally see.<eos> It enables you to realize your full potential.<eos> The next Einstein, or Macgregor.<eos> Scarlett and Elinor were deliberately O.D.'d.<eos> Did you kill them?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
I could never get her to believe that.<eos> I didn't want her to take Vero.<eos> It's the only thing we ever fought about.<eos> What happened?<eos> The drug opens up a world of possibilities for chromes.<eos> But for naturals?<eos> Well...<eos> I'll let her tell you.<eos> I know you said I shouldn't take it.<eos> But I did.
Any sign of Agent Landon?<eos> No.<eos> No, and that's what worries me.<eos> You know, I know she's, uh, suspicious of Tori and, you know, maybe me, too.<eos> She knows something strange happened and she knows that we're hiding it from her.<eos> If she finds out, then I'm exposed and you are completely screwed.<eos> Yeah, but I still think that if we can figure out who killed her husband all those years ago, maybe she'll go away.<eos> You know, I know if we find the stolen gem, then we will find the killer.<eos> Okay, but how do we find the gem?<eos> Well, same way that your ancestor did.
Wait, what do I get for my sacrifice?<eos> Curled toes.<eos> So, Gabe, I hear you're leaving.<eos> I'm going to try one of your canapes.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> Weren't you going to tell me?<eos> Of course I was.<eos> I just, um... I didn't, because...<eos> I didn't want you to think that it had anything to do with us.<eos> It doesn't?
Goddamn you.<eos> For more than a thousand years, the world has been my oyster.<eos> And it still can be.<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> I've lost my taste for oysters, Pam.<eos> You should go.<eos> Sarah Newlin.<eos> What about her?<eos> What if I told you Jason Steakhouse let her live?<eos> - He didn't.
- Yeah, that's more than enough.<eos> - Why isn't she healing?<eos> - She hasn't eaten in months.<eos> - None of this is even up for debate.<eos> - You must eat.<eos> - You can feed off of me.<eos> - You're a fairy.<eos> - I trust you.<eos> - You shouldn't.<eos> - Well, I do.
- Yeah, I suppose I am.<eos> All right, folks, it's gonna be all right.<eos> We gots to keep moving, though.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - We've come this far and we almost--<eos> Well, well, look who we have here.<eos> You had no right to kill that man.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> - You had no goddamn right.<eos> - Oh, actually, I do.
We gots to keep moving, though.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - We've come this far and we almost--<eos> Well, well, look who we have here.<eos> You had no right to kill that man.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> - You had no goddamn right.<eos> - Oh, actually, I do.<eos> Now, if you would kindly hand over that map.<eos> Do it!
- At the BBG.<eos> - He's acting like he doesn't even know you.<eos> - Yeah, that's because he doesn't.<eos> Listen, Arlene, do not say anything to him, all right?<eos> - I'm on my way.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So...<eos> -...should I use this on you?<eos> - Uh... How much does it say to use? Um...<eos> It doesn't.
I think so.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Thank you, Reverend Daniels.<eos> Any time.<eos> I know it's not my place, but you want some advice about that sermon? Ha, ha.<eos> Honey, I'll take advice wherever I can find it.<eos> Tell them help is on its way.<eos> Tell them it will all be over soon.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
16?<eos> My father still owned the place.<eos> I was working behind the counter.<eos> Remember that?<eos> Not well.<eos> You were the prettiest piece of ass back then in your little candy stripes.<eos> Not that there's anything wrong with you now, huh? But 15 years ago,<eos> Jesus.<eos> I thought, if I could just put my dick inside that girl before I turn 18... [Laughs]<eos> And I did.
Over my dead body, Pop.<eos> Well, if we don't, we're all dead, Carlos.<eos> Come on, this isn't a business merger you put together in a board room, Daniel.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Dad is a businessman.<eos> So is Lavar Quintel.<eos> What have you always told us?<eos> _ _<eos> We don't have anything to offer Lavar Quintel.<eos> Yes, we do.
It's your job to find them.<eos> I am placing every resource we have at your disposal.<eos> It is imperative that you find them immediately.<eos> I don't care who you have to bribe, threaten, or kill.<eos> Any questions? No, sir.<eos> Danilov failed us.<eos> I won't.<eos> Not easy figuring out how to be a mother.<eos> - Do you have children?<eos> - My sister did.
What was that?<eos> She's hungry.<eos> I haven't had a chance to feed her.<eos> The blanket's wet.<eos> She's cold. This is about the baby. It's not about you.<eos> You need to get her warmed up.<eos> If you care about her at all, you're gonna do what I say.<eos> We need to get her dry.<eos> Follow me. - Juliette, you can't trust her.<eos> - Oh, I don't.
Does he really believe we're saving these people?<eos> I know I do because I choose to believe it.<eos> If you believe it, it is your reality.<eos> I was raised by a woman who told me every day that I was ugly and sick and a mistake.<eos> Joe was the first person to look at me and tell me that I was perfect.<eos> He believed in me until I could believe in myself.<eos> You have to trust him, Robert.<eos> I want to.<eos> All you have to do is believe in him.<eos> I do, I do, but--
She attacked me, chased me into this tower.<eos> Well, you don't have to worry about her anymore. I'm getting you out of here.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> She won't let me.<eos> Whenever I try to leave, she...<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It's too late.<eos> She must know you're here.<eos> Now, you've already gone through labor once, so at least you know what to expect. Oh, yes.<eos> We both do.
Well, Mary Margaret was telling me earlier about what happened in the first curse, and... losing your daughter is... it's tragic.<eos> I don't mean to pry, but she did express some anxiety about all of this.<eos> You did?<eos> David, we're missing a year of memories in the Enchanted Forest.<eos> We suddenly find ourselves in Storybrooke about to have a baby?<eos> It's... a bit disconcerting.<eos> I think it's best to just get these anxieties out in the open.<eos> Feelings, especially those we keep bottled up, can affect a pregnancy just as much as diet and exercise.<eos> Look, I suppose what I'm trying to say is that... If you've got any fears at all about any of this, it's best to just get it out - into the open.<eos> - I don't.
If it bothers you, you should say something to him.<eos> To what end?<eos> The man has chosen vanity and the pursuit of the spotlight.<eos> Nothing I say is going to change that.<eos> It's not about changing him.<eos> It's about putting it out there, so you can focus on finding Aurelius, instead of watching Lestrade yammer.<eos> When we first ran into him, you said that you expected him to crash and burn without you.<eos> Did you?<eos> I didn't give it much thought.<eos> Oh. Yes, of course I did.
We think one of your executives may have been targeted.<eos> How did Lawrence Iver fit into the hierarchy here?<eos> Larry?<eos> He was an ace.<eos> He made our clients a boatload trading distressed debt.<eos> Came here to the mother ship five years ago.<eos> He had been on the commodities desk ever since.<eos> Did he have any enemies at the company?<eos> I guess.<eos> We all do.
We own chickens, don't we?<eos> Holmes!<eos> Your bloody rooster is at it again! 19 days.<eos> 19 days he has been here.<eos> Well, you were the one who said he could stay with us until he figured out his next move.<eos> Holmes!<eos> I'll pluck it!<eos> I swear it!<eos> He has offers, remember?<eos> Course he does.
Because the police think he killed someone.<eos> We just want to ask him some questions.<eos> Okay.<eos> His name is Lawrence Cranford.<eos> He was a neurochemist on one of the study teams.<eos> He quit after his warnings were ignored.<eos> Do you know how we can find him?<eos> He dropped out of sight after that.<eos> Did you or anyone else at Merrill-Grand ever consider that he might be Adam Peer?<eos> Of course we did.
Thanks.<eos> And I didn't have to shoot anyone.<eos> If you need to change out vehicles, do it.<eos> Stay on the ground.<eos> Stay small, but find out how she's getting in and out of that compound.<eos> Saul Berenson.<eos> He's on a plane to Washington, D.C., tonight via London.<eos> Flight information's inside.<eos> Has he confirmed his seat?<eos> The embassy travel office did it this morning.
What's the connection?<eos> Burns' wife.<eos> Meet Sally Ann Burns.<eos> But we know her better as Sally Ann Caldwell.<eos> The name on the other plane ticket.<eos> The reason we couldn't find her is because she hasn't used her maiden name in over 20 years.<eos> So Guy Ingram and Burns' wife were gonna run away together.<eos> Burns must've found out and made sure that didn't happen.<eos> All right, how do we get to Sally Ann?<eos> We don't.
Thank you.<eos> What is it?<eos> Someone has connections on high.<eos> I wonder... what ward you might be going to!<eos> Let me guess.<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> He likes you too.<eos> Really?<eos> Do you think so?<eos> No, he doesn't!
Few years back.<eos> It's left me with a rattle, but it's... It sounds much worse than it is, it's nothing, honest.<eos> Breathe in.<eos> How did you get through your medical?<eos> Shoved a half crown across table.<eos> Hey, no, no, don't.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Don't tell him, let it be just between me and you.<eos> It's just a rattle, it don't mean anything, it don't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.
You almost had it, then you looked him in the eye and lost your nerve.<eos> What do you know about it?<eos> What you tried, a keystone cop would have spotted.<eos> Cigarette?<eos> You know my name.<eos> What's yours?<eos> Finn.<eos> When's the last time you've slept without keeping one eye open, Finn?<eos> What's it matter to you?<eos> It doesn't, really.
I didn't get AppleCare.<eos> I'm not surprised you want to end the relationship.<eos> I'm a little surprised you didn't get AppleCare.<eos> Anyway, enjoy your life.<eos> Where do I sign?<eos> At the bottom.<eos> I must say, I'm relieved you're not making more of a scene out of this.<eos> Oh, I've already moved on.<eos> Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.<eos> Wh... It doesn't?
Wish we could help you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Doesn't hurt to ask.<eos> If anyone wants to stop by, give his morale a boost, hope can heal.<eos> Oh, yeah, can hope make up for the years of misery that he put us through?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Come by.<eos> Find out.<eos> He doesn't deserve to go out like this.<eos> No one does.
Why would you do this to me?<eos> Seema gave me 50 bucks.<eos> - I call dibs on the remote!<eos> - Fuck.<eos> - I want to watch Steve Harvey!<eos> - I call-<eos> - I was here first.<eos> - That doesn't matter.<eos> - Yes, it does.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Hey, Fiona.<eos> You hungry?<eos> I'm gonna go get us something to eat.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Ah, jeez!<eos> So your father just offered me 10 grand to stay away from you.<eos> Amanda, you know we love you.<eos> Did you take the money?<eos> Uh, what do you think?<eos> That you did.
I'm gonna go get us something to eat.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Ah, jeez!<eos> So your father just offered me 10 grand to stay away from you.<eos> Amanda, you know we love you.<eos> Did you take the money?<eos> Uh, what do you think?<eos> That you did.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, did you?
Lily got lice from someone.<eos> - Portia.<eos> - Who else?<eos> You know what? Skip the pharmacy. Just -- just borrow our lice kit.<eos> It's in the basement.<eos> The key's under the mat.<eos> Thank you, Phil. Thanks.<eos> All right! Enough... with scary robot!<eos> But who wants to pretend to be a dog and ride in the car?<eos> I do!
Easy. That is the reaction for when there's a man behind me with a gun.<eos> All I said is I don't care about wedding dresses.<eos> Because you've never been in one.<eos> I'm gonna pick some for you to try.<eos> Okay, no, no. No need.<eos> Mnh-mnh. Come on, you'll feel beautiful.<eos> Then you can go back to your... boy clothes.<eos> Hey.<eos> I bought this shirt for Luke and I couldn't return it. And I don't have all day to try on dresses.<eos> Oh, and I do?
I bet you wish you had boy shoes now, huh?<eos> Lily?<eos> - Claire, stop!<eos> - What? - Look!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Okay, run, run.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> She looks so happy.<eos> She does.
Okay, we're starting with flash bangs.<eos> What about my team?<eos> - We'll do everything to keep them safe.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, listen, he's not gonna make it.<eos> I just wanna get the hell out of here.<eos> So have a car ready for me.<eos> He's gonna figure out he's dead.<eos> Ragosa has to know something's going on.<eos> - And if he does?
Both?<eos> You see, when Rumple saw that Neal was dying, he... absorbed him. And, uh, Zelena got ahold of the dagger.<eos> Now she controls Rumple.<eos> Maybe now isn't the time to announce the pregnancy.<eos> Regina is right.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> No, if... if we don't, we give in to fear.<eos> But if we do, we give the kingdom what they need... hope.<eos> We don't even know what this wicked witch wants.<eos> Actually, we do.
And then the only way to stop us from interfering was to bring us back here and wipe our memories.<eos> So if we get our memories back, we might already know how to defeat her.<eos> We just need to break this curse.<eos> Well, thank goodness we have a savior.<eos> I would love to, but there's one problem.<eos> Last time, all it took was me believing in magic and kissing Henry.<eos> Since I've been back, I've done both and nothing.<eos> It's the belief.<eos> Henry... he needs to believe.<eos> In this new life... he doesn't.
A book can't just disappear.<eos> But it can just appear.<eos> The first curse.<eos> It just showed up in my closet when I needed it...<eos> - or more accurately, when Henry needed it.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> He was going through a rough time.<eos> He was realizing he had been given up.<eos> He didn't feel like he had a real family.<eos> He did.
Ask the barman, the bouncer.<eos> There was half a dozen guys there who'll back me up.<eos> I am telling you i did not kill her.<eos> I loved her.<eos> She was my girl.<eos> Come on, Hildy, DNA.<eos> You know what, mark?<eos> I actually believe you.<eos> You do?<eos> Yeah, I do.
They're coming after me regardless of the evidence.<eos> David insists I need a doberman.<eos> Will you be my doberman, Mr. Daniels?<eos> I'm not cheap.<eos> I require a million-dollar retainer and a two-million-dollar advance when we go to trial.<eos> I don't bill by the hour.<eos> I've already instructed David to take care of it.<eos> If I take your case, I have three ironclad rules...<eos> One, do not tell me whether or not you killed this woman.<eos> I didn't.
Automatic send...<eos> On Android, anyway.<eos> And it's trackable on the phone?<eos> Apps can be uninstalled remotely from a browser.<eos> There would be a download history, but if you delete the app in your account and sync, you've wiped it.<eos> Permanently?<eos> If you know how.<eos> And this guy definitely knows how.<eos> At least you have a scenario.<eos> I do.
Yeah.<eos> I book the bands. I recruit the clients.<eos> My friends call me "The Cat."<eos> Welcome to The Fame Experience.<eos> You want to be a singer?<eos> An actor?<eos> A dancer?<eos> If you really want to be a star, you came to the right place.<eos> You want to ask me some questions?<eos> Yes, sir, Mr. Kirch, we do.
- What are my orders?<eos> - Stand down. [people murmuring]<eos> On your knees now! [gavel pounding]<eos> It's over, Francis.<eos> You got him.<eos> Destroy my notebooks.<eos> Sergeant Hawkins, on your knees now!<eos> In a surprise development today, the head of the CIA all but admitted to using illegal death squads to assassinate innocent American civilians.<eos> Del, you killed your father today.<eos> - Why did you do that?
Here, it's Nick Tullo.<eos> There, it's M. Tartullo.<eos> In another one, it's Nicky Tull.<eos> There's no way one guy witnessed all these crimes.<eos> It's obviously a phony eyewitness giving bogus statements.<eos> Rix is cooking his cases.<eos> Guy's got brass ones... I'll give him that.<eos> He's barely even changing the name.<eos> I know, and the system's so big, no one ever caught it.<eos> Linda did.
I'd seen this article on the Shadow League.<eos> They were a group of regular people not afraid to stand up for what's right.<eos> So you sent them an e-mail, hoping they'd do something about it.<eos> And they did.<eos> Guy ended up dead.<eos> When I got an e-mail from The Ghost saying he'd taken care of it for me, I admit I was excited, because he got what he deserved.<eos> But then The Ghost kept e-mailing you and asking for more cases.<eos> I got scared I would be connected to the drug dealer's death somehow, so I stopped responding.<eos> I hoped he'd just go away.<eos> But he didn't.
- Are you sure?<eos> Nick, I saw what I saw, man.<eos> There is no mistaking that.<eos> I'll kill all of you!<eos> I don't think she knows what you're talking about.<eos> Listen to me. Hey!<eos> You're a Grimm?<eos> So am I.<eos> - It doesn't mean anything.<eos> - Yes, it does.
Not that we need any more bad news, but I can't find any indication that Clément was ever in Italy.<eos> So we are certain the two murders are connected, but we don't have any evidence to that effect.<eos> Aside from one delusional nutter?<eos> An Italian film agent, a French actress filming in Holland, and a French perpetrator.<eos> It's almost too random to be random.<eos> Maybe he's a movie critic.<eos> The French can be tough.<eos> "The world reborn from night into day."<eos> Don't apocalyptic visions usually come from a group mentality?<eos> Yeah, they do.
Honey, look, I'm making you a tiara.<eos> Nice.<eos> Listen, I decided I don't want to have a party.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It's a celebration!<eos> It's fun and games and free stuff for the baby.<eos> I don't need it.<eos> Sweetheart, I'm stealing food from the restaurant.<eos> Believe me, we need it.<eos> No, we don't.
It looks like I'm your new P.T. instructor.<eos> Watkins got sick, so today's your lucky day.<eos> I'm your guy.<eos> Awesome.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Guys, guys, come on.<eos> Seriously, you should have just said something.<eos> This whole fit test thing is just a formality.<eos> I could've got the whole thing waived.<eos> But since you didn't, you ready to do this?
I was about due for one.<eos> Besides, it's all part of the plan.<eos> Keep them dry.<eos> Change the dressings every 72 hours.<eos> I love it when you play doctor.<eos> Was it just a coincidence...<eos> Cyrus and me?<eos> Or was the Machine trying to make some sort of point?<eos> You'd have to ask the Machine.<eos> I did.
Is that a real book?<eos> I would totally read that book.<eos> Can I borrow it when you're done'?<eos> Well, I'll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week.<eos> Why would you do that'?<eos> Because it was crap.<eos> It was a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.<eos> Serial Ape-ist?<eos> I thought you died in that.<eos> She does. 42 minutes in.
- Buzz Aldrin.<eos> Howard?<eos> Howard?<eos> Howard?<eos> What now?<eos> I have to go to the bathroom.<eos> You just went to the bathroom.<eos> I didn't use it because it didn't seem safe.<eos> Despite all my emails, the toilet didn't have a seatbelt.<eos> Well, it still doesn't.
Mr. McCawley hailed me. We went searching.<eos> I found the roller.<eos> There's no sign of her.<eos> All right, let's just ask you a few questions.<eos> Shouldn't we be putting together a search party?<eos> First things first.<eos> Uh, can anybody think of anybody who may wish Bertie harm?<eos> No.<eos> Bertie doesn't have an enemy in the world.<eos> No, but I do.
Good-bye, Lev.<eos> Don't you want to know why I'm here? Nope.<eos> Not in the least bit curious?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm dying.<eos> A little jumpy, huh?<eos> My nerves are shot.<eos> Ah, I understand.<eos> You have no idea what I'm going through. Oh.<eos> Of course I do.
Fine.<eos> I'm dying.<eos> A little jumpy, huh?<eos> My nerves are shot.<eos> Ah, I understand.<eos> You have no idea what I'm going through. Oh.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> It's your sister.<eos> No, this has nothing to do with Kenya.<eos> Ah, yeah, it does.
- be a crime?<eos> - In this case, it should be.<eos> I'll research it back at my office.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So now...<eos> - what can I do for you?<eos> - I came to warn you.<eos> Michel told me about Sebastian Berger.<eos> - He wants him prosecuted.<eos> - No, he does not.
I mean...<eos> Do they know how-- how he'll be?<eos> Won't know for a few days, he said.<eos> I can't stay.<eos> Got a meeting.<eos> You weren't crazy, Ted.<eos> When you were suspicious...<eos> When you were angry at me for spending time with him, you weren't crazy.<eos> Not that anything happened.<eos> It didn't, but...
Not that anything happened.<eos> It didn't, but...<eos> Like I told you, I thought that-- that God wanted to use me to save him.<eos> And maybe he did. I don't know. But that's what I felt then.<eos> It's hard-- it's hard to explain, but I-I promise I didn't think I was leading him on.<eos> Were you? Leading him on?<eos> Not on purpose.<eos> But it's like we-- we had a connection or... things in common.<eos> We have things in common.<eos> Of course we do.
That way, they'll expel me to Romania. and I can come straight back here.<eos> - But... I can't do that.<eos> - Sure you can.<eos> If you don't, my friends will follow you.<eos> They'll find out where you live, and then they'll kill you.<eos> You and your family.<eos> But if you do as I say, and tell them I'm from Romania, you'll receive a lot of money.<eos> Do we have an agreement?<eos> Well?<eos> Yes, we do.
In the old texts, we have, for example, a word like "heaven."<eos> So, for example, Abraham was taken up to heaven and brought back to Earth.<eos> So we should change the word<eos> "heaven" into the word "space" so it makes sense.<eos> Using what they say is a more accurate translation of this origin myth, ancient astronaut theorists believe the tablets tell a story about the Anunnaki coming from space to colonize both Mars and Earth.<eos> According to some researchers, the Sumerians had a number of myths about Mars, including that the<eos> Anunnaki used Mars as a supply base to come here to Earth.<eos> And subsequently the Anunnaki then ruled the earth as these extraterrestrial god-kings, while humans began to create the many civilizations on our planet.<eos> And eventually the Anunnaki left to go back to their own planet.<eos> Or did they?
- Someone is coming for us.<eos> - Take the tunnels. Go.<eos> Go!<eos> Find her!<eos> This is where I left Jeremy.<eos> And where he took his new name.<eos> You sure we'll be safe here?<eos> Churches are consecrated ground.<eos> You don't think Henry can get around that?<eos> The termites did.
I must admit, I am confused by your presence here, Mary.<eos> How could I not come?<eos> Once I heard you'd been coerced to throw in with the colonists.<eos> Not to worry.<eos> Papa Wells can fix it.<eos> As long as you recant.<eos> I have no intention of recanting my belief - under any circumstances...<eos> - You mean you had no intention until you laid eyes on me again.<eos> But seeing me now, your heart still beats for me.<eos> As it always did.
She attacked Caroline. Then me.<eos> If this is Mary we're dealing with, she could be a literal green-eyed monster.<eos> One of the reasons I broke off our engagement was, indeed, Mary's jealousy.<eos> She was irrationally possessive.<eos> Any woman to whom I so much as spoke was trying to steal me away.<eos> Weeping Lady's always been a harmless, benign spirit.<eos> Now she's angry and tangible.<eos> Something's changed.<eos> She's tried to kill women that she thought were trying to steal you away.<eos> What about the one that did?
There's some people here that need your help.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Hmm. What?<eos> You pierced your ear.<eos> You used to hate needles.<eos> Yeah, I still do.<eos> I... I didn't even want to do it.<eos> It was Dave's dumb idea.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Of course it does.
I'm definitely not buying her breakfast.<eos> I'm gonna see if Katrina can give us a bearing on Miss Love-Em-and-Eat-Em.<eos> - Hey. - Steady.<eos> Man.<eos> Just can't seem to get rid of the crazy ones.<eos> The creature is drawn to those who hide desire in their heart.<eos> Hey, I, no, I'm...<eos> I'm grateful, you know?<eos> She saved my life.<eos> As you did hers.
The book.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You getting as tired of that answer as I am?<eos> You could say that.<eos> So, cheap and stupid.<eos> Guess I'll have to get by on my looks.<eos> Like you don't know what I'm talking about.<eos> What's that on your wrist?<eos> It's faded ink. And of course I don't know what it means.<eos> But you did.
I'm gonna pop a squat.<eos> Still something underneath all the mumbo jumbo.<eos> The way women treat each other.<eos> It's like they're fighting over table scraps.<eos> I don't mean just in here.<eos> Back in high school...<eos> Scheming to steal someone else's man, talking behind each others backs.<eos> Girls grow up nipping and scratching and whupping each other's ass.<eos> It's no wonder when a man does it back, we think it's normal.<eos> Until we don't.
I'm not implying anything, ma'am. I'm stating.<eos> Well, that's all done with.<eos> That case was sewn up tight.<eos> Got a sworn affidavit it was an FBI turncoat.<eos> That's right. it's yesterday's news.<eos> This is today.<eos> My phone.<eos> Jimmy.<eos> You got those last six keys?<eos> I do.
- We're gonna all be having them tonight.<eos> - Return to hell.<eos> Bastard's dead but it won't lie down.<eos> - Try this.<eos> - White ash?<eos> - Is it at peace?<eos> - It don't deserve to be.<eos> - Don't you believe in redemption?<eos> That our past sins can be forgiven?<eos> - Sure he does.
One summer, I taught ballroom dance to homeless teens.<eos> Because when you're dancing, you're not hungry?<eos> Fast-forward.<eos> This is my least favorite part of the Addams Family.<eos> - Look at his pants.<eos> - I know.<eos> That tango is giving him even less ball room.<eos> [chuckles] Stay.<eos> We don't have to have sex.<eos> We don't?
Son.<eos> Do you want to talk about it later Over a game of catch?<eos> I'd like that.<eos> (holt) thank you for coming in on your day off.<eos> I know you'd all rather be at home, Binge watching media content. Oh!<eos> I just started the second season Of media content.<eos> No spoilers.<eos> But these evaluations are important.<eos> Sir, I think I speak for all of us... All:<eos> She doesn't.
Oh, believe that.<eos> Yes.<eos> Sometimes there's limited space at the hotels where we're staying at, so sometimes we gotta double up on a room.<eos> And every now and then, Martin will bring some random girl to the room at 3:00 in the morning, wakes me up.<eos> I got to look at him and say, "Really, bro?<eos> "You're going to put that in your mouth?<eos> "Do you know what that's going to do to your body?<eos> "Hey!<eos> Have some self-re..."<eos> He doesn't. He really doesn't, so...
Head movement is just a form of expression.<eos> No matter where you live in this world, people express themselves in their own unique way, whether through facial expressions, hand gestures, body movement, extra words.<eos> Everywhere you go, things are different, and that's just how they express themselves in India.<eos> Now back to the whole Indians-Mexican thing.<eos> That is something else that we share in common with Indian people.<eos> Head movement.<eos> Now, some of you in the building tonight are like,<eos> "Stupid.<eos> We don't have head movement."<eos> Yes, we do.
Tonight, we just have to plant the right seeds, and for that, we need help.<eos> You know, I am starting to think that you have a death wish. I just want to get my stuff and get out of town.<eos> And why would we let you do that?<eos> Because I got information that could be very useful to francesca guerrera.<eos> We're taking the 12 original rings.<eos> Now 4 of them sit on the hands of the guerrera brothers, one on Oliver, one on francesca,<eos> 3 with her home security detail, and the rest scattered amongst her lackeys.<eos> Now each ring is distinguishable by its setting... gauche like those that wear them.<eos> Klaus thinks you have the white oak stake.<eos> But we don't.
You could try to hide the fact that you're glad I can't get out in the field anymore.<eos> I can't hide that I'm glad that you're safe.<eos> - What's all this?<eos> - Your surprise.<eos> Thank you all...<eos> Excuse me. Thank you for coming.<eos> Five months ago this city was under siege.<eos> And the S.C.P.D. rallied behind a man in a hood.<eos> Well, I ended up with a captain's rank and he didn't even get a thank you.<eos> But today he does.
What did we find out?<eos> You know how we got the number of crime bosses down to three?<eos> This new guy Werner wants to make it zero.<eos> Take out the competition.<eos> Mikhail Petruv, Luciano Costa, Shintaro Shimosawa.<eos> What are their locations?<eos> I'm not getting anything off their last addresses.<eos> Werner could be moving these guys right now.<eos> It's not like these guys walk around with little GPS's attached to them.<eos> Unless they do.
But...<eos> Quon?<eos> Quon!<eos> If I thought you were going to attack me, I would have drugged you both.<eos> You drugged him?<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Aslam Al-Rahim.<eos> Before you reach Constantinople, I would like to share something with you.<eos> You cannot think I would trust you.<eos> And yet Leonardo does.
Officer Lance?<eos> The Queen family's here.<eos> - Mr. Lance, did he tell you where Thea is?<eos> - Mrs. Queen, thank you for coming.<eos> This doesn't make any sense.<eos> Slade Wilson is a friend.<eos> And he's been in Costa Rica for the past 72 hours.<eos> He can provide flight manifests, phone records, even some videos... so he couldn't have taken your daughter.<eos> - If he didn't, then why did you arrest him?<eos> - We didn't.
- Jeez.<eos> - Hey, he's going through it.<eos> - Pete, shoot.<eos> you lose again, agent lattimer.<eos> Welcome to the new world order.<eos> You're not gonna get away with this!<eos> - Take this.<eos> - Artie, what just happened?<eos> I'm not s... wait a minute.<eos> Did he...uh, pete?
And people would say all kinds of derogatory things about us based on the circuit that we played, without ever having seen us. It was tough getting a deal.<eos> You know the labels that we wanted weren't as interested.<eos> The labels that came to the table, were one's that-- you'd make a deal with, you'd shake hands and everything.<eos> And then like you'd never hear from them again.<eos> Now we were lowering our sights to indies. I remember the Handshake deal.<eos> When we got the contracts, they were basically indentured servitude.<eos> Literally, the guy took everything and we would just like, uh, some sort of salary. And we had to say, "No."<eos> There were things floating around.<eos> But the Hansa or Handshake deal did not work out.<eos> But the deal with this German company, X, did.
Upstairs. Top brass wants to see you.<eos> Pairing off makes total sense.<eos> Just one thought though. What if we make it a double-blind?<eos> How so?<eos> Well, I'll give one person from each team the potential Clairvoyant's coordinates, and I'll give the other one the identity.<eos> That way no one person knows the full specs of the op until you get there.<eos> I like how you think.<eos> I like how she thinks.<eos> One question. How am I supposed to access all the classified files without someone in the room? I don't have clearance.<eos> Now you do.
Do you think I'm crazy?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> It's looking like that's all I got left, you know?<eos> Some kind of insanity plea.<eos> I just don't want to spend the rest of my life in a cage.<eos> It's not about what you want.<eos> You gave that up when you walked in here.<eos> I'm-I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> There are gonna be consequences, obviously, but if you choose to live, man, there's... you can make something out of that life.<eos> What if I don't?
So... he had nothing to do with this.<eos> S-So it was someone else?<eos> Somebody who had a connection to Powell.<eos> Somebody that he crossed paths with when he was trying to straighten his life out.<eos> We found this photo from, uh... last year's Police Youth Sports Camp.<eos> I don't believe this, Sara.<eos> That kid killed my husband.<eos> He killed Blake.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He did, Debra.
I mean literally, noise.<eos> Across every S.H.I.E.L.D. communication channel.<eos> Some sort of blanket signal.<eos> - Encoded data, maybe?<eos> - I think so.<eos> You wanna fill us in?<eos> We root you out, a mole, suddenly our plane shuts down, our communications jammed.<eos> I don't know what's happening, I wish I did.<eos> - You have to believe me.<eos> - No, I don't.
The processing center's at the end of that hall.<eos> Give me your ICER.<eos> - What are you gonna do?<eos> - Pave the way for you.<eos> - There's, like, 100 guys out there.<eos> - Twelve. Level 5 foot soldiers, basic armor package, and no other way through.<eos> The others are depending on us.<eos> But it's suicide.<eos> Not if I don't die.<eos> - And if I do...
Bitch...<eos> Was it the noise?<eos> Do you want to come with me?<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yes?<eos> Ah. Do come in, Prentiss.<eos> Why does it help?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But it does.
I apologise for my friend, he er... he thinks he's dashing.<eos> Leave her alone, Miles.<eos> Do you know what they call the VADs?<eos> The Very Adorable Darlings.<eos> And I think that suits you perfectly.<eos> My father gave me a piece of advice about women, shall I tell you what it is?<eos> He said, never marry a woman who holds your look for too long, she's bound to be trouble.<eos> And you take your father's advice for everything, do you?<eos> Well, usually, but not in matters of the heart.<eos> Of course you do.
Who?<eos> Your husband.<eos> Can he talk to you?<eos> Of course he can talk.<eos> That's good.<eos> George, my boy, he can't talk.<eos> He was hit in the head.<eos> I don't think he sees me.<eos> Doesn't know I'm there.<eos> Of course he does.
I'll understand if you're not, but I'll be there.<eos> He was born with a cord around his neck.<eos> He shouldn't be on his own.<eos> He's a lamb.<eos> I should never have left him.<eos> Why did you?<eos> Is it because people found out what you are?<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Is it because you're a girl that you think everyone wants their life laid out?<eos> They don't.
He'll be round as soon as he's ready.<eos> Why doesn't anybody in this place do what they're told?<eos> !<eos> If I could just dress your arm...<eos> Colonel Brett.<eos> Delighted you could finally make it.<eos> I did warn you.<eos> I don't appreciate being summoned by the sound of smashing crockery.<eos> You have to sign me out and send me back up to the front as a matter of urgency.<eos> Do I, indeed?
So, you feel compelled to save everybody else.<eos> Was it your father in the regiment?<eos> No.<eos> Are you ready now?<eos> I don't even know which direction I'm facing.<eos> You know, I still think you have a question for me.<eos> If you do, you need to ask it now.<eos> The Blighty convoy is here, Major.<eos> Sir, in your regiment... ..do you know of a Subedar Major Amar Singh?<eos> Yes, I do.
Well it will be very helpful to our investigation to know exactly what's been removed.<eos> I checked the records as soon as we knew about the robbery.<eos> That particular box was empty.<eos> As I mentioned, we have more than a few.<eos> You do know that impeding a police investigation is a very serious offense.<eos> And you know that as a Fortune500 company, we have a full complement of lawyers that can back-up my truthful and helpful statement.<eos> But why go there.<eos> Liber8 is behind this robbery Mr. Richardson.<eos> You don't want them having anything of yours.<eos> And they don't.
Negative.<eos> We're in an old commercial paint shop, so it's hard to get a solid result, but there was definitely a cook here.<eos> The product's gone, though.<eos> Get all residue specimens to Cassidy as soon as possible.<eos> I want to know the concentration levels we're dealing with.<eos> Rebecca, I need to leave for a while.<eos> Um... could we talk later?<eos> Mom, I have four paintings to finish, so, you know,<eos> I wish that I'd known you were coming by earlier.<eos> But I didn't, so...
Well, I'm suggesting it, yes... as a friend.<eos> So now we're friends?<eos> I would hope so.<eos> I've [Chuckles] never met anybody like you.<eos> With all due respect, you and me... we aren't friends.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.<eos> Does Alexa Richards still live here?<eos> Uh, no, she doesn't.
I saw her.<eos> She was on medication.<eos> I saw the pills.<eos> That's what she does.<eos> She has a problem.<eos> I don't need to tell you what the stakes are here.<eos> That's right, Alan.<eos> You don't.<eos> But if she did hear our conversation...<eos> She didn't.
She's my friend.<eos> And she can't take the lie-detector test.<eos> So you pulled me out of my day for this?<eos> If anybody deserves to be a mother, it's Angela.<eos> So do a lot of other women who will never get the chance.<eos> But she would be amazing.<eos> I don't have the patience that she does...<eos> Or the support system.<eos> I thought you called me out here to discuss something important.<eos> I did.
KELLOG ON PHONE: Those Sonmanto headlines?<eos> Yeah, that was us.<eos> You should also watch that space for some truly amazing news about Gautuma.<eos> And right behind them is anybody else who wants to try to take on Piron.<eos> Hey, would you do me a favor?<eos> Would you pass that on to the other old, fat, white guys?<eos> We will burn you down.<eos> I lost a bet with Lucas because of you.<eos> So the protector delivered.<eos> She did.
Yeah.<eos> She kick you out? Yeah!<eos> Hey, check this out.<eos> The caulk on this window... it's fresh.<eos> Yeah, and the other ones are yellow and cracked.<eos> That means that somebody recently replaced that glass.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, come take a look at this.<eos> Does that look like blood to you?<eos> To the naked eye, yes, it does.
I know you're making this all up! I know you didn't go to Sacramento.<eos> I know you went to a hotel to be by yourself.<eos> - Damn it, Winston!<eos> - Nick loved being alone, too!<eos> - Damn it, Winston!<eos> - That's for my ding-a-ling!<eos> You didn't like living together either?<eos> No, but it was your idea, and it seemed like the thing to do.<eos> But at least I didn't lie about it, Jess.<eos> Okay, I did!
His name's Daniel Casey.<eos> Mr. Dillinger, what are you doing?<eos> - Casey, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we went to Cal Poly together way back when.<eos> - So, you know him?<eos> - No, I'm afraid not.<eos> But if I do run into him, I'll tell him you said hello.<eos> - What'd you say your name was?<eos> - I didn't.
♪ Who ate cookies and fries by the pound ♪<eos> ♪ They ate their own hats ♪<eos> ♪ And a cook named Ron!<eos> ♪ Okay, now this is fun.<eos> Kids love this kind of stuff.<eos> Don't you realize who they are?<eos> These are the Veggie-Ta-Bills.<eos> Christine loves these guys.<eos> Loves the show.<eos> She does?
Mrs. Roth, I need to annoy you for just a minute, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> That your daughter?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> That's Charlotte.<eos> She's pretty.<eos> Thank you for saying that.<eos> You have children?<eos> Yes, ma'am, I do.
I don't touch a thing.<eos> That way, it won't interfere with my sobriety.<eos> But I'm not gonna go to Coop unless you're okay with it.<eos> Let me think about it.<eos> I don't have anything to say.<eos> You're the chief.<eos> Do something chief-like.<eos> Make a small but meaningful speech.<eos> Thor, I didn't even know the guy.<eos> None of us did.
- I'm great.<eos> I mean, fine.<eos> Not great.<eos> I mean, also fine.<eos> You hang in there.<eos> Nurse Barkow.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You're all saints nurse of the month.<eos> We have a nurse of the month?<eos> We do now.
- You're here for the toy convention?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Been meaning to get there myself.<eos> Supposed to get an award tonight.<eos> - For real?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You in the toy business?<eos> Inventor.<eos> You know the Finger Faddle?<eos> Oh, God, my kids used to play that game for hours.<eos> Some still do.
I need to protect Grace right now.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Whatever this is, it ain't about Grace.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right. Ii isn't.<eos> This is about me not wanting to be with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's exactly what Antoinette said was gonna happen.<eos> Yeah, fucking Antoinette.<eos> Of course she did.
Charades.<eos> Why the Navy uniform?<eos> Any connection between these two?<eos> I've got the warrant. I'm going to Bodeen's office. Maybe I can find something there.<eos> I'll do a matrix of their cell phone, e-mails, credit cards;<eos> see if their paths crossed anywhere.<eos> Where is DiNozzo?<eos> He was trying to hook up with his father.<eos> Gibbs said you have something for me.<eos> Yes, I do.
This guy, great private dick.<eos> Rubbed elbows with the rich and powerful from all around the world.<eos> Sort of a classic Warner Brothers set deck, you know, noir atmosphere.<eos> Yeah, except it's all phony.<eos> It's fake, just like him.<eos> Would you take that hat off?<eos> When Bodeen was on his game, it was a great life.<eos> Until it all came crashing down around him.<eos> I wonder how he paid his rent.<eos> He didn't.
We'll be leaving in a minute.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Did he work on any sensitive or classified issues?<eos> No, uh, mostly he just worked with constituents from the state who had requests or problems.<eos> We'll need access to his office computer and files.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Will? Would you please call Jennifer?<eos> May I ask, do you have any suspects?<eos> We do.
Wow, last time I saw you, you had a face full of braces and you were playing with, like, a Cabbage Patch Kid.<eos> Yep. And now I am having one of my own.<eos> Yes.<eos> So what do you think about our parents?<eos> I think... It's weird.<eos> Exactly what I thought... until I saw them together.<eos> It's real. And sweet.<eos> They're in love.<eos> Does your mom know what she's in for? Oh, yeah.<eos> - She does.
Pretty cool, huh?<eos> Are you still talking to me?<eos> What Bishop was trying to say is, we got a partial from the bomb.<eos> It was too partial-y for a search, but you add in a little magical NSA wizard math fix-it, and voilà.<eos> Yup, the print from the bomb belongs to...<eos> Luke Pischedda.<eos> The HCF concert coordinator?<eos> More like concert destroyer.<eos> The guy almost ruined his own show.<eos> No, he didn't.
We don't have to... you know, if you're not sure.<eos> Oh, I'm sure.<eos> Sir.<eos> A word, please.<eos> Not the best time.<eos> I think you'll have time for this.<eos> Doyle is sending men out by the dozen looking for Monroe.<eos> And?<eos> And they don't know where he is.<eos> I do.
Maybe it's some kind of post-hypnotic suggestion...<eos> You know me.<eos> I wouldn't hurt anyone.<eos> We need to talk, now.<eos> He does not move.<eos> He's a good kid.<eos> A kind kid.<eos> Please, you... you can't kill him.<eos> Gene, I tried to go with you on this.<eos> I did.
Is that what you want, huh?<eos> Please.<eos> God, that is not you, Miles.<eos> That is not you, and you know it.<eos> So what are you fighting for, huh?<eos> Tell me.<eos> What do you want, Miles?<eos> Come in.<eos> You wanted to see me, sir?<eos> Yes, I did.
You ever think of moving to a place that can't roll away?<eos> I... haven't given it much thought.<eos> Mmm. Not that I don't love the trailer and the roughing it in nature.<eos> It's like camping.<eos> Mmm. Wait. Wait.<eos> You hate camping. - I hate camping. I do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, maybe we should look at getting a bigger place... together.<eos> I thought you hadn't given it much thought.<eos> I just did.
Yeah.<eos> We've seen one or two of 'em.<eos> That's what those sons of bitches did to me... that and a lot more.<eos> Look, I know I got nothing here, nothing but burned bridges.<eos> And I know there's no reason for you to take me, but I'm asking.<eos> And I can help.<eos> I need payback.<eos> And how do we know this isn't a trick?<eos> How do we know you're not zombified right now?<eos> You don't.
We both know you're not.<eos> I don't have blood on my hands.<eos> Wait, so does Victoria pick the victims, or are you just scoring points with Mommy?<eos> You got no idea what she's been through, so stop attacking her.<eos> Or what?<eos> I'll have an accident next?<eos> You've totally changed.<eos> You don't even see it.<eos> You really think you know me, don't you?<eos> You don't.
I was ready to face them.<eos> And you.<eos> Then how about this?<eos> How about you come over to my house tomorrow, officially meet your grandson?<eos> I would like nothing more.<eos> I thought Brunello appropriate to honor the next chapter of Patrick's life.<eos> Please thank Stefano again for affording him the opportunity.<eos> You were the one that made him an offer he couldn't refuse, but...<eos> In truth, even without the money, he thinks your boy has talent.<eos> Of course he does.
Adderall, Xanax, trazodone,<eos> Kolonopin, oxycodone, Demerol, Darvocet, and codeine.<eos> - They're all legit scripts.<eos> - You need help, man.<eos> Sign here.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> Next up!<eos> Erich Blunt passed his polygraph test.<eos> - For real?<eos> - Yeah, of course he did.
I think somebody was ejected!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> The girl could have fallen out wherever the bus first lost control.<eos> We are gonna shut down the road, run a search.<eos> My guys have been up and down this road.<eos> They didn't see anything.<eos> We should have some firefighters take a look.<eos> Look, be my guest, but I can't close this road.<eos> You do realize you have a girl that is unaccounted for.<eos> Yes, I do.
Screw this.<eos> Bloom, just give me one second.<eos> You are a son of a bitch.<eos> Hey, it's not like that, Captain.<eos> Oh, Captain!<eos> Captain.<eos> Aren't you cute?<eos> You can mail me my wallet.<eos> We didn't know what happened to you, Bloom.<eos> Now you do.
No, no, it's just a girls weekend.<eos> - You're cool with that, right? - Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> Does this hat make me look silly?<eos> My mom gave it to me.<eos> No, I like it.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry I told Jones what her dad was up to.<eos> I really am.<eos> - I thought she deserved to know.<eos> - I do too.
My lawyers told me I'm not allowed to discuss it.<eos> Totally get it.<eos> That's baller.<eos> - Hey, babe?<eos> You're up. - Hmm.<eos> - All right, I'm gonna go have a shower. Mmm-hmm.<eos> - Uh, what was that?<eos> - What?<eos> Tara just whispered something to you and then she looked at me in a weird way.<eos> No, she didn't.
We just don't know.<eos> If we tackle her lung issues first, what are the chances the lobe removal being successful?<eos> It... it's hard to say.<eos> There's a heavy burden of comorbid diseases uh, complicating outcomes.<eos> We're not magicians.<eos> So, what you're saying is you really don't know?<eos> No.<eos> Ultimately, it's in the hands of our maker.<eos> I mean, if you believe.<eos> And, of course, if you don't, well...
- I'm so over him.<eos> Dawn: He's the world's biggest loser.<eos> He's too lazy, he won't come down the stairs.<eos> This is stupid.<eos> Why didn't you choose wait?<eos> 'Cause I don't want to talk to you!<eos> Thanks for that shitty weekend.<eos> Oh, and, you know, thank you for sticking me with the apartment, by the way.<eos> Did I... did I say that?<eos> No, I actually didn't.
Yes!<eos> Stig, I might need a little bit more from you than this.<eos> OK, right, so that's not working.<eos> By process of elimination, if we come off the clutch and press this...<eos> Revving.<eos> Yeah, that's revving.<eos> Getting ready.<eos> And your handbrake's on.<eos> That sounds good.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Hey, where's Watson's disease?<eos> "Many people consider sweet honey clover a cure-all for most diseases."<eos> Jackpot!<eos> "But beware..."<eos> "Poisonous stink weed may cause swelling and hallucinations."<eos> At least I'm not having hallucinations.<eos> Zat hallucination's got a good kick!<eos> Huge squirrels, Jean-Bob?<eos> And zey have blowguns!<eos> Of course they do.
I even called a friend over at, uh, Chicago children's who knows Lucas... you know, whatever his name is...<eos> Who's doing the work on the ligature tissue-sealing device, which is... kinda...<eos> Derivative. Right?<eos> Right?<eos> And supposedly, his trial patients are not doing well.<eos> Which is bad, obviously, but also...<eos> I think you're gonna win.<eos> And when they called my mom's name, she was genuinely shocked.<eos> It was validation of all her hard work and sacrifice.<eos> I really do.
Sam's probably nearby, too. Quick, get in before he spots us.<eos> Vincent, I know you're trying to help,<eos> I do, but I can't let you get in the way.<eos> I have to track Xavier to Sam so that I can catch him in the act, so that I can arrest him, and Gabe can prosecute.<eos> Sam?<eos> Yes.<eos> What about Xavier?<eos> You know he's an innocent victim in all this, right?<eos> He's a person, too.<eos> No, of course I do...
I'm not so sure that's a good idea.<eos> - You afraid of me?<eos> - Of course I'm afraid of you.<eos> Well, I'm afraid of you too.<eos> Then why do you want me to stay?<eos> Because I'm more afraid of being alone.<eos> I'll take the couch.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> I had a child to hold.<eos> I don't anymore.
- Of course I'm afraid of you.<eos> Well, I'm afraid of you too.<eos> Then why do you want me to stay?<eos> Because I'm more afraid of being alone.<eos> I'll take the couch.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> I had a child to hold.<eos> I don't anymore.<eos> But for the short time I had her, I felt something I've never felt before.<eos> I did too.
The name of the firm is Pearson Specter.<eos> It's changed too many times, and it's not going to change again.<eos> Never?<eos> I never say never.<eos> - That's all I'm looking for.<eos> - Of course.<eos> After all, who knows where any of us will be in a few years?<eos> You, me, Harvey.<eos> I think we just changed the subject.<eos> We did.

Now, which one of you motherfuckers killed him?<eos> He's dead'?<eos> I ain't going on parole. Oh, no?<eos> That's fine.<eos> You're on the next flight to Guantanamo.<eos> You can be roomies with the blind sheikh.<eos> Assalamu alaikum, motherfucker.<eos> Here's how it's gonna work-You don't open your mouth about Sully.<eos> You weren't on the docks that night. You didn't kill him.<eos> Frank did.
- What's going on?<eos> They're from the boot camp.<eos> They're spying on us.<eos> What is the point of saving this town if we have to murder its children to do it?<eos> Now, they're the town's kids.<eos> Next week, they're Patriots.<eos> Looks like trouble in paradise.<eos> Doyle is sending men out by the dozens searching for Monroe.<eos> They don't know where he is.<eos> I do.
- Shut up.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> The bad news is the Patriots just found our last safe house.<eos> It's only a matter of time before they find us here.<eos> But there's good news, right, Miles?<eos> Because Miles let the kid go, so we can all die with a clean conscience.<eos> Yeah, I'm really sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I made it harder for you and your kid to get your discount empire back.<eos> Oh, you didn't think we knew.<eos> We do.
- I don't know... better?<eos> - News flash.<eos> It's the apocalypse.<eos> Things are only getting worse.<eos> What makes you so sure, sunshine?<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Because I've been down this road before, all right?<eos> I set out to make things better.<eos> Bass and I both did.
But he asked you to do something, didn't he? - Yes.<eos> - And you did it... because he saved you, because he's Beth Ann's dad.<eos> - It was nothing, really. So I...<eos> - What did you do, Kyle?<eos> I made my parents come to the school tonight.<eos> And you told them it was your idea?<eos> - But it wasn't, was it?<eos> He asked me to get my parents to the vigil.<eos> To show support for Beth Ann.<eos> Did I do something wrong?
It worked when you told me.<eos> I thought we were gonna help each other.<eos> You left yourself wide open there.<eos> Callie's a grown-up.<eos> She knows how research works. Just tell her.<eos> And Karev will be...<eos> understanding about it. Oh, no.<eos> I'm not telling him. - Did you get to talk to her?<eos> - No. I was on the floor.<eos> She didn't do it on purpose, did she? No. No.
The only way in or out of the chalet is through this door, which was locked and bolted from the inside.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> That was Dwayne.<eos> There were three entries in the victim's diary for yesterday.<eos> The concert with Mr Campbell, the dance...<eos> And?<eos> And a note to meet Judith Musgrove at 3pm.<eos> Judith Musgrove.<eos> We spoke to her last night, didn't we?<eos> Yes, we did.
Actually, she didn't - that's why I didn't mention it last night.<eos> Everything looks absolutely in order.<eos> Nothing that needs to be altered.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Everything was left to her husband, unless he predeceased her, in which case, her estate would go straight to her son, Ben.<eos> Her husband died a few years ago.<eos> And I was able to tell her not to worry about it.<eos> Her son would still inherit on her death.<eos> Did she say why she felt the need to check her will?<eos> No, she didn't.
I didn't even have the courage to tell her who I was.<eos> You know, I didn't know true loneliness until I came to a retirement home.<eos> I mean, look at them.<eos> Everyone's got someone.<eos> You probably think I killed her, don't you?<eos> Did you?<eos> There were times when I could've done.<eos> Maybe even would have done.<eos> But no.<eos> I didn't.
I gave up so easy!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Hey, are you sure it's a good idea to eat all this shawarma right before your tux fitting?<eos> Oh, yeah. I'm not gonna be one of those grooms who doesn't eat.<eos> Hey. Thanks for being so supportive all day.<eos> Best man... whatever you need, I will do.<eos> Actually, there is one thing.<eos> Do you have a pen I could borrow to sign these forms?<eos> You bet I don't have a pen.<eos> I never do.
Vivian!<eos> Jake, you're so sweet!<eos> Charles told me you insisted that I come to breakfast.<eos> Because of it being such an important one.<eos> Meal, I mean.<eos> You know that in ancient Egypt, the peasants drank beer for breakfast?<eos> Well, that explains why all their buildings were crooked.<eos> Charles, can I see you in the bathroom for a second?<eos> I've got a mole on my back that needs a looking-at, and Charles has eyes.<eos> I do.
We're already on it, but what we really need is for your boy Harold to tell us what he knows.<eos> I was like a sitting duck in there.<eos> How could you let this happen?<eos> What kind of a cop are you anyway?<eos> Harold, we're doing everything we can to bring in the gunman.<eos> This is what I get for being a snitch.<eos> Well, technically, you're not a snitch, because you haven't actually told us anything yet.<eos> Well, they don't know that.<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
- Which is ironic...<eos> - Mr. Castle. What on earth possessed you to turn my precinct into the set of Kojak? Oh!<eos> Or should I address you as Captain Castle?<eos> Okay, that was so not my idea.<eos> Oh. But the rest of this was?<eos> Sir, in fairness...<eos> And you. Detective Beckett, you know what a high-profile case this is.<eos> How could you allow this circus?<eos> Sir, given his fixation with the '70s, we figured that this would be an opportunity to let Harold Leone open up about his knowledge on Vincent Bianchi's murder.<eos> And did he?
Oh. But the rest of this was?<eos> Sir, in fairness...<eos> And you.

Ghoulia?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Veronica is talking about Elissabat!<eos> Veronica is...<eos> What?<eos> Say again?<eos> I remember Elissabat, who, more than anything, wanted to act.<eos> Only on stage, and in her imagination, did she have the strength to lead.<eos> But my friend Draculaura has reminded me that you need to have courage to face your fear, to overcome it, to help others.<eos> I did?
Not unless they were trying to hide something.<eos> Take a look at this.<eos> You'd be surprised what you'd find with an active imagination and a little scraping.<eos> This means something to you.<eos> Shelburne was a code name my mother used as a CIA operative.<eos> The other two lines, they don't mean anything to me.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Back up.<eos> Did you just say your mom worked for the Company?<eos> Still does.
You know, over spaghetti, with cinnamon?<eos> I bet you never had that.<eos> Sounds fucking disgusting.<eos> You... Are gonna eat it and like it.<eos> Look, Hol, I... I might be a little late tonight.<eos> How late?<eos> I... you can make that shit for me another night.<eos> Another night?<eos> You like having me around, huh?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I got a surprise for you.<eos> Holly!<eos> Oh, just come on.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen,<eos> I'd like to introduce the lady of the hour,<eos> Mrs. Tasha St. Patrick, to rock the mic.<eos> I'm not singing at my own damn birthday party.<eos> Why not?<eos> Beyonce did it at hers.
Never mind, I know the answer.<eos> Reality calls.<eos> I wish I could, Angie.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> It won't always be like this.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> I promise.<eos> Thank you so much, Shawn.<eos> I hope you got a chance to enjoy some of the party the other night.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Because I know why you did what you did.<eos> We're much alike.<eos> Our mother ruined you, too.<eos> I know what it's like to not have the life you wanted... the life you feel you deserve.<eos> Oh, boo-hoo.<eos> You had to be Queen.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> I saw it all.<eos> You had everything.<eos> Did I?
Because she's the one who found out that Louis knows you don't have a file in the Harvard file room.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because Louis's new girlfriend is the queen of that file room, and she left him alone in there.<eos> You guys didn't think to mention this?<eos> I thought I handled it.<eos> She did handle it.<eos> She sent him to sniff out your transcript.<eos> Only she didn't realize you gave yourself an A-plus in legal ethics.<eos> I didn't give it to myself.<eos> Lola Jensen did.
Jessica, you loved him.<eos> I know you're hurting.<eos> So is she.<eos> Whatever your history with her, so is she.<eos> You're here late.<eos> The life of an associate, right?<eos> Ah, yeah, I remember.<eos> I used to live in this room, work piled all around me, surviving on coffee, delivery, and no sleep.<eos> And the whole time, wondering, "man, is it ever gonna get any easier?"<eos> - Does it?
But it didn't matter.<eos> Lisa.<eos> He wasn't supposed to die.<eos> He wasn't supposed to live as long as he did.<eos> We weren't trying to prolong his life.<eos> We were trying to find a cure.<eos> And we failed.<eos> You never cared about the money.<eos> The only money I cared about is the money to find the cure, and we don't have the resources.<eos> Pryzen does.
Well, maybe you didn't have him sign it, but I know when he signed it, and it's not gonna hold up.<eos> It'll hold up just fine.<eos> We'll see.<eos> This is a subpoena.<eos> So the next time we have this conversation, you'll be under oath.<eos> What exactly is he claiming?<eos> He's saying Quentin wasn't competent when he made me executor. So let him say it.<eos> I don't see where there's a problem.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> No, I don't.
- Me.<eos> Friend?<eos> Louis, I may not ever say it, but that's not because we aren't.<eos> I know it.<eos> I just don't like to say it.<eos> Last time I asked you, you said, "don't push it."<eos> You knew I meant yes.<eos> I did.<eos> So Mike told you.<eos> He did.
And I want you to forgive him too.<eos> Oh, Harvey, I did forgive him.<eos> I just can't cover it up for him.<eos> You covered it up with Hardman for me.<eos> What you did that weekend is not the same as what he did to Professor Gerard.<eos> What's the same is Hardman wouldn't have let it go, and Gerard won't let it go.<eos> You make Mike confess, you might as well throw his life down the toilet.<eos> Harvey, he didn't just betray us.<eos> He betrayed the law.<eos> He did.
"The folk have stolen me over again,<eos> "the stones seemed to say.<eos> "I stood upon the hill, and wind did rise, "and the sound o? thunder rolled across the land.<eos> "I placed my hands upon the tallest stone "and traveled to a far, distant land,<eos> "where I lived for a time among strangers "who became lovers and friends.<eos> "But one day, I saw the moon came out "and the wind rose once more.<eos> "So, I touched the stones "and traveled back to my own land<eos> "and took up again with the man "I had left behind."<eos> She came back through the stones?<eos> Aye, she did.
Yes!<eos> Your spirit guides are on fire!<eos> The majority of people have dark hair.<eos> Even you, at one time.<eos> Does she work in a similar field to you? Ha!<eos> The opposite.<eos> She's a neurobiologist, and I'm a theoretical physicist.<eos> My spirit guides can go suck an egg.<eos> They're telling me that you have difficulty being close with her.<eos> Oh, he does.
Was it none?<eos> Yes, it was none!<eos> Absolutely none at all!<eos> And I have to say, it wasn't just supercars where Scotland was ahead of the game.<eos> They were ahead of the curve, also, with electric cars because, way back in the day, they made a little car called the Scamp.<eos> I've got a picture of it here.<eos> Wow! LAUGHTER<eos> Great Scott! LAUGHTER<eos> That still has the power to take your breath away, even today.<eos> It does.
Did that catch fire?<eos> Let me just think.<eos> No.<eos> Did it not?<eos> No, it didn't at all.<eos> Richard, the hire car you came down in...<eos> Yes?<eos> !<eos> ..did that burst into flames?<eos> No, it didn't.
APPLAUSE I hate you. LAUGHTER<eos> Right, now, em...<eos> Yes, as we know, a great many people in the country are now starting to use one of these to move about.<eos> Now, this is called a bicycle and you can tell just by looking at it that it is very dangerous and, as a result, a lot of people are being hurt in cycle-related injuries.<eos> In the olden days, the government would have addressed this problem by making a public information film.<eos> They used to make them about all sorts of things.<eos> We had 'Clunk Click Every Trip', not to go near a railway, not to play near the water...<eos> Yes, there was 'Don't Run'.<eos> They never told us not to run. They did!<eos> They did not.
Everybody has seen that happen.<eos> It is what annoys people most about bicycles.<eos> This is making the roads a happier place because cyclists wait like they are supposed to, car drivers aren't infuriated.<eos> And cyclists don't get knocked off or indeed blown up.<eos> You didn't listen to what we said, did you?<eos> You said we had to make the roads a more harmonious place.<eos> Exploding cyclists doesn't really get that message across.<eos> You're really trying to waste our time today because that is way off.<eos> What, you want them to jump red lights?<eos> No, we don't.
Look, I'm sorry.<eos> This is a waste of time.<eos> I'll just tell him that I tried, you know, so...<eos> Did your dad draw that?<eos> I don't know who drew it. He's had it forever.<eos> It's a Hundjager.<eos> You know what that is?<eos> Yeah, do you?<eos> No.<eos> Does your dad?
We got to be whatever they want us to be.<eos> Whatever they say or do, just go with it.<eos> Oh, and who's this smoking hunk of beef?<eos> Uh, my husband, Burt.<eos> And who's this slow... roasted...<eos> pork shoulder? You're doing great.<eos> That's my husband, Talon.<eos> And I know it looks like there's a big age difference, but that's just because I can still pull young tail.<eos> I hope everybody likes Howdy's special blend of instant dark roast.<eos> I do, but none for Talon.
He left the prison in a hurry, but his toiletries were missing from his house, and there was no suitcase there.<eos> He obviously went back to his home even though he knew he was taking a risk.<eos> I think that he might have gone back to pick up his dog.<eos> Did Rockland PD mention anything about animals at the residence?<eos> Rings where the bowls would have been.<eos> That's well-spotted, Watson.<eos> I'll revise the BOLO.<eos> Advise them the suspect may be traveling with his pet.<eos> No, I did not know they made a model for dentures based on Aaron's mouth.<eos> None of us did.
I just want to play with my dog, you know?<eos> Stan.<eos> You ran from the police.<eos> I know how it looks.<eos> I should have just told them when they asked about the dentures, but I...<eos> I thought, "How's it gonna look?" You know?<eos> I'm registered.<eos> I've got the same teeth as this guy.<eos> I thought, "Nobody's gonna believe me."<eos> Now nobody does.
Yes, but if Colville killed those woman in 2005, this may suggest motive.<eos> Whoever's committing the murders in the present day wants us to know about the dentures.<eos> They want to cast doubt on who killed those women all those years ago.<eos> Why would anybody do that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Not yet.<eos> The question becomes:<eos> Who stands to benefit most from Aaron Colville's exoneration?<eos> ...based on Aaron's mouth.<eos> None of us did.
Chris, come on, we're going home!<eos> He can't make you do this.<eos> But, Mom, I wantto do this.<eos> What?<eos> I know he's marrying me for my money, but I don't care.<eos> Dad and I spent more time together planning this wedding than we ever have before.<eos> And if being married means I get to spend even more time with my dad, then it's worth it.<eos> Wait.<eos> You knew all along I just wanted you for your money?<eos> Yeah, Dad, I did.

- Leo?<eos> Took you long enough.<eos> - Well, we got tired of waiting for you to escape on your own.<eos> - Is this a rescue or a romantic comedy?<eos> Come on.<eos> - Just keep an eye out for foot and shredder.<eos> - [blows raspberry] [laughing] - it's a trick!<eos> - Got it.<eos> Let's go. - How did you get past tiger claw?<eos> - They didn't.
I just want to know how long it's gonna take.<eos> Oh, so now you want answers.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No. Come on, you started it, what does that mean?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I sent you flowers.<eos> We spent the night in a hotel together, but you act like nothing ever happened and I don't like it.<eos> You don't.<eos> No, I don't.
Don't be so naive, Catherine.<eos> I can't keep protecting you against him. Protect?<eos> I don't need you to protect me from anything.<eos> I'm sorry, that's not what I meant. Yes, it is.<eos> Be honest.<eos> Okay, you want honesty?<eos> You may think that Vincent has changed, you may even believe that he actually has, but I used to be what he is, and I know sooner or later, he is going to hurt you...<eos> Gabe and you will be sorry! Gabe, please.<eos> The only thing I am sorry about is that things didn't work out between us, because I cared about you.<eos> I still do.
Uh, it'll-it'll take some time to fully wean him off the sedation, but I'll let you know when he starts to wake.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think she really means it.<eos> And that bugs you?<eos> No. I mean, maybe. I don't know.<eos> It's just...<eos> I don't know. It's not like I want to get married tomorrow, but never?<eos> But you're with her.<eos> I-if you love her, who cares if she's not the marrying kind? - I wasn't.<eos> - Yeah, but then you did.
Thank you.<eos> I think she really means it.<eos> And that bugs you?<eos> No. I mean, maybe. I don't know.<eos> It's just...<eos> I don't know. It's not like I want to get married tomorrow, but never?<eos> But you're with her.<eos> I-if you love her, who cares if she's not the marrying kind? - I wasn't.<eos> - Yeah, but then you did.<eos> Right, but some people don't.
Like we have to vow to the hospital gods?<eos> Hey, Alex, we have a transoral fundoplication. - I sent you the latest labs. - Jo:<eos> Oh, it's really, really cool.<eos> First, we go in orally, and then we go in through the belly button to fix a kid's reflux without leaving a scar.<eos> It puts the "fun" in "fundoplication."<eos> God, that does sound fun. - Yeah. - See?<eos> You could get on that.<eos> Just sign that, and you could be back on peds. Yeah, I'm not signing that.<eos> I have a twin?<eos> You did... in utero.
How many black kids you know know how to swim?<eos> That is such a racist assumption.<eos> Doc, what the hell are you talking about?<eos> You didn't h... nothing.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> Okay, you said he was going swimming?<eos> It's not always about race, pal.<eos> You seen many swimming pools in this neighborhood?<eos> Does Kenny know how to swim?<eos> - No, he doesn't.
All right, Raylan and I just thought it might be a good idea if you were looked after. And the service doesn't provide official protection unless there's a specific, credible threat.<eos> But you can call this an abundance of caution.<eos> And you swear Raylan's all right.<eos> He's not lying dead on a slab somewhere and you're holding back telling me?<eos> Yes, ma'am, I swear.<eos> It's just that things have heated up between him and the Crowe family, and we thought that since they came at you once to get to him...<eos> You two are worried Dan's gonna run me off the road again?<eos> Something like that.<eos> You think they'd leave me alone if I told them we broke up?<eos> We did, by the way.
And you think it's Darryl?<eos> I don't know. I wasn't there.<eos> But if I was a betting man...<eos> Since you are the one who's here at the moment, Boyd, why don't you explain on Darryl's behalf?<eos> Mr Picker, the only explaining I've ever done in my life was to my mama when she caught me sneaking in after my curfew.<eos> And you ain't my mama.<eos> But I'll indulge you with a short answer 10 your question.<eos> Shit happens, Mr Picker.<eos> What about the other half?<eos> Sometimes it don't.
Just that one right now.<eos> You going to get any more?<eos> Yeah, I'm going to get the memorial of everyone who's... That we lost here.<eos> Sergeant rice has some names on his arm from his last deployment.<eos> He's going to get another one too, with, - as far as I know, he's going to get the quote from the beginning of "8th of November."<eos> Which is what?<eos> It's - no...<eos> "There's no love greater..." Er... what is that?<eos> You have it on your iPod?<eos> Yes, I do.
- "Killed!"<eos> No, no, you see, I did not kill--<eos> Lester, you're gonna say it<eos> - one way or the other, okay? - Mm-hmm. - All right?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> "Killed Sam Hess."<eos> That's not true.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> No, I didn't.
Of course not. Proud of you.<eos> You know what you want, you went after it.<eos> How'd you get so smart? I got it from you, Daddy.<eos> Nah.<eos> Your mom's the smart one.<eos> Sometimes she says "Irregardless"<eos> when the word is "Regardless."<eos> Yeah, well, irregardless of that, she's your mother and she loves you.<eos> So you want to go to Bel Air, huh?<eos> I do, Daddy.
What was in the box?<eos> His skateboard tools and stuff.<eos> At least, that's what he said.<eos> But you didn't believe him?<eos> It's just, when he came to get it, he acted kind of strange.<eos> He noticed some tape had come loose on the box and he freaked out.<eos> He made me swear I hadn't opened it.<eos> Holly, do you have any idea what was in that box?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
Yeah.<eos> I mean, there was one in the bag. But it wasn't there when he sent it back.<eos> - Did he tell you what he was after?<eos> - No. But when I saw all the trouble that we were going to, I told Logan I wanted a cut, not just the three grand.<eos> He got really pissed and said he wasn't some criminal and this wasn't about money.<eos> It was about making things right for a friend who died.<eos> He was really intense.<eos> I believed him.<eos> Did Logan tell you who this friend was?<eos> No, he didn't.
- Hmm? Figure out how you're gonna get these bastards out of my noggin?<eos> Yes. It will be a, uh, very careful, very precise... yank.<eos> Oh, me! Me, me, me!<eos> [monitor beeping] [scoffs] Do I have to do that thing where I acknowledge the losers?<eos> 'Cause I have like five minutes.<eos> I don't want to waste it on people I don't even know.<eos> Mm, it is a courtesy.<eos> [sighs] You're nervous.<eos> You know, I know you think that I'm too busy, but I can make it work, if you don't want to be alone.<eos> But I do.
Well, just that my mother said he wants to leave tonight on the first of many vacations with her.<eos> If Pascal stops running the day-to-day at LeMarchal, it could create a power vacuum back in Paris.<eos> Where Gideon can sweep in and take advantage.<eos> Yeah, Margaux...<eos> We are about to launch a product that will fundamentally alter the landscape of this company.<eos> So why shouldn't your father commit to you before your brother has a chance to change his mind?<eos> Hello?<eos> Are you sure this is the right address?<eos> County Registrar's office said there's no Kurt Renner or anyone living here.<eos> Well, someone does.
There was this shack.<eos> We used to go there when...<eos> We wanted to sin.<eos> Am I right?<eos> And this is the place.<eos> This is where I was conceived?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's right.<eos> Thought nobody's catch you, didn't you?<eos> My mama did.
I'm gonna let you rest, let you sleep, okay?<eos> No.<eos> Stay.<eos> Please, Dad?<eos> Hey, Jim.<eos> Hmm. D.B., come in. Sit down.<eos> I hear Ellie's out of the woods.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Two of you able to talk?<eos> Yeah, we did.
Almost!<eos> How did you pull this off?<eos> Well, you know, I called your dad, and he said he had a dress you could wear.<eos> You look like an angel.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> For a second there, I wanted to marry you!<eos> Oh, just stop, Lanie!<eos> I must say, your mother had great taste.<eos> Yes, she did.
We'll have to clear the checkpoints, but we shouldn't be that far behind.<eos> Hey. Are you ok?<eos> Are you sure you're up for this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Because you almost died.<eos> I'm ok.<eos> We should get moving.<eos> Clarke's gonna be looking for us.<eos> Who lives here?<eos> We do.
Do you have a photo of your son?<eos> Do you see the picture?<eos> Yes.<eos> That was taken on the last day his mother heard from him.<eos> Over the past five years, there have been a handful of cases, all missing young men, where the last place they were known to be was Nysa, Poland.<eos> Supposedly working at the hotel.<eos> Hotel Leopold.<eos> They check in, but they don't check out.<eos> What?<eos> They don't.
- Yeah.<eos> What's it always about, Paul?<eos> Guilt.<eos> She's got a kid...<eos> a daughter, nine years old.<eos> Someone's responsible for that man's death, for making her a widow and making that kid fatherless.<eos> Yeah, and we both know who that is, don't we?<eos> And he killed Juan Badillo, and he left those two alone without even a body to bury.<eos> Jangles, Cortez, whatever his name is... he didn't kill Juan.<eos> I did.
I sat next to that federale for weeks without a goddamn clue that he might've been something else because I was so caught up with making you the villain.<eos> Chuck, please don't do this.<eos> There's nothing else to do, Paul.<eos> I let a psychopath destroy that family.<eos> It just...<eos> It just feels like everything I touch turns straight to shit.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Charlie, you got to think about what we do for a living, okay?<eos> People get hurt.<eos> They do.
Joe, your marriage is over.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Bonnie and I are stronger than ever.<eos> Your marriage... is over.<eos> Well, now that you say it with the cigarette...<eos> God, there's, like, no one hot at this school this year.<eos> Okay, students, take your seats.<eos> First off, we have a new rule:<eos> no more asking the gym teachers if they went to college.<eos> They did not.
You going to cut me?<eos> You like to watch me bleed?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You want me to cut you again?<eos> Are you hearing that?<eos> Yeah. She's adding years to his sentence.<eos> Tell me about the first time.<eos> I was eight years old... and I cut my sister's breasts with a straight razor.<eos> I got no problem cutting you.<eos> Well, I do.
Because I'm going to the mattresses against Dana Scott.<eos> Mattresses?<eos> Have you been watching The Godfather?<eos> I've been trying to come up with some common ground to expand our friendship.<eos> Tell me you finished the proposal for Franklin Courier.<eos> No.<eos> What do you mean, no?<eos> I mean I didn't do it.<eos> What, did your mother die?<eos> Because if she didn't...
Is it possible that they are actually identical?<eos> Anything's possible.<eos> How would that be?<eos> Either it's a one in a billion event or one of them stole the other one's design.<eos> Mmm. Your Honor, based on evidence introduced by opposing counsel and Mr. Morris' testimony, I would like to file a counter-suit against AYZ for patent infringement.<eos> That is outrageous.<eos> His client stole my client's design.<eos> I am the one who is outraged.<eos> This case has nothing to do with patent infringement.<eos> It does now, Reginald.
So be it.<eos> Are you mad?<eos> I'm disappointed.<eos> Harvey, I didn't mean...<eos> You can't have it both ways, Louis.<eos> Hi.<eos> The furniture came.<eos> I know we said that we would go with all my choices, but it turns out you have got pretty good taste.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I now know why they have those stickers for lorry drivers -<eos> "If you can't see my mirrors, I can't see you."<eos> 'Even though the incident had been technically my fault,<eos> 'I still followed the standard procedure.'<eos> What?<eos> He knows the rules.<eos> Live by the sword, you must...<eos> I can't remember.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Something to do with swords.
Well, we never agree on anything, ever, Nick.<eos> Why are we doing this right now, Jess?<eos> We're hungover.<eos> Just because I want to know we're going in the same direction, - that we're on the same page.<eos> - Yes, we are.<eos> Well, we live on different planets!<eos> Oh... You're talking about the fake future!<eos> I just...<eos> I guess we want different things.<eos> Clearly, we do.
Understood?<eos> - We don't get high... - Understood?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> Dude, do not Instagram that.<eos> The cops can trace that shit.<eos> You're gonna get busted, Jill.<eos> Your dad already knows you took it.<eos> - Did you tell him I took it?<eos> But he does.
The fact that any of them survived...<eos> I know this, Owen.<eos> Frankie was on borrowed time from the moment she got here.<eos> You made the right decision.<eos> You made the right call.<eos> I know I made the right call.<eos> You don't have to tell me.<eos> It was an impossible decision, and I stand by it.<eos> I did everything... exactly as I was supposed to.<eos> I did it perfectly.
Relax, old man.<eos> You're gonna get him.<eos> But right now I'm in the middle of something.<eos> Sit tight.<eos> I'll be in touch.<eos> What?<eos> Hello?<eos> Now what? Now we call John.<eos> You put a lot of trust in your friend.<eos> I do.
And I don't understand why you're angry about that.<eos> I mean, I'd think you'd be grateful for being driven around.<eos> He gets driven around all day, every day.<eos> Who am I?<eos> Miss Daisy?<eos> Sometimes I like to drive my own car.<eos> Sometimes you do drive.<eos> Are you saying that with a straight face in front of this woman?<eos> I...<eos> Do I...
You're not even redlining, okay?<eos> Look, shut up, okay?<eos> I don't know what's worse, your driving or your backseat driving.<eos> Zip it.<eos> Kono, go ahead.<eos> We're a little busy.<eos> Guys, air traffic control is reporting a small aircraft on approach.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I thought we shut down the airport.<eos> We did.
You want to tell me what's going on?<eos> She's a lying bitch!<eos> Okay, who is she?<eos> Is she your girlfriend?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> And then...<eos> Know what?<eos> Don't worry about her.<eos> Calm down.<eos> I didn't do anything.
I know you well enough to know you've already grilled everybody On your way in here to find out how i'm doing.<eos> At least you didn't break anything.<eos> Suppose if it was you driving, It would be me laying here instead.<eos> Reagan, look.<eos> I'm sorry i pressured you into doing the detail.<eos> No, you're not sorry, danny.<eos> You make decisions All the time without any regard to how i feel about it.<eos> You know, i make decisions based on what i think is right.<eos> Yeah, exactly. What you think is right.<eos> I didn't...
Well, why don't I let you two talk?<eos> So...<eos> You want my endorsement?<eos> Actually I was told That you had had a change of heart.<eos> So, what does this do?<eos> Peter thinks castro wants the meeting.<eos> Castro thinks peter wants the meeting.<eos> They're both prideful and...<eos> I want to learn your job.<eos> No, you don't.
Probably wants to know why I haven't found gainful employment.<eos> Maybe you could come with, huh? Explain why?<eos> Why don't we just clear the air?<eos> We couldn't make a deal. It's fine.<eos> You got to where you are by looking out for your own interests.<eos> No, I got to where I am because someone believed in me.<eos> Oh, you mean David Clarke, the terrorist.<eos> Despite what the rest of the world thinks, he was a great man.<eos> Do you know something that I don't?<eos> Yeah, smartass, I do.
The very rich and decidedly titled Lord Castleroy.<eos> You mean Peppercorn?<eos> That's what I called him, but I was corrected.<eos> The gentleman with a singular interest in his pepper trade, you said.<eos> But I disagree, he's also interested in you.<eos> I think I made it clear that I'm not interested in him.<eos> - But you haven't been courted by another.<eos> - Except you. I don't count, though, do I?<eos> - I don't say that to pain you.<eos> - But it does.
We had an ally.<eos> Jonathan agreed with me.<eos> Yeah, and then he agreed with his boss, which is what we're gonna do, because it's the way the world works.<eos> - Come on, Harvey.<eos> - Mike.<eos> This man goes through lawyers like a hot knife through butter, and I wasn't about to get us fired to protect some guy I don't even give a shit about.<eos> Now are you on board with that?<eos> I'm on board.<eos> - I have nothing to move on to.<eos> - I do.
Treat my body like a temple.<eos> And you've also been commuting every weekend, and you let the associates raise your blood pressure.<eos> - It's because they're stupid.<eos> - Okay, Louis, relax.<eos> The doctors say you're out of danger, but you shouldn't get worked up.<eos> - The doctors need to let me go.<eos> - You had a heart attack.<eos> If my blood supply had been cut off for a half-second less, it would've been classified as a minor cardiac event.<eos> And what if it would have lasted half a second more?<eos> It didn't.
There's no escaping the wrath of the Sky Gods, Leonardo.<eos> Translate all I say.<eos> Children of the sun!<eos> My companions and I, we have faced the trials of the divine and survived.<eos> Let us return to the vault freely and you may be spared the gods' vengeance.<eos> This is your plan?<eos> It's a bit fluid.<eos> Lay down your blade, Leonardo.<eos> If I can't find my mother, what else do I have?<eos> What else do I...
We had an agreement. It's criminal.<eos> I named the sum before I knew that one of my hostages was the father of the infamous Leonardo.<eos> You see, Mirko here had a brother.<eos> He once served as a papal guard.<eos> Where is your brother now, Mirko?<eos> Blown to bits by your son's diabolical canon.<eos> Ozzo, wait.<eos> Good Duchess, I cannot be trusted.<eos> You should have learned that from my dealings with the King.<eos> Oh, I did.
Leonardo!<eos> Mother!<eos> Tell me you heard that.<eos> I did.<eos> Perhaps she and the book lie in this vault.<eos> There has to be an anomaly somewhere.<eos> The spheres.<eos> These spheres!<eos> I remember that they have magnetic properties and the vault is metal.<eos> Oh, it doesn't do anything. Oh.
Those are your orders.<eos> First -- soon, you need to tell her who you really are, who she really is, get her ready.<eos> Then, develop her until the time is right for you to tell her that she will join our ranks.<eos> It was unforgivable for them to go behind Emmet and Leanne's backs, but don't forget what's at stake in this war.<eos> A second-generation illegal could change everything, and, for the right child, it could give their life a meaning and a purpose that they could never get in this country.<eos> That's for us to decide.<eos> Paige is your daughter, but she's not just yours.<eos> She belongs to the cause.<eos> And to the world.<eos> We all do.
What?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Uh, can you change it to the news?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> ...manhunt is currently underway in Manhattan and surrounding boroughs as the NYPD searches for Vincent Keller...<eos> Isn't that who we're meeting about?<eos> We're going to have to postpone.<eos> I Thought you said JT bandage the gem to it.<eos> He Did.
Catherine, I've come to say good-bye.<eos> ♪ Because you're all that I Good-bye?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I don't know where exactly.<eos> I just don't want you to throw away your life, okay?<eos> Oh, right, 'cause this is all for me?<eos> No, thank you. Come on...<eos> - Vincent, it makes me responsible for this colossal mess.<eos> I don't know whether to kiss you or throw you off this roof.<eos> I do.
I know.<eos> And now, the only way to free ourselves from our past is for you to kill the Founder.<eos> For better or worse, John, it's your destiny.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, stop this war.<eos> For all of us.<eos> This house if off-limits for Ultra.<eos> You're safe as long as you stay here.<eos> I thought you said Stephen needed help.<eos> He does.
But first, trousers.<eos> My name... is Joe.<eos> Bey.<eos> Well, according to your rap sheet, it's Kurt.<eos> Greenlee.<eos> Kurt Greenlee is a slave name issued to me by a corporate entity. I don't recognize the U.S. Government, so stop saying it.<eos> Call me Joe Bey.<eos> Mr. Bey, we know that Eugene MacIntosh is an associate of yours.<eos> If you say so.<eos> Actually, I don't; his brother does.
When were you gonna tell me about Alistair?<eos> His son Jeremy came here last night.<eos> He was upset about some things you said to Ian.<eos> I told you the truth.<eos> Alistair's heart stopped beating.<eos> Because of a heroin overdose, a massive heroin overdose.<eos> I know that he was found with a needle in his arm. I know it all.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> It must be nice, knowing it all.<eos> I myself do not.
But we're only halfway through our trial period.<eos> Trial period?<eos> Yeah, Michael says we're doing great. Michael?<eos> Like, tall, red hair?<eos> Crazy eyes?<eos> He only has crazy eyes when you challenge his dominance.<eos> He's an oddball who sometimes volunteers here, but I certainly wouldn't recommend letting him into your home.<eos> Good to know.<eos> Who wants to go to the dog park?<eos> I do. Yeah.
Mickey.<eos> Mickey.<eos> I was wrong about you, Mickey.<eos> - What?<eos> - You are not a captain, Mickey.<eos> You are a sailor.<eos> You are only a sailor.<eos> I'm not a fucking sailor.<eos> Never said you fucking were.<eos> Did I?
- Oh, come on.<eos> I'm Kenneth Benson. I'm Tiny.<eos> I belong in Southie.<eos> I just came out here with Sully to do a job for you.<eos> - You're gonna get--<eos> - I ain't going!<eos> You can't turn me into Bert fucking Handey.<eos> You don't get it, do you?<eos> You don't got a fucking choice.<eos> I do.
He didn't have to tell me about that reserve tank. But he did.<eos> Yesterday, we save his life, he can barely utter a thank-you.<eos> I think in some strange way he tried.<eos> A few words does not change the fact that all he cares about is his folklore status.<eos> And he's not the only one fueling it.<eos> Rebecca has been talking him up all over town.<eos> She's also the one who discovered the whole crop problem in the first place.<eos> But a few science textbooks is not gonna solve what's happening here.<eos> She doesn't know everything about this dome.<eos> And we do?
What are you talking about?<eos> It's a celebration.<eos> It's fun and games and free stuff for the baby.<eos> - I don't need it.<eos> - Okay. May I ask why?<eos> I decided to give the baby up for adoption.<eos> - I'm kind of liking these people.<eos> - Jeff and Suzanne Taylor.<eos> Bonnie: So... you want to adopt a baby?<eos> - Yes, we do.
And fast. Let's go.<eos> McGee, where are you?<eos> Do you think it's possible we could've shaken these guys?<eos> No. Keep your eyes open.<eos> Oh, boss, I got a signal.<eos> These damn things won't let me shut 'em down.<eos> - It's even messing with our phones.<eos> - Got every available I.T. helping Ms. Sciuto, and not one of them knows what the hell it is.<eos> We know one I.T. who does.<eos> Or did.
- A piece.<eos> - No.<eos> - No piece?<eos> No negotiating.<eos> Look, I know what you're doing.<eos> You can't make up your mind, so you want me to make it up for you.<eos> But I don't want someone who's with me for the money.<eos> I want someone who's with me 'cause they want to kick some ass.<eos> - And if you want to take this job right now, I will negotiate in good faith.<eos> But you don't.
But the world outside does exist.<eos> I just got word from Fitz. They need our help.<eos> Bus is fueled up, ready to go.<eos> We should tell Koenig.<eos> I just did.<eos> He's headed outside to open the hangar doors.<eos> We're in a hurry.<eos> - I just gotta grab a couple of things.<eos> We need to go right now.<eos> Of course we do.
Single shot, half a mile away.<eos> You're missing the point.<eos> I didn't want to just cross him off, I wanted to make a spectacle.<eos> People are killed by guns every day in Bogotá.<eos> But how often does a monster punch a drug lord's head clean off?<eos> Hell, that's international news.<eos> Spectacular thing you did back there, Mikey.<eos> If I didn't know better, I'd swear you were starting to enjoy your job.<eos> You get the impression he's enjoying his job?<eos> Somebody does.
I doubt he'll want to see you leave any time soon.<eos> I sent jamie to the stables To help old alec with the horses.<eos> Best place for him under the circumstances.<eos> Dinna want him inside the walls.<eos> Jamie needs a woman, not a lassie.<eos> And laoghaire will be a lassie until she's 50.<eos> Mistress beauchamp was just about to tell me Of her unusual upbringing.<eos> I'm sure it's a good story.<eos> She came back through the stones.<eos> Aye, she did.
You need someone to look after you, Daniel.<eos> Doc, hey.<eos> Glad I caught you. Um...<eos> This'll tide you over till you can get to the market.<eos> You want a job?<eos> Doc, are you okay?<eos> I know I ask a lot of you, Max.<eos> You know, keeping me on schedule, finding obscure cassette tapes, going to the ends of the earth for organic grapefruit.<eos> - You don't have to...<eos> - Yes, just... I do.
This brings to an end the crimes of one of Chicago's most prolific serial killers.<eos> Agent hess will take your questions.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Donnie.<eos> Shelby.<eos> Call me.<eos> One popular definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome.<eos> When you binge-eat a pint of chunky monkey, you see the negative results when you step on the scale.<eos> So, when you go to the freezer to grab another one, you should remember that negative consequence and resist.<eos> But you don't.
I didn't kill my sister, Alan Lim did.<eos> What the hell's this?<eos> What's going on?<eos> We recovered Corey's body, Alan.<eos> He probably looks a little different than when you and Bradley buried him in the maze 25 years ago.<eos> I don't know anyone named Corey.<eos> Sure you do.<eos> Laura knew him, too.<eos> In fact, Laura liked him.<eos> Didn't she?
Yeah.<eos> We got to go.<eos> JC Dekker.<eos> How's the surfboard business?<eos> You tell me.<eos> State of Hawaii became the proud owner of that when you threw me in here.<eos> Well, that's because your problem was trying to diversify.<eos> You should've just stuck with selling surfboards instead of going to the guns.<eos> Warden says you got something for us.<eos> I do.
This looks like a bad time. I'll come back later.<eos> Stay right where you are, Mozzie.<eos> I can explain, Suit.<eos> I'm so very lonely.<eos> You're gonna tell me where he is.<eos> I know all your interrogation techniques, Suit.<eos> I'm never gonna crack.<eos> I'm also aided by the fact that I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> We both know Neal ran.<eos> Of course we do.
Stop screwing around, Caffrey.<eos> Caffrey, you're running out of time.<eos> My travel broke.<eos> I'm supposed to meet with the Panthers in two hours, Caffrey.<eos> Figure something out, now.<eos> Guard's about to come around the bend, Caffrey. Now or never.<eos> Caffrey, I see the guard.<eos> He kept touching things.<eos> If you don't want your equipment modified - for maximum accuracy...<eos> - We don't.
Yeah?<eos> Love the pool.<eos> Sorry, Mrs. Despres.<eos> We should've asked you to bring your bikini.<eos> You a stand-up or something?<eos> You sign Steve's eviction form and you're both free.<eos> Free from what!<eos> Are we gonna talk about this?<eos> Do you speak French'?<eos> Just as good as they do in France, yeah.
- You're 46!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Don't look at the deco, eh!<eos> Tenant before, some old lady, she died two months ago.<eos> There's so much tapestry in there we could start a shop.<eos> - I hate that ugly shit!<eos> - I feel ya!<eos> You can get the last toke.<eos> You didn't even kiss me!<eos> First thing I did.
We stick together, tonight.<eos> Mom's there for ya, and vice versa.<eos> We good?<eos> Where toooooo!<eos> Alrighty!<eos> It's scary, how nothing's changed here.<eos> That secret sauce is what scares me!<eos> Those freaking secrets scare me.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I just don't.
Just happened to be dragging his body down the hallway? Is that right?<eos> Look, can you text my son?<eos> You handcuffed me right in front of him.<eos> I'll dictate it to you. He just needs to know that I'm okay.<eos> Yeah, but I'm not sure that you are, Doc. In fact, I'm sure that you're not.<eos> I'm not gonna dick around with you. You are in a shit storm of trouble here.<eos> The best thing you can do for yourself is to tell me the truth.<eos> Look, I know that this is the way you do things, but we really just don't have time for this shit.<eos> That's all you got is time, fella.<eos> No. I don't.
Look, can you text my son?<eos> You handcuffed me right in front of him.<eos> I'll dictate it to you. He just needs to know that I'm okay.<eos> Yeah, but I'm not sure that you are, Doc.

Just pick one, any one, and see what you find there.<eos> Let's put this guy back in his cell.<eos> Good-bye, Doctor. We'll see you in court in five or six months.<eos> All right, all right, all right. I-<eos> I'll take you to the bodies.<eos> I know where the bodies are.<eos> - Are you saying something different now?<eos> - I am.<eos> You know where the bodies are?<eos> I do.
No, I wasn't trying to kill Claire, I swear.<eos> Why did everybody have to go and change?<eos> What?<eos> No goodbye?<eos> Goodbyes are for suckers.<eos> Well, I... I gotta make a statement downtown.<eos> Might spend a year or 20 in jail.<eos> Lucky for you, you know a good lawyer.<eos> Well, maybe we can get together after.<eos> I don't do relationships.
I'm afraid that's not exactly accurate, Harold.<eos> Collier just sent out another coded message.<eos> "Disseminate."<eos> A shocking revelation today as an anonymous source released a classified government report...<eos> The report revealed black budget items connected to an invasive surveillance system...<eos> High-level government officials, including Senator Ross Garrison, were named in the report.<eos> - Senator! Senator!<eos> Senator!<eos> Does this massive surveillance system exist, Senator?<eos> It does not.
It's not Ethan I'm worried about.<eos> What, the other kids?<eos> He's gonna have to deal with them sooner or later.<eos> There's no nature with Ethan; it's all nurture.<eos> Kids his age are not nurturing.<eos> It's the opposite.<eos> If you're even the slightest bit different...<eos> I hear you, Jules.<eos> But he can't stay with us forever.<eos> He didn't.
This guy again.<eos> He's like a cockroach.<eos> Sounds like our last escape route is about to disappear.<eos> I'm more comfortable shooting this guy than the cops.<eos> You guys going my Way?<eos> Congressman was abducted by a white male, Six-three, dark hair, in suit.<eos> Be advised, suspect is armed and extremely dangerous.<eos> Nice car, Shaw.<eos> So how'd you know we'd be there?<eos> I didn't... until five minutes ago.
It was tucked away under several aliases, but... even MI6 can't hide from her.<eos> Mr. Greer.<eos> And Greer has Finch.<eos> Which means that Vigilance is about to have him unless we can get to him first.<eos> You won't make it there in time.<eos> Well, where's "there," Root?<eos> Still too hard to see.<eos> Then how are we supposed to find him?<eos> The machine doesn't know.<eos> But Hersh does.
Observe, child, the quintessence of devoted marriage, how carefully I attend to my dear husband's toilet...<eos> And how fearlessly he exposes his throat to my blade.<eos> Come along, Miss Mercy.<eos> Leave her.<eos> Take him with you, Tituba.<eos> One's too few, and three's too many.<eos> Your eyes... so filled with want.<eos> The hard part's not getting what you want, child.<eos> The hard part's knowing what you want.<eos> But I do.
Why would you have to?<eos> I have been using cannabis.<eos> Why would you lie about that?<eos> Because I didn't want you to think that it would compromise my performance.<eos> I-I would never use it at work.<eos> Mr. Bray, we're scientists.<eos> Hopefully, we're not ruled by hysteria, fueled by ignorance.<eos> You're fighting for your life.<eos> Yeah, but while I'm here, I want you to think that I'm living it well.<eos> I do.
Because you're a drug dealer on campus. Plus, she cut off your supply at her dispensary.<eos> That is crazy.<eos> I'm a good student.<eos> I'm here to study.<eos> Right. Well, we talked to some of your classmates.<eos> They said, four months ago, you sold pot to some of your customers, and it didn't get them high.<eos> Because her plants were truly medicinal.<eos> That's why you didn't go back for the rest of her grow.<eos> You have no proof of this.<eos> Yes, we do.
We fought about the drugs.<eos> And then I hit him with it.<eos> With the... with the Slaughterer's Chalice.<eos> Sarah, I need to know where the Chalice is.<eos> It's in a locker in my gym.<eos> I didn't know where else to put it.<eos> All I wanted to do was surprise him for when he came home.<eos> I just wanted to keep him safe.<eos> You protect the person that you love.<eos> Don't you?
Okay.<eos> I've been scanning through the restaurant's security footage for two hours; no sign of Evan.<eos> Yeah, you two took your sweet time.<eos> I got you some balls. Coconut rice.<eos> Give them to your new partner, Simms.<eos> He could use a pair.<eos> You're just jealous because he's friends with the president of the United States.<eos> - Hey. - You're wearing a new tie.<eos> Well, yes, I have a fresh one.<eos> - Doesn't everyone?
You'll leave me and my business alone if I tell you?<eos> We're only investigating a murder.<eos> Okay.<eos> He was sponsoring Maggie Parker.<eos> She's a junior at Hudson.<eos> Where Daniels worked.<eos> Let's go find her.<eos> And... you'll be hearing from my buddy at the I.R.S.<eos> But he said you'd leave me alone.<eos> He did. I didn't.
Yes.<eos> Mind if we come talk inside?<eos> Wow, pretty nice place you got here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Better than living in a dorm.<eos> And so close to campus.<eos> Can't be too cheap though.<eos> I didn't know scholarships covered private housing.<eos> You know about the Winifred O'Daire Scholarship?<eos> Yeah, we do.
Yes!<eos> Like, so easy!<eos> That's how you do it.<eos> You see that?<eos> Um, so, my friend, I would like a margarita on the rocks with salt, please. Sure ya wanna mix like that, ya lush?<eos> Oh, I can handle my liquor, thank you very much.<eos> And get one for Hayley, too.<eos> Eddie, do you want to come with me to the girls' room? I need you a sec.<eos> Why do girls always need to pee in pairs.<eos> We do not, okay?
In fact, we were thinking maybe you should take a look at some of these poems he wrote for her.<eos> Excuse me, what are you doing?<eos> Here, why don't you start with this one?<eos> Or this one. How about that?<eos> That one, any of these.<eos> Tell you what, Mrs. Daniels. How about I just read one for you?<eos> Please, just stop this!<eos> "Your cheek the apple shames, "And the brightest star turns "ignominious shooter, mortified by the wink of your eye."<eos> He wrote this for you, didn't he? What?<eos> Yeah, he did.
!<eos> The man was defending himself!<eos> Is that what the prosecutor on the case is supposed to do, or the commissioner's daughter?<eos> You chose to make that one and the same, Erin.<eos> Christopher Collins was a father who was facing the loss of his daughter, and he was scared and confused and likely out of line, but he did not deserve to die.<eos> You really trust your gut on this?<eos> Yes.<eos> Officer Cutter went too far... and he needs to pay for it.<eos> I'm just saying she's got a job to do.<eos> Dad doesn't?
The stores change, the faces change, but the job we do here... that stays the same.<eos> Serve and protect.<eos> The citizens and your partner.<eos> Randy always had my back.<eos> He made me a better cop.<eos> Then you owe him for that.<eos> But it does not excuse you of the obligation to enforce the law.<eos> Collins attacked my partner in that bathroom.<eos> Randy had the right to defend himself.<eos> Yes, he did.
Thanks for coming, Uncle Jamie.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Your text said it was "serious."<eos> Yeah, it's about a friend of mine. A friend?<eos> No, really, he's a great kid.<eos> Name's Tyler.<eos> He went to my school, but Mom said she saw him in Hell's Kitchen looking like he was on drugs.<eos> Did he use when you knew him?<eos> I know he smoked pot sometimes.<eos> No, I don't.
You just didn't want anybody seeing you in a skirt.<eos> I'm not sure anyone would enjoy that.<eos> Oh, no, well, that's not really true.<eos> You know, I mean, 'cause you're just always so self-deprecating.<eos> I've got stuff to do.<eos> She's green.<eos> I don't think we should just put her in with random skank. You said Zen Dolls, right?<eos> That's right.<eos> I know somebody who works there.<eos> Or did.
The operation went as well as could be expected.<eos> There's, uh, good blood flow to the liver, and the other bleeding has stopped.<eos> She's got a long road ahead of her, but, uh, it's looking good.<eos> Where the fire department is still working hard to clean up the mess left by a bomb that went off at 8 o'clock this morning, leaving 18 dead...<eos> How many survivors they pull out?<eos> I just heard over two dozen.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Chicago will bounce back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She always does.
-Now I want some.<eos> WOMAN: (SINGING) ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you<eos> ♪ Happy birthday, dear Madison<eos> ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪<eos> WOMAN: What do you want, Simon?<eos> We are blowing out Madison's candles.<eos> No.<eos> Listen, I don't care that you're her father.<eos> Madison doesn't want to talk to you.<eos> Because she doesn't.
Come in.<eos> Alpha, Oscar, three, Charlie, Zulu.<eos> Come in.<eos> Unknown caller, by failing to identify yourself, you are conducting an illegal radio transmission.<eos> MAN: Oz Turner?<eos> I-I-9-9-R-C...<eos> There is no caller by that handle at this location.<eos> Over.<eos> MAN: Mr. Turner, we need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
That's a problem.<eos> Well, now that we're out here, let's go find a solution.<eos> What did your pain-in-the-ass sister just say?<eos> We need power. Now that we're out in the world,<eos> I'm taking Uma hunting.<eos> You tell her... Hey.<eos> They've been cooped up down here for ten years.<eos> God!<eos> She needs this.<eos> They all do.
It was controlled and they know what they're doing...<eos> He got so scared that he ran away from the table.<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> I did not.<eos> - No, no...<eos> - Come on.<eos> You ran away from the table.<eos> What?<eos> No, I did not.
What?<eos> No!<eos> I did not.<eos> - No, no...<eos> - Come on.<eos> You ran away from the table.<eos> What?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Yes, you did. Oh, okay.<eos> No. I did not.
Obey peacefully and genius remain in the bottle.<eos> We will continue to truck CDC and act on my mark.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> How will dominate guarding the hostages situation?<eos> They will not.<eos> I guess I will not risk.<eos> Going to shoot and destroy the truck the virus before it disperses.<eos> These people are our family.<eos> Can not decide who lives or dies.<eos> No, But they will.
Give me the wrong answer, I can't help you.<eos> Get out of here, Fed.<eos> What are you doing, bruh?<eos> He's a narc, man.<eos> He's trying to get us to say seadog was dealing.<eos> So, tell the bacon what he wants to hear if it gets us our light back.<eos> I not diming on seadog.<eos> Man, he's six below.<eos> - He won't know.<eos> - Yo, I will.
Or everybody knows no one throws a rager like Hailey Nichol.<eos> You're looking for some good blow, clean speed...<eos> This conversation is over.<eos> You want to go, then go.<eos> Not without my three grand.<eos> You better hope that Cameo doesn't show up, after what you did to Alex.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Hey. Do you think it's time we end this?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Well, maybe the cops will.
Michael Jordan scored 16 points in his first pro game.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know that. I just didn't think you did.<eos> All I'm saying is, you know, you've got to shake it off.<eos> What if I can't do it, Keith?<eos> - I mean, maybe I can't play at this level.<eos> - You can. Well maybe not.<eos> And plus, it's all of them.<eos> I don't fit into their world.<eos> I never will.
Fear changes everything.<eos> - Atlas Shrugged?<eos> - Yeah, you read it?<eos> - No.<eos> - It's good.<eos> Anyway, you're gonna be fine.<eos> Just remember... don't let him take it.<eos> - I don't know what that means.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> But you will.
Did I miss something? Did you get married while I was at work?<eos> No, but that's where we're headed.<eos> You forgot Charlotte Yorkenblatt.<eos> Actually, I've been making some calls... and I was wondering how you both felt about November.<eos> November?<eos> For what? For our wedding.<eos> Most of the synagogues are booked through the fall.<eos> - November works for me.<eos> - Has Harry even proposed yet?<eos> No, but he will.
Six hours.<eos> You're not here to fight the Toros and the Los Mags.<eos> You're here to unite 'em.<eos> One gang, one leader: you.<eos> Uniting the Toros and the Los Mags?<eos> Come on. Think about it.<eos> They stop pissing on each other and turn their guns on everyday folks... it's not good.<eos> - So how do we keep him here?<eos> - The girlfriend won't testify.<eos> - Mayda will.
Do you ever wonder how your life would be different if that hadn't happened?<eos> I used to.<eos> Not any more.<eos> - Were you and Dad in love with each other?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Very much so at first.<eos> Despite how we grew apart, your father was the great love of my life.<eos> At least you had that.<eos> I'm beginning to think I never will.<eos> You will.
"look for me under your boot soles.<eos> "You will hardly know who I am or what I mean<eos> "but I shall be good health to you nevertheless.<eos> "Missing me one place?<eos> Search another.<eos> "I stop somewhere.<eos> "Waiting for you."<eos> I hate to see The People go. Mm.<eos> I just hope the cheque clears.<eos> Of course it will.
But on the life of my family, I knew nothing about that.<eos> Get me the memo.<eos> L guarantee your e-mail won't be needed.<eos> But if I were you, I'd talk to the police before they talk to you.<eos> - L-l'll drop you somewhere safe.<eos> - L'm safe.<eos> How much did you get?<eos> Nearly all of it.<eos> If you're going to change your mind, do it before the affidavit's handed over.<eos> L won't.
You will if you keep interfering with me getting Jackie back.<eos> You're the one that's interfering.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm going and Jackie's going, and you're staying home.<eos> - No.<eos> You are.<eos> - No.<eos> You are.<eos> - Fine, stay home then.<eos> - I will.
Shower open?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> - Hi, Alan.<eos> Judith?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Cindy's teaching me to surf. She says I'm a natural.<eos> 'Cause she's got the upper body strength for it.<eos> Nothing like yours.<eos> You will.
I lose this vote, I'm resigning.<eos> - Will they postpone again?<eos> - Not after two continuing resolutions.<eos> - This expires at midnight.<eos> - Is that our problem?<eos> It massively is, yes.<eos> What about Grace Hardin?<eos> I thought of her.<eos> Can she say no to the president?<eos> - She will.
"Orange County's beachfront is a national treasure."<eos> - Who are you? Charlie McCarthy?<eos> - Charlie was the dummy.<eos> Edgar Bergen was the ventriloquist.<eos> When they ask about the rise in the consumer price index, you say:<eos> "Orange County's beachfront is a national treasure."<eos> They're gonna ask me about the Democratic tax plan.<eos> - They might.<eos> - They might.<eos> - They will.
I'm asking why you would choose me after what happened last go around.<eos> Yeah, I thought about that, too.<eos> Looking down that list of names on the Southeastern roster I'm saying to myself,<eos> "Why take a man who already burned you once,<eos> "who already proved himself disloyal?"<eos> Now, why would I do that?<eos> I have no fuckin' clue, Lieutenant.<eos> Because if I caught him once, he might be the last son of a bitch to try it twice.<eos> I'm guessing you got enough shame from the last time, so it won't happen again.<eos> No, sir, it won't.
- It's always about that.<eos> - No. Not this time.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's different with him.<eos> I don't have to pretend anymore.<eos> - I almost believe you.<eos> - Well, you should.<eos> Because it's over, and I'm out.<eos> - You can't prove any of this.<eos> - I will.
You can't be bothered about it anymore!<eos> Just shut up!<eos> I can't take this anymore.<eos> I'm sorry you had to find out this way... but I can't go on like this, and neither can Kelly.<eos> And if you're not ready, that's okay.<eos> I understand.<eos> It doesn't mean that I don't love Sean.<eos> I think of him every single day.<eos> Because I do.<eos> And I always will.
- You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him. - Yes, sir.<eos> - And if there is any problem, make sure we know about it first.<eos> - I understand.<eos> When the Precogs declare a victim and a killer their name is embedded in grain of wood.<eos> Since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is unique the shape and grain is impossible to forge.<eos> - I'm sure you all understand the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.<eos> - Here we go again.<eos> Look, I'm not with the ACLU on this, Jeff.<eos> - But let's not kid ourselves, we are arresting individuals who've broken no law.<eos> - But they will.
Take a look at your chest.<eos> You saw how accurate I can be, how lethal.<eos> Kill me now, and you give yourself away.<eos> Not with a silencer.<eos> It would take these guys the rest of the day to figure out it wasn't one of their own men that did it.<eos> You can be shot 41 times for pulling out your wallet.<eos> Throw down your weapon and come out with your hands raised.<eos> - Ignore him.<eos> - Yeah, what if they open fire?<eos> They won't.
- Up ahead.<eos> Roadbiock.<eos> - Who are they looking for?<eos> - Anyone not like them.<eos> His passport was found in his backpack when he escaped one of our roadblocks.<eos> - He's committing suicide.<eos> - Oniy two ways he can go:<eos> Upriver or on the road through Mompós.<eos> If we know he's here, the guerrillas know.<eos> Or they will soon.
- What would you have me do?<eos> - Heip me stop him.<eos> It's too late.<eos> I'm trusting you with my life.<eos> And my son's.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Ciaudio went to Washington to plant a bomb.<eos> I can't be a part of it anymore.<eos> They'll protect us, won't they?<eos> If they won't, I will.
so, let's try this one.<eos> it's not really that hard.<eos> Think of all the times you wanted to kill yourself.<eos> Very nice.<eos> Now for the real test of mettle.<eos> You wouldn't shoot me, would you, Sam?<eos> Not the woman you love. Not the woman who stood by you through all your pain and suffering.<eos> - Shoot it, Sam!<eos> - I love you, Sam.<eos> I always will.
You're smarter than that.<eos> You write a story, I steal it, and I'm about to shoot the greatest movie of my career.<eos> So, you admit you stole my story?<eos> We've been over this.<eos> It's ancient history.<eos> Yeah, I stole your story!<eos> Whoop-dee-doodle-doo! You happy now?<eos> I stole Jason Shepherd's paper and turned it into Big Fat Liar!<eos> You know who's listening, pal?<eos> And they never will.
-You all right?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Is your mom picking you up?<eos> No, I got my bike.<eos> It's a great shot you made.<eos> Your coach was a little rough.<eos> He should be more supportive.<eos> -Want me to have a word with him?<eos> -That's okay.<eos> -I will.
No, I wouldn't think so.<eos> Ha! Or in any other.<eos> Tell me, Reverend you who have attended so many deathbeds... what is it people most desire as they face the end of their lives?<eos> More time?<eos> Well, I suppose.<eos> Exactly.<eos> They'd give almost anything, I imagine, for one more year.<eos> Imagine what they'd give for all eternity.<eos> Sir, I don't quite understand what...<eos> You will.
-Of course.<eos> Since I am here.<eos> Then find out about Alicia.<eos> Whether she's alive, whether she gave birth, whether the baby is alive...<eos> I need to know, Marco...<eos> You understand, right?<eos> I will try to...<eos> Talk to you on Saturday...<eos> -Did you find out anything?<eos> -I will.
You think Donnagon's the one behind all this?<eos> You're talking to a man with four heads.<eos> Trust me -- the guy is dirt.<eos> What should we look for?<eos> First, find the island.<eos> Then find the island Man.<eos> That would have been Donnagon's contact.<eos> Okay. Thanks, Minion.<eos> Be a good girl and swat your brother for me.<eos> Oh, I will.
Lecter picked up on something in the missing part of the note.<eos> Not a name, but something, enough to narrow the search.<eos> Even if he did, he won't tell you.<eos> Not unless I can offer him something.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> That was most artistic, the way you disposed of Mr. Lounds.<eos> Your cell looks bigger with no books in it.<eos> Does it?<eos> I hadn't noticed.<eos> Oh, you will.
- Good, that was good.<eos> "Yeah. I can see how touched you are."<eos> - Yeah, I can see how touched...<eos> That's my line.<eos> - That's your line.<eos> What am I doing here?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I came here to tell you that you have a preliminary...<eos> Come back and try again.<eos> - I will.
- Who's the lucky boy?<eos> - Not telling.<eos> - You will if you want me out of the room!<eos> - Sean Bateman.<eos> - He's a drug dealer.<eos> - He made me zhing!<eos> - Zhing? What? Something amazing's gonna happen.<eos> Like it just fucking fucks you right up the...<eos> - No, I've never had that.<eos> - You will someday.
Do you remember anything about that night?<eos> That night with Katie?<eos> Do you remember...<eos> She told you about a videotape, didn't she?<eos> She was afraid, wasn't she?<eos> Something was happening to her.<eos> How did she die?<eos> Please.<eos> I need to know.<eos> And you will.
Christ!<eos> The things she'd show you.<eos> She's still showing them.<eos> And she'll never stop.<eos> You coming here proves that.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Please.<eos> I have to stop her.<eos> If I don't, my son will die.<eos> Oh, yes. He will.
And then they mate, and they get thirsty, and they come back.<eos> All right, but, I mean, I...<eos> We don't know how far the water is, though.<eos> And I don't think we should abandon the higher-ground idea, 'cause it was a good idea.<eos> And that was a rolling hills scout-about. And if we go on a mountain, like, crow's-nesting, like that mountain over there...<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> We know where the water is now.<eos> We could just go there, and then get water and then go on our mountain, the mountaintop scout-about, after we've gotten water.<eos> I think the mountain's a better idea because what if we go to the mating grounds and they see us and they get self-conscious, and then they don't mate?<eos> Then we'll just...
- Dad, are you all right?<eos> - Go away. Get out of here.<eos> Dad, open the door.<eos> Go away!<eos> Let me in, please.<eos> Why did you tell her?<eos> They know that only I know where to find him.<eos> Do they think I'm going to take you to him?<eos> I'll never do that.<eos> - I won't.
- Larger than a Greyhound bus.<eos> - Bullshit!<eos> - Look. That's what you're dealing with.<eos> You can't keep this quiet.<eos> We have got a 60-foot shark swimming off our coast that's not going to go away.<eos> We have to tell the authorities!<eos> And tell the world we've got a dinosaur swimming off our beaches?<eos> - You won't blow the whistle?<eos> Fine.<eos> Then I will.
You want me to do something for you, I'll do it, but let my daughter go.<eos> - I'm not...<eos> - After what you've done I should kill you both right now! Don't test me!<eos> You're not thinking this through, Andre.<eos> You have a chance to escape with your brother and your father alive.<eos> - You start killing innocents, they'll never... - Enough!<eos> Your best tactic right now, Mr. Bauer, is to be quiet and let my father rest!<eos> Okay.<eos> All I care about with Ferragamo is that the public knows in no uncertain terms, that Carl and the Latham Group were acting outside of our influence.<eos> No. They will.
Well, like I said, someone has to retrieve the engine, and we all know what happens next.<eos> Some of us better than others.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Your brothers and sisters would love to know what's become of you.<eos> No.<eos> My place is here with my friends.<eos> Your place is with us.<eos> Don't forget whose side you're on.<eos> I never have.<eos> I never will.
Nice and empty.<eos> You should have seen the size of the dust bunnies under Cordy's bed.<eos> More like dust sperm-whales.<eos> I can't believe it's been three months.<eos> We paid the rent for the first couple but then things got sort of tight.<eos> And, well, big apartment, no one living here.<eos> Phantom Dennis.<eos> Does he know anything about Cordy?<eos> He's just ticked we haven't brought her home already.<eos> We will, though.
Hey, Grissom... Keep me posted.<eos> I will.<eos> Did you take a look at that maggot from the<eos> Yes.<eos> And?<eos> Well, it belongs to the family of sarcophagids.<eos> That's as far as I got.<eos> You mind taking another look for me?<eos> Your maggot never developed, Nick.<eos> It never will.
But we also know that you're lost and that scares us.<eos> And there's nothing in the world that we want more than to help you find your way home. We just don't know how.<eos> I think you just did.<eos> I will stand by my word.<eos> You promise?<eos> I promise.<eos> You guys, can we...?<eos> Can we just stay in tonight and not go to the restaurant?<eos> We still have to talk.<eos> Yeah, we will, just at home.
I am Mrs. Cole Turner.<eos> This is all wrong.<eos> Ever since I put that ring on your finger,<eos> - you've been acting strange.<eos> - You mean I've been acting normal?<eos> Which is strange for you, you know.<eos> I gotta be honest.<eos> If this is what being married to you is gonna be like,<eos> - you can take that ring off now.<eos> - I will not.
It'll be the stupidest thing you've ever done, and there won't be any coming back from it.<eos> Your life will be over.<eos> - My life's already over!<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> Not yet.<eos> It takes more courage to put down that knife than to use it.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Give me the knife, Greg.<eos> - You'll call the police.<eos> - No, I won't.
I know you.<eos> How are you ever going to find your soulmate if you won't go and talk to anyone, Walt?<eos> Soulmate?<eos> What the heck is that?<eos> It's the person you're meant to spend your life with.<eos> You really believe in all that stuff?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really do.<eos> Right now, I'd just be happy to find a good woman, you know?<eos> Well, you will.
Okay.<eos> So I gotta get to Midway.<eos> Wait.<eos> I updated my will last year, but-<eos> Look at it out there.<eos> It's gonna take me hours.<eos> I want to start a college fund.<eos> Well, you'll drop Rachel off in St. Louis in July. We can talk then.<eos> - I don't know if I'll be able to make that.<eos> - Yes, you will.
I'd hate to see humanity destroy itself.<eos> That makes two of us.<eos> Want to shoot some eight ball?<eos> Jack... I've got a geometry midterm next week.<eos> It's good practice.<eos> Nice try, but there's better ways to prepare for a math test.<eos> Are you interested in mathematics?<eos> Oh, it's what I want to study at college.<eos> Mechanical engineering... if I get to go.<eos> You will.
Colin would never forgive me if I didn't make sure you got these.<eos> I know he would give anything to be here.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Amy.<eos> Amy.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - He's not coming back.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> He could come out of it.<eos> He probably will.
What?<eos> What is it?<eos> Are you moving us to Zimbabwe or something? No no.<eos> It's nothing like that.<eos> I was just thinking about something.<eos> It's funny actually.<eos> Well it's not so much funny "ha ha" as...<eos> You see the thing is...<eos> I don't know whether or not you've ever had sex.<eos> And you never will.
Maybe I don't wanna be called that.<eos> It's just-- it's just. she has too much homework.<eos> Did you see how many books she has to carry?<eos> She's gonna be a hunchback.<eos> You know. your concern for Ally is truly heartwarming. but this is what Miss Purcell gives them.<eos> Miss Purcell. yeah.<eos> I know the type.<eos> "My life is miserable. children. so guess what-- I'm takin' you down with me!"<eos> If you have a problem with this woman. then maybe you should talk to her.<eos> Maybe I will.
Sincerely, Marie Barone."<eos> - "P.S.--<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Please ask Robert to forgive me.<eos> I tried, but it'll mean more coming from you."<eos> Please forgive your mother.<eos> Mom, I didn't purposely not tell you I was gonna be on TV, I just forgot.<eos> Then maybe I'll just forget to watch.<eos> Fine, don't watch.<eos> Fine, I won't.
I never saw that in my sires.<eos> (laughter and chatter)<eos> Definitely.<eos> -Oh, no, no.<eos> You just want 'em to stay like that. You know, they think they got all the time in the world. But pretty soon, it's doctors.<eos> Kim. -Hey! Hi.<eos> -Hey. Hi, I did what you told me.<eos> Johnny doesn't wanna be here, but I told him we had to talk.<eos> He thinks I'm breaking up with him.<eos> Yeah, well you will.
A small crew.<eos> They must feel the need to be free.<eos> Take jobs as they come.<eos> They never have to be under the heel of nobody ever again.<eos> No matter how long the arm of The Alliance might get we'll just get ourselves a little further.<eos> - Get her running again?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - So not running now?<eos> - Not so much.<eos> But she will.
I tell you, we get a mechanic, get her up and running again hire a good pilot, maybe a cook, live like real people.<eos> A small crew.<eos> They must feel the need to be free. Take jobs as they come.<eos> They never have to be under the heel of nobody ever again.<eos> No matter how long the arm of The Alliance might get we'll just get ourselves a little further.<eos> - Get her running again?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - So not running now?<eos> - Not so much.<eos> But she will.
- My heart is beating so fast, it's gotta slow down.<eos> - Okay, just... let's take a breath.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - This freaking out is not good.<eos> - It sucks.<eos> We can do this. If others can do this, we can do this!<eos> - Well, I'm not so sure anymore.<eos> - That is unacceptable!<eos> - Well, I don't wanna accept it.<eos> - Then we won't.
- Sookie and Jackson?<eos> - That would be fun.<eos> - And Grandma and Grandpa?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's your graduation.<eos> They should be there.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> They won't want to be there.<eos> - Of course they will.
No.<eos> Should I?<eos> Well, he's been talking about you the whole trip.<eos> He thinks you murdered your wife.<eos> - He what?<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> No one's gonna believe him.<eos> He's a real fruitcake.<eos> But you might want to... want to keep an eye on him, you know?<eos> Yes. Yes, I will.
The Chariot.<eos> You are a very restless soul.<eos> Oh. Now this is interesting.<eos> The Knight of Pentacles.<eos> Is that good?<eos> Well, it confirms what I felt earlier...<eos> romance.<eos> You know anyone with a British accent?<eos> - No.<eos> - You will... very soon.
- Officer Brass.<eos> - This is bullshit!<eos> - Brass!<eos> - If I could get another fucking job somewhere else, I'd quit in a second. But I'm a gimp.<eos> Nobody's hiring gimps these days.<eos> - Dave, what's wrong?<eos> - Wall-to-wall bullshit.<eos> Leo?<eos> He's pissed I assigned to him to reception and I won't let him deal with prisoners... put him back in Unit B.<eos> Well, why won't you?
Jordan was right about me.<eos> I'm insecure and I judge people to cover up for it.<eos> Even right now, all I can think about is to tell you you're a surgeon now, and you have to start acting like an adult.<eos> You had to say all of that?<eos> You don't listen unless people spell it out for you.<eos> - Oh, my God, I can't stop.<eos> - Baby...<eos> Maybe it's something you need to work on.<eos> I promise you, I will never ever tell you what to do, ever again.<eos> Yeah, you will.
That's too bad.<eos> I liked her.<eos> I did too.<eos> Dear God.<eos> Why don't we just say something to him?<eos> - Like what?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> "I heard your songs and they're extraordinary"?<eos> Elliot, don't.<eos> - I won't.
- l'll be your plus one.<eos> He should've said "we" something.<eos> We go to this dry cleaners.<eos> - We might be breaking up soon.<eos> - l didn't tell Walker I had a baby.<eos> - How could you not mention it?<eos> - lt didn't come up.<eos> If he'd asked, "Have you given birth recently?", I would have said, "Define recently."<eos> - You have to tell him.<eos> - l will.
I forgot I had these.<eos> Things are looking up.<eos> How many pairs of shoes do you need?<eos> That is not the way to get out of this alive.<eos> I figure I'll need about half this space.<eos> - I figure you're mentally ill.<eos> - You never wear most of this.<eos> Yet.<eos> I never wear most of this stuff yet.<eos> Some day I will.
Wipe those smiles off your faces, shitheads.<eos> You don't score points with me banging 1 2-year-olds.<eos> What kind of work she do before tricking for you?<eos> I heard she worked this sex club.<eos> - She was a kid.<eos> - So?<eos> So, what kind of work could she do for a sex club?<eos> - You'll have to ask them.<eos> - Oh, don't worry.<eos> I will.
All right.<eos> Let me do it. Let me do this for you, Vic.<eos> Please, Vic.<eos> Looks like it's starting to work.<eos> Us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course, you never ask me about my stuff.<eos> I'm always trying to get you to open up, but you never pry. Why is that?<eos> You wanna talk?<eos> You will.
They handed over a hatemonger.<eos> Their actions led to three people being killed.<eos> And a woman being sexually assaulted in front of her 1 0-year-old son.<eos> - They couldn't have foreseen that.<eos> - They conspired to kill a man and then tried to cover it up.<eos> They're victims.<eos> My group won't let this department turn them into martyrs.<eos> I thought martyrs are what brought in the donations and got your name in the papers.<eos> I'll see they don't spend one day in jail.<eos> They probably won't.
I take the kids up to Lake Tahoe every year, fishing, swimming.<eos> Sounds great.<eos> Two weeks' vacation doesn't make up for a year of double shifts but the kids look forward to it.<eos> - How's the meat?<eos> - Five more minutes, bring out the buns.<eos> - Great.<eos> Did you tell Matthew he could keep a spider in his room?<eos> - That's for a school project.<eos> - Lf that thing gets loose...<eos> - It won't.

This I gotta see.<eos> Oh, he just wants to make friends.<eos> Ooh! Who's a good dog?<eos> What a goody doggie!<eos> He just a google...<eos> So, Bart, when does the killing start?<eos> Look, Bart, sometimes dogs or people hate you for no reason.<eos> Bart's a goner.<eos> Anyone want to be my new best friend?<eos> I will!
What's with the red face?<eos> Keith and I were fooling around, and, well, he hadn't shaved.<eos> You big whore.<eos> - Is it really bad?<eos> - No.<eos> Actually, it's bright red.<eos> It's red as a baboon's ass.<eos> Oh, my God! I look like a burn victim.<eos> What I wanted to ask was if you'd be best man at my wedding.<eos> - Of course I will.
I just said that I hadn't admitted that I was powerless.<eos> I don't want to hate my parents any more than I already do.<eos> -You'II probably end up forgiving them.<eos> -well, I don't want to do that either.<eos> I don't want to be one of those people that walks around in pain all the time.<eos> What about when you are in pain?<eos> I choose not to be.<eos> What's so bad about a little pain?<eos> I feel like it'II kill me.<eos> It won't.
Yeah, I do.<eos> Not getting my stripes.<eos> Something I can't talk about.<eos> Something that was ruining my whole life, and he made it right.<eos> I would follow that man into hell.<eos> But why do they have to come here?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> This place isn't bugged.<eos> The cops and the feds don't know about it.<eos> Probably in time they will.
We've seen it before.<eos> You were all willing to stake the security of the base on it.<eos> Artok's hostility towards the Tok'ra could throw off the readings.<eos> - His hostility is the reason Ocker is dead.<eos> - What if we verify his alibi?<eos> He's right.<eos> Maybe someone saw him where he said he was.<eos> Tok'ra and Jaffa deliberately ate apart from each other.<eos> I will not accept the word of a Jaffa in his defence.<eos> Of course you won't.
Spoils are good.<eos> We like spoils.<eos> Teal'c has informed me that you require several hours of sleep.<eos> There is no shame in doing so.<eos> Gee, thanks.<eos> - Shal met.<eos> - Shal met.<eos> Have you chosen to join us, Teal'c?<eos> - K'tano has yet to ask.<eos> - He will.
You've got Senior Senior Staff at the COS then Senior Staff at the Roosevelt Room.<eos> Meeting with the economic team to pre-brief for fed chair then Advance, State and NSC to go over the next 6 months of foreign travel.<eos> Let me look at this thing.<eos> Right.<eos> Yes.<eos> Let me know when C.J. 's briefing starts.<eos> - Sorry I'm late.<eos> - Good morning, Mr. President.<eos> - We hearing from Michigan's delegation?<eos> - We will.
Like, uh... maybe something you'd find in an X-File.<eos> If that's what you came looking for, then you came a long way for nothing.<eos> - Then what's with the cavalry?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> A lot of good shoes out here looking for what's gotta be a dead man.<eos> The guy was killed, right?<eos> A man survives a fall like this, on fire?<eos> It's not very likely.<eos> You got a body?<eos> We will, Agent Doggett.
Who authorises you?<eos> I mean, what gives you the right?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm the future, Agent Scully.<eos> And I risked my life being here.<eos> Then why do it?<eos> I mean, why meet me?<eos> You can reach Mulder.<eos> He needs to know what I know, or he may have no future.<eos> Perhaps no one will.
My God!<eos> I'll twist my tongue saying that!<eos> It's a nice name.<eos> Whatever it may be.<eos> Memsahib, we're leaving.<eos> Namaste.<eos> Come on.<eos> He'll never agree, Bhuvan.<eos> Father.<eos> He will.
He wanted you to know that he changed his stars after all.<eos> And has he followed his feet?<eos> Has he found his way home at last?<eos> Yes.<eos> Father.<eos> Oh, William.<eos> Oh, my boy.<eos> I should like to meet this Wat.<eos> And Roland too.<eos> You will, Father.
-He's a toy.<eos> He's a gift.<eos> From you.<eos> David, when we leave, the doors will go smart so you can't leave your room, but if you'd like....<eos> -I put too much on.<eos> -Do I smell lovely?<eos> Oh, God, no!<eos> Mommy?<eos> Will you die?<eos> Well, one day, David, yes, I will.
Come on!<eos> Is 50 years a long time?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> David, I'll get it!<eos> -Hand it to me.<eos> -Look what I can do.<eos> Hello. Yes?<eos> Mrs. Swinton, could you hold?<eos> I have an urgent call.<eos> Yes, I will.
The meal will begin with an hors d'oeuvres tartare... your feet.<eos> The main course...<eos> But during that time... you'll be able to enjoy the effects of the consumed appetizer... with a full-bodied saline drip.<eos> I guess you wish now... you'd fed the rest of me to the dogs.<eos> No, Mason.<eos> No, I much prefer you the way you are.<eos> So... dinner at 8:00.<eos> You will stay for the evening's entertainment... won't you, Cordell?<eos> If it's all right with you... I think I'd rather not.<eos> Rather not... or will not?
Okay.<eos> Okay, I'll get the garbage, Danny.<eos> Okay?<eos> Bye-bye, Andre.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> You look good with those shoes.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> I know.<eos> Watch your step out there, Brian.<eos> I will.
- Who is that? - It's the guy from yesterday.<eos> - Who?<eos> - The insane guy who came in the office.<eos> We gotta call the police.<eos> - Hang on. Let me think about this.<eos> - No! What for?<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> Just put down the phone so I can think!<eos> I'm just not 100% sure they're going to believe me.<eos> Of course they will.
-They were fighting.<eos> The janitor said that it was two identical twins fighting.<eos> identical twins.<eos> Go. Straight.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> You're alive.<eos> Who is he?<eos> You're so smart, figure it out for yourself.<eos> I will.
You know the rules.<eos> You just don't come up here.<eos> Make an appointment. An appointment.<eos> Now, go.<eos> Tell the beaver to make an appointment.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'll end up sleeping with the fishes.<eos> How's it gonna look in the paper if Dr Dolittle throws a possum off the roof? Not right.<eos> - Now, leave.<eos> Cos I will.
That will never be tolerated.<eos> You know the importance of a God-given name and a home in which it can flourish.<eos> It defines us.<eos> No doubt your request comes from the heart.<eos> - But there are higher considerations.<eos> - I implore you!<eos> If I have no legacy to pass on, the name of Valois dies with me.<eos> In the eyes of the royal family, that would not be unfavorable.<eos> This royal office will not grant your petition.<eos> It never will.
We're all friends here, aren't we, Mary B.?<eos> We're not just friends.<eos> I'm sorry, Paulie.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> In her eyes, that brightness, heh?<eos> Just like my fake mother... that brightness when she lies...<eos> Make you big and strong. You can fly far away from here.<eos> You can fly far away from here.<eos> We will fly away from here.<eos> We will away from here forever.
I don't wanna get Jeff into trouble.<eos> - He's right, you're a good mechanic.<eos> But just do your fucking job, all right?<eos> Like, Jeff, I mean, he's been here two years, he works his ass off, he's loyal to the company, and he believes in what he's doing.<eos> Now a guy like that, he can move up.<eos> You catch my drift?<eos> - I'll do my best.<eos> I hope you do.<eos> So, let's consider this just a bad mistake. One that'll never happen again.<eos> - It won't.
Who are you people?<eos> Let me go.<eos> Wait.<eos> But Prince Asoka, he tried to...<eos> -Spare him.<eos> 'Prince' Asoka?<eos> You'll stay here.<eos> -Pawan is waiting for me.<eos> His kind never return.<eos> He will, Bheema.
Just the man I wanted to see<eos> I owe you a call Good to see you You're a busy man<eos> If you weren't so busy, you wouldn't be getting<eos> Southport's Man of the year award<eos> Yeah, well, it's a slow year, we all know that right?<eos> How's the backhand coming ?<eos> Coming along, want to play tomorrow?<eos> Let me give you a call<eos> Give my best to everybody<eos> I will
Was it wise to bring him here?<eos> One day he'll be king of the Huns' most powerful tribe.<eos> Then we should kill him.<eos> Then we'd be at war with the Huns, just what we're trying to avoid.<eos> - Won't his elder brother be king?<eos> - Attila will be king.<eos> Therefore, we'll seduce him with wealth and treat him as a friend.<eos> And at the end of all your scheming,<eos> - if he turns against us...<eos> - He will not.
What's wrong with you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Hey, let me have a bite of that.<eos> None of us mentioned it.<eos> It was only a dream, a nightmare.<eos> Nothing that crazy could be real.<eos> Everything was okay, just like before.<eos> Have a good day at school, boys.<eos> And remember not to tell anyone.<eos> We won't, Dad.
Come into the shed.<eos> Come in and shut the door.<eos> Are you afraid?<eos> -Of what?<eos> -You.<eos> Only demons should fear me.<eos> And you're not a demon, are you?<eos> The angel said you were.<eos> But I can't believe that.<eos> I won't.
This is a hell of a setup you got here.<eos> I mean, I'm not lyin'. I mean, whoo!<eos> You got to have major coins behind this.<eos> Who's backing' you - Puffy?<eos> Silence, Moor!<eos> Tell me, when will the duke arrive?<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> You wanna see if I can improv.<eos> OK, well, let's see...<eos> The duke will arriveth in all his royal pomposity and splendor on Tuesday.
No, but I was a child.<eos> I've survived in a fashion.<eos> I can't be separated from her.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Don't know what to think.<eos> Your bed's made.<eos> - I believe in you.<eos> - You do?<eos> They will too.
They're moving really fast, sir.<eos> - How many?<eos> - Over a hundred, sir.<eos> We don't have much time.<eos> We must leave at once.<eos> Escape to where?<eos> We'll throw them off with the carriage.<eos> Good idea sir.<eos> Who will lead the carriage?<eos> I will.
Isn't that splendid?<eos> And it's almost undamaged.<eos> I find their pottery crude compared to the Egyptians.<eos> Oh, no, Mr Mercado, unsophisticated, perhaps -<eos> I swear I'll kill you, Mercado!<eos> Oh my God!<eos> I'll avenge my brother!<eos> Sergeant!<eos> I will avenge him!<eos> I will!
We got a phone call from Chicago.<eos> Brian Piccolo has cancer.<eos> They found a tumor in his chest.<eos> He's on his way to New York to have it removed.<eos> Is he gonna be all right?<eos> If they caught it in time. But nobody knows that for sure.<eos> He'll be out for the rest of the season.<eos> We still got a game to play.<eos> Who's gonna tell the guys?<eos> I will.
Tell us the password to the website...<eos> I only talk to Sloane.<eos> That was the agreement.<eos> If you were who you say you are, you would know that.<eos> Mr. Schiller, I swear to you. Sloane is a liar.<eos> He has nothing to do with the CIA.<eos> So you say Sloane is a fraud?<eos> How do I know it's not you who is the fraud?<eos> You don't.<eos> But you will.
Did you bring your passport?<eos> Our mother was killed.<eos> I found her body in a state medical facility.<eos> I identified her, paid for her release.<eos> Made arrangements with a mausoleum in Moscow three blocks from where she was born.<eos> I thought she'd want it that way.<eos> And you have no idea who was responsible, who killed her?<eos> No.<eos> I swear to god, somehow I will find out who did this to our mother... and I will kill him.<eos> I will.
Catherine?<eos> Just get him out of here.<eos> I don't want to ever see you in this building again. This is our place of business.<eos> You understand that?<eos> I always knew you two had a thing.<eos> Go home, Eddie.<eos> Sure.<eos> "One way or another "I'm going to see you<eos> "One day, maybe next week "I'm going to meet you, meet you<eos> "I will...
- Oh, no.<eos> Leo.<eos> - What?<eos> We killed him.<eos> Oh, Leo.<eos> Thank God you're okay.<eos> Actually, it had more to do with what you guys did.<eos> Vanquishing Zile broke the bond and reversed all the evil you had done.<eos> I just hope the wedding planners don't remember what we did to them.<eos> Unfortunately, they will.
Maggie, thanks for coming by. It's always a pleasure.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> There it is.<eos> Sorry about Dell.<eos> Heard he was a damn fine cop.<eos> Yeah, he was.<eos> You guys did great work.<eos> We got an APB out on Rudy Coombs.<eos> I just hope you nail him.<eos> We will.
- Which means canceled.<eos> - One had a fever, one had an emergency.<eos> All of them happen to be the more complex procedures.<eos> It's simple coincidence.<eos> Look, I've been completely slammed by this review.<eos> - Nothing seems to be up to standard.<eos> - I have every confidence in you.<eos> But I need an associate chief who actually performs surgery.<eos> I do.<eos> I will.
- You know what?<eos> You said you were gonna take Gianni, so you should take Gianni.<eos> - I told him I was gonna take him.<eos> - All right, so just go.<eos> Look, I don't want to go if you're gonna hate me.<eos> - I don't hate you, Ray.<eos> - Oh, come on, look.<eos> When I get back, you and I, we'll go somewhere.<eos> You know, we should because we never get away together.<eos> - Okay, then we will, all right?
It's not him.<eos> The stresses on Moya are frying Junctions everywhere!<eos> She's dying D'Argo.<eos> The wormhole is killing her.<eos> Do you hope, someday, to be Dominar, Rygel?<eos> I am still Dominar!<eos> Always Dominar!<eos> I mean ruling from a throne, instead of a throne sled.<eos> They'll never know if I kill Crichton.<eos> But you will...
- Are they signed?<eos> - They're signed.<eos> - Are they authentic?<eos> - You have my word.<eos> - Letter of authentication?<eos> - That, too.<eos> - It's like watching the Williams sisters.<eos> - I wish we had popcorn.<eos> - I won't take it.<eos> - Then someone else will!
- Three.<eos> - Five.<eos> - Not an all-time high, but very respectable.<eos> - I'm going to bed.<eos> Are you staying here?<eos> - Yeah, I'm comfortable.<eos> I've got the pillows in a perfect mushed position.<eos> Night, Mom.<eos> - You just go think about what you've done.<eos> - I will.
- Bye.<eos> - What time is it?<eos> - 10:00... 10:00 of?<eos> - Three.<eos> - I have to go.<eos> - No!<eos> You're always going.<eos> - I have to.<eos> - Luckily, that'll all change soon.<eos> - Yes, it will.
I've long ago given up any hope of getting into her psychotic good graces.<eos> But that woman is horrible and selfish.<eos> She cannot get away with this.<eos> - I won't let her.<eos> - You're talking about my mother.<eos> Your mother, the one who stepped in without being asked... and single-handedly wrecked everything.<eos> What is this about?<eos> She'll never come back here.<eos> - Who, Mother?<eos> Of course she will.
Okay, I'm gonna go find a payphone.<eos> Your grandmother will be back any second.<eos> Just have a sandwich.<eos> Have a sandwich?<eos> - That's what you have to say to me?<eos> - What do you want me to say?<eos> Say that you are sorry you tried to talk me out of taking this money... that you realize you were being petty, controlling and mean... and you know that no amount of money can change what Rory and I have.<eos> - That's what I want you to say.<eos> Say that.<eos> - I will not.
Y... I know her name!<eos> Okay?<eos> ! I know things!<eos> She said I went to Wyoming.<eos> She asked if I stole a gun there.<eos> I DON't REMEMBER!<eos> When I try to remember, it just gets worse.<eos> You're the only one I trust Isabel.<eos> You have to help me.<eos> Okay, I will.
Eye of the tiger.<eos> You can do this. Just say no. Eye of the tiger.<eos> You can do this.<eos> I thought we were meeting in the balcony.<eos> Aren't we being a little risky?<eos> Hey.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> Look, did someone find out?<eos> No.<eos> And they never will.
Don't you think I know that?<eos> Maybe part of me just needed her to be missing.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> After everything we're been through, after all the pain that we're caused,<eos> I just wanted what we are, what I am, to do something good for a change.<eos> Isabel, you are my sister.<eos> You yell at me, you second-guess me, and you piss me off.<eos> You also saved my life, and I don't care what we're been through;<eos> I still believe in you.<eos> I always will.
No, no, I'II buy you one.<eos> I insist.<eos> No, I must buy you one, to make amends.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I'II buy.<eos> -No, I will buy.<eos> -I'II buy.<eos> -No, I will buy.<eos> -I'II buy.<eos> -No, I will.
I insist.<eos> No, I must buy you one, to make amends.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I'II buy.<eos> -No, I will buy.<eos> -I'II buy.<eos> -No, I will buy.<eos> -I'II buy.<eos> -No, I will.<eos> -I will.
There's so much I don't understand about bullying.<eos> Yeah. There's a lot of history there.<eos> Did you know it predates agriculture? - Mm-mmm.<eos> - Let's walk.<eos> Finish the job.<eos> I just don't understand Francine's motivation.<eos> Why does she only go after the smart ones?<eos> That's like asking the square root of a million.<eos> No one will ever know.<eos> Someone will.
I don't choose which part of you I love, like some kind of chicken!<eos> It was just so much easier when you were little and you would tell me everything.<eos> And when you were upset, I could always fix it.<eos> I don't know how to take care of you anymore.<eos> Just let me...<eos> Just let me take care of myself.<eos> But do you?<eos> I'm afraid that you don't.<eos> I do.<eos> I will.
I am concentrating on that!<eos> Christ, you're a broken record!<eos> - Take it down a notch.<eos> We wanna make sure you take advantage of all the city offers. Culturally, socially... educationally.<eos> Right before the snap, the ball is still. But the qb's eyes can tell you whether he'll pass or hand it off.<eos> It happens in a split second. But you can learn what his habits are.<eos> Once you know these habits, he's fucked.<eos> Hey. Good morning.<eos> - A.J., try what I told you.<eos> - I will.
Well, I'm going down to the saloon to look for the guy who shot my paw.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> That was Woofy, and he talked to us!<eos> Guys, we gotta pick a place to meet in case we split up.<eos> How about the corner of Fun Street and Fun Boulevard?<eos> I mean, that should be easy enough for even Michael to remember.<eos> Michael?<eos> - Great.<eos> Now we'll never find him.<eos> - Sure we will.
-How long ago?<eos> -Seventeen years ago.<eos> A criminal charge was dismissed.<eos> There was a civil suit, it was dismissed.<eos> There is enormous pressure from local black Democrats.<eos> -Our people?<eos> -1 7 years ago.<eos> So they gave him an official condemnation.<eos> -Anybody have the story?<eos> -They will.
His parents, who are in custody, FedEx'd him to Rome, which is in Italy.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - No, it's really in Italy.<eos> - But that's not the best part.<eos> - Italy won't extradite him.<eos> - Italy won't extradite him.<eos> - Because of the death penalty in Georgia?<eos> They've come a long way since Mussolini.<eos> - You should mention that.<eos> - I will.
- Ainsley.<eos> - I'll meet him another time.<eos> - What other time?<eos> - A better time. - What's a better time?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Don't you have to absolve yourself of the humiliation visited on your family and the House of Atreus?<eos> But I believe I'm going to compound the humiliation.<eos> - It'll never happen.<eos> - Really?<eos> No, it probably will.
Wait You and The Nibbler?<eos> Wait You and Clammy Hands?<eos> ! Hey!<eos> Come on you guys Stake it UK!<eos> So Have you thought of anything else to<eos> Hello?<eos> Let go of my hair!<eos> Not until you let me out of here!<eos> Ok!<eos> I will!
- Somebody different from Bill and Winky.<eos> - You killed Bill. To keep you from being killed!<eos> - And now you're coming with me.<eos> - Stay where you are, Dylan.<eos> Don't try and stop me!<eos> That little talk you wanted to have with me, it'll have to wait.<eos> - Where do you think you're going?<eos> - It's where we're going, me and Natalie.<eos> - I'll be taking the car.<eos> - You won't.
A wonderful performance.<eos> Quite wonderful.<eos> Lord Edgware was there that night, and I saw how he behaved.<eos> He was a brute of a man.<eos> Despicable.<eos> I can't help but think that he deserved what he got... although that's a terrible thing to say.<eos> I won't lie to you, Mr Poirot. I'm glad at the way things worked out.<eos> And as soon as there's been a decent interval, Jane and I plan to be married.<eos> If she'll have me.<eos> Of course I will.
All the children got out alive.<eos> Why would she make me say that?<eos> Someone's feeding her commands, just like the male bomber.<eos> Can you get audio on the voice, male or female?<eos> Anthony... can you establish gender of the voice in her ear? No, negative.<eos> The voice is too soft.<eos> I got four colored wires here.<eos> I'm gonna have to cut them in order.<eos> Okay...<eos> I will.
"I'm going to dance even if my dancing bells fall off"<eos> "I'm going to dance even if my dancing bells fall off"<eos> "I'm going to dance even if my dancing bells fall off"<eos> So are you happy, Mr. Anirudh?<eos> What do you keep brooding over?<eos> If you want to bide time, take up a job<eos> I'd rather that you completed your education I'd rather that you completed your education<eos> I've wasted nothing.<eos> You haven't understood me ever, Apa<eos> Maybe you won't, ever.
Never know! .<eos> And me?<eos> It'd be rough on you.<eos> That's right.<eos> Guess we'd just be changing places.<eos> That's right.<eos> Same as ever.<eos> Don't want that.<eos> Wish something fun would happen.<eos> Sure it will, someday.
Ever think about that stuff?<eos> Fate and destiny?<eos> I don't.<eos> Not that any of this is your own fault.<eos> Since this may be the last chance we have to unload on each other it's my duty to say that had you been a better Watcher I might've been a more positive role model.<eos> Face it, Wesley.<eos> You really were a jerk.<eos> Walking around like you had a big stake rammed up your English Channel.<eos> I think I want to hear you scream.<eos> You never will.
- Maybe he just needs some time alone.<eos> I had this friend once who really liked this girl, and... he got all worried that she didn't like him back, and maybe that made him act like a total jerk.<eos> Maybe Riley reminds me of that friend.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Then again, maybe he just wants attention.<eos> Here's a hot tip, if you want attention. Be there so people can give it to you.<eos> I care about you, Xander.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Don't be insecure.<eos> Thanks. I won't.
Demons don't usually fondle.<eos> And besides, the only demon that we know who used mirrors was Kali and we vanquished her sorry ass.<eos> Yeah, by smashing her reflection in a mirror.<eos> I mean, I know that she's supposed to be dead, but so were the Grimlocks.<eos> - Please don't remind me about them.<eos> - Did you find anything?<eos> Just a bunch of fingerprints.<eos> They don't match your samples.<eos> I'll run it through the computer, see if any names pop up.<eos> They won't.
-l thought they were gonna kill me.<eos> -You'll stay here.<eos> -l can't, I have nothing to wear.<eos> -l've got lots of stuff for you to wear!<eos> You'll stay here.<eos> Mom and Dad are here anyway.<eos> -lt's no big deal, I'm making a great dinner.<eos> -l'm so sorry.<eos> -You should call Cheryl and apologize.<eos> -l will.
Poison ivy?<eos> Is that in Wisconsin?<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Sorry, Peter, I gotta run.<eos> - We'll have to finish this later.<eos> - When?<eos> My office will reschedule.<eos> Good luck with that, Lizzie.<eos> He's never gonna give me this job.<eos> Yes, he will.
I crushed that man's throat<eos> You admit that you are guilty?<eos> Zhaan Don't do this<eos> What's the matter with you? Do you want to die?<eos> I do not want you and Rygel to die with me.<eos> I refuse to carry the guilt of any more deaths into the afterlife.<eos> We haven't lied yet.<eos> Of course, the trial's only been on for a few microts.<eos> Rygel!<eos> You will.
As such, it needs to be questioned.<eos> Re- examined.<eos> A containment cell is a fine place for reflection. True.<eos> Pa'u Zhaan achieved much during her incarceration.<eos> But I cannot stay here.<eos> Talyn needs me.<eos> Too frelling bad.<eos> Your hatred of me, though well- earned, blinds you.<eos> I can keep Talyn out of Peacekeeper hands.<eos> And I will.
Come on.<eos> Uh-uh! You know what?<eos> We're gonna sober her up and get her out of here right now!<eos> That life-disk we found on board Moya was her brother's.<eos> - And he's dead? - Yes.<eos> I think that's why she likes it down here.<eos> I think she's trying to prove that she's still all...<eos> Aeryn... when I need a psych report on Chiana, I'll let you know.<eos> If you try to force her to leave, she will stay here just to spite you. No.<eos> She won't.
I'm rechanting the gathering, they want the stone.<eos> I've already told Chiana.<eos> I've given her a head start.<eos> It's gonna be drad.<eos> Molnon, wait... please... just wait... just...<eos> Why does it always end in tears?<eos> Hey, old man.<eos> - Chiana...<eos> - Don't come any closer.<eos> I won't.
Well. Start a new life.<eos> Not in the Uncharted Territories, I want to go home.<eos> You can do that?<eos> D'argo, I can do anything!<eos> I can guide your ship home.<eos> I can help your friends.<eos> I could even make you a real General.<eos> My son.<eos> I want to see my son again.<eos> Then you will.
That's right. $2000.<eos> But you're not identical twins.<eos> Damn it, Carl!<eos> Oh, my good God.<eos> Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals.<eos> Tonight, number three:<eos> Macaroni and cheese with cut-up hot dogs.<eos> Look, you have done enough.<eos> You have to stop this now.<eos> I will, but not tonight.
Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> We've always had a democracy in this house.<eos> We never did anything unless we both agreed.<eos> But now I guess I'm gonna have to play the mom card.<eos> You are going to Chilton whether you want to or not.<eos> Monday morning, you will be there.<eos> End of story.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Yeah, we will.
Look, here's the problem.<eos> We've got this pain-in-the-ass DNA.<eos> - This make any sense to you?<eos> - No.<eos> Me, either, but it just let your brother off the hook.<eos> - And it puts you in the hot seat.<eos> - Which doesn't make sense to us.<eos> Ray's bad but you've been clean your whole life.<eos> Can you explain this, Jesse? - No.<eos> - A blood sample will.
You know, six months ago you didn't have time for a relationship.<eos> - Oh, come on, Bri, it's not you.<eos> - Obviously.<eos> It's my policy. Never fall in love with people you work with, no matter how great the sex was.<eos> - So now you're in love?<eos> - If I'm lucky.<eos> - You'll be bored.<eos> - I'll still have my job.<eos> - Whoever you marry...<eos> - If. You will.
The only thing that's died here are my hopes and aspirations.<eos> How many entry points do you think there are in this house?<eos> - The front and back doors...<eos> - I make it 24.<eos> - 25 including the chimney.<eos> - 26 if they tunnel in.<eos> - What do you see there?<eos> - A window. I call it the welcome mat of death.<eos> - OK, we'll take it.<eos> - No, we won't!

It'd make life go on forever.<eos> So, your wife up in her room?<eos> I expect so.<eos> Unless she's popped out for a job interview with the SAS.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - She's having a midlife crisis.<eos> Don't talk to us about midlife crisis.<eos> I...<eos> It's all right.<eos> I won't, then.
I want to watch the TV.<eos> -We should get one for your room.<eos> -Listen to her.<eos> Like Rose Kennedy, with all her money to throw around.<eos> It's giving me a_íta.<eos> Want me to go downtown.<eos> Lock you into a story.<eos> Why the fuck ain't they talking to you?<eos> Give them time.<eos> They will.
Oh.<eos> Don't tell me you lost another one.<eos> I didn't lose last month's datastream.<eos> It never arrived.<eos> So what's the holdup this time?<eos> The transmission was a little larger than usual.<eos> It's jammed the transceiver.<eos> Seven and I have been up all night trying to download it.<eos> Harry... we can't go another month without mail.<eos> Oh, you won't.
- I have told you.<eos> - And I'm supposed to trust you?<eos> You know, this whole "talking to two people in one body thing" really sucks.<eos> Shan'auc.<eos> It is good to finally see the face of she who taught me so much.<eos> To speak with you in words...<eos> It is something I never dreamed of.<eos> There will be time for words.<eos> You must stay a while. We have so much to talk about.<eos> - I will.
Previously on The West Wing:<eos> - I don't know these people.<eos> - You will.
I'm saying, don't read too much into it.<eos> - All right?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Anything else?<eos> No.<eos> I'm gonna go check the phone banks.<eos> - Roosevelt said...<eos> - Josh...<eos> - The Republicans will bring it up.<eos> - No, they won't.
- It's a nice suit.<eos> Sure, it's his Joey Lucas suit. I'm regretting not getting waffles.<eos> I'm regretting having hired any of you.<eos> 42% job approval, and you're talking about waffles and something with Josh.<eos> - He's wearing a suit for Joey Lucas.<eos> - For a guy named Joey?<eos> She's a woman, and I'm not dressed up for her.<eos> It's a Tuesday suit.<eos> Point is, we have to make it through the week with no mistakes.<eos> We will.
Chinese Catholics are being arrested for recognizing the Vatican's authority.<eos> An 82-year-old bishop was released after 30 years in prison, then arrested again.<eos> An 84-year-old bishop was tortured until he passed out.<eos> - He's now in a coma.<eos> - China harasses Christians, Josh.<eos> State Department says so.<eos> Amnesty International says so. I say so.<eos> It is fact.<eos> And the millions of American Christians and Christians around the world will not stand blithely by while religious freedom is threatened.<eos> - Sure you will. - Sam...
- No, Sam's right.<eos> It's a point well-taken.<eos> I don't wanna get bogged down in a Mary Marsh mud fight. - This is too important.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I want you to know.<eos> I want the president to know.<eos> My church will pay out the bond for each of the refugees. - It might be more money...<eos> - I know how much we're talking about.<eos> My church will pay it.<eos> If they won't, I will.
Speak!<eos> I'm sorry, Jack, that's the price you pay for being an artist.<eos> Or as the twins say-- oh, I can't tell you.<eos> You, are no friend of mine!<eos> I feel the sky tumbling' down, tumbling' down, tumbling'-- back in an hour.<eos> I hope you don't mind that I'm going to Jack's show tonight.<eos> I just figure if I break up with Ben in a public place, there's a better chance I won't end up sleeping with him.<eos> Grace, you gotta be tough about this.<eos> - You got to tell him what you really want.<eos> - Oh, I will.
You mean it reads like an X-File.<eos> But that's what you intended, wasn't it, Sir? When you assigned me to the case.<eos> I'll ask the questions, John.<eos> You just give me some damn answers.<eos> Don't come back until you do.<eos> My dad always said it's not who wins or loses it's who takes the worst beating that counts.<eos> That supposed to cheer me up?<eos> I thought so.<eos> But then I never did get to see your opponent.<eos> And you never will.
Here she is. Ask and you shall receive.<eos> That's biblical.<eos> - That's real craftsmanship.<eos> Solid as a rock.<eos> It's supposed to do that.<eos> Perfect, guys.<eos> How's that egg coming?<eos> This is a double yolker.<eos> I don't see what it has to do with ...<eos> - You will.
We'll be right back!<eos> If-lf you were a screening room... where would you be?<eos> I bet in the basement.<eos> I don't like basements.<eos> Ooh, it's spooky.<eos> - Ooh, Weredad. - Damn, it's dark in here.<eos> - I loved that movie.<eos> - Forget the movie!<eos> What if Milton's crazy... and he's gonna jump outta his screening room with a sling blade or something?<eos> - He won't.
How you feeling?<eos> You doing all right?<eos> I'm doing all right.<eos> is that Han?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're the one who's been making all this trouble, huh?<eos> Let me shake your hand.<eos> You got a firm grip. I like that.<eos> Stay with your father.<eos> I will.
The best there is.<eos> Can we do a little something about ... ?<eos> So, was special agent James still working with Cary Grant here?<eos> No chance.<eos> James reported Rifkin for dealing drugs and weapons to the Chicago underworld, which is nowwhere he hides somewhere.<eos> B plus, Coop.<eos> And we knowthey've planned a Chicago rendezvous for next Sunday.<eos> A minus.<eos> I wish I couId wake up every morning like this.<eos> You will.
Thanks for a seeing me.<eos> I've got everything that you asked for.<eos> Just once I'd like to get sent something simple.<eos> That never happens anymore.<eos> The downside of being good at my job.<eos> Good?<eos> My daughter was told you were the best.<eos> Like most people, I do the best can.<eos> Last time she passed out she regained consciousness almost immediately.<eos> Next time, or the time after, she won't.
I hope so.<eos> The bus to Edirne is soon leaving.<eos> Please board the bus immediately.<eos> I have to go.<eos> -Aren't you going to Istanbul?<eos> -No, I have to bring something to the border.<eos> What?<eos> That is also a long story.<eos> -Say hello to your boyfriend for me!<eos> -I will.
It's all right.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You're in a hospital.<eos> - Marion?<eos> - Who's that?<eos> She'll be sent for.<eos> She'll come.<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> No, she won't.
It's funny, though.<eos> They always let you get but so far.... ...before they take everything away from you.<eos> God, he's such a good kid, man.<eos> Then he gets to come back to this shit.<eos> That seat open?<eos> I think so.<eos> This isn't exactly where I thought I'd find you.<eos> This is still my school.<eos> They want me out, they'll have to do it themselves.<eos> They will.
Seems pretty hard to understand.<eos> No, only at first.<eos> And then it becomes clear in your mind.<eos> I learned molecular biology.<eos> This is the symbol for water and engineering.<eos> See, a wing, see?<eos> And line and form and artistic composition.<eos> You see, this is a square, like a cage.<eos> I thought we were supposed to be working on stuff to help us escape.<eos> This will.
Satch?<eos> Well, he always was crazy about you ever since you were born.<eos> You're still my Little Chief.<eos> Right?<eos> Yeah, I'm tryin' to be.<eos> Well, tell me about yourself.<eos> Tell me about your life.<eos> I mean, where do I start, you know?<eos> Mustang? I don't own a Mustang.<eos> Well, you will.
- You don't know what happened tonight.<eos> - Oh, but I do.<eos> I passed my finals.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, Jo.<eos> I'm going to be starting my internship at Bellevue.<eos> It'll be crazy.<eos> I won't have time to see you.<eos> - It won't happen again.<eos> - Yes, it will.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I said, ""No."<eos> I'm not gonna do it, 'cause I don't understand--<eos> I-- I'm not gonna show up wigless.<eos> I'm not gonna show up without my face on.<eos> And I sure as hell am not gonna do them stupid masturbation exercises... if I can't at least masturbate and fantasize about a woman that's manly!<eos> You will if I say you will!<eos> No!<eos> I won't!
Oh, shit!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Where'd that come from?<eos> Look at you.<eos> - Sorry I'm getting your carpet wet.<eos> - It's just carpet.<eos> It'll dry.<eos> Yeah, it's raining.<eos> Rain'll make you wet.<eos> Yes, it will.
All right, well, get it together.<eos> - Thanks, Hattie, baby. - Good.<eos> Get your ass outta here.<eos> Oh, and that seersucker suit?<eos> Sherry made a call today.<eos> Who was it?<eos> A Dr Green in Los Angeles.<eos> A refill on the kid's allergy prescription.<eos> She's done nothing to try and contact Lester.<eos> Well, she will.
Is it?<eos> Oh, hurry up, Nanya.<eos> - Let her do it.<eos> - What's the point?<eos> I know who I'm going to marry.<eos> You'll marry a soldier.<eos> You always say that. And Vladimir Lensky is the least soldierly man in all of Russia.<eos> You will also marry a soldier.<eos> But I don't know any soldiers.<eos> You will.
Tell me that you feel nothing.<eos> My husband is asleep upstairs.<eos> Tell me that you love me.<eos> I loved you once. A long time ago.<eos> There.<eos> You haven't forgotten.<eos> No.<eos> Tatyana, I beg you... be with me.<eos> You told me once that my heart would heal.<eos> So will yours, Evgeny.
Yes.<eos> Just as long as you'd like.<eos> Oh, the man is impossible.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - It's no good.<eos> He simply won't listen.<eos> - It seems it's up to me.<eos> - We'll all help you.<eos> Well, it's my problem, but you can all help if you will. - Oh, of course.<eos> - Of course we will.
Run!<eos> Run!<eos> Go!<eos> Just haul ass!<eos> Run, nigger, run!<eos> Oh, that's our ticket off this farm.<eos> You mark my words.<eos> In five years, there'll be a colored man in the majors.<eos> I don't think the world changed that much.<eos> Maybe not yet, but it will.
You have to walk through it.<eos> Tank, load the jump program.<eos> You have to let it all go, Neo.<eos> Fear doubt and disbelief.<eos> Free your mind.<eos> Free my mind.<eos> What if he makes it?<eos> - No one's ever made their first jump. MOUSE: I know.<eos> - But what if he does?<eos> - He won't.
She said it.<eos> "Not even a little death can knock down this house. " She knew.<eos> I want to keep this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Would you rather be alone?<eos> Has he called?<eos> I left him a message, though.<eos> I said I was sorry.<eos> And I asked him to call.<eos> Well, then, he will.
The letter was meant for me.<eos> Fuller was talking about my world.<eos> So what are you saying?<eos> You're saying there's another world on top of this one?<eos> That's right.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Fuller found out about it.<eos> They killed him.<eos> Why didn't they kill you?<eos> Maybe they will.
Tomorrow she'll be as right as rain.<eos> You'll see.<eos> I want to see a priest.<eos> Why did she have to die?<eos> Only God can answer that.<eos> I know Jesus says to love your enemies, but I can't.<eos> I just want the English to burn in Hell forever and ever!<eos> I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.<eos> It's hard but revenge will never bring about peace.<eos> What will?
A message for the dauphin of France.<eos> A message!<eos> Captain, a message for the dauphin.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> The dauphin!<eos> Louis.<eos> Shouldn't you be learning your lessons?<eos> I don't want to.<eos> I want to fight.<eos> You will.
They're going to visit you in here?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's what I pray for.<eos> I want to see that.<eos> Mind if I stay on the side?<eos> I won't bother you.<eos> No! No!<eos> You can't!<eos> Or else they won't come.<eos> -Why won't they?
You can stay close to your family, and I can continue to improve and perfect my friendship and intimacy with the Mansfield Park family.<eos> I have a better plan.<eos> Live here with us.<eos> Stay as long as you wish.<eos> Bring all your horses.<eos> Your sister, too.<eos> Be as one of our family.<eos> - We'd thrive on it, wouldn't we, Fanny?<eos> - Of course.<eos> A king for three shillings? - I will.
I gotta go.<eos> - Everything okay?<eos> - I forgot something very important.<eos> You change your mind?<eos> I thought this was a good idea.<eos> Talk to somebody and work this thing through.<eos> I could talk to you.<eos> We could always talk.<eos> I know.<eos> We will.
Now, allow me to show you around.<eos> Oh, my, you have a pert elbow.<eos> You must be Gina Carbonara.<eos> Yes, and you must be Mr Thwaite.<eos> It's "Twat. " Damn...<eos> I'm sorry, please, forgive me, Mr Twat.<eos> Yes.<eos> I have a problem, could you come into my room?<eos> - No...<eos> - You won't?
A time for everything And to everything its place<eos> Return what has been moved through time and space<eos> - All right, we don't have much time.<eos> - What about his ring?<eos> Don't worry about the ring now.<eos> Let's just get you back.<eos> Well, but it is unblessed, right?<eos> Yes, but there wasn't time to test it.<eos> - Then how will we know if it works?<eos> - You won't.
Can't be much of a dragon.<eos> Did they say what color it was?<eos> - Red, green, black?<eos> - Gold.<eos> With red eyes.<eos> Why?<eos> No reason, just curious.<eos> - I'll go and get ready to meet them, then.<eos> - I haven't invited you yet.<eos> You will.
Plastic handle count 19 cents!<eos> -Yes.<eos> Audacity!<eos> Behold a woman who has taken two parking spaces. -Excellent.<eos> I want to see her expression when you read my message!<eos> Thanks for your patience.<eos> Honor trifles.

They using the cell saver?<eos> - Have they called Neurosurgery?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I need to get blood.<eos> - Should we set up for bypass?<eos> - Not necessary.<eos> There are no intracardiac injuries.<eos> Vascular clamp.<eos> - Have you called Neurosurgery yet?<eos> - We will!
What about me?<eos> - Keep silent, Rygel!<eos> - What about you?<eos> - I demand better treatment!<eos> You dare serve me with this grotesquery of a bowl!<eos> My apologies... your Eminence!<eos> I should think so...<eos> So, Jotheb, your subjects came up with your ransom?<eos> It was not in doubt...<eos> Why, yours will not?
-All right.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Here we go.<eos> All right. Ready?<eos> Turn!<eos> Turn!<eos> Turn!<eos> -I don't think we can turn any more!<eos> -I don't think it'll fit!<eos> Yeah, it will.
- He wants a bib.<eos> - Big baby.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - Calamares, is that salad, lemon?<eos> - Si, senor.<eos> - What is it, Luigi?<eos> - Squid, Stella, you won't like it.<eos> I'm asking Luigi.<eos> Anyway, I might.<eos> She won't.
Know what I mean?<eos> Sorry to disturb you, Miss Parker, but there's been a bit of an emergency.<eos> - What kind of an emergency?<eos> - The personal kind.<eos> I'll see you back at the office.<eos> Roommate?<eos> I have to go.<eos> I'm sorry, but this was a big mistake.<eos> Look, I'll be up by Old Bridge Road if you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
Can you help us?<eos> Tell us what's going on around here?<eos> I probably could.<eos> But not at the moment.<eos> I'll be in touch.<eos> I couldn't help noticing that you had to satisfy yourselves there was no way out.<eos> Yeah, well, we'll find a way out.<eos> You could bet on that.<eos> Well, no one ever has.<eos> No one ever will.
Fashion is two years behind.<eos> Technology is two years behind.<eos> Fads are two years behind.<eos> Just like you.<eos> - Home!<eos> - Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!<eos> Oh no you don't glory-monger!<eos> Gorak is my responsibility!<eos> I'll take him to Des Moines!<eos> No you won't, butthole!
- We work together.<eos> We have more in common.<eos> Julian, you are beginning to annoy me.<eos> Darts, racquetball, Vic's lounge, the Alamo... Need I go on?<eos> I love my wife.<eos> And I love Ezri. Passionately.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Have you told her?<eos> But I will.
You do not see what you have done.<eos> You have entered a battle you are ill-equipped to fight, tipped the balance of power among the Goa'uld, and worsened the fortune of your race.<eos> We must know what would happen to him if we turned him over.<eos> I am certain he would be executed.<eos> Eventually.<eos> I see.<eos> Surely you welcome this.<eos> His guilt is clear.<eos> He cannot be allowed to escape punishment.<eos> He won't.
- Very sure.<eos> - He seems effeminate.<eos> He's very athletic.<eos> Plenty masculine.<eos> - He's a woman.<eos> - Take me seriously.<eos> I do.<eos> The Times is releasing a poll that brings your unfavorables up to 48%.<eos> - I hadn't heard.<eos> - You will in an hour.
In 1787, there were delegates who were opposed to the Bill of Rights.<eos> This is what a member of the Georgia delegation had to say:<eos> "If we list a set of rights, some fools will claim that the people are entitled only to those rights. "<eos> Were you just calling me a fool?<eos> I wasn't, the brand-new state of Georgia was.<eos> Gentlemen, laws must emanate from the Constitution.<eos> - There are natural laws.<eos> - I do not deny there are natural laws.<eos> I only deny that judges are empowered to enforce them.<eos> Then who will?
Because I have yet to hear any explanation.<eos> Agent Mulder can explain it.<eos> Agent Scully, to an extent.<eos> They might have even prevented what you see in those photos.<eos> Scully and Mulder have been suspended by the FBI.<eos> - also my doing... and my mistake.<eos> - I would ask...<eos> I'd ask, before you say it's not my business, that you do everything you can to get them back on the X-Files.<eos> Far worse can happen.<eos> And it will.
- Dance. - Huh?<eos> I'd like you to dance.<eos> That's why you're here.<eos> To entertain me.<eos> Pony, foxtrot, frug, Philly Dog, fandango.<eos> Anything.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> You "can't"? "I'm sorry, ma'am."<eos> Or you won't?
No pulse or rhythm.<eos> Are you God?<eos> No.<eos> My name is Seth.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Home.<eos> Can Mommy come?<eos> No.<eos> She won't understand.<eos> She will... ... someday.
Of course it isn't, because it isn't everything.<eos> And we want everything, don't we?<eos> But we still have one thing.<eos> One of our greatest things we'll always have.<eos> You know what that is?<eos> Our dreams.<eos> We can still meet in our dreams.<eos> We can talk to each other there and go for walks together in the summer and in the winter, and in the rain and in the sun and I can come and pick you up and we can go flying.<eos> Nobody's loved you like I do.<eos> Nobody ever will.
A press conference? Where?<eos> The next train is not till 5:00.<eos> Shit.<eos> - Then Casey...<eos> - No, don't send Casey.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> No. I'm sorry.<eos> Too late is unacceptable.<eos> You said you'd get the story.<eos> And I will.
Is Robbie here?<eos> I'm afraid he's indisposed.<eos> Shower.<eos> You must be Linda.<eos> Yeah, that's me...<eos> Robbie's fiancee.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Julia Sullivan.<eos> Would you tell him that I came by to see him?<eos> Oh, yeah, surely will, Jennifer.
Hey, no problem.<eos> Okay, try it.<eos> Suzie, you need a lift?<eos> We got room for one more.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Where'd she get those shoes, "Whores 4 Less"?<eos> Try it again.<eos> Nice to see you kids getting along.<eos> - Don't forget Sunday.<eos> - I won't.
You're holding us up, Frik.<eos> We have a lot to do!<eos> Mab! You evil, old crone!<eos> May God have mercy on your soul!<eos> He obviously didn't have any on the rest of you!<eos> - Why is everybody suddenly against me?<eos> I'm leaving you with your misery, and pain... but... with no more magic powers!<eos> Now... you will wander through the world ugly and alone... just as if you were human.<eos> Goodbye, Frik... I'll miss you...<eos> No, I won't!
- And the wheelchair match.<eos> - Basketball.<eos> - Isn't the most boring I've done.<eos> - Why'd you say it then?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You don't know?<eos> You know what?<eos> It doesn't make any difference anymore.<eos> 'Cause I've never liked you.<eos> And I never will, either.
Well, thanks to you, I had to eat both our dinners, and I'm uncomfortably full!<eos> You know, it's just as well.<eos> That new professor, Dr. Ravelli, just got into town, and I told her I'd take her out for drinks.<eos> Oh, Ravelli!<eos> It's bad enough she's taking over half my office.<eos> Now this! She's ruining everything.<eos> I want her to go away!<eos> Oh, come on, Dick. She's very nice.<eos> You're going to like her.<eos> No, I won't!
I'll say it again<eos> I can rub and scrub till this old House shines just like a dime<eos> Feed the baby, grease the car and Powder my face at the same time<eos> Get all dressed up<eos> - You've got to be kidding me.<eos> - Aren't birthdays fun?<eos> Start all over again Cause I'm a woman<eos> W - O-M-A-N<eos> Renee's never gonna believe me.<eos> - She will.
We have a lot of fun, but I want smoochies!<eos> - Have you dropped any hints?<eos> - I've dropped anvils.<eos> Oh, he'll come around.<eos> What guy could resist your wily Willow charms?<eos> At last count, all of 'em, maybe more.<eos> None of them know a thing.<eos> They all get an F in Willow.<eos> But I want Oz to get an A. And oh, one of those gold stars.<eos> - He will.
If he fails, you can eat his eyes out of the sockets for all I care.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Please.<eos> I swear.<eos> OK.<eos> Hurry back, then.<eos> I should go the rest of the way alone.<eos> OK.<eos> But I'll be back.<eos> I will.
You said if I brought them back their cat...<eos> Was it the oldest?<eos> Was it Prue who sent you away?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Avoid her.<eos> She's the strongest.<eos> You must separate them.<eos> Together they're charmed, impenetrable.<eos> - But what if they don't want me?<eos> - Phoebe will.
Rock] How about we take the boat out this weekend?<eos> Just the two of us.<eos> We can catch some fish... pee in the bay.<eos> Dad, mother sold the boat.<eos> Whywasn't I told?<eos> I'm the captain.<eos> You-You don't have to take me fishing.<eos> I'm not - I'm not taking sides in this.<eos> I just don't want what's happening between your mother and me... to affect our relationship.<eos> It won't.
Okay, ready?<eos> Feeling any better?<eos> All right, I guess.<eos> What did you...?<eos> What did you give me?<eos> Haldol, to calm you down.<eos> I can't take that.<eos> It's not good for my baby.<eos> Coco, you don't have a baby.<eos> But I will, really.
There's something you should know.<eos> is this about you dating the nurse?<eos> Joey told me.<eos> I am so fine.<eos> You and I, we're just, nothing.<eos> Just goofing around.<eos> I was about to tell you I was getting out of it.<eos> But if we're just "goofing around", maybe I will go out with him.<eos> Fine.<eos> Maybe I will too.
Rachel, I can do this all night if I have to!<eos> -You want me to get that?<eos> Just let her do her thing and we'll do our thing.<eos> Because I really need to tell you<eos> Thank you.<eos> Rachel?<eos> Can I talk to you outside for a sec?<eos> We really need to talk.<eos> Well, then talk.<eos> Okay, I will.
All right.<eos> There's a group therapy session later on.<eos> One of you can watch from behind the glass.<eos> OK.<eos> Grab a chair.<eos> Semicircle.<eos> I know we're doing this for all the right reasons, but deep down I can't help but feel like I'm betraying them.<eos> They'll never know I'm here.<eos> I know, but I do.<eos> And I always will.
Only if it means getting revenge for Jen's death.<eos> All the other things you talk about make no sense to me.<eos> It may take a while, but Shang Tsung will be punished.<eos> I must warn you both... the forces of Outworld will stop at nothing to defeat us.<eos> We must beware who we trust.<eos> For evil is everywhere and it is relentless.<eos> Sounds better than dying alone.<eos> Brooding?<eos> Be very careful.<eos> I will, Shang.

I didn't expect to hear from you for at least a week.<eos> I had to push the timetable up.<eos> Desmond has only given me 72 hours.<eos> - Is that enough time?<eos> - [Sighs] It'll have to be.<eos> Just tell me that you are sure that Ryan and Rebecca are okay.<eos> See for yourself.<eos> I took this yesterday.<eos> - I never thought I'd see 'em again.<eos> - You will.
[Gasps] Oh, my goodness.<eos> That was a long movie.<eos> It's time for school.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Uh, can't make it in today, Mr. Smithers.<eos> I have smallpox.<eos> Well, it wasrt wiped out in my house!<eos> Okay, delegates.<eos> You leave tomorrow for the statewide Model U. N... so this is our last chance to bone up.<eos> And bone we will.
- Then who is?<eos> - Who do you think?<eos> - Brunt.<eos> - Grand Nagus Brunt?<eos> Acting Grand Nagus Brunt.<eos> - We're in trouble.<eos> Brunt hates us.<eos> - Don't start panicking.<eos> The Ferengi Commerce Authority hasn't confirmed him yet.<eos> And they won't for three more days.
Let him talk to me.<eos> Your friend had a feeble mind.<eos> It suffered greatly and gave in easily.<eos> Come on, Skaara.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Try!<eos> Perhaps I will not kill you.<eos> Perhaps you will make a good host yourself.<eos> All right, promise me this thing won't kill him.<eos> Two shots will.
You can re-create yourself every second of your life.<eos> -But what if...?<eos> -You know what is bad?<eos> What?<eos> Keeping me awake when I'm tired.<eos> Right.<eos> -Good night, Xena.<eos> -Good night.<eos> It's just that I'm not sure whether or not I'll figure out this being good thing.<eos> You will.
-Sure you did!<eos> -I saw you kiss her.<eos> -Exactly. I kissed her.<eos> The bet was that she would kiss me, which she didn't.<eos> So I lost.<eos> -In fact, these are yours.<eos> -Oh, no, you don't.<eos> You're setting me up, aren't you?<eos> Playing some sort of angle I don't see.<eos> But I will.
Dorian's right to be concerned, Xena.<eos> Why don't you leave me and go on ahead?<eos> The advance scouts travel a day ahead of the main force..., ...so we still have time.<eos> Be honest with me Xena.<eos> How bad is this poison?<eos> It didn't hit a main artery.<eos> This poultice will delay the effects until we can get to Tripolis and treat it with a serum.<eos> By tomorrow you'll be trying those flips again... with a staff.<eos> -If she dies...<eos> -She won't.
Athena. Speak to me.<eos> No tears.<eos> No tears.<eos> He is strong like you. He doesn't cry.<eos> - Promise me you will return.<eos> - I cannot.<eos> Troy does not fall so gently.<eos> I love you.<eos> - Penelope, If I cannot return ...<eos> - You will!
Well, she was real.<eos> I mean, she was human, of course, but not our real.<eos> But we won't be fooled next time.<eos> No, I am going to think of really hard questions.<eos> No.<eos> My heart can't take it any more.<eos> I will see no more girls claiming to be Anastasia.<eos> - Where is Uncle Boris from?<eos> - What if Sophie doesn't recognise me?<eos> She will.
Clare!<eos> Davis!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> - Where you all going so fast?<eos> - To go say goodbye to Sanders.<eos> Afterwards, get your chores done.<eos> - Yes, Mama.<eos> - Yes, Mama.<eos> Clare, after chores, help Davis with his arithmetic.<eos> I will, Mama.
No, but maybe you could take me with you instead.<eos> Damn, you do start fast, don't you?<eos> I'd really like to go with you now.<eos> And exactly why is that?<eos> I need to show you something.<eos> Slow down.<eos> - Girl, don't hit the gas like that!<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> You really need to see this.<eos> I will.
#PIERRE, LET'S GO.#<eos> It's cold!<eos> Ah! It's colder than a motherfucker.<eos> A serious crime. Justified punishment.<eos> This is James Russell reporting.<eos> That's some hard hitting stuff, Russell.<eos> John School of Journalism.<eos> Oh, come on, Barclay. Just watch it onemore time before you decide that it's<eos> Why should I?<eos> Nobody else will.
They're getting antsy, Red.<eos> You scheduled it.<eos> The idea is that an understanding of case history... ... should,inparolesituations,help the subject to avoid habitual traps.<eos> And in penal escape situations... ... couldidentifythoseselfsame traps as an aid to apprehension.<eos> -Let me tell you, Miss Gerber... .<eos> -Sally is fine.<eos> Let me tell you, Sally...<eos> ... thisisnotanescape. This happens to be a manhunt.<eos> And no talking around in circles is gonna fix that.<eos> -And what will?
I know.<eos> Is there any way we could...<eos> Do you have to give him everything?<eos> - Could it be 25%?<eos> - He's got a lot of overhead.<eos> His jet is getting old.<eos> Just draw it up the way I asked, and bring it back so I can review it.<eos> Here's the hustlers when they were still young and sweet.<eos> - You come back now.<eos> - Oh, I will.
I'm gonna miss you.<eos> I'm gonna miss you too.<eos> I love you.<eos> Outbound group 94-A, Tereshkova, all sections...<eos> That's me.<eos> Just say it once.<eos> Try it on for size.<eos> I love you.<eos> - Don't forget to write.<eos> - I won't.
Do you fuckin' believe i gave that guy five hundred bucks ?<eos> Jesus !<eos> between him and the boots, you're down two grand.<eos> Don't ever mention the fuckin' boots to me again.<eos> You got that ?<eos> Sorry, lono.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> It's not fuckin' funny.<eos> I don't want to hear about any fuckin' kind of footwear from you ever again.<eos> I won't. I won't.

I won't.<eos> Don't even talk about fuckin' socks to me.<eos> All right.<eos> I won't. I won't.
As she goes down by the head... the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck... from one to the next, back and back.<eos> There's no stopping it.<eos> The pumps.<eos> We open the pumps...<eos> The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.<eos> From this moment, no matter what we do... Titanic will founder.<eos> But this ship can't sink.<eos> She's made of iron, sir.<eos> I assure you, she can.<eos> And she will.
Here, I'll smash something.<eos> - Has all the fight gone out of you?<eos> - Just leave the car alone.<eos> Too late.<eos> You pissed me off.<eos> Goddamn it, you son of a bitch!<eos> There you go, sweet-talking me again.<eos> I'll get you your money.<eos> I'll just get some things out of my trunk.<eos> No, you won't.
I need to examine him... but I see clear symptoms of typical psychosis.<eos> Don't get into it with him.<eos> You'll just get angry.<eos> Hey, you all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> I went out to the convenience store, and I got lost.<eos> I see.<eos> We'll need toothbrushes.<eos> We will, won't we?
No, but maybe you could take me with you instead.<eos> Damn, you do start fast, don't you?<eos> I'd really like to go with you now.<eos> And exactly why is that?<eos> I need to show you something.<eos> Slow down.<eos> -Girl, don't hit the gas like that!<eos> -You don't understand.<eos> You really need to see this.<eos> I will.
- Hey guys, just in time!<eos> - I'm so glad you're here.<eos> - I wouldn't miss this.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Last night we took a break for a joke.<eos> It went so well, we'll do it again.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> If you don't have fun, the audience can't.<eos> Whatever happens, enjoy.<eos> - We will!
Then that's good.<eos> So you'll go?<eos> I don't get you. You weren't happy when I wasn't here, and now you're not happy when I am here.<eos> Yes, it's confusing, isn't it?<eos> Well, I guess that what I want... is for you to want to be here... but not actually be here.<eos> I can do that.<eos> -I can want to be here whenever you want.<eos> -Good.<eos> And maybe you could just try to be home for dinner sometimes.<eos> I will.
It's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather but with Alice, all that stuff kind of went away.<eos> And now it's gone, and I don't know why.<eos> Well, I can tell you why.<eos> It's because of me.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I only did it because I love you, okay?<eos> What?<eos> I kind of had a little chat with Alice and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together.<eos> And you'll see it too, one day.<eos> You really, really will.
I know Wellman is a widower, with a young child. But I don't want any sentimentality on Nikita's part to get in the way of the mission. - Is that clear?<eos> - Of course.<eos> You've done a good job with Nikita.<eos> She still lacks perspective, that's all.<eos> You don't think she's formed any attachment to Wellman?<eos> They've only seen each other a couple of times.<eos> - That's not what I asked.<eos> - I don't think she has.<eos> Good!<eos> But sooner or later, she will.
Don't lose him.<eos> Put together a convergence plan. Let's go.<eos> Let's get Shays out of there.<eos> - I'm in.<eos> - Everyone hold.<eos> Nikita's taking point.<eos> Nikita, be careful!<eos> I'm wired.<eos> Nikita, get me out of here.<eos> - I will, Stanley.
- Nothing.<eos> That could be dangerous for your son's health.<eos> I got hit in the leg the other night during the raid.<eos> I've been laid up.<eos> Don't play games.<eos> No games, I swear.<eos> My uranium's piling up.<eos> I've got to get it out of the country now.<eos> I'll have your intelligence for you this afternoon.<eos> Yes, you will.
- Kyle.<eos> - Who's he?<eos> - He's a friend.<eos> - Can I go home now?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I called your mom and dad.<eos> They're... just over there.<eos> Dad!<eos> Mom! Dad!<eos> - Nikita, if we don't work together again...<eos> - We will.
I will, but you gotta pray to God, too, you know?<eos> Don't negotiate. You gotta stop bragging for your own good.<eos> I know that. But if my baby dies, you know, I don't know what I'm gonna do.<eos> I mean, it's like I'll die.<eos> Miguel, you should pray to God for your son's health, but you should also ask God to give you and MaritZa the strength to face whatever happens.<eos> MaritZa says that the doctor says that all this is going on because of the drugs that we did before she was pregnant, you know.<eos> And after she was pregnant, you know, people were fucking telling us, you know, not to, you know-- And MaritZa didn't want to, you know, and I thought nothing bad was gonna fucking happen to me.<eos> Me.<eos> Pray for me. Pray for my baby.<eos> I will.
Grace?<eos> What?<eos> So he- - He kicks my boyfriend out and then moves her in?<eos> God, I can't believe him.<eos> You know, I'm just gonna go somewhere else.<eos> No, no. Stay.<eos> We're finished here.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> You can't just walk away from all of your stuff at the house.<eos> Fine. Then I won't.
- We're just beginning here.<eos> - Don't bluff, detective.<eos> - Just shut up.<eos> You've done enough investigating to know you're in trouble.<eos> - You may not make probable cause, Jean.<eos> - We're not too worried.<eos> How can you not be?<eos> There is a city councilman who is dead.<eos> People wanna know who killed him.<eos> - And they will.
Kick this one and we'll owe you.<eos> - You'll owe me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Owe me what?<eos> - A favor.<eos> Everything goes around here.<eos> One day you'll need a favor from us.<eos> And when the time comes, think how relieved you'll be that we owe you.<eos> It's not the way I operate, Mr. Young.<eos> One day you will.
He gets real paranoid someone's going to poach his data.<eos> Even when I brought him test subjects they could only come in one at a time.<eos> Like the homeless man you were telling me about?<eos> Broad Street Bill? Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> In fact Dr Fein did several tests on him.<eos> And you haven't seen him for a year, have you?<eos> No I haven't.<eos> And you never will.<eos> No one will.
There is no follow up.<eos> Candy cases are pro bono.<eos> They should happy to get surgery at all.<eos> Pro bono?<eos> I spent seven years in medical school to operate for free.<eos> Once a week.<eos> Brant's rule.<eos> You know I'm beginning to wonder about this place.<eos> Money, movie stars, so far I've not even seen one single starlet.<eos> For now you won't.
Everyone. Even your own people.<eos> Cardassia was on the edge of an abyss, Major.<eos> The war with the Klingons left us a third-rate power.<eos> My people had lost their way.<eos> I've made them strong again.<eos> At what price?<eos> You sold Cardassia to the Dominion.<eos> Yes... a high price, to be sure. But look what we're getting in return.<eos> The Alpha Quadrant itself. We'll see about that.<eos> Yes, we will.
I see I was wrong.<eos> One man's villain is another man's hero, Captain.<eos> You should see the monument they're erecting in my honor at the gateway to the Imperial Plaza.<eos> Is that why you sold out your people to the Dominion?<eos> For a monument?<eos> ! What I did... I did to make Cardassia strong again.<eos> And mark my words, Captain, I succeeded.<eos> You may have escaped defeat this day but tomorrow...<eos> We will see about tomorrow.<eos> Yes, we will.
We're ordered to cluster with the Seventh Contingent two new lights from now.<eos> They'll have means to signal your people.<eos> You can make the walk with us to meet them.<eos> I appreciate the offer, but I can't wait two days.<eos> I have to find my vessel now.<eos> It wouldn't be sharp to return to the trunks.<eos> The nemesis is everywhere there.<eos> Then I'll have to do my best to steer clear of them.<eos> If your tactic won't change...<eos> It won't.
Killing their savior might irritate them a little, but at least I'd be gone.<eos> Don't make me do this.<eos> Go on, ...pull the trigger, one more fraction of an inch.<eos> You had the gun.<eos> You appeared to have all the power.<eos> Yet, I was in control.<eos> That is the strength of a god.<eos> My name is Jamala, Jamala.<eos> Please don't kill me.<eos> - No, we won't.
O'Neill!<eos> The Nox woman.<eos> Where'd the Nox go with Lya?<eos> Who knows where they ever go.<eos> I trained him well.<eos> - Is he gonna be alright?<eos> - Well, if it were you or me...<eos> My wound will heal.<eos> We must find Shak'I.<eos> We will.
I'm saying that I'm getting wildly differing reports.<eos> I have a job to do.<eos> I'm not the ultimate authority here.<eos> But you don't have the authority either over this child or her future.<eos> You can get a court order and you can try and enforce it.<eos> But I suggest that if your job is to do what's best for this child, you do all you can to tell the authorities that if they take Emily out of this hospital, they are going to hasten her illness.<eos> And I will make it known that all of you are responsible.<eos> What do you want me to tell them you're doing for her?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> But I will.
She feels.<eos> She cares.<eos> Not exactly good attributes for a true warrior.<eos> Guard them.<eos> First daylight, we take them to the hill.<eos> Fifteen volunteers are standing by.<eos> They're ready when you are.<eos> At dawn, then.<eos> This had better work, Xena, or I'm going to lose a lot of my best people.<eos> It will.
- But I-<eos> And what really fries me is you returned his check!<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Hutz, but I just can't lie to people.<eos> [Laughing] You're one of a kind, Marge... and nobody deserves this more than you.<eos> [Groans]<eos> Well, I'm proud of you, Mom.<eos> You refused to compromise your integrity.<eos> Yeah. You did the right thing, eventually.<eos> Still, it would've been nice to bring home at least one paycheck.<eos> Oh, you will, honey.

Don't worry.<eos> When can we go?<eos> - When can we go?<eos> - Yes, when?<eos> In three days. At dawn.<eos> I was told it'd be tomorrow.<eos> I've been told lots of things.<eos> This won't work.<eos> He won't come.<eos> Yes, he will.
Is he still back there?<eos> Yeah? Never mind.<eos> It's working.<eos> That or he's gone completely crazy.<eos> - You hate me, right?<eos> - No. - You don't? - No.<eos> I mean, I know I said some nasty things about you.<eos> - Did you tell your friends?<eos> - What? That you're a lying sack of shit.<eos> No. But I will.
Miss Smith!<eos> You'd better go by Mr Cole's stable.<eos> The near way is flooded.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Miss Woodhouse, do talk and make me comfortable again.<eos> I suppose this would not be the right time... to mention that Mr Elton is engaged.<eos> This was awkward because it was the first time... - you've seen Mr Martin since refusing his proposal.<eos> You, and I must say he, behaved very well!<eos> Now, the kindest thing you can do for yourself... is to put Mr Martin out of your head for good.<eos> Yes, I will.
That's the problem with new cops.<eos> They need to be taught who to pay attention to.<eos> I'd be happy to teach him that lesson.<eos> Put some of our Russian friends on it.<eos> Let them earn their money for a change.<eos> Everything else in shape?<eos> Like clockwork.<eos> Everyone's still in the dark?<eos> It's a very tight seal, as long as everyone keeps their mouth shut.<eos> They will.
I didn't mean to.<eos> L-I'm sorry.<eos> Well, you're not hurt, are you?<eos> Here, here, let's see.<eos> - No, no!<eos> N-No!<eos> - There.<eos> No harm done.<eos> Just try to be a little more careful.<eos> L-l-I will.
- Of course.<eos> Then do that.<eos> - I can't say.<eos> I don't have a kid.<eos> - You love him as much as I do.<eos> Tell me what you'd do, Juliet.<eos> I think you've got to go to the judge.<eos> Tell him that your son just got diagnosed with leukemia.<eos> - He's not gonna buy that.<eos> - Yeah. he will.
You've got six hours to that press conference and no other leads.<eos> Get Feldstein back on the record or find another source to confirm this thing.<eos> Otherwise we're printing a retraction.<eos> And I guarantee you, Jack, it'll be your last.<eos> That's fine.<eos> If you need me, I'm at a different number today.<eos> - Where are you goin'?<eos> - To find Manny.<eos> - Take care of yourself, kid.<eos> - I will.
I've noticed that you haven't been dating for quite a while.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Actually, we've all noticed.<eos> Hey, there we go.<eos> Hi.<eos> I know that you're sensitive but frightened.<eos> I'm gentle but brutal.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Think about me, Jack.<eos> I will.
- Dad!<eos> What?<eos> You guys are being...<eos> Oh, man.<eos> - You're so stupid.<eos> - Am not.<eos> Are so.<eos> You ruined my dad's marble.<eos> He's not gonna want it with your snot all over it.<eos> Yes, I will.
And then?<eos> People get headaches, they go to her.<eos> She looks into their eyes and tells them who is wishing the headaches.<eos> She says a few words, and the headaches go away.<eos> Once in a while, the person who wished the headaches, goes away too.<eos> This guy, Addison, the one who works for the Mayor he quits his job in 2 weeks.<eos> He don't want nobody to know what kind of a guy he is.<eos> He don't want nobody to see pictures of him they shouldn't see.<eos> -He knows this?<eos> -He will.
Cigarette burning random beatings solitary confinement with no food and no light.<eos> -Say that took place?<eos> -On occasion.<eos> -Who tortured them?<eos> -Guards. Which guards?<eos> I can't remember all of them.<eos> Remember one.<eos> Remember one.<eos> This line of questioning better lead somewhere having to do with this case.<eos> -It will, Your Honor.
i'm sure that she really appreciated that.<eos> yeah, but i didn't look at it because it's not my affairs.<eos> right. i guess you're right.<eos> people's mail is their business.<eos> i don't look at other people's affairs because it's not my business.<eos> well, like it's not my business to tell you who to like and stuff.<eos> right.<eos> well, i'm going to go inside now and take care of my business.<eos> o.k., but if you ever... want to know what i think about that, uh... bad guy... with the fast car, you just ask me, o.k.?<eos> i will.
Yeah, if I have to.<eos> You gonna bring your whole gang?<eos> I'm here. Yeah.<eos> Me too.<eos> And me.<eos> Well, why are we just standing here?<eos> Music!<eos> May I have this dance?<eos> You were supposed to ask him.<eos> I will.
Go on back to your ship and play with your molecular microscanner.<eos> You've tried all that already, but it didn't work, did it?<eos> Kes didn't get better.<eos> No, she didn't.<eos> Why not?<eos> The Doctor couldn't explain it.<eos> So it's inexplicable.<eos> A miraculous nonrecovery.<eos> We haven't found the reason yet.<eos> But of course you will.
You're insulting me, aren't you?<eos> I have made such a huge mistake.<eos> I thought you were nice, but you're not nice.<eos> You hate me. I am so glad we finally understand each other.<eos> Me, too, Frances, 'cause as long as I'm going to date your son, I don't want any problems.<eos> Over my dead body.<eos> Doable.<eos> If you're going to throw a punch, try putting your weight into it, like this.<eos> Will the ladies be returning?<eos> One of them will.
But how?<eos> You know every ship going to Narn is searched.<eos> Vir, we're talking about G'Kar here.<eos> He is annoying but extremely capable.<eos> He will find a way.<eos> And when he arrives, he will attempt to free her and my forces will be there to arrest him.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It won't work, Londo.<eos> He'll never believe me.<eos> Yes, he will.
Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Are you...?<eos> Hang on!<eos> Hang on!<eos> - Have a doughnut if you want one.<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Weaver's looking for you.<eos> Yeah. It takes a while to get in from the D-Iot.<eos> - Did you get your car back?<eos> - I will.
I like not knowing right now.<eos> Sorry if that scares you, but if you wanna be with me, deal with that!<eos> -Okay, fine!<eos> -Thank you!<eos> -We're not done!<eos> -I didn't know that.<eos> You're with a guy who won't stop planning his future with you.<eos> He knows we'll end up together.<eos> If that scares you, tough! You'll have to deal with that.<eos> -I will!
Think of your victim's aging process as the opposite of Superman's, for instance.<eos> - What?<eos> - Well, you know how Superman's molecular structure is such that his aging process actually stabilizes and slows? In the case...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Hold on, hold on.<eos> What do you mean "stabilizes and slows"?<eos> What I mean is it stabilizes and slows.<eos> So are you saying Superman won't age?<eos> No.<eos> No, no, of course he will.
There never was.<eos> What about all those banks you robbed?<eos> It was the '30s.<eos> Does the phrase Great Depression mean anything to you?<eos> Back then we'd get out with a couple of thousand.<eos> Sometimes a calendar.<eos> You lied to me!<eos> I never actually said I had the money.<eos> I said I knew where to get it.<eos> And I will.
-No, look, I'm sorry-- -l'm just a freak.<eos> I don't have a past or a life.<eos> I bet I don't even have a soul.<eos> -There's nothing for anybody to love.<eos> -That's not true.<eos> You're just different.<eos> Different is good, okay?<eos> I ought to know.<eos> You just need to get your own life.<eos> And you will.
And you met her in an antique store.<eos> I don't know how you do it.<eos> I'm not engaged.<eos> - I got it.<eos> - Got what?<eos> I got the answer, Jerry.<eos> Refrigerator problem is solved.<eos> Oh, it's no problem.<eos> You can take whatever you want.<eos> I will.
All right. I'm going.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Going? Where?<eos> I'm going to change into something more comfortable.<eos> You don't think I'm going to beam down to Risa dressed like this, do you?<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> When in Rome...<eos> I can't believe we finally made it.<eos> Well, enjoy your vacation.<eos> Mmm. We will.
I never said I was.<eos> Increase speed to warp nine.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> It was delicious.<eos> What do you call it?<eos> Chicken à la Sisko.<eos> How did you learn to cook like this?<eos> Well, uh, all Sisko men have the cooking gene.<eos> Yeah, you should try my father's shrimp creole.<eos> Maybe one day, I will.
Did you see any Pah-wraiths?<eos> Pah-wraiths?<eos> In the Fire Caves.<eos> Odo was telling me the Caves were haunted by some sort of weird supernatural beings.<eos> Don't tell me you believe in wraiths.<eos> Well, I may have mentioned the Bajoran legends about creatures living in the caves but I never said I believe in them.<eos> Well, the only thing I saw in the caves were some beautiful and botanically fascinating fungi.<eos> Well, maybe the next time you go to the Fire Caves, I could come along.<eos> I've always wanted to meet a Pah-wraith.<eos> Maybe you will.
I didn't know that was public knowledge.<eos> You told Commander Dax.<eos> Well, that explains it.<eos> She is concerned about you and for good reason. As your Executive Officer<eos> I recommend that you remain on the ship during the away mission.<eos> That way, Omet'iklan will have no opportunity to carry out his threat.<eos> I appreciate the concern, but do you really think I'm going to follow that recommendation? No, sir, I do not.<eos> But I hope you will take some advice.<eos> Do not turn your back on him.<eos> I won't.
You sure you're all right?<eos> I'm not sure about anything anymore.<eos> You seem sort of... I don't know, funny.<eos> Look who's talking... The guy who still wears his virillus token.<eos> Hey, come on.<eos> Lots of guys still wear their tokens.<eos> Besides, it's good luck.<eos> It saved my life, remember?<eos> -How could I forget?<eos> -Yeah, well, I never will.
If something happens to me, you will not become a monster.<eos> But you never kill.<eos> I know that.<eos> I love you.<eos> Don't let that light that shines out of her face go out.<eos> I don't understand you.<eos> After all I did you still can't kill me.<eos> I won't take a life, even yours.<eos> I'd rather die.<eos> Oh, but you will.
- Yeah.<eos> Half a page.<eos> Fine.<eos> I only left it in so you'd cut it out anyway.<eos> I'm ready for Arizona.<eos> You should see what I have for the malpractice piece.<eos> - The surgeon's ex-wife- - Wait a minute.<eos> Had her on the phone for 20 minutes last night.<eos> - I haven't assigned you that story.<eos> - You will.
Top-drawer crook.<eos> Lived with me and never caught on.<eos> [Scorsese] "There is no doubt in my mind... that the prettiest music is sad," he remarked.<eos> 'And the most beautiful photography is in a low-key with rich blacks."<eos> [Heavy Breathing] [Scorsese] The paranoia of film noir reached its high point... with Robert Aldrich"s film Kiss Me Deadly.<eos> Out of the dark, a haunted woman appears to private eye Mike Hammer.<eos> She"s running away from a mental institution and an unbearable secret.<eos> She"s not mad, though. Merely innocent, destined to be a sacrifiicial lamb.<eos> - If we don"t make that bus stop...<eos> - We will.
I know her pretty well.<eos> She's had a Iot of success getting congressmen elected.<eos> Maybe we should try to steal her.<eos> Ten percent, A.J. Don't let them leave the room till they're clear about that.<eos> If you've got a free second, maybe you could stop in and say hello.<eos> - It might smooth the way.<eos> - Mention it to Janie tomorrow.<eos> - Good deal. - And let's focus on the crime bill.<eos> I don't want to just win this one. I want to win by a couple of touchdowns.<eos> We will, Mr. President.
Most couples when they first get together are inclined... to slam on the brakes because they're concerned about Bob Rumson's drool. - You're not most people.<eos> - You know what your problem is?<eos> - What's my problem?<eos> - Sex and nervousness.<eos> - Sex and nervousness is my problem?<eos> - Yes. Last night when we were looking at those place settings... I realized that those place settings were provided by the first ladies.<eos> And I'II bet none of those first ladies... were nervous about having sex with their president husbands.<eos> - And do you know why?<eos> - No, but you'II explain it to me.<eos> I will.
Muk, you and Luk carry Jenna back to town on this.<eos> And this time don't take time out for a swim!<eos> You can make sure of that, Boris.<eos> You're gonna lead them home.<eos> Just follow my marks.<eos> - You're going alone?<eos> - Won't be the first time.<eos> Here.<eos> Afraid it won't keep you very warm.<eos> Yeah, it will.
- You look a wee bit shaky.<eos> - I should have remembered the rocks.<eos> Aye.<eos> Get up, you big heap of...<eos> - It's good to see ye again.<eos> - Aye, welcome home.<eos> - Look what you did to my head.<eos> - You should have moved.<eos> William, will you dance with me?<eos> Of course I will.
You and you alone can rule Scotland.<eos> What I tell you, you must do.<eos> Not for me, not for yourself, but for your country.<eos> Right, lads, make way.<eos> Coming through.<eos> Make way, lads.<eos> - The Bruce is not coming, William.<eos> - He'll come.<eos> Mornay and Lochlan have come.<eos> So will the Bruce.
And your father sees you, too.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Shall I come with you?<eos> No.<eos> I'll go alone.<eos> - I'll see you after.<eos> - Right.<eos> Sooner rather than later, I hope.<eos> - He won't come.<eos> - He will.
You had the last philistine.<eos> This one's mine.<eos> If I want this one, I'll have him, too, by God.<eos> Fine.<eos> What happens if I just shoot you then, eh?<eos> - What do you think about that?<eos> - You gonna shoot me?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Well, why don't you shoot me then, goddamn it?<eos> - I will.
- What do you think about that?<eos> - You gonna shoot me?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Well, why don't you shoot me then, goddamn it?<eos> - I will.<eos> I'll shoot you right now.<eos> - Come on. Shoot me.<eos> - I will.<eos> - Well, quit talkin' about it and do it, by God.<eos> I will.
Look at you.<eos> Fat girl.<eos> See what we got ourselves here.<eos> Oh, you know what? I think we're gonna have ourselves a little boy.<eos> Yeah, come on, man.<eos> You got to be a boy.<eos> Boy, boy, boy.<eos> Ant Junior.<eos> See, it's the power of the mind.<eos> We will ourselves a little boy.
Joe is out.<eos> A.J. is out.<eos> All the beautiful little tattooed, gum-chewing freaks are out as well.<eos> And it pretty much goes without saying, that I'm out.<eos> Wish it had gone without saying, but you won't shut up.<eos> What I think Lucas is trying to say is that I'm going to open my own store.<eos> You don't have the start-up capital.<eos> - Yes, he does.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> But I will.
Peppermint?<eos> Information is power.<eos> If you don't have the information, one cannot seize power.<eos> You need to think about becoming mentally competitive.<eos> Being black does not free you from being a responsible individual.<eos> But being a responsible individual don't free you from being black.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Poor, misguided soul.<eos> You have yet to learn the rules of this game.<eos> - He will.
No, though, I'm serious. Either of you guys.<eos> What really makes you think I'll let you suck my tits?<eos> I don't know. They're just sittin' there all ripe and firm. It makes you want to suck on them.<eos> Don't touch!<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> I thought you had a girlfriend.<eos> No, I ain't seeing nobody.<eos> What about you?<eos> I can't. My mom won't let me have a boyfriend.<eos> She won't?
I'm glad it's nice there.<eos> That's great.<eos> Look, you just relax... and take care of yourself, get well quick... and we'll come see you in a couple of weeks.<eos> Soon as I reach deadline on this.<eos> Okay, babe?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Love you.<eos> - I love you too, honey.<eos> - Say hi to Rory.<eos> - I will.
It'll be worked out stage by stage...<eos> In secret.<eos> This um...<eos> El... what?<eos> Casco.<eos> - Hm? - If he does produce the deserters.<eos> Then what?<eos> - We'll look after them, sir.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Oh, no, you will not.
- That was the decision.<eos> It makes you feel bad... ..that you had to kill her.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Wow.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yesterday morning the body of a transient was found in a siding near Salt Lake City.<eos> Preliminary NA tests conclude he was killed by our creation.<eos> - Have you found other bodies?<eos> - No, not yet.<eos> You will.
I don't know.<eos> But just as I got close he must have hit the wrong button because the air doors slammed shut.<eos> The space doors opened, and he just flew out into space.<eos> And the one thing they never tell you is that you don't die instantly in vacuum.<eos> He just hung there, against the black like a puppet with his strings all tangled up or those old cartoons where you run off the cliff and your legs keep going.<eos> You could see that he was trying to breathe, but there was nothing.<eos> And one thing I remember when they pulled in his body his eyes were frozen.<eos> A lot of people make jokes about spacing somebody about shoving somebody out an air lock.<eos> I don't think it's funny.<eos> Never will.
Does anyone here truly believe the Centauri will stop now that they've seized our territory?<eos> We are only the beginning.<eos> You, all of you are next!<eos> Look, what happened was between you and the Centauri.<eos> - It has nothing to do with us.<eos> - Not now, but soon it will.
Where he who yells loudest wins, even though he may be totally wrong.<eos> That's how it is.<eos> It doesn't have to be.<eos> Picture a hospital without departments.<eos> Where every floor is staffed by a team of specialists.<eos> No time wasted on battles about "Your service, my service."<eos> They've been replaced by a more evolved, harmonious feminine model, in which the patient belongs to us.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> Does it exist?<eos> It will.
Oh, God.<eos> We didn't get into Scranton.<eos> That was our safety zoo.<eos> They take, like, dogs and cows.<eos> I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.<eos> I'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it.<eos> Good boy!<eos> See?<eos> How can nobody want him?<eos> Somebody will.
I don't know how this works.<eos> Are two people supposed to tell each other everything?<eos> Yes, I think two people who are considering getting...<eos> Who are considering doing what...<eos> Don't they?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Are we talking about what we decided not to talk about? No.<eos> No, we're not discussing marriage because that, combined with other unusual aspects of our relationship is making us both crazy and so, no, we should not discuss it.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> So we won't. Fine.
Let's just say that everyone's getting sick of your games.<eos> Not everyone.<eos> As a matter of fact Victor and I and Lois are just sitting down for three-handed pinochle.<eos> She and I have become inseparable.<eos> If you can get a message to Superman tell him we're in the penthouse of the Lakeside Towers.<eos> Buh-bye.<eos> This is such a nice place.<eos> We live in such a dump.<eos> Kyle, why can't we live in a nice place like this?<eos> We will, Victor.
Wolfgang Puck you are not.<eos> Beggars can't be choosers.<eos> We're not exactly rolling in the dough, you know? Oh...<eos> I bought us some clothes at a second-hand store. I took a guess at your size.<eos> You could change in the bathroom if you want.<eos> Well, that's... that's damnably kind of you, my boy.<eos> Well done.<eos> Is this some kind of joke, - Mr. Mallory?<eos> - Yes... I think you look very cool, Professor.<eos> "Ultra-hip," if you will.
Oh, I know that and I hope that will make this easier for you.<eos> You see...<eos> Benjamin is dead.<eos> Can I go now?<eos> You must have loved him very much to be so angry with him, to become so cold.<eos> Were there other Terrans killed with him?<eos> Oh, a whole ship full.<eos> All of this killing-- it has to stop.<eos> Mmm.<eos> And it Will.
Remind him where he belongs.<eos> And what about Sisko?<eos> Take me to the intendant's quarters.<eos> Then she'll decide what do with me.<eos> Of all the impudent...!<eos> Do as he says.<eos> Intendant, I demand that this man be... Ooh!<eos> You... demand?<eos> You promised me he'd die.<eos> And he will...
I don't know if she can see the sky... where they're keeping her.<eos> And...there was more.<eos> There was something about a friend...<eos> I...<eos> Why can't I remember?<eos> I wanted to tell her!<eos> Is all right.<eos> She'll understand.<eos> Yes, yes, you're right.<eos> She will.
As magistrate, he has the authority to make this decision.<eos> In the meantime,<eos> I'm going to take a look at that trajector platform.<eos> Maybe I can figure out how it works.<eos> You'll do nothing of the sort, Lieutenant.<eos> If I find this law is negotiable, I'll make every attempt to get the technology, but until then, we won't do anything that might violate their Canon of Laws as we understand it.<eos> That's all.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I just hope she gets it.<eos> She will.
No, his brother Lanny died last night.<eos> I already performed the autopsy on him this morning.<eos> So I guess it's true, you can never go home again.<eos> His body wounds were nonfatal.<eos> He died as a result of advanced cirrhosis of the liver.<eos> Oh, there's a moral to this story...<eos> "lay off the booze. "<eos> His body possesses some anatomical discrepancies... some offshoots of the esophagus and trachea... that almost seem umbilical in nature.<eos> - I've never seen anything like it.<eos> - And you never will again.
I was trying to get this Magic Eye thing to work.<eos> Look at that.<eos> A pony.<eos> Hey, everybody!<eos> Mom's home.<eos> They didn't have my size shirt, but you get the idea.<eos> Wow, Mom. I never pictured you as any kind of authority figure before.<eos> Marge, I want you to take care of yourself out there.<eos> You've become very dear to me.<eos> Homie, of course I will.
I will not.<eos> I will not betray you.<eos> Do it quickly.<eos> Let him go.<eos> You will all fall away.<eos> Rabbi.<eos> I will not fall away.<eos> I will lay down my life for you.<eos> Will you?<eos> I will.
Go now.<eos> - I'll come up then.<eos> - What the hell!<eos> Don't come up.<eos> Don't come up, I said.<eos> You'll fall!<eos> Don't ever let go of this hand.<eos> Else, I'll die.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - Okay, I won't.
What has he done for you?<eos> Okay, this is really stupid.<eos> And then I'm getting so emotional over the fact that he touched me... because, I mean, he was, he was always paying me... to do him this favor and-<eos> - I don't know, Thomas.<eos> - Why do you want to know all this?<eos> - Well, I'm sorry, but I, uh-<eos> What is it about a schoolgirl that gives her that special innocence, gentlemen?<eos> Such a thing that you have absolutely no control over.<eos> You never have.<eos> And you never will.
Why don't you go give your dad a big kiss goodbye, okay?<eos> I want to thank you for taking such good care of me.<eos> I was in a pretty horrid state when I arrived.<eos> It's nice to see that you're feeling better today.<eos> Oh, here.<eos> I want you to have this.<eos> Absolutely not, Iole. I can't accept this.<eos> Please, Deianeira.<eos> It would make me very happy if you'd accept it and wear it.<eos> All right, then I will.
You help him.<eos> - Uncle? - Uncle?<eos> - He doesn't want us to find him.<eos> - That's for sure.<eos> So what's going on?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Where's the money?<eos> Try to show some patience, all right?<eos> - If I wait much longer, they'll discover me.<eos> - No, they won't.
He's so cute and all alone.<eos> -Can we keep him?<eos> -Pumbaa, are you nuts?<eos> You're talking about a lion.<eos> Lions eat guys like us.<eos> -But he's so little.<eos> -He's going to get bigger.<eos> Maybe he'll be on our side.<eos> That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.<eos> Maybe he'll...
I'm not going either.<eos> We'll place my bow in front.<eos> Yes, that covers it.<eos> I'll never have suitors.<eos> I'll be an old spinster.<eos> You don't need scores of suitors, only one.<eos> The right one.<eos> - Listen to the child !<eos> - Meg won't be married right away.<eos> With Jo's help, I never will.
So he, um... Nice try, Sully.<eos> He does owe me.<eos> Well, get in line. He owes everybody.<eos> You take a big pile of money, and you go have a heart bypass... see how much money you have left after that.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Changed the locks, and throwing out his clothes.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, he no longer lives here.<eos> It's a bold move.<eos> Won't work. It might get his attention.<eos> Well, maybe it will, and maybe it won't.
Because I see real danger in all this.<eos> Oh, why must everything be so difficult?<eos> Here he comes.<eos> You have broken so many tapu today that Makemake should eat your souls in hell for eternity!<eos> But I will grant these requests, on one condition.<eos> For the Short Ears to enter The Birdman race The Great Moai must be finished<eos> At Motu Nui. But if he loses the race The Short Ear competitor will be sacrificed<eos> Now,<eos> Who would swim for the Short Ears?<eos> I will.
Two days, 16,000.<eos> - In two weeks there would be...<eos> - More than 250 billion.<eos> You OK?<eos> I don't know why your father picked me.<eos> - I won't be able to find the answer.<eos> - Wait.<eos> He knows what he's doing.<eos> You'll find something.<eos> No, Mary, you will.
I wouldn't hit you.<eos> Get away!<eos> You said enough!<eos> Ling, no!<eos> You will hurt the baby!<eos> - Then put me down! - okay.<eos> Leave me alone, I said!<eos> No!<eos> You have to stop this!<eos> All right, I will.
The loser, jack.<eos> The winner is ace.<eos> - I had a feeling this was a game for me.<eos> - You're a winner, sir.<eos> Now can we have a better time than this upstairs?<eos> At least upstairs I'd be making some money.<eos> Wyatt Earp!<eos> That's my name.<eos> Well, that don't mean shit to me or anybody else in this world.<eos> And it never will after this night.
We got fluid.<eos> We got a beat.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Pressure's back.<eos> Stitch around the tube. I think you can take it from here.<eos> Andy?<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Police talk to you yet?<eos> They will.
What is all this about?<eos> Will someone please tell me what's going...<eos> I see.<eos> I see.<eos> Very well, you are warden now.<eos> You'll have quarters at the mission.<eos> Go there.<eos> I don't want you under my roof. Go.<eos> I won't have you here.<eos> I won't.
Look how tense she is.<eos> She's fine.<eos> All right, Lisa, you got your way.<eos> Your mom's going to a psychiatrist.<eos> She's gonna tell Marge to leave me.<eos> It'll break up the family.<eos> You'll have to live with your grandmother and pick beans.<eos> Dad, I like picking beans with Grandma.<eos> - Well, keep it up, then.<eos> - Okay, I will.
It's you.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I thought you'd sleep till noon.<eos> You're supposed to be relaxing.<eos> I'm very relaxed.<eos> Good.<eos> How are you feeling this morning?<eos> Miserable.<eos> I wish you could stay here longer.<eos> All right, I will.
- What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - I can't marry you, Harry.<eos> You're too dumb.<eos> You think dumb people make this much money?<eos> I think only a dumb person would think money makes him smart.<eos> I got a different kind of life in mind.<eos> Is this something your little teacher taught you?<eos> He's what needs to be different around here.<eos> - I don't want you seeing him no more.<eos> - I won't.
Yeah?<eos> I know I've always treated her like a bratty kid sister but until yesterday I never realised how much she meant to me.<eos> I know.<eos> I'd better go home now.<eos> - Henry.<eos> - Yeah, Mom?<eos> Never mind.<eos> I'll see you at home.<eos> - Tell Connie I was here.<eos> - I will.
Look, cou... could we find some kind of way to help him?<eos> The book.<eos> The witches used it to put the spell on him.<eos> Maybe there's a way in here to take it off.<eos> Mmm, I don't know.<eos> Binx told us not to open it.<eos> Well, the witches are dead.<eos> What harm could it do?<eos> Well, just be careful.<eos> I will.
Just let me take a look.<eos> Okay, everything's fine.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Careful.<eos> Sister Mao, please get the lotus soup.<eos> - Thank you, Ma.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> We're turning Wai Tung to you.<eos> And you, Wai Tung, must care well for Wei Wei.<eos> I will.
He is not dead and that is not Robert.<eos> Jess, I did not kill your mother.<eos> Yesterday, Josh, or someone that looked like Josh, killed her.<eos> That was after she blew off the back of his head.<eos> I stabbed him with a poker through the heart and the son of a bitch still lived.<eos> Steven, please let me go.<eos> You and the baby are in danger.<eos> I can help.<eos> I won't leave you this time, Jess.<eos> - Yeah, you will, Steven.
Maybe she wants to see me.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I was always good at math and science. Maybe I had something to do with that part.<eos> You had nothing to do with it. Nothing.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> I understand you, your highness.<eos> I can't talk to you anymore.<eos> It's ok. I'm outta here. Mm-hmm.<eos> Have a nice life.<eos> I will.
You should have called.<eos> Hal. Hal, we need to talk.<eos> Oh, I don't think We need to talk, sweetheart.<eos> It was never really our thing.<eos> You can get down on your knees to me, I'm still breaking up with you.<eos> I think you should break up with me.<eos> Bruce is a hell of a lot better for you.<eos> I don't think you understand What I'm trying to stay.<eos> It's over between us, So don't try and stop me. Ok.<eos> I won't.
Oh, yeah. It's a busy life, Ma.<eos> Places to go, faces to paint.<eos> Yeah, I'll tell him, Ma.<eos> Don't worry, I'll tell him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hold on, Ma.<eos> She wants to know if you want to come stay with her.<eos> - No way.<eos> - He says he'll think about it, Ma.<eos> I will.
I can.<eos> I'd like for you to come downtown... and answer a few questions.<eos> This is downtown.<eos> Headquarters.<eos> You can have your attorney present.<eos> Why would I need my attorney?<eos> May I change before I go?<eos> Sure.<eos> You should always wear your hair down.<eos> For you, I always will.
What are you doing up here?<eos> - Hunting.<eos> - In a suit?<eos> - What kind of hunting?<eos> - Pink flamingos.<eos> The police have rounded up 12 of the 18 escaped prisoners.<eos> The six unaccounted for are to be considered armed and dangerous.<eos> You ever see any pink flamingos?<eos> No, sir, never have ...<eos> and never will.
We'll be right there, Marge.<eos> They're getting antsy, Red.<eos> You scheduled it.<eos> The idea is that an understanding of case history should, in parole situations, help the subject to avoid habitual traps.<eos> And in penal escape situations could identify those selfsame traps as an aid to apprehension.<eos> - Let me tell you, Miss Gerber...<eos> - Sally is fine.<eos> Let me tell you, Sally this is not an escape. This happens to be a manhunt.<eos> And no talking around in circles is gonna fix that.<eos> - And what will?
You have to.<eos> Maybe you can't even keep a secret.<eos> Master Colin, we've brought the machine for your legs.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> Now, don't be like that.<eos> You know how important it is for your circulation.<eos> I've got some nice, fresh flannels, too.<eos> Your father returns today.<eos> He won't want to see me.<eos> Perhaps he will.
So what about yours?<eos> What's your family like?<eos> Sadie's a pit boss in vegas.<eos> She's on her fourth marriage.<eos> Fourth?<eos> My god.<eos> To frank.<eos> Frank sells plastic catheters, bedpans, Stuff to hospitals.<eos> You'll probably see some of his work wash up here onshore from time to time.<eos> Really, you will.
Whoa, ugly!<eos> Whoa.<eos> You smelly... lump of lard!<eos> Impressive.<eos> Damn it!<eos> How pathetic.<eos> Killed by the same man that killed his father.<eos> You killed my father?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> As I will you.
You don't think I'm kissing his ass, do you?<eos> You're saying what he wants to hear.<eos> That ain't the same as kissing his ass.<eos> I saw Coming Home in a Body Bag, I loved it, I'm not lying to him.<eos> No, that's why it's not ass-kissing.<eos> What you're doing is genuine.<eos> And he knows it.<eos> I like you, Clarence.<eos> Always have.<eos> Always will.
Of course I didn't say anything.<eos> But...<eos> - But what?<eos> - Maybe I should.<eos> Are you nuts?<eos> Look, if you tell him the fire wasn't our fault, -<eos> - I mean...<eos> - Look, they're gonna slam us.<eos> You can bet nobody's gonna believe it was an accident.<eos> Maybe my dad will.
Are you getting any scent from it?<eos> They got a duty-free shop?<eos> - Can you smell anything?<eos> - No.<eos> Suggest we maintain present course.<eos> That fireball does not exist.<eos> - Say you're wrong?<eos> - I'll stake my reputation.<eos> - You haven't got a reputation.<eos> - I will after this escapade.
But there is nothing to talk about.<eos> - You used to tell Curzon everything.<eos> - Not everything.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> - lt's because I'm a woman, isn't it?<eos> - Don't be ridiculous.<eos> It's hard to talk man-to-man with a woman.<eos> - That has nothing to do with it.<eos> - Then tell me what's going on.<eos> I will.
NO, MAN!<eos> YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!<eos> YOU GOTTA FIX IT!<eos> OR WHAT?<eos> YOU GOTTA HELP ME.<eos> IT'S ALEX THAT DID THIS.<eos> GOD DAMN. I CAN'T STOP WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE ME.<eos> I'LL PAY, MAN.<eos> I WILL PAY.<eos> YES, OF COURSE, YOU WILL.
You're mad.<eos> There's work to be done.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> I brought some pencils.<eos> Oh, how wonderful!<eos> There you go.<eos> Ask and you shall receive.<eos> Amen! Amen!<eos> Now that Maria's back here with us, we'll start again.<eos> Joshua, if you will, please.
I also knew I didn't wanna care.<eos> Six months into the war, Europe still belonged to Hitler and Mussolini.<eos> American boys were being lost by the thousands on Pacific islands with names like Corregidor and Bataan.<eos> And the man named Ed Leland had disappeared from the face of the earth.<eos> When spring came to Washington he was all I thought about because I believed that wherever he was the sheer force of my love for him would keep him safe, keep him alive.<eos> Excuse me, I noticed you looking a bit lonely.<eos> Would you like to dance?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> - You sure?<eos> I will.
I'm dying, boys!<eos> Then you shouldn't have cut up no woman, you asshole!<eos> Jesus, I'm so thirsty.<eos> Give me some water, please!<eos> Please, Slim!<eos> I'm bleeding, Slim!<eos> Give him a drink of water, goddamn it!<eos> Give him some water, for chrissake!<eos> We ain't going to shoot!<eos> You won't?
Well, here's an extra dollar.<eos> You guys shoulda been at Gasworks Friday.<eos> - Yeah, we were.<eos> - This band, Crucial Taunt, they had this megababe lead singer...unreal!<eos> Phil, we were there.<eos> Have you gone mental? Hello?<eos> - I think we should go now.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> You think it's wise to sell a show we don't own?<eos> - By tonight, we will.
He can't touch me.<eos> They don't tell him that, though.<eos> Officially, I don't exist.<eos> I can't.<eos> My profit's my reward for selfless service to God and country.<eos> What's the fuck's wrong?<eos> I brought them here for you.<eos> They're the only ones that can connect Artie to you.<eos> - Nobody'll ever know.<eos> - I will.
The office, the house, everywhere.<eos> He knows we're on to him.<eos> Daggett?<eos> Who else?<eos> You were the one who said he was trying to take over the company.<eos> Yes.<eos> Insider trading.<eos> But once you give these papers to the DA, he'll be under indictment.<eos> If I turn in the evidence.<eos> But I won't.
Oh, wait a second.<eos> Did you say Thanksgiving?<eos> Aw, shoot.<eos> See, I usually spend Thanksgiving with my old Army buddies.<eos> Sam, you weren't in the Army.<eos> No, no, but, uh, my buddies were.<eos> You know, I-I'd invite you all over to my place, but Ma's down in Florida working on her tan.<eos> Yeah, she's got this standing rule that, uh, when she's not around, I'm not allowed to bring any more than two friends over at a time.<eos> Please, she's never gonna know.<eos> Yes, she will, Norm.
He was vulnerable.<eos> Then the flow of negative emotions was reversed back to him somehow?<eos> That's our guess, like a man with no immune system.<eos> - And Liva?<eos> - She seems fine.<eos> He wasn't able to establish a link.<eos> Looking back on the past few days it's as though I'm looking at a holodeck projection of someone else.<eos> That's how it seemed to us.<eos> Thanks for sticking by me.<eos> I always will.
YOU'VE GOT ME OUT HERE CAMPING. I'M STARVING, AND I HATE IT.<eos> GIVE ME THE CREDIT CARDS AND THE KEY.<eos> YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.<eos> THEY'RE MY CREDIT CARDS, TOO. AAH!<eos> STUPID DOG.<eos> I SHOULD HAVE HAD YOU BOTH PUT DOWN.<eos> IF I HAVE TO DRIVE MYSELF, I'M GOING HOME.<eos> NO, YOU WON'T.<eos> YES, I WILL!<eos> YOU WILL NOT!
You're sleeping with everyone they've ever slept with.<eos> Now that I've been to the Past Lives Pavilion that could be 20 to 30,000 people.<eos> As far as my life is concerned, I truly believe I turned the corner.<eos> I know I had a few fears left, but I was taken very young.<eos> I could've conquered them.<eos> If you see fit to let me move forward I promise you, I will do the best I can.<eos> I will work very hard, I'll do whatever is asked.<eos> I'll do the best I can.<eos> Honestly.<eos> I will.
You are so right there.<eos> This is yours.<eos> There's a map in it.<eos> They've put you up in one of the nicest houses on the base.<eos> We appreciate that, special agent Cassidy.<eos> So is there something going down that I should know about?<eos> No.<eos> It's just that all my transcripts have been pulled, my interrogations have been canceled, and then you all arrive on a navy gulfstream.<eos> How would you connect the dots?<eos> I wouldn't.
I love massages.<eos> - Since when?<eos> - Since yesterday.<eos> Please?<eos> You wanna go under the sun porch?<eos> Maybe it'll be more comfortable.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Maybe we'll all end up naked.<eos> - I wouldn't bet on that.<eos> - I would.
Please.<eos> Come on.<eos> Promise me you'll get your homework and chores done before you set one foot outside of that door?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thanks, Mom.<eos> When you see Pete, tell him to stop cutting doughnuts in the field.<eos> He's scaring the cattle.<eos> I appreciate you coming on short notice, Professor Walden.<eos> Yeah, normally I wouldn't.
The fairy poem?<eos> I haven't the foggiest idea.<eos> Do you mean Christabel LaMotte?<eos> Get off the line!<eos> I looked in Ellen's diary.<eos> There's nothing.<eos> But, uh, this should cheer you up.<eos> It's in her correspondence.<eos> I'm not going to ask if this is the original.<eos> I wouldn't.
Davey was wondering where his parents were.<eos> Turns out they were on their way to the ball game when a truck hit a patch of black ice and swerved into oncoming traffic.<eos> Mr. And mrs. Stone tragically couldn't get out of the way in time.<eos> I couldn't believe something that horrible could happen to a kid that nice.<eos> He walked right through that door and into foster home after foster home until his 18th birthday.<eos> Oh, my. You poor, poor boy.<eos> What in heaven's name did you do?<eos> Let's just get off of this.<eos> He didn't know how to handle it.<eos> What 12-year-old kid would?
At the end, the boy kills himself by jumping over a bridge.<eos> The second story was pretty much the same as the first... except, at the end, the boy kills himself by drinking a bottle of bug poison.<eos> Your stories are intense.<eos> I just want to leave some kind of legacy.<eos> Something great.<eos> And after that, I don't care what happens to me.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I wish there was a story about me.<eos> I don't know who would read it, though.<eos> I would.
I'd go crazy.<eos> I hate drab.<eos> You just looked right at my dress... when you said that.<eos> I did not.<eos> Oh, you did.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> I would kill to have, uh...<eos> It's almost the same color... as the... walls.<eos> - I would.
You're a few lbs.<eos> Overweight. - Are you or not?<eos> - When you start asking questions...<eos> No, listen, what if I told you can lose those pounds in a week?<eos> - You want to sell something.<eos> You needn't suffer, go on diet what would you say?<eos> - You want to sell something.<eos> Listen, would you like to lose 13 pounds in a week?<eos> - Fuck off.<eos> - Would you? - Nothing.
-It must be a wild place.<eos> -A worthy setting if the devil did decide to have a hand in the affairs of men.<eos> What are you doing in my cab?<eos> Tell me about the fare who watched my house in Baker Street!<eos> -What are you talking about? -And followed two gentlemen down Regent Street.<eos> Where did you pick him up?<eos> Where? !<eos> Trafalgar Square.<eos> -How would you describe him?<eos> -I wouldn't.
Should we send someone after him?<eos> No. No, he's OK.<eos> He just needs some time alone.<eos> I'll call Secret Service.<eos> David. I know how you feel about telling our side of the story first, but there is no time for that.<eos> Maureen is gonna go on air at nine o'clock.<eos> That's 40 minutes from right now.<eos> Isn't there anything we can do to stop her?<eos> She won't budge.<eos> And why would she?
I thought the job would be over by Christmas.<eos> It was Vaughn who made it clear to me what I was really up against.<eos> So that's how I became a double agent.<eos> And a few days later, your father came to see you and revealed that he was a double agent working for the CIA.<eos> That his job at SD-6 was cover, too.<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> Father and daughter double agents.<eos> Yes.<eos> Why would he recruit his daughter into that environment?<eos> He wouldn't.
It's not so bad, this vampire thing.<eos> Well, I've got a super power of my own, hotshot.<eos> What's that now?<eos> That really is inhuman.<eos> But what good do you really think that could...?<eos> Yes, that one!<eos> Kill that one, please!<eos> - Thank you. Thank you, thank you.<eos> - Why did he attack you?<eos> Well, who wouldn't?
It's that the sunglasses that Gus is wearing... familiar?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Very rare, custom-made graduated lenses.<eos> Your son is holding them in his hands.<eos> Were they a gift for him? No.<eos> He has his father's eyes.<eos> The two of you met on a video shoot in Vegas six years ago.<eos> Last night... Gus! Hey, baby.<eos> Huh? He knew immediately that it was his son.<eos> Any father would.
It's Teresa's seizure medication. She was epileptic.<eos> Only problem is, these are allergy pills.<eos> I got a C in chemistry, Jordan, and my lunch is getting cold.<eos> Could we get to the point?<eos> Antihistamines have been known to cause seizures in people with epilepsy.<eos> So, what are you saying? Keisha switched her mom's pills?<eos> She had a fight with her mother. They struggled.<eos> That's how the fingernail polish got on her neck, but Keisha didn't kill her.<eos> Besides, how would she know about the possible side effects of a drug?<eos> She wouldn't, but a pharmacist would.
Like any kid?<eos> It was no big deal, believe me.<eos> Is this where I'm supposed to admit that I was abused or something and that would explain everything?<eos> Well, sorry to disappoint, but he didn't.<eos> He didn't hit me.<eos> Didn't even lay a hand on me.<eos> He didn't even like me.<eos> I think I used to remind him of my mother who was about to dump him.<eos> Sure, I hated it.<eos> What little kid wouldn't?
I used to like rain better but now I'm on the fence.<eos> I like the snow.<eos> It has something to say when it falls like this.<eos> It's like time stops.<eos> Everyone stays home and I don't know drinks hot chocolate.<eos> Am I allowed?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were thinking of leaving?<eos> - I didn't think you'd have an opinion.<eos> - Of course I would.
No. It's not.<eos> Then at least we have that much in common.<eos> It seemed like a power fluctuation in the cycle output of the naqahdah reactor. But I discovered the absorption port and its redundancy had been tampered with.<eos> Carter!<eos> I haven't had coffee.<eos> Sir, if no one had noticed it, the reactor would have overloaded.<eos> - Any chance this was an accident?<eos> - Not a chance.<eos> Would not such an explosion destroy an area several miles in circumference?<eos> Yeah, it would.
And if Mr. Smith likes Mr. Jones' life... then we simply broker the transaction.<eos> What transaction?<eos> Oh, Mr. Smith's future becomes Mr. Jones'... and Mr. Jones' future becomes Mr. Smith's.<eos> - And that's it? - That's it.<eos> Of course, we do charge a small commission.<eos> - Simply for handling the deal.<eos> I assure you it's an equitable fee... for what we provide.<eos> Have I piqued your interest yet?<eos> You want a different life, don't you?<eos> Who wouldn't in my position?
You said you heard one say something about making someone come into the towers.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Which one was talking?<eos> He was tall, I think.<eos> All right, but who else was there?<eos> I don't really see that well without my glasses.<eos> Where are your glasses?<eos> You can't see faces without those?<eos> You don't wear those while you're working, do you?<eos> Would you?
Is there anything in his behavior that you can think of... that makes sense now?<eos> He was unhappy.<eos> But I never imagined anything like this.<eos> What did you imagine?<eos> I don't know.<eos> To be honest with you, I haven't thought about it until now.<eos> What about your father?<eos> What about him?<eos> - Would he have any idea?<eos> - No. Why would he?
How 'bout-- how 'bout the time we were at the pet store with the kids and that guy had a monkey?<eos> All I did was look at it.<eos> - and you gave me that face.<eos> - What face? That don't-even- think-about-it face.<eos> Well. you know we can't have a monkey in the house!<eos> I know!<eos> I wasn't going to buy a monkey.<eos> But you didn't even like that I thought it might be fun.<eos> That's right. because maybe I don't want to think that my husband. whom I'm married to. would like to live with a monkey!<eos> Well. maybe I would.
Charlie.<eos> There's no reason at all why you should believe me.<eos> So I'm gonna get proof, and I'm gonna show you and anyone else who will listen that I'm not crazy.<eos> Okay, Charlie.<eos> Okay.<eos> It took us almost two months before we found her.<eos> Something wrong with your system?<eos> No, the system's fine.<eos> She just doesn't have an implant.<eos> Why would she?
You've got a tiny bit of cream... right...<eos> - I got to go.<eos> - Oh, oh, oh.<eos> Why? - I just can't do this.<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> Is it because you don't find me attractive?<eos> No, no. A part of me is very, very interested... but the other parts are yelling...<eos> "You just married her cousin."<eos> Jane would never know, I promise.<eos> Yeah, but I would.
- Come on in.<eos> I'm Lawrence Bowen.<eos> This is my wife, Elaine.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm actually a partner. In the firm.<eos> I'm not just his partner in life.<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> We're Mr... We're Mr. Montgomery's attorneys.<eos> Yes, and they would know that.<eos> Sure they would.
Is that it?<eos> Well... let me tell you something.<eos> Let me tell you: you got it backwards!<eos> I know what you think, that I was too lenient!<eos> -That I let him get away with...<eos> -Everything!<eos> Everything!<eos> -And why didn't he come to you?<eos> -He wouldn't listen to me!<eos> -No, he wouldn't!
Get out of here.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You're pretty good with these kids, Jenny.<eos> I seem to have a thing for immature boys.<eos> Ouch!<eos> At least Stewart has his act together enough to ask me out.<eos> I think we're checking out a movie... right after his nap time.<eos> That's what I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> Would you...<eos> Would I...
I'm sorry.<eos> Are you saying that my life has no value?<eos> I am saying that maybe underneath all the neurosis, you have a profound capacity for happiness that you're not allowing to exist.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> You just met me.<eos> - You can't possibly know... who you are or how you'll respond to something until you try it.<eos> I happen to disagree.<eos> I happen to think if you know yourself well, you can gauge how you're gonna react to something.<eos> And I can pretty much assure you that I will never be made happy... by chanting for spiritual enlightenment.<eos> - Or maybe you would.
Eversmann, I'm out!<eos> Kurth, my last one!<eos> The convoy's here!<eos> Sergeant Eversmann.<eos> I heard you guys needed a lift!<eos> Yes, sir! Bring your wounded right over there and start loading them up!<eos> I got you, I got you.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I want to walk.<eos> Yeah, I would too.
Not many in here are still alive. They're all gone.<eos> That's Francois!<eos> - What a face!<eos> - His face was rounder, he was very young.<eos> Look how his face thinned out.<eos> He's a few years older now.<eos> - You sure took care of him.<eos> - Of course. He's my baby.<eos> - Would you like a cup of tea?<eos> - Yes, I would.
Yet she wants to marry him.<eos> Everybody has a past.<eos> We must forget the past and think of the future.<eos> What does a girl need for marriage?<eos> A husband's love and security.<eos> Yes but this is such an important decision.<eos> I don't understand anything.<eos> Should I talk to the girl?<eos> "Tell me, if you were in the girl's place..." Would you marry him?<eos> Yes I would.
And if he operated 3 times, 3 times.<eos> They call the doctor "the gardener".<eos> - You know why?<eos> - No.<eos> Because he works with plants.<eos> Terminal cases.<eos> When we don't know what to do with someone... we send them to him to see what he invents.<eos> You don't understand him.<eos> What he'd like is to see all his patients alive.<eos> Who wouldn't?
- Isn't it better than watch him kill it?<eos> You can't just change a whole way of life.<eos> Perhaps not, but I CAN save these unfortunates.<eos> For now, possibly.<eos> You may think me heartless, Agnes, but I see no point in being sentimental.<eos> If we weren't here, these... er, things, whatever they are, would be dead by now.<eos> But we ARE here.<eos> I don't think they would thank you for your compassion.<eos> All these animals you hunt... Do you never feel pity for them?<eos> No. No more than they would for me.
You, stay there.<eos> You know, you catch more flies with honey than vinegar, though I don't know why you'd want to catch flies. They're actually quite dirty little things.<eos> Just find the diary.<eos> Right.<eos> Finding it.<eos> If I was a diary of a mad Perseid explorer, where would I hide?<eos> Take your time.<eos> My trigger finger never gets tired.<eos> And if it does, well, I won't shed any tears.<eos> I would.
- Nothing.<eos> - No, really.<eos> Really. Against my better judgment and everything I hold sacred in life I covered for you. So you owe me.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Also, I told her I dumped you.<eos> You dumped me?<eos> She believe you?<eos> Of course she did.<eos> Why wouldn't she?
- On what?<eos> Scans I took this afternoon.<eos> Find anything you wanna tell me about?<eos> There's nothing of scientific interest on this planet.<eos> Our mission here was a waste of time.<eos> That's what you'd like us to think.<eos> - Let me see that thing.<eos> - The readings are in Vulcan.<eos> - You won't understand them.<eos> - No. But Hoshi would.
Either you give it back, or we'll take it.<eos> He's powering his engines.<eos> Target his shields and fire.<eos> Lock onto whatever belongs to us and transport it to the cargo bay.<eos> I'm detecting large quantities of food on his supply deck.<eos> Maybe we should take it while we have the chance.<eos> is it ours?<eos> No, but our own reserves are running out.<eos> Valen wouldn't hesitate to take it from us.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
Hey, Fez, Donna hasn't been...<eos> I don't know, like, mentioning me or anything?<eos> No.<eos> Well, that... that's okay.<eos> That's good, 'cause I haven't been talking about her either.<eos> Of course, I've been alone, so I'd just be talking to myself.<eos> And that's not normal.<eos> Have to be pretty crazy to talk to myself, wouldn't I?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I would.
- Okay.<eos> When do you think I should go in there?<eos> I'd wait a couple of hours till we have some more facts.<eos> You'll talk to the sheriff's office and I guess, the DA.<eos> Yeah, but you don't want to walk too far into that. Yeah.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - You heard?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - C.J. thinks I should wait a few hours.<eos> - I would.
-Better every year, but--<eos> -What?<eos> -You're not gonna give it, right?<eos> -Sure.<eos> -Why?<eos> Because it's Big block of Cheese Day, Josh.<eos> Y eah, see, but we know it's Big block of Cheese Day and we know why it's called that, so there's no need for the speech.<eos> Except it wouldn't be Big block of Cheese Day without the speech.<eos> Well, Iet's find out.<eos> Maybe it would.
- Hey.<eos> - Good evening, Mr. President.<eos> What's your name?<eos> I'm Donald Dolan from the office of the executive clerk, sir.<eos> Leo, I don't think it's a bluff.<eos> I don't think the leadership holds their members on a weekend for a bluff.<eos> - I don't think they're bluffing.<eos> - You think they're holding a vote?<eos> - Why would they hold a vote if they couldn't override?<eos> - They wouldn't.
He cracked under the pressure<eos> Poor guy<eos> Making him choose designer clothing when the only labels he owns say "Nathan" in red marker<eos> Will, what do you think of this dress?<eos> It's fine, Mrs. Fleischman if you're gonna continue that affair with the superintendent of the school district<eos> I am so glad that you're here<eos> Oh, I hope it's a Curly<eos> Oh, Shemp Well, it's still good<eos> You know what I thought I could wear with this?<eos> Yeah, and I wouldn't
Sucker!<eos> Are you sleeping?<eos> I was<eos> Well, now that you're up...<eos> Hi!<eos> Jack, I--I really wanted to be by myself<eos> I know Me, too<eos> Anyway you know, sometimes my mom would take to her bed for weeks and I was the only one who could help<eos> She'd say "Jackie, sing me a song"<eos> and I would
They took turns to talk to me, the same things everytime.<eos> Several times a day.<eos> I've come to realize things aren't... really so complicated.<eos> Why did they ever seem so? Right.<eos> How can I say this?<eos> While you were away... I had a chance to relive part of my youth.<eos> My first thought was that I could make things... turn out differently. But...<eos> They turned out the same, or not much different.<eos> I suddenly realized that... even if I was given a second chance... I wouldn't need it.<eos> I really wouldn't.
Whales are bigger in size and stature, but they're the submissive.<eos> Sharks are smaller, but they're by far the more dominant.<eos> I think someone's out there playing the dominant, but he's really the submissive.<eos> Okay.<eos> Listen... I need a favor.<eos> The new girl-- she's having a bit of a rough one.<eos> She thinks she let you down.<eos> I was hoping you might be able to help her process the suitcase, give her a little of that Grissom TLC?<eos> She could really use it.<eos> I'd rather not.
Hope he knows what he's doing.<eos> Come on, Bek.<eos> He's only piloting 3 fighter squads while we sit here and do nothing. What could be so difficult about that?<eos> Ok, let's hit them with a feint and pray they buy it.<eos> Missiles away.<eos> The Andromeda is moving.<eos> Now we see if they take the bait.<eos> The Nietzscheans took out our entire missile barrage.<eos> They're coming right at us!<eos> Well, why wouldn't they?
I grant you one hour to organize your affairs before your execution.<eos> My imperative compels me to serve all Companions.<eos> And you expect me to accept that as the justification for your actions?<eos> - You betrayed me.<eos> - No, I did not!<eos> You never gave me a direct order with respect to this relic.<eos> Only because I was unaware of the developments surrounding it.<eos> Would you expect a human being to take it upon himself to defy a direct order from a Taelon?<eos> Any Taelon?<eos> No, I would not.
There was a sergeant on our force, a regular guy, just like you and me, who had no idea he was that way until his trip to Hawaii.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What happened?<eos> A guy rented him a boogie board, and a bell went off.<eos> Today, they run a gift shop on Maui.<eos> So what-- what are you saying?<eos> We just haven't met Mr. Right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Debra and I were talking about going to Hawaii.<eos> I wouldn't.
And it might be fun to go shopping for the rest of my life, but I am not getting married.<eos> What's the word on Moya?<eos> Nothing.<eos> And what difference does it make, anyway?<eos> Scorpius has a full Command Carrier out there, waiting for us.<eos> Which is probably why Zhaan and Pilot have taken off.<eos> He's right, you know.<eos> Only place we're safe is in this Palace.<eos> I'm sorry. You're sayin' I should get married?<eos> I would.
I think she's a sex fiend.<eos> You should move your locker.<eos> What if she comes to school really horny one day?<eos> - Girls don't get horny.<eos> - They don't?<eos> Only guys get horny.<eos> Maybe Karen Scarfoli's a guy.<eos> Sam, if it was me, I'd go to Karen Scarfoli's house and make her write it.<eos> - I'm sure you would.<eos> - I would.
But I... I got over it.<eos> Do you want to know how?<eos> Vast amounts of antipsychotic drugs.<eos> Dad, what's the word?<eos> Unemployable.<eos> He's tense cos death is in the air.<eos> - Mm-hm? - Not you, Mr Briggs, it's all right.<eos> They're talking about me, but your concern is touching.<eos> Dad, I've had a word with Mum, she thinks the insurance thing is a great idea.<eos> She would.
Jason had head lice.<eos> Spread like wildfire.<eos> Mm. I never thanked him properly for that.<eos> What's he spreading now - cholera?<eos> Typhoid?<eos> Distemper?<eos> No, this time it's different.<eos> He's picking on Michael.<eos> - He didn't want to go to school.<eos> - Who would, with a foul class like that?
- Michael, we understand why you...<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Isabel, you don't understand.<eos> - So you got a raw deal.<eos> No one's saying you didn't.<eos> God, Michael, you finally have a chance to change it.<eos> Would it kill you to ask for help just once in your life?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> It would.
I like to think of myself as the Columbo of panties.<eos> Yeah. I'd say we're looking at a woman.<eos> Ages 16 to 38... with a five-figure income.<eos> She lives within a four-mile radius of here and is very popular with the gentlemen.<eos> Sure, she is.<eos> She'll have sex in a car that stinks like cheese.<eos> So, what you're saying is, they could be Shelly's.<eos> Come on.<eos> Forman wouldn't cheat on Donna.<eos> Sure he would.
Ah, screw it.<eos> Ow. My tooth.<eos> Why did I bite?<eos> Eric... if you don't wanna wear your ass for a hat, you'll get up here pronto!<eos> You better go.<eos> You know how that ass-hat screws up your hair.<eos> Poor Forman, huh?<eos> Workin' for Red like that.<eos> - Wouldn't wish that on my enemies.<eos> - I would.
- So you decided to kill time by...<eos> - Yeah, you know why?<eos> Tell me you went to Notre Dame.<eos> Maybe next time you won't be so quick to mock on the eve of a Michigan game.<eos> There must be an escape hatch here of some kind.<eos> The constitutional argument...<eos> I don't care about the constitutional argument, Josh, it's gay bashing.<eos> It's legislative gay bashing.<eos> How do I put my name on it?<eos> I wouldn't, sir.
What did you do with the gold?<eos> I did nothing!<eos> I never got it, I never!<eos> It's gone.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> But you ran away, Tom.<eos> Only scumbags run away.<eos> You can't trust someone who does that, can you? I mean, would you trust them, Tom?<eos> Would you?<eos> No, no, I wouldn't.
I never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.<eos> She liked to read a lot, though.<eos> Sometimes she'd lock herself up in her room for days, just reading.<eos> They wanted to put her in a school for the gifted when she was young.<eos> Maddie wouldn't hear about it.<eos> I don't know where she got it.<eos> She didn't get it from me.<eos> She probably got it from her father's side of the family.<eos> She never really mentioned her father.<eos> Yeah, well, she wouldn't.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, sophomores.<eos> You gotta love 'em, huh ?<eos> The usual ? Yes.<eos> That would be lovely.<eos> The race is at 4:00 today. You gonna be there ?<eos> I don't know. I've got this really riveting econ seminar... on the origins of the gross national product, so--<eos> - I wouldn't want to miss that.<eos> - Yeah, I would, actually.
I won't forget it again.<eos> The Outfit is not unreasonable.<eos> But no corporation would agree to what you're asking.<eos> Will Fairfax give me my money?<eos> Resnick told you quite a bit.<eos> Fairfax will say the same thing I have.<eos> We're not authorized to do things like this.<eos> Who is?<eos> Who makes the decisions?<eos> A committee would, in this case.
To be honest, it's freaking me out a little.<eos> You just make sure you keep my apartment clean or you will die.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> - Six thousand dollars?<eos> - I know.<eos> It sucks.<eos> Neil, where am I going to get $6,000 in three weeks?<eos> I don't know your budget.<eos> You may not want to... blow your whole wad on this tank.<eos> I would.
Let's just do it again. Ok, but this time you be Alissa.<eos> Wait.<eos> Why am I being Alissa?<eos> Because I'm tired of being Alissa.<eos> Yeah, but at the prom, I'm gonna be Tommy.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I'm just trying to prepare you.<eos> Tommy might try that.<eos> I would not try that.<eos> Yeah, I would.
I told you, I had soap in my eyes.<eos> That wasn't pain on your face, that was fear.<eos> Prue!<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Is everything okay?<eos> - Yeah, everything's fine.<eos> - So are we done?<eos> - Yeah, we're done.<eos> You would not believe what happened to me.<eos> Yes, I would.
- Thank you.<eos> - One question: What is it?<eos> - We, it's a...<eos> No, no... Okay, don't te me.<eos> I wanna be surprised.<eos> How can you order something without knowing?<eos> How can you order the same thing every time we go out?<eos> I do not.<eos> He' have penne marinara, half a caesar salad, dressing on the side and bruschetta to start.<eos> No, 'd ike the specia.
Okay, everybody, hold!<eos> Next on the platforms are...<eos> You two!<eos> And...<eos> -You two!<eos> -Cool!<eos> Excuse me, sir?<eos> Would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?<eos> Monica!<eos> Would it?
Are we?<eos> Financial advisor? I don't know.<eos> - I have many connections.<eos> - I don't need your connections.<eos> As nagus, people will be lining up to do business with me.<eos> You missed a spot.<eos> I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind.<eos> Possibly.<eos> Would 40 bricks of gold-pressed latinum do the trick? - No.<eos> But 70 would.
You want some thinner?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Back when I was working security at the studio... it was a full-time job keeping Jack out of trouble.<eos> No. Doctor's orders.<eos> If there was an actress he missed boinking...<eos> I don't know who she was.<eos> They all loved him, even after he dumped 'em.<eos> The man had the gift.<eos> Their husbands took a dimmer view, if I remember.<eos> -Well, they would.
Tired of being shushed.<eos> What do you wanna say?<eos> I already said everything I wanna say.<eos> Except I'm sad.<eos> - Why? - I'm sad that I won't be able to plan your wedding.<eos> So promise me that you won't have a ring bearer... or a flower girl, because those kids always just misbehave... and then they distract from the bride.<eos> And don't invite too many people.<eos> - Well, you know, I might not even get married, so...<eos> If I knew that you would be happy, I would close my eyes now.<eos> I would.
-Oh, God!<eos> This is a strange way of showing your appreciation.<eos> Hey, we appreciate it.<eos> We really do.<eos> We just want to go home now.<eos> But you don't know how long I've looked for someone like you.<eos> I'm very disappointed.<eos> In fact, I'm starting to get a little upset.<eos> No, don't get upset.<eos> Well, wouldn't you?
If I'd have known how much was won,... ..I'd never have started in the first place.<eos> Oh, Lord, this is getting awful serious.<eos> It's desperate.<eos> Oh, God, you did well today, man.<eos> Me and the whiskey.<eos> But Annie is still livid.<eos> Ah, she'll come round.<eos> What a performance that was!<eos> Your Jessy would have been proud of you.<eos> That she would.
In a reflex, I just slapped back.<eos> - Then?<eos> - She goes into kickbox overdrive.<eos> Then I fell down.<eos> That's all I remember.<eos> When I woke up a paramedic was standing over me.<eos> - I have nothing further.<eos> - She asked you to stop?<eos> - No, to take it slower.<eos> - And you wouldn't?
- What? I couldn't do that.<eos> - I couldn't.<eos> - You have to.<eos> - What are you asking me?<eos> - Wouldn't you want...<eos> I wouldn't ask you to do that.<eos> I'd go out in the woods...<eos> I'd just...<eos> I wouldn't ask you to do that.<eos> I wouldn't.
No one believes me.<eos> I believe you.<eos> I want you to tell me what's wrong with each of these pictures.<eos> The chimney is missing there.<eos> The door is upside down there.<eos> The bench is missing at post there.<eos> And, the address numbers are inverted there.<eos> Look closely, Jarod.<eos> The sun shadow of the wood stack, It's mis-directed at all and I missed it.<eos> Most people would, Jarod,
- Are you boys staying' out of trouble?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Ok, I, I'm just gonna go over here for a while.<eos> Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.<eos> - Knock it off asshole.<eos> - No way!<eos> I'm never going back to your parents house.<eos> Come on dude, if it were your little brother we'd help you.<eos> Ehh. Wait a minute!<eos> No you wouldn't!
They were lucky, that's all.<eos> I know a way you can increase sales of Slug-o-Cola by 50-60%.<eos> I'm all ears.<eos> Target the new female consumer.<eos> Make Slug-o-Cola her drink.<eos> There's nothing stopping her from drinking it now.<eos> You're not encouraging her either.<eos> "The slimiest cola in the galaxy"?<eos> That kind of slogan doesn't appeal to women.<eos> - Well, what would?
I've indulged you.<eos> I've gone out on a limb for you many times, but this is it.<eos> You've got to make a decision.<eos> You are either the Emissary or a Starfleet Captain.<eos> You can't be both.<eos> I'll be on the Defiant Bridge at 0500.<eos> The combined fleet at Deep Space 9?<eos> Composed of Federation, Klingon and Romulan ships.<eos> You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system?<eos> I would.
Just say it and she'll go home.<eos> Fine.<eos> You're right, Jackie, the Fonz could beat up Bruce Lee.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, Michael, call me tonight at 8:00.<eos> - But that's when Chico And The Man is on.<eos> But I like it when you describe it to me.<eos> Do your Chico impersonation.<eos> I don't think these guys really want to hear my...<eos> - Sure we would.
I mean it's practically all been said already, you know?<eos> I mean we could talk about it forever.<eos> This kid's 0 for five.<eos> I mean look at his record.<eos> At 10 he's at juvenile court, he threw a rock at a teacher, at 14 he was in reform school cause he stole a car, he's been arrested for mugging', he's been picked up twice for trying to slash another teen with a knife,<eos> he's real good with that switchblade you know.<eos> Everybody said that.<eos> This is a real fine boy.<eos> Ever since he was 5 years old, his father beat him up and he used his fists.<eos> So would I. A kid like that?
Right.<eos> Now I'm your pet project.<eos> I' m your hobby farm.<eos> Whatever you say, Bob.<eos> Guy who tried to kill you.<eos> -That's terrific, Charles.<eos> -No, you wouldn't have done it.<eos> Yes, I would have.<eos> You stupid son of a bitch.<eos> Yes, I would.
- Come on, Gaz, I'm freezing.<eos> "Women only"?<eos> Cheeky buggers!<eos> It's a bloody working-men's club!<eos> I mean, look at the state of that!<eos> What have you got to smile about?<eos> He's got no willy, for starters.<eos> Nowt in a gym'll help you there, mate!<eos> No decent woman would be seen dead in there.<eos> Jean would.
- Is everything all right?<eos> - Fine in a petroleum processing plant yesterday... I've finished for the evening.<eos> Will you be needing anything else?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Good night, then.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Never mind who that is.<eos> You wanna know how a camera got into your home.<eos> Yes, I would.
Actually, I went in there looking for a rare Robert Johnson.<eos> - Yeah, I think I know the place.<eos> I'll have to get in there.<eos> - You should. Uh, Mr Korda, do you know a Frank Antonucci?<eos> Guy who owns the bakery down the street?<eos> No, this is a different Frank.<eos> This is a man who deals in jewellery.<eos> Stolen, usually.<eos> You wouldn't know anybody like that?<eos> No, I certainly would not.
- Killed in action!<eos> Three more days and you're out.<eos> Good as new. - See ya later.<eos> What did you hear about our new unit?<eos> Roughnecks killed more Bugs than any other outfit on Big "K".<eos> I hear the lieutenant's a real nut-buster.<eos> Who's top kick?<eos> You want the job, huh?<eos> - I wouldn't mind.<eos> - I would.
But no one else knows him.<eos> Somehow he has brainwashed the entire country into thinking that John Doe is a "darn nice guy."<eos> Honey.<eos> Honey, we believe you.<eos> It just doesn't seem like Clark is dead.<eos> Maybe he can be found.<eos> If I haven't learned anything else in this life I've learned you have to cling to hope.<eos> - That's what Clark would say.<eos> - Hello?<eos> Yes, he would.
Andrei, the undercover cop.<eos> He's there. With Yura.<eos> Yaponchik, Chernobyl, wormwood.<eos> They believe it, both of them.<eos> That's why they're searching for Yaponchik.<eos> That's why Yura's here.<eos> You weren't honest with me.<eos> I don't talk about Chernobyl, Frank.<eos> And neither did Andrei.<eos> Would you?
[Sydney] Real glutton for punishment, hmm?<eos> Desperate times, desperate measures, Sydney.<eos> If Sponge Boy here really can become anyone, like all the quacks around here claim... then I'm letting him become Kyle and Jarod at the same time.<eos> - Maybe he'll tell me where they went.<eos> Maybe we should have tethered him.<eos> Aren't we making one erroneous assumption, Dr. Parker?<eos> What's he gonna blow?<eos> A transistor?<eos> - You assume that he wants to help you.<eos> - Why wouldn't he?

When you like what you see, turn the knob to the right.<eos> When you don't like what you see, turn it left.<eos> My knob tastes funny.<eos> Please refrain from tasting the knob.<eos> Hey, quit it.<eos> They like Itchy, they like Scratchy.<eos> One kid seems to love the Speedo man.<eos> What more do they want?<eos> Okay, how many of you would like Itchy Scratchy to deal with real-life problems, like the ones you face every day?<eos> - I would!

One or two.<eos> How many people are on the list now?<eos> Twenty-five.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> Not... just yet.<eos> I'd like to... narrow it a little.<eos> You're afraid I'm going to take the names and go charging off after them.<eos> Something like that.<eos> You're right.<eos> I probably would.
I actually believed that she'd set me up to fail.<eos> Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.<eos> She saw... she saw something in me that I didn't see.<eos> She saw a worthwhile person where I saw a lost and hostile misfit, and because she had faith in me,<eos> I began to have faith in myself and when she died, the first thing I thought was that I couldn't do this without her, that I needed her too badly-- her strength and her compassion, but then I realized<eos> that the gift that she gave me-- and gave a lot of us here-- was the knowledge that we are better and stronger than we think.<eos> I wish I had said these things to her.<eos> I wish I had taken the time.<eos> Would anyone else like to say something?<eos> I would, sir.
I assume you know how to do that?<eos> You assume correctly.<eos> But I will have to bypass several safeguards.<eos> It will take time.<eos> Then you'd better get started.<eos> Tuvok to Seven of Nine. Yes?<eos> Why have you accessed the EPS relay system?<eos> There is a malfunction. I'm attempting to repair it.<eos> Perhaps you should leave that to the Engineering crew.<eos> Normally, I would.
A mighty princess forged in the heat of battle.<eos> The power.<eos> The passion.<eos> The danger.<eos> Her courage will change the world. XENA<eos> If you had her promise...<eos> then you would let her go, right?<eos> It would take more than that.<eos> Xena would never go back on her promise.<eos> Of course she would.
You are guilty of selfishness, Bess.<eos> You didn't even consider for one second how painful it must have been for him.<eos> You put your own feelings before everyone else's.<eos> I can't see that you love him when you behave like that.<eos> Now you must promise to be a good girl, Bess.<eos> I promise to be a good girl.<eos> I'm sorry for the way I behaved, mother.<eos> It's all right, Bessie.<eos> Mother, would it be ok if I came home for a bit while Jan's away?<eos> Of course it would, Bessie.
Caleb!<eos> Caleb!<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> Half the neighborhood can hear this music!<eos> Well, I am very sorry.<eos> I must apologize.<eos> There!<eos> That's for the other half.<eos> Would it kill you to be considerate for two seconds of your life?<eos> Yeah, it probably would.
Delight.<eos> Respect.<eos> Compassion.<eos> That for your actions to be pure, they must proceed... from direction, determination, patience and strength.<eos> I'm afraid I'm still working on patience.<eos> They taught me how to live... how to breathe, how to fight and how to die.<eos> How to use it.<eos> And how to face it.<eos> Think I'd like to hear more about that.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
All right, that's it!<eos> Come on, we're going back.<eos> It's past your bedtimes.<eos> - Please, can we go to one more floor?<eos> - Yeah, one more floor!<eos> - Be a sport, Peter.<eos> - Yeah, be a sport, Peter.<eos> - Nurse "Ba-jerk" would let us.<eos> - Bjerke.<eos> And, yes, I would.
You should take Rachel to the prom.<eos> Doubtful.<eos> Jack, give me that.<eos> Talk to your son.<eos> All right, go on.<eos> This thing's heavy.<eos> Your mother's right.<eos> Take her. You can wear my tux.<eos> She won't wanna go with me.<eos> Of course she would!
- Aurora's moving to Beirut.<eos> Well, I guess we won't be double-dating any time soon.<eos> Well, to tell you the truth, Chief I think our double-dating days are...<eos> Miss Lane!<eos> Mr. Gendell.<eos> I just came by to thank you for reintroducing me to the world.<eos> And I was wondering if you and your husband would join Connie and me for dinner?<eos> - Thanks, but we're not going to do any...<eos> - We'd love to.<eos> We would?
I was young once.<eos> In fact, I'm not anywhere near ready for the old folks' home.<eos> Hey, what do you think of this one?<eos> - That's it.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Old folks' homes.<eos> - What?<eos> They serve the same kind of food as hospitals, don't they?<eos> I suppose they would.<eos> Of course they would.
Yes.<eos> But if your heart is Klingon how could you fire upon your own people?<eos> They fired the first shot.<eos> And when that happened, they became my enemies.<eos> Then why aren't you glad you destroyed that transport?<eos> It was filled with your enemies and their children.<eos> There is nothing honorable about killing those who cannot defend themselves.<eos> Are you telling me that you would never attack a defenseless opponent?<eos> No.<eos> I would not.
I just want to know one thing-- whose idea was this?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> It does to me.<eos> It was mine.<eos> We needed you to help us complete the ship.<eos> Smiley told me all about you about your wife's death, about your son.<eos> I knew that Jake would want to meet me-- that I'd remind him of his mother.<eos> You're nothing like his mother.<eos> I think Jake would disagree.<eos> Of course, he would.
Look at them.<eos> You'd think somebody died.<eos> I don't know if it's because she's Betazoid or what but her mood is contagious.<eos> As soon as she walked in here, things started getting quiet.<eos> Well, what do you want me to do about it?<eos> Either cheer her up or get her to leave because if you don't, I'm going to throw her out.<eos> Odo.<eos> Won't you join the party?<eos> Actually, I have some free time and I was wondering if you wanted to take a walk.<eos> I would.
I'm not going to tell this crew we're adding another 15 months to this journey.<eos> We'II have to find another option.<eos> If we are not to go around their space, the only available option is to go through it.<eos> precisely.<eos> Tom and B'EIanna hit a sensor net as they crossed the border.<eos> We have to figure we'II run into it when we try to cross, but there are ways around sensor nets.<eos> They can't possibly have enough ships to patrol a border this size.<eos> We can probably find an unguarded section.<eos> would it affect your decision if I pointed out that encroaching on the territory of an alien species is prohibited by StarfIeet regulations?<eos> No, it wouldn't.
If he stays with me, he'll become a target for all those who hate me..., ...and he'll learn things a child should never know.<eos> He'll become like me.<eos> The son of Borias will be raised as my own.<eos> I want to talk to you.<eos> I told you everything.<eos> Yeah, now you've told me everything... Everything except why.<eos> I mean... How could you walk out on your own child?<eos> You don't understand.<eos> No, I do understand.<eos> Any woman would.
You look so sad.<eos> Do you need one?<eos> Me?<eos> No.<eos> You're not exactly what you seem, are you?<eos> What is it you really came here for?<eos> Yikes, time's up.<eos> That's usually my line.<eos> I'd love to stay here chatting--<eos> Would you?
I love climbing.<eos> But?<eos> I've met someone.<eos> That's fast work.<eos> You just moved here.<eos> You could say he just dropped out of the sky and bang!<eos> I think he felt it too.<eos> He sure did.<eos> What?<eos> Who wouldn't?
You have no backup, no escape route.<eos> And I have the only bargaining chip.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Oh, yes. Your fatal weakness.<eos> Ourumov, bring her in.<eos> Lovely girl.<eos> Tastes like...<eos> like strawberries.<eos> - I wouldn't know.<eos> - I would.
- Do you want me to leave?<eos> - No, why?<eos> My eyes were red and swollen, yesterday. Mom thought that I was sick.<eos> - What did you tell her?<eos> - I couldn't tell her of the makeup.<eos> so, I said I had smoked a joint.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I have to do my mother's job again.<eos> - I can help you, if you want.<eos> - Would you?
Shoot.<eos> Wait.<eos> Can I talk to you?<eos> I've been trying to call you.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - I heard that you left Eddie.<eos> - Well, Lorene, you know...<eos> - You would tell me, wouldn't you?<eos> If there was anything that had to do with me, wouldn't you?<eos> Of course, I would.
Are you happy?<eos> I don't remember you having had a conversation with your father.<eos> You wanna leave the business, don't you?<eos> Is this just another miscommunication that we are having here?<eos> What do you know about my family?<eos> Spending a week with them does not make you an expert.<eos> Spending a lifetime with them hasn't made you one either.<eos> Yeah, well, I know that keeping your family happy gets complicated.<eos> Would your father be happy knowing you're sitting in a token booth planning vacations that you aren't taking?<eos> No, he wouldn't.
- Tonight.<eos> - What are the odds of that happening?<eos> You take your time.<eos> There it is!<eos> - What'll you do?<eos> - What can I do?<eos> I don't wanna screw it up with Ursula.<eos> And your friend?<eos> If she's my friend, she'll understand.<eos> Wouldn't you?
It's easy for you to say.<eos> You found one already.<eos> All you need is a woman who likes men, and you'll be set.<eos> Not her.<eos> So, you guys really slide down a pole?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - That's so cool.<eos> How do you get back up?<eos> Well, we rarely have to return from a fire as quickly.<eos> So, would you guys....
Salmoneus told me that Xena saved a baby boy at my village.<eos> Is that true?<eos> Was he...?<eos> Did he have a birthmark on his left leg?<eos> That's my son.<eos> Oh, gods above, thank you. I don't know how to...<eos> - Suppose I don't wanna give him up.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I put my life on the line for him.<eos> Would you?
Well, I think that's the tops.<eos> You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?<eos> Yes, George, come in, come in.<eos> I've been your biggest supporter and I was disappointed to hear you've been pilfering equipment.<eos> George would never do anything like that.<eos> -No, why would I?<eos> I own it. -Right.<eos> So, what are you saying?<eos> Why would George steal from the Yankees?<eos> -He wouldn't.
Did you see them?<eos> It doesn't really matter.<eos> I'm just glad that I wasn't hurt.<eos> Well, whoever it was did a very thorough job.<eos> They took everything she had, even her I.D.<eos> Chris rescued me and let me use his computer to get my replacement I.D.<eos> You were lucky the police didn't find you first.<eos> If they'd caught you on the street without I.D. you might have ended up in a Sanctuary District.<eos> I thought they stopped doing that.<eos> Why would they?
I told you we didn't kill him.<eos> Please try to understand.<eos> We don't want to hurt you.<eos> We don't want to hurt anyone.<eos> We just want to get home.<eos> Tuvok, release the force field.<eos> Captain...<eos> Do it.<eos> You'd show me mercy after what I did to you?<eos> Yes, I would.
Doesn't "no" mean "no"?<eos> Sometimes "no" means that person wants to be overwhelmed, dominated.<eos> The way we're supposed to have sex nowadays we'd need UN supervision.<eos> "No" means "no."<eos> lsn't that what we tell women?<eos> Do men deserve less?<eos> When he really wanted to stop he had no problems doing it.<eos> And you got angry.<eos> Of course I did.<eos> Anyone would.
- I'Il be right back with your drinks.<eos> Could you roll me one of those, cowboy?<eos> - You can have this one, cowgirl!<eos> Think nothing of it,<eos> Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam.<eos> - How long were you there?<eos> - Just over three years.<eos> - I go there once a year to chill out for a month.<eos> - I didn`t know that.<eos> Why would you?
- Yes, but, Master Richie, please consider...<eos> Well, I'm wanted for attempted murder, escaping from jail, blowing up an aircraft breaking and entering sounds right up my alley.<eos> - Let's kick some butt, shall we?<eos> - Let's.<eos> Well, that's it.<eos> It's all up to Richie now.<eos> Well, then, everything is fine.<eos> - Richie never lets us down.<eos> - No.<eos> He never would.
