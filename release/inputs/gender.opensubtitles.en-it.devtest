Madam President?<eos> Assemble the Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Jack was right about Starkwood.<eos> You found evidence that they've been supporting Juma.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you find out why?<eos> I mean, what could Starkwood possibly get from Juma?<eos> The infrastructure to develop and test biological weapons.<eos> We think they're holding them somewhere on the Starkwood compound.
You found evidence that they've been supporting Juma.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you find out why?<eos> I mean, what could Starkwood possibly get from Juma?<eos> The infrastructure to develop and test biological weapons.<eos> We think they're holding them somewhere on the Starkwood compound.<eos> Okay, where's Jack?<eos> He's on his way over here.<eos> What, Larry?<eos> He managed to secure the weapons, but then, uh, Starkwood got them back.
They've identified the pathogen as a prion variant indigenous to the East Congo.<eos> It's a form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.<eos> It attacks the brain and the nervous system, causes dementia, physical deterioration, ultimately death.<eos> Standard CJD kills within several months, but this strain kills more quickly.<eos> How long?<eos> A day, maybe two.<eos> There's no treatment for this disease. There's no cure.<eos> If dispersed over a populated area, the results would be catastrophic.<eos> But it goes without saying we cannot allow a private military force, these killers, to possess weapons of mass destruction.<eos> We need to find these weapons, and arrest those bastards in Starkwood who are responsible for bringing them here.
Tim, what's our troop status?<eos> Mobilizing.<eos> The secretary of defense says they're still several hours out.<eos> At which point we have a war on our hands against 1.500 mercenaries armed with bioweapons.<eos> Madam president, I do believe that a surgical air strike will work as long as we can pinpoint the exact location of the weapon.<eos> - And you can do that?<eos> - Yes, I believe we can.<eos> Mr. Bauer, you've seen the canisters containing the bioweapons, you know what they look like, is that correct?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Then we'll need you to verify the canisters once Almeida has located them.
Elimu, remove mr. taylor's gag.<eos> You son of a bitch. You're behind my son's death.<eos> He was poking his nose where it did not belong.<eos> You'll never get away with this. you must know that.<eos> Everyone in the city is going be looking for me.<eos> You should be concerned with just one question, mr. taylor.<eos> Does your wife love you enough To call off the invasion of my country?<eos> For your sake, I hope the answer is yes.<eos> Activate the scrambling device.<eos> Our law enforcement agencies Will hunt down the people responsible And bring them to justice.
Shit.<eos> Boner!<eos> You got a boner!<eos> Brennan's got a boner!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Thanks.<eos> I like your records.<eos> Eno, Replacements, Big Star.<eos> Hey, give me your underwear.<eos> I'll throw them in the dryer for you.
Boner!<eos> You got a boner!<eos> Brennan's got a boner!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Thanks.<eos> I like your records.<eos> Eno, Replacements, Big Star.<eos> Hey, give me your underwear.<eos> I'll throw them in the dryer for you.<eos> -I promise you'll get them back.
- What?<eos> - 10K.<eos> Gonna see my man Sandu Ajula, bing bong.<eos> Easy.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You're in America.<eos> Steal something.<eos> - No, man.<eos> - Free money.<eos> How many hands you think done touched these boxes before we get them?
- No.<eos> Oh, my God, it was.<eos> Oh, that's so cute.<eos> So...so was it really magical?<eos> Was it really worth waiting for?<eos> Was it over really quickly?<eos> 'Cause it was when I did it with him.<eos> Dirty Little slut gave me crabs.<eos> I had to shave the panty hamster.<eos> He said he got them from Sophie, but I think it was the other way round.
-Dogsled?<eos> -Yeah. And you know the old saying;<eos> If you're not the lead dog... -...the view never changes?<eos> -Right. Otherwise, you're always looking at the asshole of the dog in front of you.<eos> Be funny in a minute when I get to that part.<eos> It's funny now.<eos> And it's 8 in the morning, we haven't been to bed yet and we're tooling across this glacier and I got this hangover that's creeping up the back of my neck and guess what I'm looking at?<eos> Obviously you're staring at the ass of the dog in front of you.<eos> You got it.<eos> So this dog, out of nowhere, just lifts its hind legs up and puts them in the harness there and just takes a shit while he's running on his front paws.
Ginger was eating Ye Olde Drumstick and she dropped it. The kids were crying.<eos> And I remember this farmer saying he had a gun in his truck.<eos> From the white knight to a gun in the truck.<eos> They had everyone turn before they put the animal down.<eos> But even if you couldn't see, you could still hear.<eos> How do you get that back?<eos> How does that get to be fair?<eos> GINGER: Well, he just kept buying things.<eos> We had eight cars.<eos> Three of them we never even used.
And how can I be part of their lives if they're in Europe?<eos> - This is a game changer.<eos> - What game?<eos> - This is not a game.<eos> - No, it's not a game.<eos> It's my life.<eos> And now you decided to modify the rules, I've gotta re-evaluate which ones actually keep me here.<eos> I'll just sit here and try to concentrate on not throwing up.<eos> Butterflies making you queasy?<eos> What say we drown them with a dip in the vodka fountain?
Mom doesn't act weird.<eos> - Mom, why do you take this stuff?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - These pills.<eos> What do you take 'em for?<eos> - It's my medicine.<eos> Can you put it back, please?<eos> Chester told me it was speed.<eos> Chester doesn't know what he's talking about.<eos> - What happens if you don't take them?
- What do you mean?<eos> - lt has come to my attention that perhaps the painting is undervalued.<eos> - What, do you mean Mr. Spindle is hoping for a bargain?<eos> - ln a manner of speaking.<eos> - l see.<eos> - Baudelaire.<eos> is that dry enough?<eos> - And that one's beautiful over there.<eos> I think he's great, because, you know, he's such a clever artist.<eos> He takes things that normally we would associate with ugliness and, you know, nastiness, like cancer, and then he makes them into something really pretty and beautiful.
It's not here.<eos> It has to be.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> We trade for ten thousand cans.<eos> Certain factions of nigerian gangs want to try and extract weaponry from District 9.<eos> And have been trying to for many many years.<eos> Give them one hundred cans.<eos> - Hundred.<eos> -One hundred!<eos> Yes, yes, but we take them all now.
eleven comes, the clock will chime forgotten souls erased by time.<eos> That's it.<eos> Erased.<eos> Okay, that's it.<eos> Erased by time.<eos> That makes sense now.<eos> Okay, it doesn't make any sense at all, but I think I know why.<eos> People are gone.<eos> People I knew?<eos> You didn't just know them Eli they were your best friends and now one by one they've been...
We're running them through NCIC, but don't hold your breath.<eos> Oh, jeez.<eos> Coroner says the arms appear to have been snapped off, hyper-extended.<eos> What could this kid have done to bring something like this on himself?<eos> He must've been into something deep.<eos> Nope, nothing so far.<eos> Everybody said he was a pretty good kid.<eos> The coach did say something interesting, though.<eos> These chains don't belong here.<eos> No one's seen them before.
I hope so, for your sake.<eos> Does she have the scars?<eos> What?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What scars?<eos> Leena was one of our most violent patients.<eos> When she was here, she was kept in a straitjacket to stop her from hurting our staff.<eos> She was constantly fighting to get out.<eos> It cut into her skin and left her with scars around her wrists and neck.<eos> There is no way you could not have seen them.
And for the better part of three hours, literally the entire movie was pitched to us.<eos> You go through one storyboard, then they bring another and you'd sit there for hours and--<eos> I couldn't remember what was in the first storyboard.<eos> It was a very hard process for me to deal with.<eos> I'd been used to dealing in the script area.<eos> KATZENBERG: So when it was over, we all sort of said,<eos> "Thanks very much," and,"Great job."<eos> And Michael said, "Walk back to my office with me."<eos> On the way back to the office, he said,"What do you think?" I said,"l have no idea." And he said,"Neither do I."<eos> I said,"Well, here's the thing. We have 175 people and we're paying them every day to come to work.
And I'm starving.<eos> Nice to meet you. I'm a Russian dogmonaut.<eos> We kind of got on the ship by accident.<eos> And now, we have no idea where we are.<eos> You're aboard the RRSS, the old Russian Research Space Station.<eos> You want me to show you around?<eos> Follow me.<eos> In this module, we have our garden, where we grow all our food in space.<eos> The added benefit is the plants filter out CO2 gas and produce oxygen.<eos> And we also use them to create fuel for the station.
They're amazing.<eos> They've got such an original quality.<eos> I'll talk to Al first thing in the morning. Oh, no.<eos> You know, I think you're making too much over a little gift the good Lord Jesus gave me.<eos> That's not the only gift He gave you.<eos> You know those clean-cut, churchgoing young men, who are model kids, and good to their neighbors and quote the Bible, and never do a wrong thing, and then one day, for whatever reason, they grab a rifle, go to a tower and pick off everyone in town?<eos> Okay, this is her, but sexually.<eos> She slept with Leo Brockman, never having been to bed with anyone before but her husband, and suddenly, the genie was out of the bottle!<eos> She liked sleeping with Brockman, and she liked sleeping with Brockman's friends, Brockman's acquaintances, Brockman's acquaintances' acquaintances.<eos> Brockman took her photos to Morgenstern. He loved them. He decided to show them in his gallery.
And I think they kind of treated it like, "Well, that's his world.<eos> "We don't understand it, but that's what he does."<eos> He was open for anything, really.<eos> Yeah, I have had a good job.<eos> I've had a good job.<eos> I'm not complaining about every fucking job I had.<eos> I used to work at a lady's shoe store. I liked that.<eos> I got to see this all day long, man. It was great.<eos> Women came in, they'd wear dresses to try on these shoes.<eos> I'm the guy that helped them on with their shoes.
On the walls?<eos> Yeah, I thought you'd like that.<eos> Fuck the motorcycles, the food is what counts!<eos> Get in the car!<eos> What's going on here?<eos> THE BONE MAN<eos> Wait here!<eos> You have the keys?<eos> No.<eos> - Hand them over!
'"We shall have a moment of contemplation."<eos> I think we should hear Mr. Shelley's thoughts on excessive ambition.<eos> Poppy?<eos> "I met a traveller from an antique land<eos> "who said: 2 vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert.<eos> "Near them on the sand, half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies<eos> "whose frown and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command<eos> "tell that its sculptor well those passions read<eos> "which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,<eos> "the hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.
Go ahead.<eos> So I walked up to him, said, "Good to see you again, Chavez.<eos> You're coming with me."<eos> He said, "just you?"<eos> And I said, "just me."<eos> Uh, just to be clear.<eos> Are we talking about the quick shop on las palmas or on princeton?<eos> What's the difference?<eos> Let's say, for example, that you'd like a bag of funyuns. Gonna have to go to Las Palmas.<eos> - Princeton doesn't stock them.
Honey, the last time this city had an arsonist was so long ago<eos> I was still on the big red truck.<eos> Because, back in the day you were a fireman. And those vandals set fires that took the lives of two of your colleagues.<eos> Died fighting the Renkel fires of '98, set by a bunch of vandals.<eos> I served side by side with those firemen for years.<eos> They had families.<eos> You're right.<eos> They did.<eos> So you left the department and took a job inspecting buildings for code violations and you discovered those are pretty good places to hide a body.<eos> So you stalked and killed your victims, you covered them with lye and you plugged them into walls.
Shawn, what are you doing home from school?<eos> Uh...<eos> Uh, well, at the assembly today there was a guy and he hypnotized some students.<eos> And one of them thought he was a kangaroo and he punched the guy and he passed out before he could put the kids back to normal.<eos> Uh, but luckily Mr. Detmer, an ex-Navy SEAL, put everyone back before six kids had to go to the hospital.<eos> Let me see the suspension note from the teacher.<eos> How did you know?<eos> Kid, I got a nickname at work, it's the Human Lie Detector.<eos> I spend my day analyzing lies and the people who tell them.
Oh man, everything is going to be okay.<eos> Bullhorn, Cream Corn here says that he can help us find the cats we looking for.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Man, I think we should put our act together!<eos> They broke.. into my home!<eos> They got.. the ledger, they got the manifest, they got everything!<eos> - Names, dates, and schedules<eos> - We even got the shipping routes.<eos> Man, they ain't gonna be able to take a shit without us knowing when and what color.<eos> We cleaned up the streets and gave them back to the people, once again making them a pleasant place to take an afternoon stroll.
She was really calm.<eos> I think that's a good sign.<eos> So they don't ever actually do it? - No.<eos> No, it's just talk.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Do you follow up?<eos> I mean no, nothing good's gonna come of that, but..<eos> I wouldn't worry about it.<eos> This is what we do, Natalie.<eos> We take people at their most fragile and we set them adrift.
It was an accident.<eos> It can't be.<eos> It can't be!<eos> Dad!<eos> Lοok!<eos> Why did you lie?<eos> Ηow can i eνer trust yοu again?<eos> Ηow did I fall out οf the windοw?<eos> Τhe dοctors said it was because I tοok tοo many pills.<eos> Yοu toοk them already.
Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune<eos> There he is.<eos> I had him in view.<eos> I was feeling over the edge into a dive.<eos> He saw me when I moved in for the kill.<eos> Is that how you remember it, Maverick?<eos> - Is this Top Gun?<eos> - Not pretty sure.<eos> The rules of engagement are not flexible, Maverick.<eos> They are there for your safety you will obey them, is that clear?
Private contractor recommended to us by Senator Boxbaum.<eos> He's been vetted at the highest level.<eos> I'll let him tell you what he does.<eos> Hi, so, what I do is I work with an extraordinary young woman.<eos> She's not a law enforcement officer.<eos> She's not an undercover agent.<eos> She's just a girl.<eos> And she's going to help us.<eos> Her name is Esther Carpenter, and she knows these people.<eos> She knows them like she knows herself.
Even if you make it past all the shields and guards,<eos> Darken Rahl has an uncanny ability to sense when things are awry.<eos> Lord Rahl, Mistress Denna has sent word by Journey Book. She'll arrive by nightfall tomorrow with the Third Box of Orden.<eos> Tell her she'll be greeted with the strumming of harps and the blast of trumpets.<eos> You doubt her, My Lord?<eos> I doubt the very sun at noon, Egremont.<eos> Zedd, Kahlan, we have the boxes!<eos> Thank the Spirits.<eos> I was caught in the room with Rahl. I was this close to him.<eos> He picked up the boxes. He held them, he caressed them.
But I've showed you I can fight, I can track. I can be trusted.<eos> I am beginning to trust you, Dunn.<eos> I'm afraid we've run out of Whisperers.<eos> - Sir?<eos> - Relax, Dunn.<eos> A shipment's on its way from D'Hara, should arrive tomorrow.<eos> Isn't it too dangerous taking the weapons through rebel territory?<eos> That's why they're being transported at night.<eos> But even at night the open roads can be dangerous.<eos> The rebels will never see them.
We really should get going.<eos> This is a very bad idea.<eos> - What if you lose control?<eos> - I can control myself.<eos> The question is, can you?<eos> You know what, you're right.<eos> This is a very bad idea.<eos> I was coming to see if you were all right.<eos> I thought you were filling the water skins.<eos> I seem to have left them behind at the lake.
It described a lost form of magic.<eos> A kind that could only be mastered by someone like me.<eos> A painter. An artist.<eos> You learned magic?<eos> The book showed me how I could create my own world.<eos> Anything that I paint on the outside is sent here to this place inside my painting.<eos> That's where we are right now.<eos> Inside the painting.<eos> You see those hills?<eos> I found them on a farm outside of Dorn. And the forest?
She came through here.<eos> She didn't have the boxes when she was caught, so she must have hidden them somewhere between here and the cottage.<eos> Where are they, Jennsen?<eos> What did you do with them?<eos> - They were going to catch me.<eos> - Yes, they were going to catch you.<eos> You didn't have much time.<eos> You had to hurry. But you had to get rid of the boxes.<eos> Where did you hide them?<eos> I threw them in the lake.
What did you do with them?<eos> - They were going to catch me.<eos> - Yes, they were going to catch you.<eos> You didn't have much time.<eos> You had to hurry. But you had to get rid of the boxes.<eos> Where did you hide them?<eos> I threw them in the lake.<eos> Alert the nearest garrison. - Send a quad to the lake, now.<eos> - My Lord.<eos> You threw them in the lake, didn't you?
That he's a great hero and he was right about me.<eos> You tell him that I captured you and I tortured you, but you would not tell me where the boxes were.<eos> Tell him that you stole the cure from me, and you finally escaped and then you ran back to him.<eos> But I took the boxes from him.<eos> From everything you've told me, it doesn't sound like he'd forgive me for that.<eos> Jennsen, I know our brother.<eos> As long as you pretend to be on his side and not mine, he won't hurt you.<eos> All you need to remember is that he simply wants to be loved.<eos> Tell him whatever lies about me you have to.<eos> You tell him I know he has the boxes and I'm coming for them.
I was asleep in my bed when those D'Haran animals broke in.<eos> They took me and my youngest, Mariel.<eos> She's only 8.<eos> She's here?<eos> Oh, she's in another temple.<eos> She's undergoing the Trials.<eos> If she lives through them, they'll turn her into a Mord-Sith.<eos> But she's only a child.<eos> That's how they create these monsters.<eos> They kidnap young girls from their families, punish them mercilessly until there's not a shred of kindness left in them.
What do you mean?<eos> I mean, what if you kill Rahl?<eos> It would all be over.<eos> The magic hold he has over his forces would be gone.<eos> Some people might fight for a while, but most would wake up, go back to their lives, to their families.<eos> So could you.<eos> I have no family left.<eos> You could find somebody to start one with.<eos> That's not him.<eos> His hands aren't holding the reins, they're tied to them.
Do it now.<eos> You're so little.<eos> Do you know how much I want you to stay?<eos> Please stay.<eos> Madeline, you can't will a baby back to I life.<eos> It's Grace.<eos> Her name is Grace. Did you put those photos aside?<eos> Vivian on phone- Did you put those photos aside?<eos> Madeline: It's been hard packing his things, Vivian. I'm sorry.<eos> Vivian: I can stop by today if you'd just put them in a box for me.
Fuck off, you old bastard!<eos> Show some respect!<eos> Fuck off!<eos> I'm not afraid of you!<eos> Look at all Mum's jewellery.<eos> It's her mum's stuff and her mum's mum's.<eos> Must be worth a small fortune.<eos> This is the world that we live in!<eos> Makes me fucking mad, right!<eos> They take innocent people, torture them and then they film it.
What did you have in mind?<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> A short three-and-a-half hour drive away is a strip club called Avarice.<eos> You know what, I'm sorry, let me back that up.<eos> This isn't just some strip club.<eos> This is the Super Bowl of carnal pleasures.<eos> We've been to strip clubs before.<eos> Not like this one, dude.<eos> First time I got a lap dance there the stripper grabs my hands and puts them on her tits.
Okay.<eos> Take a look.<eos> The Grimaldi Crater?<eos> Nice work, kiddo.<eos> I wanna see the man in the Moon.<eos> There's no stupid man in the Moon.<eos> It's a story Mom made up.<eos> Hey, Jake, let her look.<eos> I told your mom those stories, and I didn't make them up.
Sam will be OK.<eos> Sam, you must be strong.<eos> I only ...<eos> We need to see a hospital to come.<eos> Keys.<eos> - What?<eos> Keys.<eos> - What happened to the keys.<eos> The keys to the car.<eos> I've left them in the trunk.
Hi, everyone.<eos> Oh my God, Aunt Betty!<eos> Surprise, darlin'.<eos> It's so good to see you.<eos> Aunt Jane and I just drove in from Seattle.<eos> Oh, Aunt, thank you, it's so sweet of you to do this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ooh, it's a onesies.<eos> Just what I needed.<eos> We all decorated them.
You know, I'm not a car guy.<eos> If I can go in there and steal a condo for the equivalent of what a Mercedes would cost or a Bentley would cost, I'm all about that.<eos> Meet Peter Zalewski, Florida's up-and-coming real estate whiz.<eos> Here we go.<eos> He calls his real estate company Condo Vultures.<eos> We have a very good sign.<eos> You have the final notice of eviction.<eos> So you can see this person was basically thrown out by the police department.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Peter deals exclusively with clients who buy up foreclosed homes and then resell them at a profit.
Yes we did!<eos> The average package for each worker will be very close to $6,000.<eos> But this is about more than just money.<eos> It's about what can be achieved when workers organize and stand up for justice.<eos> Just to fight-- fight fight fight fight fight just to get the most basic thing that people should take for granted and that's legally theirs.<eos> We just fight so hard just for the most basic things in life.<eos> It's a fight we knew all too well in Flint, Michigan.<eos> For it was here that my uncle and his fellow workers first brought down the mighty corporate interests that dominated their lives.<eos> It was the day before New Year's Eve in 1936.<eos> Hundreds of men and women took over the GM factories in Flint and occupied them for 44 days.
There's gotta be a Denny's out there someplace.<eos> Grand Slam?<eos> Hot shower?<eos> A bed?<eos> -Separate rooms.<eos> -Yeah, that's a given.<eos> What the hell?<eos> The battery's dead.<eos> Jesse, back when I asked you to put the keys in a safe place where did you put them?<eos> -I left them right here in the ignition.
At this time, I estimate a 27% chance that your family will remain in Eureka.<eos> Hello, Sheriff Carter.<eos> Zoe, we need to talk.<eos> Yeah, whatever.<eos> Look, I know that you're upset about having to leave Eureka but this has gone way too far.<eos> What has?<eos> I know about the emails you sent Dr. Fielding.<eos> - What emails?<eos> - We traced them.<eos> You sent them from here, and I know about the online research you did on gravity.
I need you to be specific.<eos> Feel any better in that home of yours under the waves?<eos> But, Definitely feels different.<eos> And I, Know you don`t talk down there, - You sing.<eos> Yes, Singing travels by under water.<eos> What about the cold?<eos> You get used to it.<eos> Oh, Of course you have a sealcoat don`t you ?<eos> Mine sealcoat?<eos> Look, There is no point of being around the bush. - I, Do know these things, I , Have been studying them.
- I did.<eos> How did you catch them ?<eos> - Trouling. And you expect us to believe that?<eos> - No, But it is the truth.<eos> Show us your gear nets.<eos> Hold on.<eos> That`s not wet.<eos> - I know.<eos> So, how did you dry them?<eos> - I didn`t. I told you, I didn`t use them.
Yes, once.<eos> Look, Sonia, you can ramble whatever you wanton women's rights, but I already have my own opinion.<eos> I know that in the end every woman wants to get married, have kids and a man to give her orders and set limits.<eos> Oh Boogie, how can you say such absurd things?<eos> Have you got a light?<eos> Many women love things to be forbidden to them, like smoking, drinking or low-necked dresses.<eos> They must be stupid women.<eos> Just as there are stupid men, there are stupid women.<eos> I asked for a light.<eos> Women want men who treat them like dirt, with a firm hand, and even... beat them.
And don't forget to return my money.<eos> You both should pay me for sparing your lives.<eos> Don't let me down this time.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> It's one of the silliest things I've ever seen.<eos> What?<eos> Testify against Calabria.<eos> Nothing worse than a woman scorned.<eos> That's why I think women are like Kleenex, you know,<eos> ONCE you USG them, you throw them away.
Get outside!<eos> Out!<eos> Go on!<eos> Get out there!<eos> Fucking move it!<eos> He's with Pincho and Releches.<eos> Trouble. Those two do anything Malamadre says.<eos> Come on, damn it!<eos> And the cameras in the basement?<eos> They've smashed them all.
Sleeping won't help you feel better.<eos> This might.<eos> - I don't want to...<eos> - We should try.<eos> Remember, I'm still here with you.<eos> All right.<eos> What is it?<eos> I feel like I'm invading her privacy.<eos> She's remembering all these moments that she's that she's had with me.<eos> Well, sometimes people hide disturbing thoughts or emotions with ones that calm them.
Even down to the fact Louise Pennel was forced to eat her own shit!<eos> And if that wasn't enough, full details of Sharon Bilkin's murder!<eos> But I didn't discuss it with him!<eos> Talk about sleeping with the enemy!<eos> I bloody warned you!<eos> It's beyond belief.<eos> How could you be so stupid?<eos> You're investigating a brutal murder.<eos> You're a detective.<eos> You know the rules and you've broken them.
No.<eos> What about this girl?<eos> Her name's Sharon Bilkin.<eos> No.<eos> Where were you on the 15th of June?<eos> Gosh, um...here, probably.<eos> What's this about?<eos> Both these girls were murdered.<eos> Miss Wickenham, will you have a look at these photographs, please?<eos> I don't know them. They look the type.
Girls listening to music in a car aren't dangerous.<eos> Why not search the car?<eos> These girls transport drugs in this neighbourhood.<eos> We'll give them the benefit of the doubt tonite.<eos> - Know how to drive?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Then leave.<eos> - But I don't have a licence.<eos> Leave!<eos> Shit, he let them go.
Pursue them?<eos> No, too dangeours, there are soldiers everywhere.<eos> Stay attentive anyway.<eos> Understood.<eos> Follow the instructions that were given.<eos> And where will it take us?<eos> There's always a law dog somewhere close, watching.<eos> Yes, it was you who promised me things would change.<eos> That there would always be some fool to enforce the law.<eos> Laws are not evil, the people who enforce them are.
Look at how well we're using our time, how well we've adjusted.<eos> I think we're doing pretty well.<eos> Those aren't my earrings, Daryl.<eos> Whose are they?<eos> Um, I don't know.<eos> Have you brought girls here?<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> Well, if you did, I'd like you to say yes.<eos> We were allowed to.<eos> Like, your parents met them?
Walter?<eos> Olivia.<eos> I want answers, John.<eos> There he is.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Conrad.<eos> He's a monster, Liv.<eos> Capable of creating horrible things weapons which he does for no other reason than because he can.<eos> Because he's curious.<eos> And he sells them to the highest bidder.
No.<eos> This was years ago when I was living in Ohio.<eos> John Mark and John David.<eos> Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?<eos> I guess I have.<eos> All right, who's next?<eos> Where's Andy?<eos> He's on one of his honeymoons.<eos> What?<eos> He made nonrefundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time.
You've cheered up, just talking about her.<eos> Well, I am drawn to her, yeah.<eos> But after last year and Laura, I... I don't think I'm gonna fall in love with another patient for a while.<eos> Oh, is that a relief!<eos> But is she in love with you?<eos> Is that why you mentioned her?<eos> No, I mentioned her because... we're talking about things that I need.<eos> I need... a woman.<eos> - For sex?<eos> - Is that what women think that men... really think that they want them just for sex?
And how did you respond to that?<eos> I told her if I wanted somebody yelling at me all the time, I would've stayed married to Bess.<eos> That went over real well.<eos> You know, at first, Nina was a lot of fun.<eos> I could come home at the end of the day and just relax with her.<eos> Then, all of a sudden, she started scrutinizing my every move, marshalling evidence against me.<eos> I don't know, Paul.<eos> Why do I keep choosing these crazy women?<eos> I'm not so sure, Luke, that it's the women who are crazy.<eos> I think it's the position that you're putting them in.
So, you figured that Connie wouldn't just drop her off, she'd wait at the airport for a while. So you would have enough time.<eos> I, I wanted - - Natalie up in the air, as far away from this as possible, and<eos> Connie was just supposed to come home and find me asleep.<eos> "A millionaire's death."<eos> You know what that means?<eos> Yes. I think I heard my father use that expression.<eos> Yeah, mine too.<eos> You go to bed one night... and you don't wake up.<eos> Just close your eyes.<eos> I took the pills... chased them down... took a few more.
What happens if you don't send it?<eos> They have a preliminary hearing next week.<eos> The judge... He could just throw the whole case out.<eos> But if he doesn't, it might go to trial with a jury, in which case I will lose big time.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - The lawyer says that's what juries do.<eos> He says everybody hates therapists.<eos> They do?<eos> According to this guy, therapy is bullshit.<eos> He says people go into treatment hoping that the therapist is gonna fix them.
They're being sued, Paul, just like you.<eos> That doesn't mean they're guilty.<eos> And how long have you been doing that?<eos> 17 years.<eos> How often do you call in sick?<eos> Since I got there?<eos> Five days, four.<eos> In 17 years?<eos> And vacations?<eos> You don't lose the weeks if you don't take them.
- What's it supposed to say instead?<eos> - It should say booze.<eos> Speaking of booze, I could really use some now.<eos> - I know grannie's got some.<eos> - She does?<eos> Yes?<eos> Do you want me to mix it with something?<eos> No. No.<eos> In that box on the back of the snowmobile you'll find some pills.<eos> Could you bring them?
No one's arguing with you, dude.<eos> I got your text. How bad is--?<eos> Oi.<eos> Forget the robot. What happened to you?<eos> - He slipped and fell.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I slipped and fell.<eos> In the bathroom.<eos> Bounced right off the tub.<eos> Now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don't treat them with respect.
Oh,yeah?<eos> What you in for,Doug Benson?<eos> Let-Let me guess.<eos> You,uh... You steal a cell phone at the mall?<eos> Or some 15-year-old girl?<eos> No.<eos> Jaywalking.<eos> That it,punk?<eos> I killed three people.<eos> I stabbed them to death.
And if Jenna was carrying Suzanne at the time...<eos> H... think we got something.<eos> So if we already have the victim's blood, what are we looking for?<eos> We're looking for gravity, Kyle.<eos> You see these edges?<eos> ey're irregular.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> That means... we just found oukiller.<eos> Jenna, did Suzanne discover your pills on the plane?<eos> She came back when I was unloading them.
It was raining.<eos> It's a coincidence.<eos> Nothing he said made sense.<eos> Well, maybe he saw something.<eos> - Like himself killing her ?<eos> - Galton said Pete's not violent.<eos> That guy's a spin doctor for the mentally ill.<eos> Look, doer or not, Pete's a sick, scared kid who needs his meds.<eos> And we need answers about Julie.<eos> I think this kid could have them.
Well, that was the good part.<eos> The bad side effect was heart Num.2.<eos> I mean, theoretically, if you take a hypodermic syringe, filled with 19 different stem cells, you inject it directly into an organ, there's a chance it can overload.<eos> The stem cells could, uh, replicate too quickly.<eos> I think he force-fed the stem cells to the extent that it generated a whole, new heart.<eos> Okay.<eos> Templeton gave him the HGH.<eos> - Maybe he gave him the stem cells as well?<eos> - Yeah, but you don't just walk into Wal-Mart and order yourself a batch of stem cells, even if you're a doctor.<eos> Then where did Lowell get them from?
Both of your stem cells were stored at the same place, correct?<eos> Then it's very possible that Grace's were stolen as well.<eos> Why? For what?<eos> I mean, who would do something like that?<eos> Well, I'd say someone who was very sick who obviously doesn't care about you.<eos> "Someone sick."<eos> Well, so is my sister.<eos> They said the chemo did so much damage to her immune system that without a transfer she isn't going to make it.<eos> Well, that's why we're here.<eos> We're going to find whoever it was stole your stem cells and get them back.
Ben Tillman?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Eli James.<eos> You broke into my friend's store last night. You kind of scared the hell out of her.<eos> I didn't break in.<eos> The door was open.<eos> That begs the question, what were you doing there in the first place?<eos> Well, best I can remember, I was working in one of the run-off drains by the river,<eos> And all of a sudden, these lights Started flickering on and off in the tunnels.<eos> So you followed them?
He really cared about me.<eos> You know?<eos> And he didn't want anything from me, and... I had never had that before.<eos> Is that true?<eos> I think you had that before.<eos> But they left you, When you were really young.<eos> This all started after your parents died, right?<eos> There were foster homes and schools I couldn't finish, And...<eos> I just learned to fight for things.<eos> And then, I guess, just to take them.
Ned!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Were you raised by wolves?<eos> It's ok. I'm showing it off. I like it.<eos> Ok,then let me make a note of that for the dressmaker.<eos> Ned,how's the study group?<eos> We're studying, but technically we're not a group yet.<eos> Oh, Serena's not here yet?<eos> Late,as usual.<eos> I swear,I left plenty of time, But my keys,they got locked in the car, And I put them in my bag, so it wasn't my fault this time.
Quicker and more effective to just ignore her and let her come to us.<eos> That's very astute psychology, lisbon.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> Hey,why'd you give her my name?<eos> She said i was gonna kneel before the lord of beasts. What does that even mean?<eos> What?<eos> Oh,come on.<eos> You're not telling me you believe she's an actual witch.<eos> No,of course not.<eos> But i mean, if dark forces did exist, It stands to reason there could be people who control them for their own ends.
That's... "Agent" Palmer.<eos> Is there anybody here?<eos> Pot roast looks a little well done.<eos> Prime rib...<eos> Madeira.<eos> Fire department says it's been cooking for hours.<eos> I guess we know Renny wasn't expecting company.<eos> Well, he got it anyway.<eos> Point of entry was from here.<eos> There were security bars, but it appears Renny removed them.
Gilbert and Sullivan.<eos> Opera doesn't exactly translate to barbershop quartet.<eos> Of course, you would know that, being a lover of opera.<eos> And you a lover of thearbehop quartet?<eos> It was college. I was a tenor.<eos> We were known as the PB Js.<eos> I wasoneoftheJs.<eos> Yeah, really?<eos> Yeah, we modeled our look after the Dapper Dans of Disneyland.<eos> We had the, uh... the vests, the sleeve garters. Yeah, the-the straw boater hats. Still have them at home.
It's a good guess.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Mascara was applied thick and fast.<eos> See where some got in her eye?<eos> Normally that would cause tearing.<eos> The mascara would run.<eos> There's no smudge here.<eos> What does that tell you?<eos> The victims were paralyzed or dead when they were made up.<eos> That's pretty sick, doll them up like call girls and dump them in graves.
Oh, sure.<eos> Reach for the stars.<eos> Hey, Charlie, how's it going?<eos> Boy, you really blew it this time.<eos> Did I now?<eos> How so?<eos> I've fallen in love with Chelsea.<eos> Ooh, my bad.<eos> Damn right, your bad.<eos> There were plenty of medications that would've turned me into a happy little potato, but would you prescribe them?
From me, personally.<eos> I'll make sure we get convictions. In every interrogation.<eos> I really appreciate this, Sir.<eos> Dead men triple raped women, and there's no police raids.<eos> Besides, what city doesn't have both dead men and women?<eos> Problem is, that new cop is more interested in dead women than men.<eos> Reverse sexism, dude.<eos> But the dead men are always armed.<eos> They're mostly dealers, right? And they get shot in the crossfire.<eos> But not the dead women. They take them so they can screw them.
I'm listening...<eos> The Sultan and the Cheros.<eos> It's true.<eos> The evidence is flimsy. They may or may not have murdered women.<eos> And there are several others.<eos> Several?<eos> These deaths won't stop because a serial killer is still on the loose.<eos> A murderer with a fixed method.<eos> Maybe, and this is just a hypothesis, he captures his victims every full moon... and stores them in a basement, in an industrial freezer.<eos> Then, after a few months, he throws them into the desert.
If you spoil your paper, intentionally or accidentally... .. you'll be disqualified.<eos> Is anyone certain they know what his definition of spoiling is?<eos> Look, let's crack this.<eos> Throw out some ideas.<eos> What if the questions are hidden in the paper, but each of us has to write a different answer?<eos> He said...<eos> There's one question before you, and one answer is required.<eos> That doesn't mean it's the same question for each of us.<eos> There could be eight different questions and answers.<eos> If we find one question, we can find them all.
Brown, don't do this!<eos> There must be another way!<eos> We need certainty. The kind only unbearable pain can give...<eos> I've told you everything I know!<eos> Please stop!<eos> .. or the threat of it.<eos> She's telling the truth.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Here.<eos> You wanted convulsions - now you've got them.
Bob? Can I have a word?<eos> Been around all this a long time, haven't you? Ripper?<eos> Mm, too bloody long.<eos> In deep, aren't you? Eats me up, yeah.<eos> Same for a lot of the lads.<eos> That's not a crime, is it?<eos> No.<eos> You must have your own theories.<eos> Oh, I do, yeah.<eos> So why don't you share them?
I'll just have some water... still. Low salinity.<eos> - I think Filippo's nice.<eos> - He's read your book. All of it.<eos> Really?<eos> I told you he was nice.<eos> He says it's true what you say.<eos> You say people grow up when they realize everything must end.<eos> They start to betray their friends, loved ones and so on.<eos> You grow up and get worse, a bit like going off.<eos> I don't say those things. The character thinks them.
you left him do your parenting?<eos> Hey, you're the one who told me to get creative.<eos> this wasn't what I meant!<eos> Easy for you to say.<eos> They told me they Love you more than me.<eos> When I was running things, they said they loved you more.<eos> Really?<eos> So don't get your feelings hurt, And stop asking strangers to discipline our kids.<eos> Well, I wouldn't have to if you would do it.<eos> So you want me to go to work all day, go out on business trips, And what little time I have here with the girls, You want me to spend screaming at them?
Go ahead,susan.<eos> What are your four words for edie?<eos> One of a kind.<eos> now it's time.<eos> and that is how wisteria lane came to be my final resting place.<eos> My ashes were spread over grass I had once walked on... beneath trees that had once given me shade... on top of roses I once admired... and beside fences I once gossiped over.<eos> And after my friends had finished saying good-bye, a wind came along and took what was left of me into the air.<eos> as I looked down on the world,I began to let go of it.<eos> I let go of white picket fences and cars in driveways, coffee cups and vacuum cleaners.<eos> I let go of all those things which seem so ordinary, but when you put them together,they make up a life... a life that really was one of a kind.
Wait, if Chuck is really in trouble, Then we need to help him.<eos> He doesn't have any brothers and sisters.<eos> - We are all he has.<eos> You are all he has.<eos> - He doesn't want my help.<eos> - Oh, hello.<eos> Please take my jacket.<eos> - So that's just it?<eos> You're gonna abandon him for a bunch of society matrons?<eos> Those matrons, as you call them, are helping me build a life.
Well, we'll see.<eos> You cannot be this short-sighted.<eos> If word gets out about this, you'll be expelled. Miss Carr will be fired for good.<eos> Well, Miss Carr is the one who sent me the key. So presumably, she understands that risk And she's making her own decision.<eos> However grown-up you think you are, You're still in high school.<eos> I care about Rachel, all right?<eos> And I'm 18.<eos> So with all due respect, I think I'll decide who I see.<eos> Oh, do go on, newland. I do love your descriptions.<eos> Well, why shouldn't we make them real?
Wait, what are you talking about?<eos> We broke up.<eos> Oh, Marco, I'm so sorry.<eos> What happened?<eos> We were having different fights.<eos> I thought we were fighting about a cafe, and he thought we were fighting about the future of our entire relationship.<eos> How did it spiral into that?<eos> We should have had his fight months ago. Back then it would have been small and manageable, and we would have made up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Things get a little hot when you leave them in the pressure cooker.
- Hussy.<eos> - Jezebel.<eos> Tart.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> What?<eos> You can't be dressed like a cat.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I told you that I was gonna be a cat.<eos> She spent a long time making those ears.<eos> I don't know why you made them.
But I'm done.<eos> Give it time.<eos> You'd be surprised how a prison cell inspires cooperation.<eos> Do you really think Prescott would want that?<eos> He was about to throw his whole life over for you.<eos> Okay, listen.<eos> You just need a few big fish, right?<eos> Big fish make big careers.<eos> I have a book detailing over 10 years worth of mob hits.<eos> Who ordered them, how much they got paid.
Silvia Mallick.<eos> She's a graduate student at WLVU.<eos> She was studying criminal pathology, and she was one of my students.<eos> I'm leaving the university.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, an opportunity came up.<eos> It's not something I was looking for or even anything... I expected.<eos> But you're my thesis advisor, - and I've been working up some really great ideas for possible topics.<eos> - Yes, I know.<eos> You haven't even heard them yet.
Barnard attributed all of these other injuries to the fall after the attack.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> A 90-year-old man may have bones like eggshells, but he can't possibly fall on his left side and his right side at the same time.<eos> Logic dictates that the thoracic injuries were sustained prior to the head blow.<eos> Beaten, then killed.<eos> You couldn't get away with this quality of work today.<eos> Hey.<eos> I dug up the original ME's notes.<eos> And what did the good doctor have to say about the hairline fractures to the femur and the tibia?<eos> He described them as age-related, osteoporotic degeneration.
There's something. Looks like it's tapping into one of the conduits.<eos> Where are you, exactly?<eos> Radio traffic control, let them know we're on schedule.<eos> Might get in early if this tailwind keeps up.<eos> Parker, the device you found, is, is it anywhere near an orange box?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> They tapped into the black box.<eos> No, no, it's not black, it's orange.<eos> Yeah, the black boxes, they're orange, makes them easier to find in the debris.
I know.<eos> Is that you, Gwen?<eos> Right, then.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> Good luck.<eos> No, don't do that. I hate smileys.<eos> Took me a while to get used to those things.<eos> - What?<eos> You've used the lenses? - Yeah.<eos> That's why Gwen had them.
Is that you, Gwen?<eos> Right, then.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> Good luck.<eos> No, don't do that. I hate smileys.<eos> Took me a while to get used to those things.<eos> - What?<eos> You've used the lenses? - Yeah.<eos> That's why Gwen had them.<eos> I only took them home for a bit of fun.
How you been?<eos> Great, thanks.<eos> Listen, settle a bet. Behind that smile you're dying, right?<eos> Behind this smile is a bigger smile trying to get out.<eos> Oh, oh, here it comes!<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Please! You got to have some secret agony!<eos> I bet those fancy shoes hurt your feet.<eos> No, actually they're like two leather clouds.<eos> Oh! Got them from a buddy of mine with a store in Shelbyville.
-Here.<eos> What's this?<eos> It's the tapes from all the games l've been taping over the season.<eos> See you around.<eos> I mean, it's a federal offense.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> You can't sell your prescriptions.<eos> You just can't. They're yours.<eos> Okay?<eos> You take them for a reason.
I'm not.<eos> Fuck no!<eos> I mean, I'm the fucking treasurer of the Student Union.<eos> I got you that job, man.<eos> - SHUT UP!<eos> - So fine, right? Whatever.<eos> There's no judgement.<eos> but I mean, for real, we don't do shit to make that school better.<eos> So Leon thinks that by forming this union, that it'll force us to kind of all get involved and we will make things better.<eos> OK, he thinks that things have a better chance of improving if we improve them ourselves.
Her DNA markers don't match her original profile.<eos> They don't match any profile.<eos> I'm so sorry, Jo.<eos> I still can't believe that's you in there.<eos> Yeah, trust me, it's her.<eos> Just fix me and all's forgiven.<eos> We're working on it.<eos> Transfiguration process must have caused her DNA to decompose.<eos> It's like her cells are misfiring.<eos> So, if we can't restart them again, then...
Oh, good morning.<eos> So son, any nice-looking girls there last night?<eos> - Yeah, did you get any pussy?<eos> - Zachary!<eos> You need to use a different language, young man!<eos> Yes, mom.<eos> Hizole consigue cono?<eos> Did you get to bump into any big jugs?<eos> Stop it!<eos> Back in my day, we called them melons.
Ooh,you want some?<eos> He left a little.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> - Diet mountain dew.<eos> - We don't have much time.<eos> Shall we donour bunny suits?<eos> You know,if you're shy,we can break into the ladies'changing room just up the hall.<eos> Oh,we can do this.<eos> Past a certain point in a clearance facility,you stop seeing security cameras.<eos> Lowly security guards don't have the clearance to see what's on the cameras, so there's no one to monitor them.
It's usually as bad as this.<eos> People normally just stop by and pick someone up and then head on down the beach.<eos> Yeah. It's pretty wild out there.<eos> I'm surprised the cops don't break it up.<eos> Is it always like that?<eos> Since the war ended.<eos> It's pretty great actually. It's kind of pagan.<eos> I'm Jim.<eos> I'm George.<eos> Pleased to meet you Jim. I'm sorry, I'm supposed to meet some friends but I can't find them.
Listen, I don't think I need to apologize for drinking. I need to apologize maybe for not drinking.<eos> Maybe I'm a bigger bastard sober than I am drunk, huh?<eos> If this is you sober, hell, yeah. Thank you, Marcy.<eos> I have to say, I'm a little disappointed in you, Tom.<eos> I thought you'd set a better example for Jack here.<eos> I'm sure he has a few people he'd like to say sorry to.<eos> More than a few.<eos> Maybe they've had to shoulder some of his responsibilities. Maybe he's burdened them in some way.<eos> Jack, look at me.<eos> I want you to take this pad and write a list of all these people and go away and call them, apologize to them, relieve them of their burdens and yours.
Ooh, thank you so much.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Bless us, O Lord, for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from your bounty through Christ our Lord, amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> So who was on the phone?<eos> That was Miss Bliss.<eos> Who?<eos> Miss Bliss, my theater teacher.<eos> She said that all the other girls were more experienced.<eos> I'll get them.
I don't know, but I've seen her.<eos> - Where? - Dr. Sherman's office.<eos> - The shrink from the list?<eos> - I think she was a patient there.<eos> Probably the one we were looking for.<eos> {\These people, }They tried to kill us, they have a picture of this girl. It means something.<eos> We all know where we're going, so let's just go.<eos> All right, everyone.<eos> Go to your Learn-a-word program.<eos> I'm gonna give you ten new words. You'll put them in the search box. And then...
The treatment that I gave you about the screenplay that I was gonna write!<eos> With the, with the talk show host who falls for the cop, who, who gets involved in a murder plot.<eos> I believe, if I remember right, you said it was a terrible idea.<eos> I think your exact words were contrived, boring, unsellable?<eos> Right. That jumble of ideas that you gave me?<eos> - The treatment, yes.<eos> - Oh, Alice. In no universe would that mish-mash of ideas be considered a sellable treatment, and for your information, I've been working on a screenplay of my own for the last couple of months and if it happens to bear some ressemblance to something that your jotted down then it's pure coincidence.<eos> - Oh my god!<eos> - It happens all the time in Hollywood.<eos> Where people steal their friends' ideas and then they sell them off as their own.
To them it looks like you quit!<eos> Which is a little detrimental to our client that you got fired<eos> Right, I forgot.<eos> A jury is just 12 people too stupid to get out of jury duty, incapable of parsing distinctions Incapable of thinking for themselves.<eos> You know what you sound like Eli?<eos> A trial attorney trying to win<eos> Baywest Media: sorry Sam that story is just gonna go right over the public's head<eos> Sorry Sam, but they're just not going to understand that, sorry Sam it's just too darn confusing Sam<eos> I have a theory... you could say I'd bet my whole career on it<eos> I think people are only as dumb as we treat them
You're really serious about this?<eos> It just feels really right to me.<eos> You know, I don't know when another opportunity like this might come along.<eos> What about the gallery?<eos> I can work from New York.<eos> I'll probably have to be there half of the time anyway.<eos> And our friends?<eos> I love our friends.<eos> I love them a lot, but, you know, at a certain point I have to trust they're like a family.<eos> You know? And just because we leave L.A., doesn't mean that we're leaving them.
Don't suck your teeth at me. man.<eos> Don't suck your teeth at me!<eos> Don't suck your teeth at me!<eos> - Don't give me no reason to suck them and I won't suck them!<eos> - Once he realizes not to suck his teeth at me. you know. we can have a nice conversation. and be boys and stuff.<eos> But it could have got really ugly.<eos> And I don't like it when motherfuckers suck their teeth at me. man!<eos> So don't be sucking your teeth at me.<eos> - I don't like sucking them. you know what I mean?<eos> When I sucked them.
- So?<eos> We're surrounded by police.<eos> I'll go to prison.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - But you were right, it's not about the money, I only steal things for the adventure, and today, with you, I want more days like this.<eos> I want every day to be like this.<eos> We're made for each other, you said so yourself.<eos> The perfect team.<eos> Why not?<eos> People have travelled with me and I've lost them.
They moved back a year ago. That explains the eight-year break between attacks.<eos> I got something we can use in court.<eos> I was able to sequence the worm DNA.<eos> The exact genus and species is from Brazil. This might be just a coincidence, but Colin Clark was in Brazil a month ago scouting locations for a new club.<eos> The worms will put him at the scene of the crime...<eos> But, without his blood, we can't link him to the worms. But we can link Colin to Marie.<eos> Find her.<eos> Colin loves me.<eos> Marie, Colin terrorises his victims.<eos> After he rapes them, he watches them bathe, then stays in their apartment.
The temperature of the water Lisa was in makes it impossible to determine an exact time of death.<eos> He could've shot her before he left and then called it in.<eos> And when he got back, got ahead of the story.<eos> That's how you handle the press.<eos> - And the bomb?<eos> - Sent it to himself.<eos> Then he looks like another victim.<eos> Got way ahead of the story.<eos> What did he do to those two sisters?<eos> Well, he tore them apart on purpose.
I've been going to my meetings<eos> I've been... making progress.<eos> Greg?<eos> Why don't you just try telling us what happened?<eos> It was like... it was like I was outside myself.<eos> It was like when I used to party, but more intense.<eos> I don't know, that guy behind me in line was being such a jerk, and I...<eos> I was so tired, and Troy was... he was grinding my last nerve, and I... don't know. I just... I just lost it.<eos> Mr. Filmore, I've seen a lot of addicts like you.<eos> You get sober just long enough to work your way back into your family, and then you tear them apart all over again.
"Look at me. I'm Linda. I'm making fun of everyone. "<eos> Hey.<eos> You're still awake.<eos> Crazy day. But...<eos> Veronica and I sold so much wrapping paper... not only are you going to Disneyland... but Mickey's gonna be wearing your ears on his head. Oh, wait.<eos> That's a horrifying image.<eos> Everyone at school hates me because I'm beating the disabled girl.<eos> But everybody's equal.<eos> We don't see disabled people.<eos> Well, we see them. We just don't care. Well, we care.

We just don't care. Well, we care.<eos> We just don't treat them differently. Well, they do have their own parking.
Have fun. - See you, Dad.<eos> Dad.<eos> Michael's voice: Hi, you can leave a message for Michael, Thomas or Sarah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, hi, Michael.<eos> It's Lena here.<eos> I just wanted to say thanks for looking after me so well.<eos> And we never really got a chance to say goodbye properly after that mad mad night.<eos> Um, and I wanted to say thanks for your stories.<eos> I was very flattered to get them.
Michael's voice: Hi, you can leave a message for Michael, Thomas or Sarah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, hi, Michael.<eos> It's Lena here.<eos> I just wanted to say thanks for looking after me so well.<eos> And we never really got a chance to say goodbye properly after that mad mad night.<eos> Um, and I wanted to say thanks for your stories.<eos> I was very flattered to get them.<eos> They're great!<eos> And I hope you don't mind, but I showed them to my friend Maurice Fuhrman at a dinner party I had here the other night.
I'm sorry, but...<eos> Let's just go, girls.<eos> Peace.<eos> Out, you all.<eos> Take care.<eos> Lina!<eos> You jealous bitch.<eos> You ratted us out.<eos> It's a good thing you can't touch me, because you could be expelled just like your little home girls.<eos> Don't blame Avery for getting them deported.
There's no other way out.<eos> Floor plan of Commercial Crime Bureau.<eos> What you wanna do?<eos> You said we should stick to our lies.<eos> So how is it, Vin?<eos> How're the chicken feet? Delicious?<eos> Great!<eos> I always tell my colleagues... in the whole police department, no one is as nice to me as you.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> I just passed by the restaurant. Wanna let you try them.
We got on well.<eos> You did well.<eos> What's talking?<eos> You got Several hot girls.<eos> Most were ugly, pie-faced mixed, but they were good.<eos> I had some yes, but they were lovers ...<eos> - No cases were of a night.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - You do not have respect for women. - I do not have respect for?<eos> I treat them like ladies.
The problem with all polygraph tests is false positives.<eos> Innocent people can fail if they feel an increase in any emotion-- anger, fear, sexual arousal.<eos> Not just guilt.<eos> Your polygraph is no better than the egg at telling us which emotion it's responding to.<eos> No.<eos> I've been wanting to try that for years.<eos> See, you would have been found guilty, but you were just angry.<eos> You should be, uh, spending your money studying the face.<eos> 43 muscles combine to produce a possility of 10,000 expressions.<eos> Now, if you learn them all, you don't need a polygraph.
Can you tell me anything about me?<eos> I just got this feeling in my gut that something bad happened to you.<eos> Probably the same something bad that happened to all of us.<eos> I don't feel that way about anyone else.<eos> Just you.<eos> Is there any part of you that finds me familiar?<eos> - It's them.<eos> - Thank God.<eos> Nobody saw us, but who knows what the cameras got.<eos> Or who's watching them.
Sorry,my mistake.<eos> Are you business partners?<eos> She's my accounts manager.<eos> Ah,okay.<eos> Now I understand.<eos> Understand what?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Do you know where her keys are?<eos> I can't find 'em. They're not in here.<eos> I couldn't find them.
Same prissy kind of voice.<eos> Chick said she'd be interested in setting up her own situation when scarlett quit.<eos> Does thischickhave a name?<eos> You know,I'm not big on names at first, but I do have her number.<eos> Why don't you give her a call?<eos> Digger, why are you calling me now?<eos> uh,in your own time,man, if you'd like to take a seat.<eos> Thank you so much,ma'am.<eos> How did you come to have scarlett marquesa's keys?<eos> I took them when I went to offer my condolences to victor.
He has a new boyfriend.<eos> It doesn't mean that he'll stop fucking around.<eos> Hey, watch you mouth!<eos> Hey, that's mine.<eos> I can't read Chinese anyway.<eos> People change, you know.<eos> Don't regret things, and stop talking like this.<eos> Letters are for words that you can't say out loud.<eos> You can't take back something that has been said.<eos> Maybe I wrote you letters but I never gave them to you...
Tricked you.<eos> What do you care anyway?<eos> It's out.<eos> Here.<eos> Chew on this for a bit.<eos> You're getting blood all over the place.<eos> I feel like I'm forgetting something.<eos> The coffee.<eos> Hey, I really like these mugs.<eos> Where'd you get them?
He can't hear you.<eos> Then get him out of there.<eos> Get me satellite surveillance.<eos> We haven't had a bird in the sky since the government shut us down.<eos> Then co-opt one from the NSA or CIA.<eos> That will leave us completely exposed.<eos> Zoe's right.<eos> It's too risky.<eos> We're limited to KITT's cameras.<eos> Bringing them online now.
The plane's call numbers were logged at Jamison Canyon Airstrip this morning.<eos> Is the plane still there?<eos> It appears to be.<eos> Then set a course, KITT, as fast as you can.<eos> If the SSC is right, Danny doesn't have much time.<eos> Course plotted.<eos> Hang on, kid.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Mrs. Clark?<eos> Keep your hands where I can see them. Okay.
In fact, his brains are splattered all over the living room wall.<eos> LOOKS LIKE HE KILLED HIMSELF EARLY THIS MORNING.<eos> MAYE SNAPS UP WILT Getting into the market?<eos> My husband, Joe-- he keeps wanting to invest.<eos> It frightens me.<eos> Care to see the fruits of your dreams?<eos> Turns out the guy was a pharmaceutical sales rep, which is how I'm assuming he got his hands on these.<eos> We pulled about a dozen of them out of his refrigerator.<eos> He used these to incapacitate his victims. Then he pummeled them to death wearing those gloves.<eos> There's steel in the knuckles. Then he posed them, and then he took their photographs.
We're done, let's go.<eos> So, after all that, it's really not that bad.<eos> You're gonna get a letter in your file.<eos> Ron, I just wanted to say thank you, so...<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> No, I didn't do it for Leslie.<eos> I did it because I hate bureaucracy.<eos> My idea of a perfect government is one guy, who sits in a small room at a desk, and the only thing he's allowed to decide is who to nuke.<eos> The man is chosen based on some kind of IQ test, and maybe also a physical tournament, like a decathlon.<eos> And women are brought to him, maybe, when he desires them.
Okay, well, apparently Restrepo was trying to blow us off, so my mom has a plan.<eos> We're gonna twist her arm a little bit.<eos> She's trying to cover up for the fact that she has a husband who likes to vroom-vroom-vroom-vroom and glug-glug-glug-glug-glug.<eos> So you're gonna blackmail her?<eos> No, I'm just gonna get tough with her, Tellenson-style.<eos> That doesn't sound tough to me, that sounds slimy.<eos> It sounds like your mom's telling you to be slimy.<eos> Ann, you don't understand politics.<eos> Look, nursing is easy.<eos> Really? Yeah. You just go to work, and people come in, and you heal them.
Got your messages.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.<eos> Things have been just kind of crazy. I mean, with me working and thinking and really trying to construct something.<eos> You know, I mean, something good.<eos> Of course, of course.<eos> It's good to see you, you know? Really need those pages. Mm-hmm.<eos> Yup.<eos> Oh, yes, the um... the pages.<eos> I mean, to be honest, we were getting a little bit worried,<eos> you did, you did bring them with you?
Nah.<eos> Things move and shift and settle again.<eos> It's like those... what are those snowstorm things called?<eos> Snowstorms.<eos> Yeah.<eos> About so big.<eos> Glass.<eos> No, they're called snowstorms.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, them.
Autistic fucking fruitcake mental basket!<eos> JJ, you're getting locked on!<eos> Shitty Looney Tune.<eos> One Flew Over The Fucking Cuckoo's Nest!<eos> JJ!<eos> Look at these!<eos> That worked.<eos> Last guy to see my tits wasn't quite as impressed.<eos> I suppose I should be leaving.<eos> You know, J, all those things you want, you don't ask for them.
Erica and I are having an affair.<eos> That's it.<eos> We're having an affair, okay?<eos> You happy now?<eos> You're cheating on Sarah?<eos> Are you going to lecture me about marriage now?<eos> 'Cause, you know what? That would be rich.<eos> You really had no idea she was manipulating the data.<eos> You know something?<eos> For somebody who studied emotions their entire life, you really don't understand them at all.
- Uh, six months. I wish I could help, but I don't know much else about these girls.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> A lot of my work is filming people without them knowing it.<eos> You've got... You've got one of the best camera systems on the market up here... filming everything these girls are doing on this stage.<eos> They didn't know you were filming them?<eos> What is it, some kind of Internet feed?<eos> That's it, right?<eos> You know, pornography is illegal in India.<eos> One of the few things they outsource here.<eos> Did the Ashraf sisters know you were filming them?

Let's tell all the dancers in this place exactly what you're up to! - See how they react, eh?<eos> - I was only testing the Web site when the sisters were here.<eos> - But you were filming them.

Let's tell all the dancers in this place exactly what you're up to! - See how they react, eh?<eos> - I was only testing the Web site when the sisters were here.<eos> - But you were filming them.<eos> Right? - Until they quit, yes.<eos> Jaya and Dhara did not want to be so famous, I suppose.<eos> Shame, too, because they could have made a lot of money for all of us.<eos> Were they ashamed when people at home found out what they were doing?<eos> They came in screaming bloody hell at me.<eos> Her brother called from Calcutta to say that he had seen them naked on the videos.
What was his name?<eos> He will come after me.<eos> He can't hurt you anymore.<eos> He found me when I went to renew my visa.<eos> He works at Immigration.<eos> These are notarized surrogacy agreements for all the women who were found in the apartment.<eos> He set up consenting adults with licensed physicians.<eos> Those women are all illegal aliens.<eos> But they weren't when my client entered into these surrogacy agreements.<eos> They were all on visas when he approached them about his side business.
Why is your client so afraid to speak?<eos> If you want to charge me with hiring aliens after visas expired, go ahead.<eos> How about with murder?<eos> The Ashraf sisters jumped off a bridge... and Rajal threw herself in front of a train.<eos> You created a world for this women where suicide seemed like the only option.<eos> We can charge you with depraved heart murder... callous disregard for human life that results in death.<eos> This is what you have?<eos> Depraved heart charges are for people who shoot a gun into a crowd.<eos> There's no jury in the state that will convict him, and you know it.<eos> You exploited these women, and then you threatened them.

When you asked how he could've known those women were gonna jump, his eyebrows went up.<eos> How could I know they'd kill themselves?<eos> - Eyebrows up means you know the answer to your own question.<eos> - His eyebrows went up?<eos> Did he also click his heels three times?<eos> That's not evidence.<eos> We need evidence.<eos> I'm telling you, he knew those girls were gonna jump.<eos> We have no proof.<eos> Even if we could show he mistreated those women and we got them to testify... all we could charge him with is negligence.
They're young adults.<eos> - And? - And you have to treat them that way.<eos> If you give them a class they want to be in, they will come to you.<eos> Okay, you guys, third period English Lit.<eos> Is over. I'm serious.<eos> And it's not in my dining room, it's back at school.<eos> Tomorrow I expect you to be back in Principal Rimkus' classroom.<eos> It's the right thing to do, and you know it.<eos> You left some things in my classroom.<eos> I'd like them gone by the end of the day.
Shall I teach her to levitate while I'm at it?<eos> I know everybody thinks that she's so stable, but I swear she's not.<eos> As far as you need, we'll walk it off.<eos> That happy feeling's all gone.<eos> You're on official administrative leave.<eos> You have no standing, nor authority as U.S. Marshal. What?<eos> Log off and go home.<eos> Consider me logged off.<eos> Since 1970, the Federal Witness Protection program has relocated thousands of witnesses, some criminal, some not, to neighborhoods all across the country.<eos> Every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, distinguishing them from the rest of the general population. And that is... somebody wants them dead.
We don't have money for a doctor.<eos> What have you done to my back?<eos> The illness is in the column of your back.<eos> His condition is serious.<eos> He should be taken to hospital immediately.<eos> We can go in my car.<eos> It's you who made my boy ill, isn't it?<eos> What happened to the pills?<eos> What did you do with them all?<eos> I threw them away.
- I've got someone by the gunships.<eos> - That's our Slick.<eos> Now that he's exposed, he has to get out of this base.<eos> There's no escape now, you piece of rankweed!<eos> Move.<eos> Move!<eos> He took out our weapons depot.<eos> He knew where we'd look.<eos> He's not trying to escape.<eos> He knows all our moves before we even make them.
Multitude of lines intertwined into some impossible shape.<eos> Abel's graph chart!<eos> What is this?<eos> - You can clearly see from this scan that Miss Stefanovic had a chip removed from the left forearm.<eos> Considering that it was connected with the cerebral alpha nerve, implanted chip was probably TGA-11, military chip that has also shown good results in treatment of schizophrenia.<eos> It's also used by students to cheat at tests.<eos> God knows where they get them.<eos> Interesting part is on these micro scans.<eos> Where there were chip's jumpers, there are small plates now.<eos> When we analyzed them we noticed unusual imitation of circuits existing inTGA-11 chip.
I will,sister mary elizabeth.<eos> All right. Let's begin with our morning offering.<eos> Oh,jesus,through the immaculate heart of mary, I offer you my prayers,works,joys,and sufferings of this day.<eos> Adrianna:<eos> What the hell?<eos> You okay?<eos> Dahlias are out of season.<eos> No!<eos> I'm having dinner with navid's parents tonight and dahlias are his mom's favorite flower.<eos> But the only florist that has them right now is up in santa barbara.
Shoes?<eos> ' Oh, God, I'm so sorry. Are you all right?<eos> 'But love gets complicated.<eos> 'It gets twisted up with other things, like possession 'and heartbreak, lust.....and death.'<eos> Whoa, whoa, we can't go in there, it's not safe.<eos> It's PMT, she wrote it on the calendar.<eos> How could she possibly have PMT? She's a ghost.<eos> I don't know, but it's not worth the risk.<eos> Let's go to the chippy.<eos> Mitchell, I have two steaks in the fridge that go off if I don't eat them today.
But he doesn't act like it.<eos> Charlie?<eos> Baby,can you hear me?<eos> Can you te me, was he wearing headphones when he was struck?<eos> Uh,yeah.<eos> He was... wearing this.<eos> The hospital gave it back to me with his clothes;<eos> I don't know why.<eos> People wear MP3 players all the time now.<eos> Do you think it makes them more susceptible to getting hit?
- You mean these are baby monsters? Yes.<eos> We must collect them.<eos> Peter, Petri dish.<eos> - Make it a bucket.<eos> - I'm gonna be sick.<eos> - Two buckets.<eos> - Walter, how is this even possible?<eos> The stinger.<eos> It must carry the eggs.<eos> Transfers them to a suitable incubator.
And evidence from Nazim Kasaba that you commissioned him to set the fire?<eos> Are all these people lying, Mr Kilic?<eos> Any businessman makes enemies who want to see him brought down.<eos> Look at my record. My achievements.<eos> I only ever served my community.<eos> You consider people smuggling at £5,000 per person a service to the community?<eos> I only wanted to help them make better lives for themselves.<eos> You betrayed those who trusted you, didn't you?<eos> No.<eos> You smuggled people into this country out of greed, then you had them burned alive when they begged you for documents.
Yes.<eos> Your brother is dead.<eos> A creature like the one in the garden tore hip apart.<eos> On one hand... he made a huge mistake, venturing out ill prepared..<eos> On the other hand, he was my son and I feel sorry for him<eos> The animal that threatens us is a "cat".<eos> The most dangerous animal there is<eos> He eats meat.<eos> Children's flesh in particular.<eos> After lacerating it's victims with its claws, It devours them with sharp teeth.
Highly unlikely.<eos> I don't mean that this is not the shark we look for.<eos> I think it is, Martin.<eos> He's a man-eater.<eos> Man-eater!<eos> His jaws do not correspond to the bites on the victim.<eos> I want to be sure.<eos> So do you.<eos> We all want to be sure, No?<eos> Anyone else seen them?
That my dad hadn't killed him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How?<eos> About a year after the rampage,he tracked me down.<eos> He told me I was his son,that he'd been searching his whole life for me.<eos> Do you know how powerful that is-- that kind of love?<eos> this feels great. We should have had this talk a long time ago.<eos> No,the Henry I know isn't a killer.<eos> I've always had certain impulses.<eos> I just didn't understand them until I met my dad.
Ah, Chloe.<eos> Hey.<eos> I love that.<eos> Come on.<eos> We're going to kick their ass.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> I thought God loved all creatures.<eos> Just because he loves them doesn't mean he won't smack them from time to time.
That's why I don't know kindness or guilt.<eos> For instance, if I want love, I change the other one's mind to my need.<eos> Love can be controlled using power and medical science.<eos> I operate on their brain and I obtain love!<eos> You're a beast!<eos> Sister... I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.<eos> I...<eos> Sister...<eos> Oh, you're awake?<eos> Your legs were no longer usable, so I replaced them with mechanical ones.
It's a phone number.<eos> WOMAN If you're calling about temporary employment, I'm sorry,but we have everyone we need for the next event.<eos> But please,leave your name and number, and we'll put you on our list.<eos> Thank you for calling...<eos> What kind of suicide bomber worries about his job prospects?<eos> I don't understand,Hood.<eos> I thought the government destroyed all our chemical weapons.<eos> They're still working on it.<eos> You know what they did in the 1960s?<eos> They'd take big old freighters, and they'd fill them up with VX warheads.
I am a high-school graduate,and I can't read a freakin' map.<eos> Look,atlanta's just a straight shot down 74,to 95,to 20,to 75,to 85 -- 6 hours.<eos> And maybe if you would have studied more instead of just making out with me in the backseat of this car.<eos> I got an a-plus in backseat. So,you're the only one with one more graduation gift.<eos> And I was gonna wait to tell you till I got to L.A.<eos> In case you freaked out,but...<eos> I sent copies of "unkindness of ravens" to a bunch of publishers in new york.<eos> You thudded me.<eos> Payback. And right now,there's some stuffy old publisher reading your words and falling in love with them.<eos> And he's gonna buy them,and he's gonna fly you to new york and make you very,very famous.
Great stuff, boys. You like taking a Jonas Brother's hot foam on your faces, girls?<eos> Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers - assholes!<eos> Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?<eos> Who the hell are these guys?<eos> Are they from Dreamworks?<eos> God damn, Eisner trying to hurt this company again?<eos> This whoile thing is a freaking shame.<eos> I say what you're doing now.<eos> You're trying to sell sex to young girls. And then confuse them with...
So the government had to buy the margaritaville assets from the banks.<eos> What?<eos> Just talk to the treasury department. In d.c.<eos> They're the ones who really understand how all this works.<eos> Oh,sell,sell,sell,sell!<eos> Listen,this is all you need to know.<eos> The economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity.<eos> The economy is just an idea made up by people thousands of years ago.<eos> The economy is not real and yet it is real.<eos> Nowadays,they'll give credit cards to practically anyone who applies for them.
I like it all, I like everything about it.<eos> Except the groves.<eos> I don't like the groves.<eos> Or the fountains, or the paths, or the marble birds.<eos> Everything else I like!<eos> You don't understand.<eos> The French King, Has a palace at Chambord which is is the envy of all the world.<eos> But Nonesuch will trump it a hundred, a thousand times.<eos> Then... in time... like everything else it will dissolve away.<eos> like the ruins of ancient Rome, the Colossus of Rhodes... all thing tend towards their ruin, even great houses and the fools who build them.
As the world stands, Your Majesty, I believe what you believe.<eos> So you think it right that he should be burned?<eos> Yes.<eos> Unless he recants.<eos> Yes.<eos> What were their names again? Majesty?<eos> The sisters of the duke of Cleves.<eos> Amelia and Anne.<eos> Amelia and Anne.<eos> Send someone to take a look at them. We'll have a second opinion.
They don't know anything about microfabrication technology<eos> - for vascularized...<eos> - Guys, you're together.<eos> And you have 72 hours to make that thing taste like something a drunk teenager would tip over.<eos> Cow.<eos> I'm talking about a cow.<eos> I had wanted Phil to be recognized as a hero.<eos> But what is a hero anyway?<eos> Working together again, the guys discovered their problem.<eos> Real cows move around all day, and so, build muscle and fat, and that makes them delicious.
Maybe it's just someone who comes through when others need them to...<eos> So that everyone can be a hero.<eos> The meat cost $10,000 a pound, so... it's still a few years from production.<eos> Still Phil, the meat...<eos> For a guy who likes to solve problems, it's been a pretty good week.<eos> And now I am problemless.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm helping you.<eos> - I'm stealing creamers. - No, you're not.<eos> You're replacing them.

I'm anxious to move on to the next part of my life.<eos> Right, and selling cars for Peter is moving on ?<eos> It's a temporary job so I can live while I figure things out.<eos> Or maybe you want one more person freelanding at your house.<eos> Loading.<eos> And no, I don't.<eos> You understand when people get married, they usuallylive together, right ?<eos> Of course.<eos> And I'm not like Brandi or Jinx.<eos> You don't get to treat me like a five year old, make all the rules, and expect me to follow them just because you say so.
How'd she get that key?<eos> They weren't poisoning each other for the gold.<eos> The gold was poisoning them.<eos> Henry, it's Mary.<eos> Listen carefully, have you or Amy handled any of the coins?<eos> How many times do you have to hear it?<eos> We don't know anything about any gold.<eos> They're coated with poison, Henry.<eos> That's how it got into Angela's system.<eos> And if you or Amy touched them, you've been poisoned too.
Her.<eos> Before we all lost our minds over a bunch of stupid coins.<eos> I told Amy about them when I thought I was dying.<eos> And you wrote the letter that was found with your mother so Henry and Amy would know why she did it.<eos> None of us knew about the Huntington's.<eos> How'd the coins wind up in the radio in the first place?<eos> Angela and I took 'em from the bikers.<eos> We put 'em there as a prank.<eos> We thought it would be funny when dad saw it.<eos> But then mom got shot before he saw them.

Do I look like a blow-up doll?<eos> Beaver told his fraternal brothers that he had sex with you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, he lied.<eos> Look, I'll give you DNA or whatever you want. And then you can do me a favor and broadcast the results across the campus.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> We don't have anything to compare her DNA to.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> We're going to collect his sheets off his bed? Yes.<eos> And then we will check them for DNA, see if he had sexual intercourse with Molly Briggs.
Nice kids.<eos> When did you see them last?<eos> Must be about a couple months now.<eos> They came in for a shoot.<eos> "Pappa Puffs. "<eos> Yeah, the girls worked there.<eos> You made them pose like this? Me? No.<eos> That was their idea.<eos> They convinced their boss to do some advertising, but he went postal when he saw the proofs.<eos> That old jerk fired them for this.
Here we go,Mr. Booth.<eos> You look a little flushed.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Sure. Yeah,I'm fine.<eos> Sometimes men can feel awkward.<eos> Knowing people out there know what you're doing in here.<eos> Thanks for that.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> You're kidding,right? Okay.<eos> There are magazines and videos,if you need them.
A bunch of girls here, man, be cool.<eos> You don't like that one? That was not good. I'm an actor.<eos> Hey, hey! Know your audience.<eos> You know what, I need some... I need some new material, could you help me with that?<eos> You do need some new material, you can't haveer.<eos> You know, I always knew, one way or another, that this guy would do her in.<eos> You know, I'd send her to Hazeldon, she would stay straight for a few months and then Barry would call and he would say that he'd straightened out, that they needed each other.<eos> Every time.<eos> Why do women do that?<eos> Why do they go back to the men that hurt them?
Sandra said that her husband called just before 6:00 a.m.last Sunday to say that they were on the way over to pick her up.<eos> Sometime after that call then,<eos> Jimmy Castigan and his accomplice had to carjack the victims, and they killed Walter and Bill.<eos> The sun rose at 6:44 a.m.<eos> And with the crazy humidity that we had last weekend, it would have gotten hot early,which means the bodies would have started to decompose, and they would smell.<eos> So they had to freeze the bodies while they figured out what to do next.<eos> Or until they could get them to the tannery without being noticed. Okay.<eos> Two,three bodies,you'd need a big freezer,something like a butcher would use.<eos> Or a hunter.<eos> Big game hunters freeze their kill until they can have them processed.
-No,no,i drove.<eos> I - i like the middle part of the trip.<eos> - What?<eos> - I just wanted to say,well...<eos> Families are like puzzles.They fit together in a certain way, and when one of the pieces is missing it throws everything off.<eos> Okay,is there a point in there somewhere?<eos> Yeah,the point.<eos> The point is that i find people,mary.<eos> All kinds of people.<eos> No matter how long they've been gone, i find them.
It's all right.<eos> Look,i know it's hard right now.<eos> No,it's not that.<eos> As part of my recovery, i'm supposed to make amends.<eos> We don't have to get into this now. Yes,we do.<eos> It's just that...<eos> There's just one thing that if i tell you about it, i'm just-- that it'll-- It'll just ruin everything.<eos> Well,there's only one way to find out.<eos> The-- the letters... Your father wrote...<eos> I was going through them the day after you showed them to us,and...
What if she were the reason he was up here?<eos> You don't think this was a random attack.<eos> Oil.<eos> He was lying in wait.<eos> He may have specifically targeted these women.<eos> That takes thrill kill off the table.<eos> Because the murders were planned in advance? Bend******<eos> This type of stalking behavior indicates a personal motive.<eos> There's a reason he chose these victims.<eos> So you think he knows them?
There's one road all the victims have in common.<eos> Route 7.<eos> That mean something to you?<eos> Maybe we should take a drive.<eos> Anyone living outside Bend who commutes toward Eugene uses route 7.<eos> It's the most dangerous stretch of highway in the state.<eos> They call it "suicide 7."<eos> These crosses represent accidents?<eos> Fatalities.<eos> The fire chief put them up to remind drivers to be careful.
Our skit is going to kick her skit's ass.<eos> - Ash, what happened to our skit stuff?<eos> - Maybe someone moved it?<eos> Why would someone move it?<eos> I don't know. I'm trying not to freak out.<eos> Frannie stopped by to pick up the Fashion Week decorations.<eos> But what skit are we doing now?<eos> You let her take them?<eos> Oh, God!<eos> She said that she talked to you about it and she said that you said that you thought it would be best for her to have them.
And I thought you could have been one of the ones.<eos> No, Aneka, wait.<eos> Let her go, man.<eos> Let her nasty ass go.<eos> What a day, huh?<eos> Barnabus!<eos> What news?<eos> Have we cracked the secrets of the eye yet?<eos> - No, sir, the weapon remains inert.<eos> - Daggers! Although our scholars couldn't translate the runes, they were able to identify them as turbidian hieroglyphs belonging to an almost-dead language.
I have changed the girls...<eos> Changed their souls into heretic devils.<eos> Devils...?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Eenie, meenie...<eos> Run!<eos> Buddha will save us.<eos> Look up to the sky and pray.<eos> Throwing up on your friend. How kind.<eos> We didn't kill them.
They want to stop murderers, they should televise this shit.<eos> If they want to abolish the death penalty, they should televise it.<eos> We shouldn't have done this.<eos> No regrets, all right?<eos> I mean, come on.<eos> This guy was going to die anyway.<eos> And now your son loves you again, right?<eos> It's a good thing.<eos> Besides, we've seen people die before.<eos> Hell, we threw them in the swamp.
I'm not afraid of much, but needles and iguanas freak me out.<eos> OK.<eos> Clench your fist for me.<eos> It's their claws.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Anytime.<eos> It's just gonna hurt a little.<eos> There you go.<eos> Have you seen my shoes?<eos> I swear, I left them in the bag.
Jenny, whatever you think you know--<eos> I know that you want?<eos> And i want you to know that dan and i are totally okay with it.<eos> But you have to let me make the bridesmaid dresses, okay?<eos> I think those bridesmaid dresses are a bit premature.<eos> Why?<eos> Dan saw you looking at that ring yesterday.<eos> It's not a good time.<eos> There are some, uh, Complicated things happening right now.<eos> Well, whatever they are, you can fix them.

Uh...<eos> Stacey Conolly. IRS.<eos> Now, this is a rather unfortunate place for an audit meeting.<eos> We have a lot of work to get through, Mr. Axe, and the, uh, calypso music is a distraction we do not need. Two cosmos.<eos> I assume the pink beverages are an attempt to get me drunk.<eos> Well, it's not gonna work because I do not drink, Mr. Axe. I audit.<eos> Right.<eos> Uh, uh, no, actually, these are, uh, these are for me.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, you'll need them.
TV's Stacy Keach was a wonderful male actor.<eos> I think he's best known for... you know what?<eos> Let's just focus on business now.<eos> Do you remember the one time I bought you a pack of baseball cards?<eos> I have no idea what you're referring to, Mr. Axe.<eos> You have to remember.<eos> You had a bike. It was a schwinn.<eos> I got some tape.<eos> Okay, you must be recalling some other child acquaintance.<eos> No, we took the cards, put them in the spokes of your wheel, and when you rode around in it...
Please, just let me show you what I learned.<eos> Hey, I found you, didn't I?<eos> He doesn't seem that crazy to me.<eos> All right, show us.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> He's totally nuts.<eos> Sorry about the<eos> - Oh, there's something I really need to show you in the paper.<eos> I can't find anything in this mess.<eos> Yeah, sometimes I lose track of things when I leave them on the ceiling. Ha!
- Yeah, it's latin.<eos> Oh. Let me guess.<eos> You speak latin too. - Okay, make one more nerd joke, And I'm gonna point out how you're losing your hair.<eos> Okay, so the rules, right?<eos> The rules are in latin,<eos> And rules teach us how to use the objects.<eos> - So Joshua took them off the compass himself.<eos> - Yeah, but he was missing something.<eos> - Rheticus hid some rules.<eos> - And Joshua never saw them.
Be free.<eos> You're taking all of them?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay. Got it.<eos> Oh, who the fuck knows what would make him happy?<eos> All I know is no matter, you know, how much I sacrifice or how hard I work-<eos> - Can you open that?<eos> He never even sees it.<eos> It's as if it all happens magically.<eos> Little elves help the girls with their homework and drive them to Irish step-dancing class and fill the fridge and make the beds.
I think we're lost, boys.<eos> Back to the cave.<eos> Yeah, it's freezing here.<eos> Horse.<eos> Indian.<eos> Look, Gerard's footprints.<eos> Well spotted.<eos> We've got him now.<eos> Hey Horse, lucky I saw the tracks, huh?<eos> Ifl hadn't seen them, where would we be now?
At least he's not a meth dealer.<eos> That's progress, right?<eos> You're done here, allright?<eos> I'm not leaving here till I get what I came for.<eos> What did you do with the stuff in the suitcase?<eos> I don't know much about chemistry, but I'm pretty sure it didn't just magically turn into towels.<eos> Can you hand me a towel, please?<eos> I may have underestimated you.<eos> Since 1970, the federal witness protection program has relocated thousands of witnesses some criminal, some not to neighborhoods all across the country.<eos> Every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.

To any married woman who wants them.<eos> Did you prescribe these to Audrey Chadwick?<eos> I read about Audrey's murder.<eos> Did you prescribe these pills?<eos> Yes.<eos> Look, this archaic law will be changed soon.<eos> Well, you want to get yourself a calendar, love, cos this is now, it's not soon.<eos> You're saying any lass that sleeps with whoever she likes can come in off the street and you'll help her deal with the consequences?<eos> If I may say so, only a man could have said that.<eos> When did you prescribe them, Doctor?
Why don't you ask her? I would if I could find her.<eos> I told you she'd be here.<eos> Get the Donovans lined up for me.<eos> Don't tell them anything, and don't let them talk to each other.<eos> I'll be up in a minute.<eos> Would you mind telling me what you're doing, Mrs Bishop?<eos> I send the numbers of the cars to the newspapers.<eos> I send photographs of the men.<eos> You photograph everybody who goes into Rakes?<eos> They never print them, of course.

That might be extreme.<eos> And expensive.<eos> When I get nervous, I act out with sexual touches.<eos> It's like... It's like Tourette's.<eos> - For the pain. - Thank you.<eos> I was nude.<eos> Roy dove for my scrotum.<eos> Oh, yeah, a cat did that.<eos> So I was thinking maybe lmmaculate Virgin.<eos> They've got these adorable uniforms. I've seen them.
Where have you been?<eos> So I cannot dissuade you?<eos> Why would you wish to dissuade me from marrying the man that I love?<eos> Because he has caused you nothing but pain and sorrow.<eos> We are artists.<eos> We thrive on strong emotions.<eos> Then marry Hunt.<eos> He's an artist.<eos> He has very strong emotions.<eos> Yes. And every one of them anger.
- Great.<eos> This is a disaster.<eos> Our reputation as McKinley High's "it" couple is in serious jeopardy... if we don't find some way to be cool again, Finn.<eos> - The Slushee war has commenced.<eos> - And if Finn and Quinn got nailed, none of us are safe. We're a little behind for sectionals... thanks to our Sue Sylvester detour.<eos> But you guys seem to really enjoy doing mash-ups, right?<eos> And I'm gonna keep you guys fired up.<eos> Plus, there's an important lesson to be learned with mash-ups.<eos> Sometimes things are so different, they don't feel like they go together.<eos> But the big difference between them is what makes them great.
It doesn't take much to trip a few electronic safety mechanisms and make a vehicle impossible to start.<eos> If you want to make sure you're the only one making calls, a $100 cellphone jammer will block all signals in a one-block radius.<eos> You have no idea how painful it was to be under that car and not wire it to explode.<eos> If Erik's car blows up a week before his custody hearing, they'll be a lot of eyes on April.<eos> We need him running, not bleeding.<eos> Well, technically, you can run and bleed.<eos> Hey, gang.<eos> We got firearms, and we got snacks.<eos> When you want to create fear, it's best to keep it simple.<eos> The same things people are afraid of as kids... scare them when they're adults.
(Coughs)<eos> Forgive me. I'm so sorry.<eos> Jesus, Arthur, what the hell was that? It's just...<eos> My sister...<eos> She died when I was young.<eos> It was very painful for me.<eos> I understand.<eos> I've lost people too.<eos> Yeah. Have a seat.<eos> If the ashes bother you so much, why do you keep them out?
I just got the official go-ahead from Laguerta to open a Trinity killer investigation.<eos> What's that mean?<eos> I realized if I pitched the entire Trinity theory and I added that he also shot me and Lundy, look like a fucking lunatic, so I boiled it down to the bludgeonings.<eos> I am no longer seeing lieutenant Laguerta.<eos> We broke up, officially.<eos> If I find out this is bullshit, There will be consequences--<eos> Severe, career-ending consequences.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm the person who's going to keep you from killing any more women.<eos> I didn't fucking kill them!
Which is why I haven't torn it apart.<eos> Probably donate it to the needy.<eos> Obviously I won't be needing it.<eos> No, you'll be buried at sea.<eos> I have a new lease on life.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> Hey.<eos> The best laid plans.<eos> It's Jonah's.<eos> What's the point of giving him the better things in life if he can't take care of them?
I get it.<eos> If I got shot in my jerk-off arm, I would be mad too.<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> How many pills did you take?<eos> None.<eos> Well, that's dumb.<eos> I'll get you water.<eos> Give me your pills, I'll open them.<eos> No.<eos> Why have them if you won't take them?
I will requite your loves.<eos> So, fare you well.<eos> Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, I'll visit you.<eos> ALL: Our duty to your honour.<eos> My father's spirit in arms!<eos> All is not well.<eos> I doubt some foul play.<eos> Would the night were come!<eos> Till then sit still, my soul.<eos> Foul deeds will rise, though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
- I'm afraid you're gonna bite my hand.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I just need to eat.<eos> My mom says I'm still growing.<eos> I gotta work on my manners.<eos> I started pre-law, but switched to engineering.<eos> More jobs.<eos> Really?<eos> Those are so different.<eos> You've gotta figure, if we're all gonna be replaced by machines, might as well be a guy that makes them, right?
What, may I ask, brings you to Ravenhill?<eos> - Could ask you the same thing.<eos> - Lady! Lady!<eos> - She pass out.<eos> - Is she a diabetic?<eos> - I've got half a Topic in the car.<eos> - MICHAEL: Where are the keys?<eos> - Tealeaf.<eos> - The keys, where are they?<eos> I left them in the ignition.
- Franca, say hello to the director.<eos> - Good morning, director. - Are we bothering, disturbing you?<eos> - Why?<eos> You've been here all morning, how many people have entered?<eos> - Two, to be honest.<eos> - Exactly. The newspapers aren't writing about it anymore. - Let me see what you're doing.<eos> It looks like Cézanne did it!<eos> - Does that doll have panties?<eos> - Obviously.<eos> Are you wearing them, too?
- Good morning, director. - Are we bothering, disturbing you?<eos> - Why?<eos> You've been here all morning, how many people have entered?<eos> - Two, to be honest.<eos> - Exactly. The newspapers aren't writing about it anymore. - Let me see what you're doing.<eos> It looks like Cézanne did it!<eos> - Does that doll have panties?<eos> - Obviously.<eos> Are you wearing them, too?<eos> Can I see them?
And it's an ingenious plan, to be honest.<eos> Of course, if it was me... I'd just be happy stealing the ice cream.<eos> So what was it like over there?<eos> The jungle?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Combat.<eos> Must've been hell. How did you know?<eos> I'm a psychic.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> I think between the gunshot and the head bashing, my visions are coming in kind of crazy, but I can see them.
- Try to get anything, a location.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Don't... don't ask me any questions, 'cause I can't say anything else.<eos> If you care about me, you'll understand.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I'm not gonna be able to have much of a future anymore.<eos> But if you look back at where we were, I'll be there, okay?<eos> Back?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The wind chimes that I got you for your birthday, every time you hear them from now on, that'll be me.
But the consequence of having to follow their food would have been an endlessly nomadic lifestyle.<eos> All this commotion around.<eos> People are literally packing down their homes and moving off.<eos> And this is what a nomadic lifestyle is all about.<eos> These people have to move.<eos> They have to take their reindeer to new pastures.<eos> The only thing the reindeer eat in winter is lichen under the snow.<eos> And they get through it very fast.<eos> So they're constantly on the move to find more.<eos> And the humans follow them.
It was so sudden.<eos> Well, considering the pain he was in, we can thank God for that.<eos> Can we?<eos> I got to get to work.<eos> Well, now, about tonight's memorial dinner...<eos> - I'm not going.<eos> - Well, I didn't expect you to, dear, but I do want my granddaughter to be in attendance.<eos> She plans on attending.<eos> And about our other agreement, as of tomorrow, I will get custody of Michael's ashes for a year.<eos> Would you like me to have them picked up, or would you like to deliver them?
A bris, with a mohel and a rabbi.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Bagels and whitefish.<eos> Those are my demands. -Demands?<eos> -That's right.<eos> Because I'm the papa.<eos> I'm the papa.<eos> Yes. Tradition.<eos> Who are all these people?<eos> The rabbi brought them.
I'm gonna go get a soda.<eos> - You want something?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> How's it going, Walter?<eos> I plan to urinate in 23 minutes.<eos> Good to know.<eos> I'm telling you because I'm going to need help unzipping my fly.<eos> I can't feel my hand.<eos> It seems the substance from Pennsylvania is a paralytic.<eos> Which means that whoever took those people paralyzed them first, so they couldn't fight back.
I- don't.<eos> that's not a good idea.<eos> - why not?<eos> - she- she's having a hard time.<eos> And you know this because...?<eos> She took me to see her therapist.<eos> Yeah, i think that's why she hired me.<eos> I think i'm supposed to help her, you know,<eos> - work shit out.<eos> - a million things come to mind, But i'm not gonna say them. i'm just gonna keep my mouth shut.
- Shut up! Go to bed!<eos> Go to bed!<eos> Shut up and go to bed right now!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Not another word.<eos> You know what?<eos> You deal with your daughters for a change!<eos> You're their mother.<eos> Do you think being harsh is enough?<eos> What have you taught them?
You expect us to fight shoulder to shoulder with the butchers who massacred our friends and defiled our daughters?<eos> Rebel coward!<eos> Any man here who raises a weapon against another will die by my sword!<eos> It's Ehrengard.<eos> The screeling must have gone back to the town. Go.<eos> Protect your families.<eos> Let's move.<eos> We saved as many as we could, ...but they got away with seven girls.<eos> Including Rachel.<eos> We'll get them back.
- This isn't funny!<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> No, Stace, it's me.<eos> I promise.<eos> Please let me explain.<eos> I don't have anywhere else to go.<eos> Pork chop, i'm calling the cops.<eos> Senior year, Rob Wahl gave you crabs.<eos> Who else knows that?<eos> He gave them to every cheerleader and two guys on the wrestling team.
Oh,and we have to reschedule...<eos> - yeah. - Immediately.<eos> Well,I'll have to see if I can,uh,move some things around. Oh,here.<eos> - Could you help?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know,between you and me,pearls remind me of old ladies.<eos> I feel like I should be storing tissue in my bosom or something.<eos> Um,you could always not wear them.<eos> I wish.<eos> But gregory bought them for me.
I am confident that we can do everything for you here<eos> - better than anyone else in town.<eos> - Hello, Aaron.<eos> - This is a waste of my time.<eos> - How are you?<eos> Great, but I think you know I'm not a big fan of yours either, Barbara.<eos> I think you'll find that whatever unhappiness you had in the past we can change<eos> - and now make you happy.<eos> - Look, I like Andrew Klein. I've been talking to him for a couple of months. He said he had the keys to my kingdom.<eos> He was going to bring me ideas. I was going to hear them.
And soon.<eos> I think we can make this happen pretty fast.<eos> All right.<eos> I just hope they're eating right.<eos> I'm sure they are.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Ted's not much of a cook.<eos> He eats sausages,<eos> You know, like the precooked ones.<eos> He eats them cold.
Mmm. That is a work of art.<eos> - Just know it's not gonna go to waste.<eos> - What? - Hey!<eos> - Hey, yourself.<eos> Judge Summers' office called.<eos> You are being summoned to her chambers.<eos> She said you missed your last two meetings, so you better be prompt.<eos> - What meetings?<eos> - No idea.<eos> I didn't schedule them.
Jealous?<eos> No, I'm not jealous. I'm concerned.<eos> - I thought we were friends. - We are friends.<eos> And as your friend, i'm telling you,<eos> I don't like douche bigalow over there.<eos> And that sounds like cappie.<eos> You guard the door, I'll get the pictures from the computer.<eos> And then what?<eos> Then I'll get her pictures in front of professor belski.<eos> It's just one of those things boyfriends do for their girlfriends because they love them.
* coming-coming two by two * * hoorah hoorah<eos> These people, they're my subjects.<eos> hey, that's me.<eos> A lot of people trying to get in, ya know?<eos> Is that me?<eos> They'd kill for my job.<eos> When did this happen?<eos> How did it happen?<eos> I started this.<eos> I found these people, and i put them into my reports.
You sit there so smug!<eos> That is sneaky.<eos> Is sneaky good or bad?<eos> Good, if it holds up in court.<eos> Next time, make it look more like you're taking advantage of a situation, not scripting it.<eos> Don't keep me hanging, people.<eos> Are Alexander Gallo and Tom Fargood the same person? Yep.<eos> Perfect match.<eos> Well, your facial expression suggests that you are dissatisfied.<eos> You proved that Gallo is Fargood, fine, but now you gotta prove that Fargood killed those people and dumped them under that fountain.
They said I had to wait 48 hours till I could report her missing.<eos> I told them, "You don't know my wife.<eos> "If she's not home by now, something happened to her."<eos> God, I should have been there.<eos> These parties, you know, they're just... Everyone is so phony.<eos> Travis, I know this is difficult, but I have to ask you this question.<eos> Was there anyone that you can think of - that would want to do harm to Jenna?<eos> - You're kidding, right?<eos> We filed the reports.<eos> Didn't the other cops send them - to you guys?
Lady Sarah Hill instructed you?<eos> And most expressly asked for you.<eos> Mrs Browning did almost drop her spoon when you left the room.<eos> Well, at least she will not try to enlist me for her society.<eos> You could not join the Reformation of Manners because you have none.<eos> I refuse to be reformed.<eos> And your husband?<eos> He did not object.Because he thinks I fled the argument.<eos> His beliefs are sincere and certain.<eos> But you do not share them?
Oh, no. that's not-- i mean, i--i just--<eos> I have to ask you. The answer's no.<eos> So you've never been interested In another woman in that time?<eos> Never.<eos> Really?<eos> You never cheated?<eos> He said no.<eos> Did you ever cheat on your taxes?<eos> Torres.<eos> No, And i've been paying them Longer than you've been breathing air.
Tonight I wear some gogggles<eos> Richard falls down a small slope<eos> And James Says hello to a man<eos> All right, mate?<eos> TOP GEAR Season 13 Episode 6 hello, hello, good evening, thank you erverybody.<eos> thank you,thank you<eos> Now as we kown the real world where we all live if full of dreary cars, like the Renault Scenic and the Toyota...whatever this is.<eos> Which is why, in the fantasy world that is Top Gear, we prefer to feature things that are a bit more exciting, a bit more dinosaurish.<eos> Our track... ..it's the natural home of the quad cam 84 litre carnivore.<eos> From the massive Murcielago to the agile Ariel Raptor we have them all.
We are stealing Kerrity's diamonds. Again.<eos> - You guys are gonna scrump his jewels?<eos> - No. Not "you guys. " "Us guys. "<eos> We know where the diamonds are kept in the vault.<eos> We need someone to bust - the diamonds out of the vault.<eos> - It's très bold, brothers.<eos> It's très bold.<eos> We go in tonight.<eos> You clean the stones with your laser.<eos> We sell them and make a ton of money.
You weren't kidding about having some charming back at the apartment.<eos> And you are a fantastic cook.<eos> Well, I am the second assistant to a semi-importansous-chef.<eos> Basically, I boil things.<eos> But one day I'm gonna have my own restaurant.<eos> Well, I'm making reservations now, 'cause that was, like, the best thing I have ever eaten.<eos> What's for dessert?<eos> Okay.<eos> I know I set you up with that dessert line... and you were right to jump on that... but, um, I'm just not a one-night stand kind of person I just never do things like this.<eos> Yeah, but lots of people say they'll never do things, and then they do them.
It's Mr. Sterling. Are you in?<eos> - Roger.<eos> - Dada.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Down the hall.<eos> How's Betty?<eos> She perform like a champ?<eos> - She did.<eos> - I need his initials.<eos> Jane's gonna put them on the back of her yacht or something for him.
Who, who?<eos> The dog bit me. The door was open...<eos> See for yourself!<eos> Says Blackie chomped him.<eos> That's what he is for.<eos> Probably was just teasing.<eos> Should be cleaned for disinfection, there is tetanus in the mud.<eos> And once I've smuggled a jar of chicken shit across the border.<eos> I bought eggs at 50 pfennig a piece.<eos> And then I smeared those German eggs with Polish shit. ...and sold them at the double price, as fresh straight from the Polish farm.
No, it's just a little hot in here.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> This class isn't for me.<eos> There he is.<eos> - So that pregnant woman? - Uh-huh?<eos> Heard she delivered twins. Named them both Peter.<eos> The pregnant woman's name is Kristy.<eos> And she had twin girls.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Named them Haylie and Katie.
I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned and polished, but they haven't been returned yet.<eos> You must be mr. Malone.<eos> One moment please.<eos> Thanyou.<eos> Sir,this is the man withhe shoes.<eos> Mr. Mane,your shoes are gone.<eos> They were stolen?<eos> - No,deroyed. - What?<eos> When the bag was opened by our shoeshine,the smell ovcame him.<eos> I,too,smelled them d made the choice that they must be thrown away.
Hey, uh, me.<eos> Can I talk to you for a sec?<eos> Tell me what's going on.<eos> - What?<eos> - I know you.<eos> You're lying to these people and to me.<eos> - Is that so?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> See, I know your lying expressions.<eos> I've seen them in the mirror.
Yeah, this week you do.<eos> Ha ha.<eos> I'm just saying...<eos> I just don't want you to miss out on something that you might really love.<eos> Who else was in here around the time you found Taggart?<eos> As far as I know, only Zane.<eos> He's the one that designed this cooling system, right?<eos> Yeah. I figure one of these things probably just went haywire.<eos> They're fine.<eos> I checked them.
Yo, Drizz, isn't that your booty call with Mr. Columbine?<eos> Homeboy got dumped for that guy? That's pitiful.<eos> It's also kind of funny.<eos> Shut up, you douche.<eos> What, am I supposed to, like, keep tabs on every stupid hook up?<eos> Hey, it's cool.<eos> No shame in sharing your candy with Jasper.<eos> I enjoyed our evening the other night.<eos> The moonlit ride, dinner in the orchard.<eos> You know, my chef is famous for his white truffle omelets, but he only serves them at breakfast.
And right now, you're in med school.<eos> Who cares if Robert pulled strings to get you in?<eos> You're in.<eos> And this is a chance that won't come around again. I know that, mom.<eos> And every single person here has taken their opportunity to tell me not to blow it.<eos> So thanks for bringing that up.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> Maybe I shouldn't have bought the car. Mom, this is not about the car.<eos> This is about Justin.<eos> Well, if he made you this upset, why don't we go over there and pick up your things and bring them back here?
If you didn't have this one flaw, I would spend every moment of every day wondering, what the heck is she doing with me?<eos> You may not be brilliant, but you can tiptoe through a minefield better than anyone I know.<eos> Well done.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> I tried to wait up, but today was just too much.<eos> What happened?<eos> Well, the repairman finally showed up, but he didn't have the right part so he left again.<eos> Then Celia hid my car keys so I couldn't take her to the dentist.<eos> Then she forgot where she put them.
Yeah. This poor guy thinks there's some kind of hex on all the girls he tries to hook up with.<eos> We just need to do some investigating, find some evidence, convince him he's not cursed so that he can live a full and happy life with his lady love.<eos> Man, this is a matter of the heart.<eos> He's paying us, right?<eos> Yeah, cash.<eos> The last four women that I've dated have all had terrible accidents.<eos> With each girl it gets worse and worse.<eos> The first one had a car accident. Another's apartment burned down.<eos> What do you do after these things happen?<eos> I break up with them.
Maybe we shouldn't rush this.<eos> Let's see how the evidence lines up.<eos> Well,I know how it's going to line up.<eos> It's a crime of passion.<eos> I mean,this guy's greasy as lard.<eos> Come on,he can't even fake tears.<eos> Sully,somebody tracked mud across that floor.<eos> His shoes are clean as a whistle.<eos> They never touched dirt.<eos> He washed them, just like he spit-shined the rest of this place.
Your friend Leonard really seemed like a stand-up guy.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> - Man, it's good to see you too.<eos> - Man, we thought we was dead for sure.<eos> Tony started praying out loud in the back of the car, so then the scary Sugar Hill dude was like, "shut the hell up back there!"<eos> - Tell 'em what I said .<eos> - Then...<eos> I said, "man, don't you know when it's time to keep your mouth shut?"<eos> You understand me?<eos> I was thinking words in my head, but I wasn't saying them. See?
- Okay, well, I'll get a team together.<eos> - We're good.<eos> We're ready to go there now.<eos> Walter and I were discussing how radiation pertains to- Yes.<eos> Which lead to a theory about the shadow.<eos> Initially I'd assumed there would be a radiation surplus in the victim from the penthouse.<eos> It's not the radiation that's killing them, quite the opposite.<eos> It's the radiation that the entity is after.<eos> This thing passes through victims to absorb radiation?<eos> And disintegrates them.
- Thank you.<eos> I have to go home, Lola. - But it's raining!<eos> Mother is looking for me.<eos> - Then take the umbrella!<eos> I can't come tomorrow. Mother and I are going somewhere.<eos> Thank you for staying.<eos> Aren't you hungry?<eos> And your medication?<eos> Did you take it?<eos> Bebong, go get the bananas, so I can sort them.
They are all fresh, and they are best when they are still hot.<eos> Iwat, tell your children to eat up!<eos> We have to go work at the duck farm.<eos> How is Iwats husband, Berto?<eos> He is out in the fields.<eos> How about the business with the ducks?<eos> Hurry, it's late already.<eos> Iwat, your children have to take a bath.<eos> Our ducks all got sick and died after the last typhoon.<eos> You lost them all?
Alright, alright.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Yes, Lola?<eos> Would you like to buy these duck's eggs?<eos> No, Lola.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - 3 Pesos each, I got two dozen.<eos> That's 72 Pesos.<eos> I'll sell them for 70.<eos> Lola, I really don't need them.
Probably about 70%, Which is good considering your injuries.<eos> I guess that means I only steal 70% as much stuff. Billy...<eos> You see this?<eos> I noticed this afternoon There were splotches all over the page, And...<eos> They're tears.<eos> She was crying when she wrote this stuff. She's scared.<eos> And--and these stupid little sayings, They make her feel better.<eos> This is her comfort.<eos> We stole her comfort from her.<eos> You and me, we're-- we're taking things from people, And we're leaving them at 70%.
Hello, Echo.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> - Did I fall asleep?<eos> - For a little while.<eos> Shall I go now?<eos> God.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Wiretap transcripts.<eos> This is more than just medical malfeasance or ethics violations. This is prostitution, human trafficking, maybe murder.<eos> They take people and they change them into whatever they want them to be.
So what was that like?<eos> It was different.<eos> Like... All access different?<eos> I'm not going to tell you that.<eos> Almost, it was dark.<eos> Come on, man. I'm-a need more details.<eos> I mean, you banged her on my futon.<eos> It was, uh... it was awesome.<eos> She was confident and specific.<eos> And bossy. She took my hands and put them places.
- That's why we invented the... - Spoon! - Spoon!<eos> Come in, take whatever you want.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Okay, take some popcorn.<eos> Where are my ribs?<eos> Ribs, ribs, ribs.<eos> Those were your ribs?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They were only boiled.<eos> I hadn't even barbecued them yet.
Why isn't the toilet on the hole is?<eos> I don't want to get into plumbing terms but it turns out, I don't know how to install a toilet.<eos> This is just it.<eos> I mean... there are boundaries, and not peeing on me is one of them, I think.<eos> When I lived with Davis, it wasn't such an uptight atmosphere<eos> I'm not uptight.<eos> You peed on me!<eos> I'd just like to point out that when you ate my ribs, I was cool about it.<eos> You're all, "Oh, those were your ribs?" Give me a break.<eos> Who do you think put them in there, the Rib Fairy?
The most incredible thing happened!<eos> You used the new toilet?<eos> The baby kicked.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> - Give me your hand.<eos> - Don't feel anything.<eos> - Wait, wait.<eos> I have to be eating a rib, I think.<eos> He loves ribs!<eos> Or hates them.
What have we got so far?<eos> The dump site's this way.<eos> Well,this is where we fnd Samantha's leg,Ray.<eos> We have maggot migration trails here,Horatio.<eos> I think we're lookg at the original dump site.<eos> So will these trails lead to more body parts?<eos> Unfortately,maggot trails don't give directionality.<eos> Lo at these animal tracks.<eos> Body parts were dumped.<eos> Animal scavengers dispersed them.
Sure.<eos> Uh, I-I'll get right on it.<eos> The password.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Dr. Nayak, can you think of anyone who would want to steal your data or might want to sabotage you?<eos> I - I don't know. I<eos> - I suppose there are any number of companies. The chip was valuable?<eos> Oh, the initial testing has been remarkable.<eos> It's cured sleepwalking, night terrors... All major non-REM sleep disorders.<eos> These people just wanted some rest, and my chip was helping them.
Which is what we want.<eos> That's right.<eos> You want to elicit a response. And I suspect hubris will be his downfall.<eos> In terms of your computer skills, you might be a little out of your league with these rathmor tech kids.<eos> Oh, please, I have proficiencies in ipsec architecture, kerberos, and plutoplus with the FBI.<eos> These kids, uh, invented that stuff, so... these guys have spent more time with their World of Warcraft avatars than real women who aren't called "mom. "<eos> Ah, just in case.<eos> Great, because there's nothing I love more than falling back on my sexuality to get the job done.<eos> Oh, and those shoes are crocodile stilettos.<eos> You scuff them, tear them, lose them... and I'll end you, Tootsie.
The victmin seems to have fried.<eos> Local cops think a radical environmental group did it.<eos> Last week, apparently they torched a Hummer.<eos> Sign was the same-<eos> "Big energy is killing the planet. "<eos> Seems to be a poor way to get sympathy for your cause.<eos> You think?<eos> Yes.<eos> So, the plant have security tapes?<eos> Your people are getting them now.
I just met her a couple months ago at a party.<eos> She seemed nice.<eos> She was pleasant, but an unexceptional anthropologist and obviously quite careless.<eos> Perhaps, but it's sad nonetheless, Dr. Brennan, to lose one of our own here at the Jeffersonian.<eos> Of course.<eos> Truth be told, we kind of flirted with each other...<eos> Not appropriate, Dr. Hodgins.<eos> Dr. Kaswell's blood's a match for the spray we found on the mummy.<eos> There are some metal flakes at the injury site.<eos> You say the word, I'll take them.
I don't think I should be talking to you without an attorney.<eos> Okay,you we can call him from the police station.<eos> You see that?<eos> Our guy worked at Lakeside Pizza.<eos> Possibly pizza sauce?<eos> Negative for blood.<eos> If Andrew Jimenez was in the car underwater,wouldn't most of the pizza sauce have washed off?<eos> You'd think so.<eos> His shoes never did get in the water.<eos> Because he took them off before he got in- he wasn't the driver.
It means he won't do any time.<eos> Kid goes on a killing spree. All they're gonna do is make him talk it out with a bunch of shrinks.<eos> - How many do you want?<eos> - I'm not hungry.<eos> - I don't need any crepes.<eos> - Oh, don't be ridiculous.<eos> You were abducted.<eos> Of course you need crepes.<eos> I'm okay, Walter.<eos> Whenever your mother made them, you called them creeps. Drove her batty.
All right. Start over.<eos> No, I'm not gonna start over. I was right. The game sucks.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> Georgia.<eos> That's six.<eos> I was gonna- No.<eos> Jesus Christ. You guys are gonna be hammered before I'm finished naming the East Coast.<eos> Bro, I gotta cook up some hot dogs, man. All right.<eos> I got a proposition for you, man. Check this out.<eos> What do you say we smash these wicker chairs to bits, put them in the middle of the U-Haul- which is metal... and we burn the wicker chairs and cook the hot dogs on that?
She said, "someday you'll find the perfect woman to give this to," and she was right.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I didn't plan on falling for you, either.<eos> And I don't blame you for wanting to run the other way.<eos> And for what it's worth... I love you.<eos> And in that moment,<eos> Bree knew that the time to leave her lover had come... and gone.<eos> Ann Peterson was the principal of Fairview Elementary School,<eos> And she believed in rules.<eos> She used them to teach hygiene, to control behavior

I love you.<eos> And in that moment,<eos> Bree knew that the time to leave her lover had come... and gone.<eos> Ann Peterson was the principal of Fairview Elementary School,<eos> And she believed in rules.<eos> She used them to teach hygiene, to control behavior<eos> And to instill order.<eos> Yes, Mrs. Peterson believed in rules.<eos> She also believed That those who didn't follow them should be punished.
-How did it occur to you?<eos> !<eos> -Ah! It stings.<eos> -Did you spray the fur cap?<eos> -I did!<eos> Good!<eos> I'll give you candles.<eos> I think I already have the...<eos> What are they called?<eos> -I had some... Where have I put them?
You could have married a younger man, not an old one like me.<eos> -I think you weren't that old back then!<eos> -No, I wasn't, but haven't I become?<eos> -Haven't I also become a granny?<eos> !<eos> -Should I take my hat?<eos> I don't know...<eos> I think I'm not going anywhere, because I can't find my shoes.<eos> Well, don't come...<eos> I've seen them somewhere around here.
If I just loiter, I feel the pain.<eos> But usually I have a lot to do, I move my hands all the time and don't feel any pain.<eos> -Don't you miss the doctor?<eos> -I don't miss anyone.<eos> -But I must say he did me good.<eos> -He did...<eos> He gave me those pills that I still take.<eos> One evening I said: "Well, I'll take it tomorrow"<eos> And the next day my hands and legs hurt really bad.<eos> I am addicted to them now.
- Actually, yeah.<eos> I'm having a heart attack.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Acid reflux.<eos> Guys your age can't digest certain foods.<eos> You're gonna need to put down that cheeseburger.<eos> So you wanna keep emoting or you wanna talk about solving this little issue of yours?<eos> It's gotta be about the chips.<eos> I slid them across.
See him?<eos> - He keeps on watching you.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, the one with the beard.<eos> That one.<eos> I got my eye on him.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So who's got the keys?<eos> Only the prince.<eos> But don't get your hopes up.<eos> He keeps them in his private chambers.
How many dead?<eos> Too many to number.<eos> I'm sealing the citadel.<eos> - You can't.<eos> - I have no choice.<eos> I have to protect those who have a chance.<eos> If I don't, we will all fall.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - There are people trapped on the drawbridge.<eos> I'm not leaving them to die.
I'm gonna let the lawyers handle it.<eos> Good day. Working two, three shifts at a time.<eos> My lawyer already checked on you.<eos> I know what it's like to feel the pressure of obligation.<eos> But isn't it possible I was on that bus and you've become so spread thin that you forgot?<eos> No.<eos> It's not.<eos> You're not going blind, Emma.<eos> There's nothing wrong with your eyes.<eos> When you saw the lights, did other people see them?
Hundred dollar bills.<eos> We took a set of plates, hid 'em with our gear.<eos> Smuggled 'em when we came back.<eos> Where'd you find Rick Pargo?<eos> He found us.<eos> Someone must have told him.<eos> We gave Pargo the plates, he made some test batches, but...<eos> The paper wasn't good enough.<eos> SAM: Let me guess.<eos> Brandon was supposed to destroy the bills, but instead, he laundered them online.
Hi.<eos> I guess i kind of missed it.<eos> [ chuckles ] hey, you let me in. i just wanted to let you in.<eos> Boy: hey, miss quinn.<eos> Hi. [ chuckles ]<eos> Wow. Great spiral, great listener, And now this hot mother teresa thing?<eos> You know, in girl world, you just called me hot, right?<eos> In an old-nun sort of way.<eos> Oh, okay, yeah. So, what exactly do you do here, sister quinn?<eos> Well...we make these homemade cameras, And then we take pictures with them.
It would be a wonderful journey.<eos> We head toward the Trapezium stars, the four brightest in a cluster that's a hectic laboratory of star formation.<eos> Thousands of other stars have formed or are in the process of forming, but as it's happening, scientists believe the cluster is imposing a kind of birth control on the whole cycle.<eos> Only about 10% of the mass of a cloud which will form stars actually become stars.<eos> So why is it that so little of the matter in a cloud actually turns into stars?<eos> What we've come to believe now is that there may be a feedback process.<eos> So once you form stars, they feed back on the cloud, acting like a thermostat and actually limiting the amount of star formation that can form.<eos> In the Trapezium Cluster, you've got those 4 massive stars that are producing enormous amount of ultraviolet radiation, as well as winds that stream into the surrounding area. And they will affect the gas that wants to form stars.<eos> So even though you have another thousand stars forming around the Trapezium, the star-formation rate in that area is being affected by the ultraviolet radiation and the winds from those massive stars.<eos> If nebulas are the stellar nurseries of the cosmos, then clusters are their grade schools, where stars stay together until life and the galaxy drives them apart.
- He is not serious, Miss Fairfax.<eos> May we take it that you did receive a letter from a loved one this morning, despite the weather?<eos> Perhaps from Ireland?<eos> I'm sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of you being out in the rain at the post office this morning.<eos> Young ladies are delicate plants, you must take good care of your health.<eos> I am much obliged by your concern, sir.<eos> Going to the post office in the rain.<eos> You sad girl!<eos> We shall have to do something about this!<eos> Well, the man who collects our letters every morning shall enquire after yours and bring them to you.
Previously on csi:<eos> Miami...<eos> Can someone help me?<eos> My daughter's missing.<eos> - What we got?<eos> - The dump site's here.<eos> The body parts were dumped.<eos> Animal scavengers dispersed them.
It was a giant squid.<eos> The amazing thing is that nobody had actually been able to prove the existence of a giant squid up until the 1870s, when finally, after countless reports of these things by sailors who were never really believed, finally dozens of them washed into the shore in Newfoundland,<eos> proving that there really were these amazing creatures.<eos> A thousand years earlier, tales of these sea monsters terrified Scandinavia's most rugged seafarers, roving bands of marauders who built an empire by dominating the waves: The Vikings.<eos> The Viking... the word "viking" itself means to plunder, to raid, and so the name that was applied to these people refers to the actual act of what they were doing.<eos> When the fear of giant sea creatures threatened their voyages, the Vikings looked to one god:<eos> Thor.<eos> We would have to imagine the Norsemen getting into their ships for plunder in the North Sea and praying to Thor for protection, to help guide them to where they were going, so Thor took on certain kind of significance that elevated him above the other gods in the eyes of the warriors.<eos> Viking raiders performed a special ritual in Thor's honour to guarantee their safety on the high seas.<eos> The ritual involved dismantling a temple dedicated to Thor and taking the pillars of the temple onto the boats with them and dropping them over the side into the ocean in order to show that Thor was dominating the ocean, that they, as Thor's servants, were going to be able to have safe passage.
It's an intriguing parallel between two myths created more than a thousand years apart.<eos> But Frodo's ring does more than make its wearers invisible, it also corrupts them.<eos> The One Ring is a creation of an evil lord who imbued it with his own destructive power,<eos> Sauron.<eos> When Sauron forged the ring he put part of himself in it.<eos> It's intrinsically evil.<eos> If you wear it and claim it you cannot use it for any good cause.<eos> It is going to twist everything you do for evil.<eos> The One Ring actually has a malevolent spirit, part of Sauron's spirit, living inside of it.<eos> So this malevolent spirit works on people to change them, to manipulate them to do evil things.
It was the fall of 2009 and I was a professor now.<eos> So, I decided to change my look a little bit.<eos> And people were noticing.<eos> Ah, tweed.<eos> Textile of the eunuch.<eos> You know, I've always wondered why those tweed jackets have elbow patches.<eos> Because the people who wear them are constantly going,
- But if for any reason you need to get in touch with me -- don't say another word.<eos> I don't want to know where you're going.<eos> Plausible deniability?<eos> Words to live by.<eos> Peter...<eos> What's the latest?<eos> We've got conflicting intel.<eos> I mean,we've got reports of caffrey sighted everywhere from jersey to geneva.<eos> He's covering all his bases.<eos> Ah,he stole them right off the field.
So many pills.<eos> These pills are important. If you forget to take them, you could get clots, have a heart attack or a stroke.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Pops, when was the last time you took them?<eos> I don't know. A few days ago.<eos> We have to go get this refilled. He should take them right away.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You're coming with us. Okay, Pops?<eos> I'm going to make sure you take them in front of me.
- I was looking. - Yeah.<eos> For the record, I did not.<eos> I don't know. Maybe I should've seen it.<eos> His resume was almost too good to be true.<eos> Top of his class at Berkeley, Stanford Business School.<eos> He must've really needed this job to lie so bad.<eos> So, there's no other reason you can think of as to why he lied? - No.<eos> - When you hired him, did you look into any of his references?<eos> Of course I did, Detective.<eos> I called them all myself.
I - I can't... I can't go in there.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I'm embarrassed.<eos> - Nothing to be embarrassed about.<eos> - I've got panties on.<eos> - Only she knows.<eos> - How am I supposed to act now?<eos> Normal.<eos> Panties up here, not... You don't have to really wear them.<eos> You just know you've got them on and maybe you're a little more comfortable than normal.
I'm out.<eos> All right, your pops want me to put you up on game, right?<eos> You see them shorties?<eos> Go up and twist your fingers all up like, West Side.<eos> And be like, "What up, hos?"<eos> Then make them give you $40.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, what happened with the fly honeys?<eos> Well, I called them all whores like you said. And then I explained what happens to whores.<eos> And that made them sad. But I told them how they could be saved like I was with the purity pledge.
I'm just making conversation. Getting to know you.<eos> You wanna know how I could do such terrible things for Red John.<eos> Oh, I know that stuff. Unhappy childhood. Sexually abused by a close relative.<eos> Blah, blah. Everyone you ever met made you feel ashamed. Ashamed of that ugly darkness festering inside you.<eos> But he didn't.<eos> He made you strong.<eos> He made you feel proud of that darkness.<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> He gave your life purpose and meaning and love.<eos> You're very much like him, you know. The way you look at people and see through them.
Bosco's favorite.<eos> Pint of Scotch, left of the fridge, top shelf, behind the ramen.<eos> Yep.<eos> Sam Bosco.<eos> Damn fine agent.<eos> It was a nice service.<eos> - Nice music.<eos> - I'm not a fan of the bagpipes.<eos> Really?<eos> I love them.
Okay.<eos> Photo, mark and sample.<eos> I have the victim's vehicle registration.<eos> I'm gonna go see if his car's in the parking lot.<eos> Too bad the only surveillance is at the register and front entrance, huh?<eos> I knew that field trip would come in handy.<eos> (groans) LVPD. Out of the car.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hands, hands. Let me see some hands.<eos> Put them on the car.
In fact,we have quite a unique ritual we use in order to celebrate that has to do with letting go of r'st yeas baggage and starting fresh.<eos> You with the weird shorts.<eos> Are those coffins?<eos> You bet your ass those are coffins.<eos> Would anyone like to guess what's inside them?<eos> - Corpses?<eos> - Ew.No.<eos> Demons.<eos> Metaphorical demons.<eos> We decorate our coffins the way you might decorate an easter egg, and then fill them with whatever has been haunting us this past year... debts we've finally paid off,letters from old boyfriends, a leather vest that looked great in the shop
Thanks to you, we pulled some prints off it.<eos> And all the prints were on Lucy.<eos> The bullet hit the father dead centre.<eos> The prints match that of the Newport news killings.<eos> It's the same killer.<eos> Family annihilators like the fox, they start with one victim.<eos> And once they feel capable, They move on to a second victim.<eos> They don't start with entire families.<eos> There are more victims.<eos> we just haven't found them yet.
To get acclimated.<eos> You know, it's like swinging two bats in the on-deck circle.<eos> Women, they just don't get it.<eos> Take it off, Randy.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> What is that?<eos> What do you got?<eos> Peanut shell?<eos> These shells were twisted apart.<eos> Most people just split them down the middle, right?
Take it off, Randy.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> What is that?<eos> What do you got?<eos> Peanut shell?<eos> These shells were twisted apart.<eos> Most people just split them down the middle, right?<eos> That's how I eat it.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> I'm allergic, so I don't eat them.
- Yep. - Dressing up as a peasant and walking amongst the serfs.<eos> That's me.<eos> So this is what idealism looks like.<eos> I liked your husband.<eos> He was better than this current state's attorney.<eos> Easier on Duis and drug cases.<eos> So, here's your problem.<eos> You've got a client who admitted to liability, - and a sympathetic plaintiff.<eos> - You saw the depositions?<eos> Got them from the plaintiff's attorney.
Thank you. Look, there's something about those shapes.<eos> There's some emotional art right there.<eos> Any kid could do that.<eos> No kid could do that.<eos> Only God could do that.<eos> What is so great about the shapes?<eos> He likes the shapes, okay?<eos> And he's part of the team.<eos> So, here. Take these scissors and cut out your favorite shapes.<eos> And then we'll put them on a new team mural.
- rigging, repair, bit of scaff. - Are you working tonight?<eos> No, I'll take the little one, give Neeta a break.<eos> I hope she lets you get your head down tonight.<eos> - I only need a couple of hours, me.<eos> See you.<eos> It's got nothing to do with Dionne, nothing to do with Gooding and none of them have a connection to the money.<eos> People are going to burn to death and all we know is when.<eos> We don't know how, we don't know where, it's like we're the butt of some great cosmicjoke.<eos> God doesn't tell jokes.<eos> Maybe it's the way he tells them.
Your little go-cart battery?<eos> Golf cart.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Would you pick an accent and stick with it?<eos> [IN AMERICAN ACCENT] Listen here...<eos> WOMAN:<eos> Son of a bitch. Now you did it.<eos> What is the point of these simulations...<eos> Krenshaw's arousal?<eos> ...if you don't take them seriously?
Come on. What... What the hell are you talking about?<eos> You threatened a guy.<eos> Then he turns up dead.<eos> Do the math.<eos> Forgeries.<eos> Fink paid me to paint forgeries of high-end paintings.<eos> I was struggling, man.<eos> I needed the dough.<eos> - What'd he do with the copies?<eos> - Sold them. Passed them along to the buyer like they were the real thing.
The newspaper articles he mailed to Karl Arnold.<eos> 2 letters from 2 different locations.<eos> They ramped us all back up again.<eos> I should just start at the beginning.<eos> Foyet had done a lot of injury to himself in the original string of killings, in an effort to paint himself as a victim and throw us off the investigation.<eos> As a result, he became dependent upon a large number of extremely strong medications.<eos> We'd been searching the country for patients with that exact prescription combination, but we hadn't had any luck.<eos> The envelopes Foyet mailed to Arnold are due back from the lab.<eos> They're flagged urgent.<eos> Gina's here with them now.
Thanks.<eos> They're also flame retardant.<eos> Excuse me, roberta?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I need you to do me a favor.<eos> Um, check under my bed for... monsters.<eos> Cleveland jr., get out of here.<eos> You're too old to be believing in monsters.<eos> Well, I know that intellectually, But phobias are not always rational.<eos> That's what makes them so--
Well, that's interesting math.<eos> What if I can get someone else to share Christmas with us?<eos> Now, that would make it a real Christmas, right?<eos> Dad, some reformed criminal pal of yours won't make a real Christmas.<eos> I'm talking family, a blood relative... an aunt or one of your cousins from Minnesota.<eos> You have contact with these people?<eos> We're MySpace buddies.<eos> Come on, honey, please?<eos> Well, why do people hate to spend Christmas alone?<eos> 'Cause it means nobody loves them.
Pressure trigger.<eos> After the weapon's done its job, the pressure is taken off the trigger and it retracts.<eos> Keep the pressure on the trigger and it doesn't reload for the next unsuspecting victim.<eos> We've got our murder weapon.<eos> This whole house is a murder weapon.<eos> - Heads up, guys.<eos> - I hope you know what you're doing.<eos> [Mac] These tiles were designed to slide.<eos> Just like a child's number puzzle. One through 15.<eos> You move each one. You place them in numeric order. Instead of a number pattern, these create an image.
Would you like some water with that?<eos> - I had two drumsticks.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Merlin, I had two drumsticks.<eos> - Maybe it fell on the floor.<eos> I had sausages.<eos> You sure?<eos> They must've fallen.<eos> - Merlin!<eos> - What? - You can search me, I haven't them.
- You're ready.-<eos> - For what?<eos> I only planned to teach you how to defend yourselves against the slavers.<eos> But you're better fighters than I expected you to be.<eos> We're going to take your village back from Caldor.<eos> Am I wrong about you?<eos> Are you afraid to take back what's yours?<eos> No. There's nothing we want more.<eos> But to fight Caldor, we need better weapons.<eos> The Wizard can make them for us.

Who's this?<eos> Your best friend in the world right now.<eos> I see SWAT pulling back.<eos> Gives me hope we can resolve this without anybody getting dead.<eos> I want a Gulfstream, fueled up and a bus to take me there.<eos> 2:00 p.m.<eos> For every second you're late, I kill a hostage.<eos> You've got four hours.<eos> All right, get Buckley here now.<eos> And-and I want Nikki to find Charlie and-and figure out what's going on with these cameras... how they got them, and I want them back.
What?<eos> So are my keys.<eos> Gina, where is the guy I just brought in for abdominal pain? Trauma bay four.<eos> He's not there.<eos> Maybe he went to the bathroom or something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Duke!<eos> No?<eos> Nothing.<eos> The signs were all over the place with this guy, and you missed them.
Well, good morning to you, Joel.<eos> Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.<eos> Another late night, huh?<eos> I'm sorry, did I wake you when I came in?<eos> No. But I can tell exactly what you did after you got home.<eos> You poured a glass of wine, you had some popcorn then fell asleep watching the TV.<eos> Let me ask you a question.<eos> - Are your shoes afraid of the dark?<eos> - No. Then could you put them in the closet, please?
What, like brainwashing or something?<eos> It's the storm.<eos> How d'you know that?<eos> You don't know that?<eos> When weird stuff happens, it's always the storm.<eos> Haven't you worked that out yet?<eos> He's got a point.<eos> Did you just suddenly grow a set of balls?<eos> I've always had a set of balls.<eos> You've just never seen them.
Great place, right?<eos> Great? This place is amazing.<eos> Everywhere I look, it's, like, my favorite kind of porn is about to break out.<eos> What's your un-favorite kind of porn?<eos> Well, the German stuff is a little rough.<eos> No wonder they started two world wars.<eos> So, Lesbian Me...<eos> Yes, Straight Man Me?<eos> Which one of these ladies would be very open-minded or so drunk that they might mistake me for a woman?<eos> Well, I don't know them at all, but I heard they're into Dutch boys.
Which typically would indicate that he's disorganized.<eos> This crime scene screams of organization.<eos> The roses, the dog.<eos> He was a stranger to these women.<eos> He didn't talk his way in, he was laying in wait.<eos> And he knew his prints wouldn't show up in the system.<eos> He had no priors, which means he was smart and most likely educated.<eos> This guy knew exactly what he was doing and he made sure he had enough time to do it.<eos> So, he knew when she'd leave the house and when she'd return.<eos> He's stalking them.
- Why not?<eos> - That's where Sheldon sits.<eos> He can't sit somewhere else?<eos> In the winter, that seat's close enough to the radiator so he's warm yet not so close that he sweats.<eos> In the summer, it's in the path of a breeze created by opening windows there.<eos> It faces the television at an angle that isn't direct so he can talk yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.<eos> Perhaps there's hope for you after all.<eos> - I love your shoes. - Oh, thanks.<eos> They are cute, aren't they?<eos> - Where'd you get them?
'Calling woman and child.<eos> This is the voice of Britain.<eos> 'Come to London and lay your burdens down.<eos> 'Here there is safety, food and shelter...'<eos> Nothing personal, Jo, but you do go on.<eos> 2 children, Bill.<eos> Well, you are a dark horse.<eos> Sorry, this is Susan.<eos> And Imogen.<eos> I met them on the way here.
Dyslexia does not exist.<eos> It is a fashion phenomenon invented by a German doctor in the 1960's and therefore it is not a real medical condition.<eos> Are you fuckin' with me?<eos> -No, I am not.<eos> It's scientifically proven.<eos> I don't fucking care about stuff like that!<eos> I'm the boss here, not you, so you better learn this!<eos> This is how prison works, you see.<eos> It's not just me...<eos> These are just rules and you obey them like all of us.
Why are they mine?<eos> Here, this is also yours.<eos> Let's go confirm this now.<eos> Confirm with whom?<eos> Let's go together and confirm this.<eos> I have to take off the heels when I enter the house.<eos> You have to let him see you in those heels.<eos> They're new so it's all right.<eos> Shin Woo hyung.<eos> Kang Shin Woo, I saw that you bought these heels but kept them in the car boot so I took them out to see who they're for.

In other words, oral frequency emissions spoken, or sung, exert powerful control over life, vibrating genes that influence total well-being and even evolution of the species.<eos> A degradation of language in this case is shown to affect biology.<eos> If something as basic and important as language can be degraded and devalued to such a degree, yet never questioned, what else might we be missing?<eos> Think of an aspect of your life that dictates the limits of your freedom.<eos> Government and law enforcement, insurance and pharmaceutical companies, taxes, building permits, drivers licenses, and more.<eos> There are hundreds if not thousands of stipulations, regulations, and boundaries on our freedom.<eos> And out of the ones that were just mentioned how many have you researched to find out whether they apply to you or not?<eos> Let's look at the forms of law that we currently acquiesce to.<eos> Law<eos> A common misconception among people is that any rule or regulation that governs them falls under one category
Under a "Law" of nature, every one of this lactose-intolerant cells would have died.<eos> But surprisingly, they all survived.<eos> Every one of them understood the problem that they were facing, and replaced the defective lactase-enzyme with a functioning one to utilize lactose for food.<eos> If a cell has the ability to decide how and when to evolve because it's facing extinction then anything can.<eos> The existing beliefs are that a human body is a biochemical machine controlled by genes.<eos> And therefore, the behavior, emotion, and characters of our biology, our health, our lives are controlled by genes which we don't control.<eos> So this is what we taught people:<eos> You're a victim, genes control your life, you didn't pick them, you can't change them, the genes you end up with program what's gonna happen.<eos> My experiments on stem cells, which I started in 1967 I'd isolate one stem cell, put it in a Petri dish and then it would divide every 10 hours.<eos> So I took all the cells, split them up into 3 groups and then just put them in 3 Petri dishes.
Nice to meet you.<eos> Did Sun Woo hyung hire you as my guide?<eos> What?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're going to the city, right?<eos> Let me take you.<eos> Let me get your bags.<eos> No, it's alright.<eos> No, that is a tour guide's job.<eos> Give them all to me.
We still have a deal.<eos> Now, get the girl and go.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> We only got a deal, we trust each other.<eos> And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.<eos> You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.<eos> You got guns on us.<eos> You decide to shoot, we're dead.<eos> U p top, they got grenades.<eos> They drop them down here, you're dead.
Just not his own. That would be poison to him.<eos> Once his third eye is released, he'll cross over.<eos> Nothing will be able to contain him, not even the runes.<eos> How do you stop him from crossing over?<eos> There has to be a way.<eos> The bones.<eos> The bones.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But someone will have to go outside.<eos> He brought his ancestors' bones from Germany and made them into a kind of armor.
Do you want to stay alive?<eos> You're not even drinking blood yet.<eos> I doubt you'd be much good in a fight.<eos> Well, what if they hurt someone?<eos> People can look out for themselves.<eos> You've been looking out for me.<eos> Why?<eos> Why? Because I'm an idiot, that's why.<eos> Only an idiot would spit in the eye of Mr. Tiny.<eos> Because he doesn't just kill people, he brings them back, as well.
That's not possible, because I checked this milk.<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> Let's go.<eos> What if we say we just get a muffin, huh?<eos> Tomorrow, can we make pancakes?<eos> Honey, I don't know if I have the right stuff for that,<eos> - you know, supply-wise or skill-wise.<eos> - I can help you.<eos> I got a better idea.<eos> How about we leave a note for Graciella, she can make some pancakes, put them in the freezer, we'll thaw them out and eat them tomorrow, huh?
George?<eos> The shuttle's leaving.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Sweetheart, listen to me.<eos> I'm not gonna be there.<eos> - No.<eos> - This is the only way you'll survive.<eos> Are you still on the ship?<eos> You have to be here!<eos> The shuttles will never make it if I don't fight them off.
Everyone dies.<eos> The rules are simple.<eos> At least, that's how my brother sees it.<eos> One, avoid the infected at all costs.<eos> Their breath is highly contagious.<eos> Two, disinfect anything they've touched in the last 24 hours.<eos> Three, the sick are already dead.<eos> They can't be saved.<eos> You break the rules, you die.<eos> You follow them, you live.
- Holy shit.<eos> Listen to this.<eos> "According to sources close to the family, "Kemp had became romantically obsessed with Dr. Wright "since his wife's death in a car accident last February.<eos> "Despite police efforts, Kemp remains at large."<eos> Wait, what...<eos> Look.<eos> Look what she's wearing.<eos> The pearls.<eos> Rachel said they were a gift from an old patient.<eos> She put them around my neck.
Dames, they're like horses.<eos> They spook easy.<eos> Cheers, Dutch.<eos> Never soil your wingman.<eos> -Sorry.<eos> -You're learning on your feet.<eos> You know, if we were actually out, uh, chasing tail tonight I'd turn your gaffe into a funny.<eos> Girls, they love to laugh.<eos> Especially at men.<eos> Makes them feel more powerful, which in turn makes them feel more comfortable.

She can control her sphincter.<eos> Hello, Blanca.<eos> I've been told that you've been asleep for a very long time.<eos> But the nuns are very happy with your improvement over the past few weeks.<eos> I've been sent here to close down this sanatorium.<eos> Do you have anywhere to go?<eos> My house... is right there... out there.<eos> All right.<eos> Here, your things.<eos> They brought them from the storeroom yesterday.
- What do the women do?<eos> - Oh, other things.<eos> - No one said anything.<eos> - No, that would be rude.<eos> - Right.<eos> I like your dress.<eos> - This is a galabia. - Hmm.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - They're quite something, aren't they?<eos> - I promised Mark, my husband, I would see them with him.
Just as European scholars wrote down every other art and science, the science of defense was also documented and recorded.<eos> Many of the old fighting manuals and treaties that were written during the 15th and 16th centuries have recently been rediscovered and are now being studied worldwide.<eos> We focus on mainly German manuals but also Italian manuals, 15th century and 16th century.<eos> My personal favorite is Talhoffer.<eos> For the most part the Italian books, the German books and the Spanish books on the fighting arts have been forgotten, hidden in old libraries and monasteries in old archives and universities.<eos> Unfortunately, very little research had been done on them.<eos> For the most part, they had not been looked at for hundreds of years.<eos> Today these old texts are once again being systematically studied and the ancient fighting skills are being reborn.<eos> In the text the old masters actually request that the students study the source literature and in one instance they ask that they add to the text, bringing their own ideas to it and expanding upon it.<eos> These arts existed in various forms because they evolved together hand in hand with the societies that created them.
Get the car ready.<eos> Little collateral damage, but we're back on track with the deal.<eos> Now it's all about the golf game.<eos> How's your back?<eos> - Tight.<eos> - Untighten it.<eos> Because Nishamura uses golf as a metaphor for life.<eos> So if you mess that up, it's sayonara, Nishamura.<eos> - One of my little magic pills.<eos> - My housekeeper happens to arrange them in an organized circular fashion, like so.
Hi, hi.<eos> Paulla!<eos> We were wondering if you were coming back...<eos> If?<eos> Of course I was coming back!<eos> Of course I was!<eos> So... what did I miss?<eos> What's... what's been going on?<eos> Well, it got very bad afer you left, Gaius.<eos> They bring us supplies and men would come and take them away... by force.
If your faith is not strong enough.<eos> I want to be close to you as long as you live.<eos> Volmar... let me introduce Richardis von Stade.<eos> She is a very bright girl.<eos> She can help us transcribe the texts.<eos> - Yes!<eos> I have nice handwriting!<eos> That's my mother's opinion.<eos> We'll have to help you take our rules seriously.<eos> I take them seriously.
Yeah, basically I've taken that same photo with that composition for, I think, every three months for the past four years.<eos> And it's just a photograph of the backyard. Looking out, you can see the hills in the distance.<eos> It's just like a little project that I set up for myself when we got here.<eos> And what was in the April 28th photograph that was different?<eos> Well, it's basically the same shot, but it would appear that Alice is standing against the fence.<eos> Do you remember what the reaction in the house was at the time?<eos> I wouldn't say the mood was good, but it was better than before.<eos> It was like.. . Like it gave us sort of something to focus on, I think.<eos> All of us.<eos> The photographs were taken on the 3rd of April, and they were developed on the 4th, and I looked at them, I think on the 5th. And looked at the dams and the water levels and I was quite happy.
Come in.<eos> Come in. I can't believe it.<eos> Okay, careful.<eos> Just because the door was locked, doesn't mean that no one's here.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Is anyone here?<eos> Maybe we should take our shoes off. Right?<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> We can leave them by the door.
Oh, shit. Um, uh...<eos> Shit.<eos> Okay, can you stay there?<eos> Oh my God.<eos> Come on.<eos> Fuck. Fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Oh, please, help!<eos> No, God damn it!<eos> I've taken five different chocolate bars and melted them in these diapers.
I was walking for two days, probably tasted like shit, just couldn't tell.<eos> I'll eat it, I'll eat it again.<eos> You know they gave me these files on all of ya. and seeing Jerry isn't here, I thought we should talk about what brought each of you here.<eos> You have the files, just read them, don't wanna talk about 'em.<eos> Actually Candy, yours was on top.<eos> So I got paid for sex.<eos> Big deal!<eos> Prada, Jimmy Choo, Chanel are expensive!<eos> A girl need her accessories.<eos> I'm not going to wear the wrong shoes because my daddy wouldn't buy them for me.
It's difficult to say, who makes what.<eos> We find together some times.<eos> Andr? walks work we individually.<eos> That, this is Bob, veteran from the Winter War in Finland.<eos> The schoolteacher, The Wise, is an expert in to find information about everything and all.<eos> Storebjørn, expert in ladies, always ready for party.<eos> And Lill-bear, good at weapons.<eos> The rumours says, to have to they shoot the man, shoot they also the wife.<eos> The wine merchant exchanges information.<eos> Sells them to us and the Germans.
It's over, Chris.<eos> We made it.<eos> We don't need to worry any more.<eos> Why d'you take the letter out of my pocket?<eos> The only real proof of her suicide.<eos> Maybe because she didn't write it herself?<eos> Could this be your handwriting?<eos> Vincent deceived every single one of us.<eos> You saw those images, Chris.<eos> - Yes, I saw them.
He disappeared into air.<eos> But then two weeks ago we got a letter.<eos> And in this letter there was a picture of him and his phone number and address.<eos> He was driving a cab in Toronto.<eos> And on the very same day, he got a letter too.<eos> And in it was a picture of me and my phone number, and a round trip ticket to New York.<eos> See?<eos> So for the past two weeks I believe in miracles.<eos> - And the letters were?<eos> - We don't know who sent them.
Ignore him.<eos> Go away, poor boy.<eos> We don't want you around.<eos> Go away, poor boy.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> You've been sent off the field too?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did you forget your sneakers?<eos> I brought them, but I didn't wear them on purpose.
Hi.<eos> You've been sent off the field too?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did you forget your sneakers?<eos> I brought them, but I didn't wear them on purpose.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I wanted to be with you.<eos> Are all your shoes like that?<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> My dad gets them from the dump.
Yes, I agree with that.<eos> - Tell you what I'm going to do.<eos> - Ok. - You know, you look like good people. - I try.<eos> I think, I'm gonna round it down to an even 8 grand.<eos> It, $8,000?<eos> Is this an ok time? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, come on in.<eos> I'm sorry I haven't signed the papers.<eos> I'll get to it this week.<eos> Actually, I'm glad you haven't signed them.
I need to think about my next step<eos> On my way here... I saw the stars are all out tonight.<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's have a look.<eos> Look!<eos> Aren't they beautiful?<eos> Stars only twinkle... when seen from earth.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Without the wind moving high above... the stars would be just boring points of light.<eos> So... they are more beautiful... if you see them from afar.
We can't depend on oil from other countries, any more.<eos> I could say we should draw for our own. But folks don't wanna hear that either.<eos> Tear up our own soil?<eos> Forget it.<eos> The problem with Americans is we, we don't wanna make sacrifices.<eos> Well, we have to.<eos> And if you truly wanna save the planet, to rely less on petroleum, to reduce the green house gas emissions, we simply have to commit to the nuclear power industry.<eos> Are there some risks involved?<eos> Sure. Like with everything.<eos> There're bigger risks in building nuclear bombs, but we do so because we consider them necessary.
How did he do?<eos> I'm afraid John isn't quite ready for our school.<eos> I'm sorry I've wasted your time.<eos> What did you do?<eos> What's he doing down there?<eos> So... this is where you shot Locke and left him for dead?<eos> Yes, Hugo, I was standing right where you are now when I pulled the trigger.<eos> I should've realised at the time it was pointless. But I really wasn't thinking clearly.<eos> Is that why you killed all these people too?<eos> I didn't kill them.
no!<eos> Was... was that just... is that sofia?<eos> Is that sofia?<eos> Have you figured out the coordinates yet,james?<eos> Please.<eos> Almost.<eos> Wrong answer.<eos> - No!<eos> - No!<eos> I'll get them for you when we get out of here,I swear.
There was a scandal at home.<eos> Her brother was crying, he said, "don't go it will be bad".<eos> The journalist told us that these people were buying and selling girls.<eos> By the time I arrived at her home the next day Darija's mother told me that she left for the so-called headquarters.<eos> They were all there already.<eos> The gilrs were supposed to leave from there.<eos> I went there.<eos> There was a room, no, a big hall, with beds, a dozen beds.<eos> And all the girls were sitting with their things packed.<eos> Waiting for somebody to pick them up from here.
Hope.<eos> Just have a little faith.<eos> I've got the most meticulous plan you can imagine.<eos> I've done extensive researches as far as across the layout of the prison what screws they use, what bolts they use.<eos> Getting outside these walls is just the beginning.<eos> We gonna need money.<eos> I'll have it.<eos> And people in the outside.<eos> People that can help you disappear.<eos> I've already got them.
When Prison Break Behind the Walls continues.<eos> In just the first 7 episodes of Prison Break,<eos> Michael Scofield has put in motion an elaborate and dangerous plan to save his brother from death row.<eos> - I'm getting you out of here.<eos> - It's impossible.<eos> Not if you designed the place, it isn't.<eos> His plan involves getting himself arrested and thrown into the same prison, an intricate tattoo that hides the map of the jail<eos> - You've seen the blueprints?<eos> - Better than that.<eos> I've got them on me.
Will doesn't care about anything but himself.<eos> This isn't a fairy tale. They won't come back.<eos> This is not your world, Will!<eos> Angelika. You know, don't you?<eos> The story, it's happening to us now.<eos> We're living it.<eos> It's alive, it's real, it's breathing.<eos> And we can give it a happy ending.<eos> Jake... Angelika, we'll find your sisters.<eos> All right? We'll bring them back.
Whatever you do, keep going. Keep going! Go!<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> They're ours.<eos> They're ours.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Come on.<eos> The souls of the just are in the hands of God where no torment shall touch them.
I was hoping he also helped women.<eos> Casey, you're not sick.<eos> You're single.<eos> You just have to relax and enjoy the ride.<eos> I haven't been ridden in months.<eos> On that happy note, I'm gonna go see if anybody interesting came in tonight.<eos> -You mean, besides me.<eos> -Right.<eos> Bye.<eos> I'll go get those girls, bring them over here... and we'll have a conversation like human beings.

I'm not me, I'm Allegra.<eos> But you're really not, so... .<eos> Okay, Albert, end of the night, you're dropping me off at home.<eos> -Show me the magic.<eos> -l'm not comfortable with this.<eos> God, Albert, I had such a wonderful time with you.<eos> Yeah, how about those Knicks?<eos> You see what I'm doing?<eos> This is a signal. I'm fiddling with my keys.<eos> A woman that doesn't want a kiss... takes her keys out, puts them in the door, goes in the house.
I just think you should forget about him.<eos> That's all I mean.<eos> He needs this-all the attention and the control- and he doesn't even know it.<eos> He needs Mom.<eos> What are you doing down here this time of night?<eos> I want to see the television cameras.<eos> You in that spelling contest tomorrow?<eos> - I don't see them.<eos> - The cameras?<eos> I guess they don't bring them till the morning.
I thought you were like that.<eos> - My lady.<eos> - Am I?<eos> These plants— If they were children, you'd be prosecuted.<eos> I do water them.<eos> When I remember.<eos> You say you're all into saving lives around the world,<eos> But you let your poor plants die.<eos> I say put people first.<eos> Why don't you water them?
- I'm kind of a slow reader.<eos> - Perfect. I'm a slow listener.<eos> "The art<eos> "of "losing..."<eos> - You know, I should just get back to work.<eos> - What is it, dyslexia?<eos> - What are you, a teacher?<eos> - Professor, retired.<eos> Just take your time, Maggie.<eos> Listen to the words as you're about to say them.
Henrik.<eos> - Hi, Bent.<eos> Come in and sit down.<eos> I'm ready to start working again.<eos> - Yes ...<eos> If I still have my job, that is.<eos> Of course you have, the water funks still have 4 or 5 lessons to go.<eos> Why don't you join Pede for a while?<eos> What about my children's classes?<eos> - I gave them to someone else.
- Soul, comes with me.<eos> - It Take care where do you step.<eos> Soul!<eos> - Dependable to my mão...<eos> - I Have a surprise for you!<eos> Hello.<eos> I bought two boxes of Milk for you.<eos> - 120 kilos.<eos> - 120?<eos> - Dear, where did you put them?
Soul!<eos> - Dependable to my mão...<eos> - I Have a surprise for you!<eos> Hello.<eos> I bought two boxes of Milk for you.<eos> - 120 kilos.<eos> - 120?<eos> - Dear, where did you put them?<eos> - In The bank of backwards of the car.<eos> The Jack can go seek-them.

There is some problem?<eos> I say you only a time. And não I am it joke.<eos> Everything what não I know... all the things that I não I know...<eos> Went kill you, if I came It know them.
Mr. Carter?<eos> I'm...<eos> Junior Battle's mother.<eos> Yes, ma'am, I remember you.<eos> Willa Battle.<eos> - How may I help you, ma'am?<eos> - I got a phone call today... from a coach at a junior college in Sacramento.<eos> They wanna see Junior play this Friday.<eos> Well, that's great, ma'am, but Junior broke some rules...<eos> And I agree with them.
Oh yes, that is.<eos> And he was the one who murdered her.<eos> This legend is too much for just one person.<eos> Who was that?<eos> And what he does not know can me no harm.<eos> Maybe I'm crazy but I am not an idiot. I tell you one word ...<eos> - Webcam.<eos> - I do not know what you are talking about.<eos> Shut up, you enormous mountain of shit.<eos> You took my pills. Threw them in your blue bag ... and rode away with your friends.
Phew. You know, she's not just another notch on the old belt.<eos> I don't even wear a belt.<eos> I'm a very powerful man.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> See you for dinner.<eos> So I am president of the Environment Defense League.<eos> And I pick up this little sea otter and wipe off the oil from the tanker spill.<eos> You gotta step this up already.<eos> I'm gonna give you the damn eye drops.<eos> No, I don't want them.
- What room?<eos> - The room you say you've never seen.<eos> - It's not locked anymore.<eos> - No, child, you don't know what you've seen.<eos> You're gonna tell me right now.<eos> Or I'm leaving.<eos> You're not from the South.<eos> You won't understand.<eos> That room up there, you just don't go in and throw things out of a room like that.<eos> You leave them just where you found them.
She didn't wait for you.<eos> And now she can never come back.<eos> You must forget you ever had a sister.<eos> We are your only family now.<eos> " Dear Satsu and little Chiyo:<eos> As one who was once an orphan child myself this humble person is sorry to inform you that six weeks after you left for your new life in Miyako the suffering of your honoured mother came to its end.<eos> And only a few weeks afterward your honoured father departed this world as well.<eos> This humble person feels confident both your honoured parents have found their places in paradise. But happily..."<eos> At the temple there is a poem called "Loss" carved into the stone.<eos> It has three words. But the poet has scratched them out.
It was nice to meet you, Mr. Burroughs.<eos> It was nice meeting you, Ms. Huttinger.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Blunt testicular trauma.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, no, I'm good.<eos> Everything...<eos> Everything's very clear to me now.<eos> You know, I came up here looking for answers, and I got them.
- Can I see it?<eos> I think it came in the ventilation shaft.<eos> But they went extinct with the contamination.<eos> I know.<eos> And how did it get by the pathogen sensors?<eos> - It must be too small.<eos> - No, it's not too small.<eos> How did it survive out there, anyway?<eos> How does anyone survive?<eos> They keep finding people and bringing them here.
Now where was I?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Doomed!<eos> - What's with you?<eos> - It's my father.<eos> He's... He's...<eos> "Can't wait to meet your wife and kids and see your big house on the hill.<eos> Cordially, your father, Papi." So?<eos> So Papi said I have to have all those things if I'm ever gonna be a success.<eos> And I once had them, but I lost them!
Come on, let me, darling.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come to me, you little cunt.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Until next time.<eos> Left alone without my usual activities I started to have other feelings.<eos> I felt solemn and melancholy.<eos> I didn't mind these feelings but I preferred not to have them.<eos> I wanted to know where they came from. Why I had them.
Blood consists of hormones, neurotransmitters, and etc.<eos> And deep inside the brain lies a molecular clock.<eos> Blood circulates through cells, controlling a molecular clock.<eos> Thus, it controls one's health and destiny.<eos> Wow, you've studied it a lot.<eos> That's only the basics.<eos> However, you may call it science, but I don't buy it.<eos> It's nothing but prejudice.<eos> There are 6 billion people on earth.<eos> And you categorize them by 4 types of blood?
I haven't seen him, but I can feel it.<eos> How do you know it's a guy?<eos> It could be an old lady.<eos> Where is the clerk?<eos> He'll be here soon.<eos> - Let's browse some.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Young-mi?<eos> Did you see our stuff here?<eos> - I checked them in. - What about the cake?
Nice.<eos> Can this support a lot of weight?<eos> Hello?<eos> I have one last favour to ask you.<eos> That doesn't hurt a bit.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Arms up!<eos> Head up.<eos> You didn't get your balls fixed...<eos> Let's get them fixed this winter.
- we wanna watch again.<eos> Please, please, one more time!<eos> what's it good for?<eos> - Keep away, don't touch!<eos> There he is!<eos> - Stand still!<eos> So this is your glowing pearl!<eos> As if, a ghost's treasure!<eos> we've seen how to stuff rat holes with it.<eos> We have a lot of rat holes, stuff them with your ball.
Let's go.<eos> What?<eos> Your passport.<eos> I have a spare key.<eos> Come on.<eos> Now you tell me.<eos> - You idiot!<eos> - Ow!<eos> Hide your shoes.<eos> - I haven't taken them off.
Yes.<eos> Why do you want to know?<eos> Did you see someone yesterday, perhaps a woman with blond hair, with brown-green eyes, in a light coat?<eos> Are you from the police?<eos> - No.<eos> Look, she's my girlfriend and she didn't come home last night, and I I really don't know where she is now.<eos> Yes, she was here.<eos> I saw her straight away.<eos> She sat in the corner over there and had quite a lot to drink.<eos> She wrote some letters and then crumpled them up.
Yes, she was here.<eos> I saw her straight away.<eos> She sat in the corner over there and had quite a lot to drink.<eos> She wrote some letters and then crumpled them up.<eos> She left her handbag here.<eos> I haven't taken anything.<eos> There was no money in it.<eos> Just a couple of women's things, an envelope and a ticket from a photo shop.<eos> What happened to the letters?<eos> We threw them away.
Trailed the fallen leaves to here?<eos> Or were you drunken by the perfume?<eos> Or were you possessed by the night?<eos> No one saw us, right?<eos> - Yes, sir!<eos> - Let's go.<eos> I swear it was the Defense Minister's old assistant, Gu Jang-gon.<eos> I clearly remember because I served under Minister Song in the last war.<eos> They're smarter than I thought.<eos> They installed bellows in the boat, made the fake coins while riding in the canal, and also distribute them.
Look, we are here, your siblings are here.<eos> Hüseyin, Ayþegül, your grand aunt.<eos> We are all here.<eos> You don't have to go to school today.<eos> Teachers wouldn't give homework, this is the first day of school.<eos> Look, you'll have new friends there, they'll like you so much.<eos> Look, there are horses here.<eos> We can drive tractor, I can teach you how to it.<eos> Actually, do you know that people don't die?<eos> God takes them to his side.
And I began to read.<eos> Since I seem to be the only person called to this meeting today has been a direct target of accusations of allegedly responsible CPRM.<eos> I take this opportunity to speak in a personal tone and show how unfair can this concept of interpretation and opinion letters and how many times can mean more than just slander.<eos> And I began to destroy all their accusations, showing, leaving no doubt, that all accusations were wrong and false, and they waved and waved.<eos> They said that "Under the Blade" was about sadomasochism, when the operation was about our guitarist throat.<eos> Does not take much imagination to conclude it is something more than surgery and hospitals, and neither are mentioned in the song.<eos> Does not require much imagination, but I have said at one point Dump the songs of imagination, experiences and dreams of people in the letters.<eos> People can interpret in many ways.<eos> Ms. Gore was looking for sadomasochism and found him.<eos> Anyone looking for surgical references may also find them.
She pretends she's injured and is taken to the casualty ward.<eos> Why the casualty ward?<eos> In Italy, there is no surveillance in casualty wards.<eos> People walk in and out all the time.<eos> Angelino, come on!<eos> Won't you bring the fish?<eos> Inspector, forgive me for interrupting. My son-in-law caught them today.<eos> Can you smell the sea?<eos> - Great!<eos> How will you cook them?
- Let's take the car.<eos> - No, let's walk.<eos> How's daddy's little boy?<eos> - I can't help it if I fancy you!<eos> - People are looking at us!<eos> - Has Salvo had his feed?<eos> - Of course.<eos> He smiled at me!<eos> Catarella, what's with the moped?<eos> Well... I collect snails early in the morning to take them to my aunt Carmela who cooks them for me.
Inspector.<eos> Mr. Scozzese... you said she never went out but there are clothes and perfume here.<eos> Did she dress up and put perfume on to watch TV?<eos> Actually, she had started going out more recently.<eos> She'd bought herself a scooter and sometimes came home late.<eos> There she is, that's Eva.<eos> - Did she have any friends?<eos> - Yes, she did. She told me about them sometimes.<eos> They were all Eastern European girls.<eos> - But I didn't know them.
- What about here?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> When you're done here, go to the other side of the railway.<eos> Yes, Inspector.<eos> - Catarella...<eos> - Inspector.<eos> - What are you doing? - I was looking at the sheep.<eos> Nice sheep, and I'm an expert on them.<eos> When I was a boy, I'd go with my uncle Salvatore and I'd ask him, "How can you spend so much time alone?"<eos> He'd say that the sheep kept him company and he listened to them.
Talking won't solve anything.<eos> Get some stones.<eos> Stones?<eos> Too small.<eos> Eat.<eos> Eat what?<eos> The stones.<eos> I can't.<eos> Put them in your mouth.<eos> I'll fucking put them in for you!
Mitsuko died?<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Funeral...<eos> There was no funeral.<eos> Mitsuko did not die.<eos> After that day, you never left the house.<eos> Meanwhile, I was sent to live with a foster family.<eos> I came back repeatedly to see you.<eos> You were writing "letters of apology."<eos> But you wrote them from the perspective of a child who killed her mother.
You can't give a language to a people until it's cleaned up and fixed.<eos> Get a grip!<eos> -Do you know what faith is?<eos> -T ell us.<eos> You have to believe in Jesus - He'll give you eternal life.<eos> Me?<eos> Believe in Jesus?<eos> And you in Mohammed?<eos> !<eos> I have all the words here, but I'm not giving them away yet.
These are people with university degrees, with education, with good grades!<eos> Shumar - number 5.<eos> Jashar - number 4.<eos> Fejm - number 1.<eos> Begin!<eos> Winning this trophy in Shutka means more than winning the World Cup in soccer.<eos> Uncle Jashar has won the most trophies, and everyone wants to take him down.<eos> I am a perfectionist.<eos> This cassette is 30 years old, and it doesn't have a single stain, not one.<eos> Every year I put 100 cassettes into my private bathtub, and I wash and dry them.
How was it, Ito?<eos> Did you capture us?<eos> Perfectly.<eos> In all your youth!<eos> Good shots?<eos> Great!<eos> Sci-Fi Club It's these uniforms that do it!<eos> Worn only twice...<eos> You get bored.<eos> I'll do them now.
Did you have a nightmare?<eos> No. I was awake. And I saw it.<eos> Tell us what you saw.<eos> That man we watched on tv once. What man?<eos> Him.<eos> Jordan collier?<eos> Someone's going to kill him.<eos> As far as this department knew. Maia wasn't having visions anymore.<eos> Right?<eos> Well. She was keeping them secret from me and writing everything down in a diary.
Was it hard for you not to see me?<eos> It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.<eos> I think about you every single day.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Is that me?<eos> That was the day we brought you back from the hospital.<eos> You look the same as you do now.<eos> I was gone so long. But... to me... this feels like yesterday.<eos> You want to talk about collier?<eos> He uses people up and leaves them on the curb.
I'm proud of you, Jack.<eos> We found his car.<eos> What would my father be doing here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That's my father's Jacket.<eos> Where is the man you took these from?<eos> Hey!<eos> Where is he?<eos> Come on.<eos> If for some reason this doesn't work, tell my girls I love them...
- White power!<eos> - Better yet, maybe we can play ball on Saturday.<eos> I'll meet you there.<eos> I've got a neck hair fitting at 11:00.<eos> [Narrator] Gob was both angry... and overwhelmed... by the approval from this new father figure.<eos> It was confusing.<eos> Michael was less torn and went to brag to his father.<eos> So, apparently my ideas aren't so bad, and that comes from Sitwell himself.<eos> - You let your ideas go to Sitwell?<eos> I gave them to Gob... who, uh, works there now.
I have terminal breast cancer.<eos> Dr. Cottle will verify the diagnosis.<eos> I have a few months to live.<eos> And in that time, I will lead the people to salvation.<eos> It is my sole purpose.<eos> Praise be to the gods.<eos> Here is our salvation.<eos> - Sergeant of the Guard!<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Remove these people from the brig and escort them back to their shuttle.
- But not to see the girl?<eos> - How is that relevant?<eos> - You know a better question?<eos> Why do you think you get to decide what's relevant?<eos> You're a principal of a high school.<eos> - We need all the sex tapes you confiscated.<eos> I'll just get a warrant, and in the application for a warrant, I'll include your admission that you let students swap sex tapes.<eos> He's not refusing to provide you with the tapes.<eos> "Absolutely not" sounds like a refusal.<eos> When we confiscate the tapes, we turn them over to local law enforcement.
Tom said "a hip, sexy aunt. "<eos> The script says running suit.<eos> Well, unless I'm running to an old-age home, this ain't it.<eos> Hey, how about juicy couture, you know?<eos> It's cute colors, it's got the drawstring. That could be good.<eos> - It could work.<eos> - Well, do you have a juicy ass?<eos> What?<eos> You're very lucky you said that to me, okay?<eos> 'Cause if you had said it to one of these girls with the body-image issues- How are they supposed to go out there and perform after you've destroyed them?
- According to his diary, 1,400 and...<eos> - 88.<eos> Luring him out was your idea, right?<eos> Greenway?<eos> Elle. I don't send a SWAT team into a house with children.<eos> Hotch says your background is in sex offender cases.<eos> What can you tell us?<eos> The last 4 murders show he's an anger-excitation rapist.<eos> He'll keep a victim for a couple of days.<eos> He probably records or videotapes them so that he can keep reliving the fantasy.
I haven't been sleeping very well lately.<eos> Y'ever have any weird dreams ?<eos> Like nightmares ?<eos> Everybody has bad dreams.<eos> It's the brain's way of processing the stuff we don't want to deal with.<eos> Right.<eos> Help me out some of these boxes in the garage.<eos> What is all this stuff anyway ?<eos> I'm not sure exactly.<eos> Most of it belonged to my father. These things belonged to your father and you've never looked at them ?
My trailer here at the camp is small, but it's big enough for the three of us.<eos> And I painted it your favorite color at least it will be now.<eos> The paint was left over from my last job at the Pink Lobster.<eos> Their idea of a tip.<eos> Only one more month.<eos> I will be waiting.<eos> Remember, this is for our boy.<eos> Be safe, my love.<eos> Hey. You know that rundown homes that we pass on the way to the lake ?<eos> Yeah, the workers use them when they were cutting that timber.
I'll do better this time.<eos> I promise.<eos> I'm afraid our lessons are over.<eos> What did you got ?<eos> Erica, she tries to escape.<eos> She sees his face and he kills her.<eos> And you have no idea if what you saw is Erica's future or her past?<eos> No, but either way we gotta keep looking right ?<eos> There's nothing about this guy that feels remotely familiar too me.<eos> He takes his victims and then lets them go.

It's crazy.
No, we came to tell you one.<eos> Man, I loved this record.<eos> This carried me through high school.<eos> You could say it was the soundtrack of our teenage lives.<eos> Look, I got work to do...<eos> You co-wrote these songs... but you never wrote again after Roy died.<eos> How come ?<eos> It's simple.<eos> I lost my inspiration.<eos> Or maybe you never wrote them to begin with.
We'll take her off the firing line, then.<eos> With whatever intervening supervision... I take it these new-arrived Chinese whores...<eos> - to be under your control?<eos> - Well-evaluated, Doc.<eos> I'd be available to see to their care, like I do these here.<eos> Declined, with thanks.<eos> You may not be aware that beyond their afflictions... these girls are fucking starving to death.<eos> I ain't one, Doc, holds the white man's as the sole and only path.<eos> I strive to tolerate what I may not agree with... but those people's culture, their women are disposable.<eos> They ship them unfed, replace them when they expire.
- There's just me left.<eos> - I see.<eos> Could you tell me what happened to those girls?<eos> All six?<eos> I'm asking after my friend Maddie... and Doris that you sent to work with us... and an outside whore, pretty-looking, like a doll.<eos> That, far as I know, when I left Wolcott there last night... to come and get you, was all three still alive.<eos> I'd be curious what happened to the other three.<eos> They're sent away, Cy, never to return or be a problem.<eos> As I won't be either to you or Wolcott.<eos> And I ask after Maddie and Doris and the outside girl, not making a problem... but if Wolcott killed them, and there's remains, to see them buried.
- Come on, Al.<eos> All right!<eos> Look at it!<eos> One gleet chasing a-fucking-nother!<eos> God bless you, Al!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you for saving me, God.<eos> - Are you uncomfortable, girls?<eos> - They're fine.<eos> You're paying them to stand in their position, Mr W... they'll stand in their position.
And to think of Mr Hearst's disturbance if he was to fucking know.<eos> Because... that's a dangerous habit to indulge when you're not among friends.<eos> Are you my friend, Mr Tolliver?<eos> And someone past surprise at habits or inclination, or turns of events... and who don't confuse himself far as sitting in judgement... with our Lord in fucking Heaven.<eos> - I see.<eos> - And... who would never tattle to your employer... or jeopardise what's got to be a handsome fucking income.<eos> Goddamn right, I am your friend, Mr Wolcott.<eos> All I can't provide for the party is the cliff.<eos> Believing yourself past surprise does not commend you to me as a friend.<eos> A man inadequately sophisticated... or merely ignorant, or simply stupid... may believe himself past surprise... then be surprised to discover, for example... that Mr Hearst already knows of my inclinations and finds them immaterial.
I could have killed that Dalek in its cell, but you stopped me.<eos> It was the prize of my collection!<eos> Your collection?<eos> Well, was it worth it?<eos> Worth all those men's deaths? Worth Rose?<eos> Let me tell you something, Van Statten.<eos> Mankind goes into space to explore. To be part of something greater...<eos> Exactly!<eos> I wanted to touch the stars.<eos> You just want to drag the stars down and stick them underground, underneath tons of sand and dirt, and label them.
She shaved her legs for you.<eos> - And?<eos> - And you didn't even kiss her good night.<eos> She shaved her legs for you, and you didn't follow through?<eos> Hey, I follow through.<eos> I always follow through.<eos> You didn't last night.<eos> Mind your own business.<eos> Mind-- she had expectations.<eos> Women have expectations, and you didn't meet them.
So does that one.<eos> They all do.<eos> I'll be damned.<eos> They're Judys.<eos> Judys?<eos> He swallowed the heads of ten Judy dolls.<eos> My mother used to buy me Judy dolls<eos> Manhattan Judy, surfer Judy, disco Judy.<eos> I always wanted one.<eos> I dissected them, cut off their arms, and shaved their heads.
- Sav, Sav.<eos> Maybe Romeo and Juliet were fated to be together, but just for awhile,<eos> and then their time passed.<eos> If they could've known that beforehand, maybe it all would've been okay.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> I like your rack.<eos> God, what is wrong with you?<eos> Why do you have to be so-- god, what is wrong with you?<eos> I like your rack, and I'd want them around if I could have them, trust me, I would.<eos> But it wouldn't be the end of the world if you got rid of them.
Well, not everyone can operate a zipper.<eos> You know, the up, down, what comes next?<eos> My new girlfriend never been with a guy who wasn't circumcised.<eos> So she freaked, and...<eos> And you wanted Rivkah to feel all gemutlicht.<eos> I get it.<eos> It's a shandah.<eos> I got some box cutters and...<eos> Just like Abraham did it.<eos> I sterilized them, which I was told...
Ow! On a scale of one to ten, how painful?<eos> About half as painful as when I punch you in the face.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> It'll hurt you.<eos> Carpal tunnel surgery obviously didn't work.<eos> Who are you?<eos> The little ones call me Uncle Gregg.<eos> Your dad never had carpal tunnel.<eos> You mentioned two obscure diseases to Dr. Chase.<eos> How'd you know about them?
So the cure's killing him!<eos> I want you to call down to Carville, Louisiana, home of the last leper colony in the lower 48.<eos> Get them to send up some thalidomide.<eos> Thalidomide?<eos> Twelve year olds don't have sex, right?<eos> So he can't be pregnant. Make the call.<eos> I need to speak to your boy.<eos> Why does everybody need to know my business?<eos> People like talking about people.<eos> Makes us feel superior. Makes us feel in control. And sometimes, for some people, knowing some things makes them care.
He got her to admit she's got a problem.<eos> She's agreed to outpatient treatment.<eos> He gets lucky a lot.<eos> Did you ever really intend to give me this job, or were you just trying to stop me from stepping down?<eos> Well, you've got two more weeks in charge.<eos> Hopefully the next case will go better.<eos> She should've died.<eos> House is not a hero.<eos> A person who has the guts to break a bad rule, they're a hero.<eos> House doesn't break rules, he ignores them.
We're going to give him a gallium scan just to be safe.<eos> We inject a radioactive isotope into his bloodstream, and we check to see if there's inflammation anywhere in the body.<eos> Has he ever complained of any joint pain? Sensitivity to light?<eos> Rashes?<eos> - No, no.<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Any relatives who've ever been diagnosed with lupus?<eos> I don't even know what that is.<eos> In simple terms, the body becomes allergic to itself.<eos> The immune system attacks healthy cells in the circulatory system and destroys them. Would it be treatable?
She didn't take any pills.<eos> The girl's lying.<eos> Why would she lie?<eos> Because she's another mean little jerk.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - I'm sorry, honey.<eos> Clemmie didn't lie.<eos> I did.<eos> I took the pills.<eos> I told her you gave them to me because I didn't wanna get in trouble.

- Well, I do work, sir. - So, if you don't mind...<eos> - No, I do mind. The Dude minds.<eos> This will not stand, you know. This aggression will not stand, man.<eos> I mean, your wife owes money...<eos> My wife is not the issue here!<eos> I hope that someday my wife will learn to live on her allowance, which is ample.<eos> But if she does not, that is her problem, not mine, just as the rug is your problem.<eos> Just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility, regardless of who he chooses to blame.<eos> I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs.<eos> Some Chinaman took them from me in Korea.
I must confess my evil.<eos> These are my sins.<eos> Your Grace, her mortal sins are not at issue.<eos> She must repent witchcraft.<eos> Perhaps she heads in that direction.<eos> You have been warned.<eos> The Church cannot deny her right to seek God's mercy.<eos> Confession is sacrosanct.<eos> Don't instruct me on the Church's laws!<eos> Then I call upon the doge to demand that the Inquisition abide by them.
Sixteenth in the marathon in Mexico City.<eos> Fourteenth, actually.<eos> And Roscoe Devine.<eos> A 3:57 mile when Jim Ryan ran a 3:56:5.<eos> God, is there anything worse than being second best?<eos> Thanks for coming to see me.<eos> Mr. Dellinger.<eos> How about an easy 10?<eos> We left our running shoes in the car.<eos> Want me to get them for you?
- Cars, cars, come on, think. While I was in the woods, you see any cars go by?<eos> Why, Hank?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> All right. We gotta make this look like it was an accident.<eos> - Come on. - An accident?<eos> Grab his... grab his legs.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> We can't do that.<eos> What do you mean we can't do it?<eos> Because we're gonna make tracks and they're gonna see them and follow 'em. It's gonna be like a crime scene or something.
I've always...<eos> thanks... thanks for everything, but I've always really wanted one of these knives.<eos> Hey, it's not a big town, but the shops are very good because of the holiday-makers and the tourists, you see.<eos> Now, I'll get us some lunch.<eos> Then we've got to make a start.<eos> We've got some especially important work.<eos> We've got a lepidopterist to deal with.<eos> What does the lepidopterist do with the dead moths?<eos> He sticks pins in them, boy.<eos> Keeps them in cases with glass tops.

They'sejustbegun hatching.<eos> Thoughjusthatched, the creatures are overnine feet tall.<eos> They'se begun feeding.<eos> When their foodsupply runs out, they will begin to hunt forfood.<eos> Ifthey get out, they'll multiply, and a newspecies will emerge.<eos> One that could replace us.<eos> Each one ofthese reptiles is born pregnant<eos> These 200 could become 40,000 within this year.<eos> Ifthe military is listening, they must destroy this building now, before these creatures can escape.<eos> They're trapped in the building, but we can't contain them for long.
My sweetie. It's okay.<eos> It's okay to miss me.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You can miss me and you can take me with you.<eos> You can.<eos> And when you're in trouble I'll be there.<eos> When you fall in love, I'll be there.<eos> You can.<eos> I mean, that's how people go on forever.<eos> Because somebody takes them along.
- I'm just trying to protect her.<eos> - And you are protecting her.<eos> I know that.<eos> You're protecting her from seeing something horrible.<eos> But maybe you're protecting her from the wrong things, Dell.<eos> I mean, my life is a mess.<eos> You know that.<eos> And... and you're... you're probably right.<eos> I don't always make the best choices.<eos> But, um, you know, I've always made them with, uh... with Lucas... with Lucas in mind, to protect him.
That's what I said.<eos> Well, so?<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> She dumped me.<eos> I totally trusted her, then one day it was like:<eos> "Okay, bye, Pheebs." Gone!<eos> You know what the saddest part is?<eos> When we were playing together, that was the most fun I've ever had in all my lives.<eos> My favorite shoes, so good to me I wear them every day
Do you know how beautiful you look tonight?<eos> - Not too ostentatious?<eos> - No, never.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Because I don't wanna stand out.<eos> Well, there's no way of avoiding that, is there?<eos> Dalton, Sarah.<eos> Well, I hope Dalton has told you how absolutely beautiful you look this evening.<eos> Well, he did his best.<eos> Will someone tell me who took women out of dresses and put them in three-piece pinstripe suits?
Annie, he's trying to stir up a story any way he can.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> The thing is, Harm, I've already thought it myself.<eos> I mean, they're all dying, Harm.<eos> Maybe this squadron created some kind of, I don't know, bad-karma thing.<eos> Annie, we've already proven why Luke crashed.<eos> - There are scientific reasons for all...<eos> - No, no, I know.<eos> There are always reasons.<eos> And I have accepted them all.
They have a wide variety of counselling services.<eos> What are you implying, lieutenant?<eos> Well, I think you need something that we can't provide.<eos> Bud, did you get the lab report on the Jelke court martial?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> It's on your desk.<eos> - Oh, bad idea, Bud.<eos> - Why, ma'am?<eos> Don't put things on my desk.<eos> I'll never find them.
Let her complete her quals.<eos> Give me a good reason why I would do that.<eos> Because it's the right thing to do.<eos> Guns are loaded and double-checked, lieutenant.<eos> I'm hoping I won't need them.<eos> If you need them, they'll fire.<eos> - Give them hell. - Just like always.<eos> It's okay, Max.<eos> Say goodbye to the girls for me.<eos> Tell them I will think of them every day.
What you mean?<eos> Pull the plug?<eos> - No. No.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> - Maritza thinks it's the best thing too.<eos> No, Maritza's sweet, she gonna listen to anything anybody tells her to.<eos> - I don't want them to kill my baby.<eos> - They're not killing the baby, Miguel.<eos> The machines are keeping the baby alive. if they turn them off, the baby can have a natural death.
Last time on "Star Trek<eos> - Deep Space 9..."<eos> More Jem'Hadar ships come through the wormhole every week.<eos> - lt's going to stop.<eos> - How?<eos> We'll mine the entrance to the wormhole, prevent the Dominion from bringing more reinforcements.<eos> Either you remove the mines or we will take this station from you and remove them ourselves.
Where are they?<eos> According to their warp signatures they should be right there.<eos> Some kind of cloaking device?<eos> I didn't know the Dominion had them.<eos> Or the Cardassians, for that matter.<eos> I'm picking up additional warp signatures bearing 183 mark 97.<eos> 244 mark 12.<eos> 302 mark 133.<eos> Defiant to Ops. Go ahead.<eos> According to our sensor readings there are Dominion ships all around us but we can't see them or get any kind of targeting lock.
Well, I don't know about you... but I feel more comfortable already.<eos> Captain's Log, Stardate 50975.2.<eos> The next Jem'Hadar convoy is due in five days but our efforts to mine the wormhole have already provoked a response from the Dominion who have sent their Vorta ambassador, Weyoun to speak with me.<eos> What can I do for you, Weyoun?<eos> Captain Sisko...<eos> I'll make this brief.<eos> We know all about the mine field.<eos> I assumed you'd find out sooner or later.<eos> As I see it, you have two choices.<eos> Either you remove the mines or we will take this station from you... and remove them ourselves.
Perhaps you should return to Kronos and make your plea in person.<eos> The Chancellor respects you. lf you cannot persuade him, no one can.<eos> I will go to see Gowron and you will come with me.<eos> No. The Chancellor no longer considers me a friend.<eos> I know.<eos> But what could be better?<eos> An ally and an enemy both telling him the same thing.<eos> He'll have no other choice, but to agree.<eos> I need those ships.<eos> And you shall have them.
For the first time I feel time like a heartbeat, the seconds pumping in my breast like a reckoning, the numinous mysteries that once seemed so distant and unreal threatening clarity in the presence of a truth entertained not in youth,<eos> but only in its passage.<eos> I feel these words as if their meaning were weight being lifted from me, knowing that you will read them and share my burden as I have come to trust no other.
I'm gonna go.<eos> I've ordered additional blood work.<eos> I'd like to start in this afternoon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mom, I know what you're going to say, but I don't have any experience being sick.<eos> I promise you, I feel fine.<eos> I don't know why you didn't tell me.<eos> I don't know why you didn't tell me immediately!<eos> I wanted to get all the answers first.<eos> And you found them here?
-I want the dead.<eos> -The dead?<eos> Yeah, these ones and the ones back on the battlefield.<eos> I'm gonna put them to work.<eos> Fine.<eos> Do what you will with them.<eos> This will convince Ming to talk, more than all of Borias' diplomacy.<eos> We sit out here, in the middle of nowhere while all the riches of Chin await us.<eos> Old families of Chin are very powerful.<eos> We could take them one at a time.
'Cause what they might do to you is nothing compared to what I'll do.<eos> Who are you?<eos> My name is Xena.<eos> Xena?<eos> Xena of Corinth?<eos> The Warrior Princess of Kalmae?<eos> The one who defeated Callisto?<eos> You've heard of me.<eos> What do you think we should do?<eos> Well, first, keep your weapons where you can get at them.
No. You keep it.<eos> I was gonna kill her, Your Honor.<eos> She tried to do it herself but she was still alive.<eos> She begged me to finish what she started.<eos> I didn"t know if I could do it or not.<eos> By the time I got back from the kitchen she was dead.<eos> Just your good luck, I guess.<eos> They tell me you"ve waived your right to council.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I tell you, I"ve married people who"ve brought lawyers with them.
He will leave and everything new and unknown that had become so familiar..." ... would be gone.<eos> Did you sleep well?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good.<eos> - More coffee?<eos> - Sure.<eos> I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel I should.<eos> What?<eos> These women friends of yours all over the world, how does it work?<eos> Do you see some of them again, or do you forget others?
Benbrook Oil now reports that oil and gas fumes are growing more dangerous.<eos> And workers are proceeding with caution.<eos> Sensitive coves and beaches are being boomed off to protect endangered wildlife.<eos> At Camp Mowester. Where three killer whales remain stranded the protective booming is already under way.<eos> Jesse.<eos> Jesse!<eos> What's going on?<eos> The boom will seal off the cove.<eos> Keep out oil. Protect the whales.<eos> Protect them?
It left a note?<eos> Unless $5 million is transferred to the following account in 7 days, I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson fleet.<eos> - Is that...?<eos> - That is the virus.<eos> Leonardo da Vinci.<eos> We have 26 ships at sea and don't know which ones are infected.<eos> Well, put the ship's ballast under manual control.<eos> There's no such thing any more.<eos> These ships are totally computerised.<eos> They rely on satellite navigation which links them to our network, and the virus, wherever they are.
All of you, get out of here!<eos> Come on, run!<eos> Run!<eos> Tell everyone the truth.<eos> Boss!<eos> Listen, call Veronica. Tell her I've got footage of Sert's murder.<eos> Acts of terror have become so commonplace in our age... that we run the risk of becoming used to their images... to becoming desensitised to them.<eos> The day that these shocking, horrific images fail to appal us... is the day that we begin to lose some of our humanity.<eos> Let's let these images speak for themselves.<eos> I, for one, will not soon forget them.
An evening party!<eos> If it depended only on me, Charles, I should prefer the theatre.<eos> But I have an obligation to my family.<eos> Then we shall go another time, when you are free to join us.<eos> - Captain Harville, sit with me.<eos> I desperately need a fresh opinion.<eos> I doubt if I could be much help.<eos> perhaps you have not been in Bath long enough to learn to enjoy these parties they give.<eos> They mean nothing to me.<eos> Those who hold them believe the theatre to be beneath their dignity.
Go on, shoot.<eos> Hold everything.<eos> All bets still stand.<eos> At Miss Nugent's request.<eos> Major Sharpe is to refire.<eos> Center, bull's-eye.<eos> Center shot takes the match.<eos> Oh... I'm sorry, Lieutenant.<eos> Your hundred guin...<eos> Where do you want them, Corporal?
- Ten o'clock tomorrow.<eos> I'll be there. - Let's go.<eos> - I owe you one.<eos> I won't forget. - Bye!<eos> It's 1942, right?<eos> He's in Leningrad during the siege, one of the worst moments in history.<eos> 500,000 people died in that one place.<eos> And there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to die any day.<eos> He has plenty of tobacco but no paper.<eos> He takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
That is where I live.<eos> Shall we get going?<eos> - Let's go. - Come, Francesco.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - The horse? There's the horse.<eos> - Should we go over there?<eos> Hold on a bit.<eos> Without stirrups, Francesco.<eos> We'll put them on later.
With you... well.<eos> Get that fucking thing away from me, you stupid idiot!<eos> Come here.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Did he scare you, Elizabeth?<eos> Yes...<eos> Watching your people in VR auto-reset gave me this idea.<eos> Put them on.<eos> Millions of nano-machines are suspended in chlodial solution.<eos> They're absorbing the glass molecules and using them to generate the snake.
The first words of your story i turn the camera on myself in all my films not all the time perhaps but often but i do it in a way so nobody can see it and although i want you us to be successful in our work<eos> i won't reveal it<eos> - has anything happened?<eos> - Well i gave an elderly couple a lift we drove for a while talking the way one does lucky thing it rained yesterday then she said it doesn't depend on us she was a typical old woman the lord decides these things<eos> if he wants it to rain it will rain if he wants a draught there will be a draught<eos> to this old woman everything happens according to god's will do you believe that everything happens by chance?<eos> No it depends on the sum of many different things<eos> that happen at the same time it depends on our will and our fate which control us but we can change fate a bit chance is not that important it has more to do with the path we choose than who we are<eos> what has caused you to be here in poreby on the veranda?<eos> There are several causes if we decide to tell stories whether we write them down or film them we must know who we are and where we come from in a general and an immediate sense to be able to tell stories and to understand peoples' lives
Everything you are mistaken in everything<eos> man is not evil it's not true<eos> - yes it is - he may be weak that boy was he your friend or brother?<eos> - My brother - how old is he?<eos> - He's 15 - has he been a junkie for long?<eos> - How did you know?<eos> - I guessed it easily<eos> in "red" you have left room for many possible interpretations<eos> do you have your own interpretation?<eos> No i accept them all that's the way my mind works i gather a lot of interpretations and i say "choose one"
Does he know our troubles?<eos> He happened upon me a moment after I first read your letter.<eos> He was very kind, very gentleman-like but he made it very clear he wanted nothing more than to be out of my sight.<eos> He will not be renewing his addresses to me.<eos> He'll make very sure his friend doesn't renew his to you.<eos> I never expected Mr Bingley would renew his addresses.<eos> I am quite reconciled to that.<eos> Surely you do not desire Mr Darcy's attentions, do you?<eos> No, no.<eos> I never sought them.
Oh, excellent. Excellent.<eos> Anytime you wanna come by and visit, that would be really nice.<eos> Excellent.<eos> I always wanted to see you again, so -<eos> Some of the early Weirdo collages. And also some publications. We managed to track them down.<eos> I think Crumb is - Basically, he's the Brueghel... of the last half of the 20th century.<eos> There wasn't a Brueghel of the first half... but there is one of the last half... and that is Robert Crumb. Because he gives you that tremendous kind of impaction... of lusting, suffering, crazed humanity... in all sorts of bizarre, gargoyle-like allegorical forms.<eos> He's just got this very powerful imagination which goes right over the top a lot of the time. But it very seldom lies.<eos> To me, he's Mr. Natural.<eos> He accepts women how they really are... and makes them even more beautiful than they really -
A tool for your rebrain-washing?<eos> Analyzing the personality of the Yamanote Line Murderer?<eos> Or... - you want me to do it Or is this part of the questioning?<eos> It's ironical<eos> Our reunion after 8 years is again related to a serial killing<eos> There is no such thing as random killing<eos> That was your hypothesis<eos> The current serial killing can't be indiscriminate<eos> There must be some common factor<eos> I see the three victims had it coming because they possessed a certain feeling A strong feeling of self-destruction to lure the killer to them It was synchronic with that of the killer
- lt's Daniel.<eos> - Daniel?<eos> - What are you...?<eos> You got so old.<eos> - You're no Monet yourself.<eos> Molly, this is my cousin Daniel.<eos> Danny's father.<eos> Danny asked me to come.<eos> He's got a real regard for you.<eos> He made me think that maybe things are different than the way I remember them.
Oh, thank you so much!<eos> Your letters are wonderful, Charles!<eos> Well, that's, um, coming along nicely.<eos> Oh, I'm the matron's favorite patient, and she showed me her special stitch.<eos> I love the color.<eos> It's for you.<eos> Goodness, me, what a lot of letters.<eos> Ha. Are your parents enjoying their trip?<eos> Oh, there's a couple of unopened ones.<eos> I'm saving them for a rainy day.
At this rate, she doesn't think you'll get school certificate.<eos> Who cares?<eos> I care, and your father cares.<eos> We want you to get a good education.<eos> I'm educating myself.<eos> You're failing English!<eos> You used to be the top of the class!<eos> I'm doing my own writing!<eos> Don't think these stories are going to get you school certificate!<eos> You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
- To forget? After I've seen the outline of my brother's body on the floor... you expect me to forget?<eos> I want to kill those sons of bitches. I'm gonna blow their fucking heads off.<eos> Nothing's the same after you've killed someone.<eos> Your life is changed forever.<eos> You have to sleep with one eye open for the rest of your life.<eos> I don't give a shit about sleeping, Leon. I want love... or death.<eos> That's it.<eos> I want death.<eos> Get off my case, Mathilda.<eos> There's this really great game, Leon. Makes people nicer. Starts them thinking.
It looks like you, Mrs. Bransford, the Spaniard... ... and,unlessamiraclehappens, Maverick.<eos> When it's decided, call a break for an hour... ... andlet'ssetitup at that table.<eos> I was going to leave you something, but I'm cleaned out.<eos> You're a hell of a player.<eos> It's the most I enjoyed losing.<eos> That's for you.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I'll see that your chips are set up for the next game.<eos> Good luck to you, son.<eos> Leave your chips here, I'll get them transferred to the final game.
It's probably been a good ten, 15 years since I was any good at it, you know.<eos> It doesn't come up that often.<eos> Maybe it's the neighborhood.<eos> Tom.<eos> - Larry.<eos> - Wow.<eos> Well, it's not the battery.<eos> In the morning, I'll check the fuel line for you, the alternator, the pump.<eos> You know, it could be your plugs are worn down.<eos> I'll replace them for you in the morning.
Three of my men are dead including your pal, Lorenzo.<eos> You don't know what's going on.<eos> Don't you even give half a shit?<eos> You still don't believe me that those preventers are bad?<eos> I believe you.<eos> They had stress cracks all over.<eos> If those were new, something's funny.<eos> Goddamn right, somethin' funny.<eos> That's what I keep tellin' you.<eos> And if you still can't figure out why Jennings made me use them anyway check out the requisition file on Aegis-1.
I had to go back there and into court.<eos> This old rocker had them staring.<eos> I guess they'd never seen one before.<eos> Those Lapland dudes were bug-eyed.<eos> Then the judge slapped a fine on me.<eos> Fifteen hundred - plus eight hundred for the guy's nose and tooth.<eos> No kidding.<eos> I'll be damned if I'll pay - eight hundred, that's half a Volga!<eos> His teeth were already like Roman ruins.<eos> They sent me some papers but I used them in the toilet.
I'm in deep borscht.<eos> Captain Callahan, 511.<eos> Sergeant Jones, 513.<eos> Sergeant Tackleberry, 514.<eos> Cadet Connors, 520.<eos> Captain Harris, 515.<eos> Not exactly a four-star hotel, is it?<eos> Well, we spend our police budget on fighting criminals... not on pampering out-of-town visitors.<eos> Your government brought us here.<eos> They also bring in monkeys for zoo... but we don't put them in four-star hotel either.
No, Don Pablo.<eos> But you'll be unemployed tomorrow. No, I don't want anything.<eos> I'll miss you, Mario. I'll miss you.<eos> But you will write to me?<eos> Of course.<eos> Things change all the time in my country.<eos> Today they'll let me go back. Tomorrow something else will happen and I'll have to flee again.<eos> I'll leave some things here anyway... if you could keep an eye on them for me.<eos> I'll let you know where to send them.<eos> Perhaps I'll bring them to Chile myself.
- I see.<eos> Perhaps I could write the state senate and request funds from them.<eos> They have only three ways to spend the taxpayers' money for prisons:<eos> More walls, more bars, more guards.<eos> I'd like to try, with permission.<eos> A letter a week.<eos> - They can't ignore me forever.<eos> - Sure can.<eos> But you write your letters if it makes you happy.<eos> I'll even mail them for you.
When is the academic community going to accept that the pharaohs of the 4th Dynasty did not build the Great Pyramid?<eos> Inside the pyramid, the most incredible structure ever erected, there are no writings whatsoever.<eos> - Dr. Jackson, you left out that Colonel Vyse discovered quarrymen's inscriptions of Khufu's name within the pyramid.<eos> His discovery was a fraud.<eos> Well, I hope you can prove it.<eos> Who do you think built the pyramids?<eos> I don't have any idea who built them.<eos> Men from Atlantis?<eos> Or Martians perhaps?<eos> The point is not who built them, it is when they were built.
Before leaving the other day, you spoke of pity.<eos> I realized later it was disgust.<eos> Would you sit down for a moment?<eos> Would you smile for me?<eos> You cried when you left here the other day.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> And I turned off my radio.<eos> I sat down at my desk.<eos> The fountain pen I'd used all my life was out of ink, so I took a pencil and wrote letters to my neighbors and to the police.<eos> I mailed them that same night while you were sound asleep.
It's different when you're gone. Come on.<eos> On, please.<eos> OK, sweetie.<eos> Night-Night. Sleep tight.<eos> Don't let the bedbugs bite.<eos> - Daddy coming home?<eos> - He's on his way.<eos> He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?<eos> Right.<eos> If the birds don't eat them first.
Do you understand the consequences of this?<eos> Not fully, but...<eos> Well, I will be cursed.<eos> I can certainly understand how that could be upsetting.<eos> Think how you would feel... if you were made to take off this mask that you are wearing.<eos> Our masks really get us in dutch, don't they?<eos> How long you been wearing yours?<eos> Since I was 16.<eos> I placed the mask on my face and vowed never to remove it... on the day I left my mother, the dark beauty, Doña Inez.<eos> I have some pills here, and I'd like you to take them.
I think therefore you are.<eos> Read it if you don't believe me.<eos> See what I have in store for you.<eos> I know what I am.<eos> Go back.<eos> Your world lies beyond that passage.<eos> Go now. I can't hold them back any longer.<eos> "Trent stood at the edge of the rip stared into the illimitable gulf of the unknown the Stygian world yawning blackly beyond.<eos> Trent's eyes refused to close.<eos> He did not shriek but the hideous unholy abominations shrieked for him as in the same second he saw them spill and tumble upward out of an enormous carrion black pit choked with the gleaming white bones of countless unhallowed centuries.
Merchants cast their spells they hoard money like elves, but why do they hide "theyselves"?<eos> Why dont they show "theyselves"?<eos> Against the merchant hidden you certainly must rebel when your mind wanders unbidden something he will try to sell.<eos> There are lying wheeler-dealers and preachers with light fingers there are scoundrelly healers and even songwriter-singers.<eos> It isnt true that the soul is regrown, as you suppose; what do lN-grow, with no loopholes, are the nails on ones toes.<eos> Against the merchant hidden you certainly must rebel when your mind wanders unbidden something he will try to sell;<eos> dont let them make you buy when saying "no" would be healthi-ER and with the money you dont otherwise apply<eos> come and see Les Luthiers!<eos> Excuse me, Sir, but were you wearing those shoes when you came in?<eos> Look whos wearing them!

That's it.<eos> It's all in the wrist.<eos> Where did you learn all this?<eos> In my father's restaurant in New Orleans.<eos> What are we having? It smells delicious.<eos> Blackened red fish with creamed spinach and sautéed beets.<eos> Beets?<eos> You don't like beets, Doctor?<eos> Well, they're not exactly a, a personal favorite of mine, no.<eos> That's because you haven't had them prepared properly.
For the good of our house, yes.<eos> I beg of you, please stop thinking of yourself.<eos> It is Alexander we should be considering.<eos> Look into your heart and do what is best for him.<eos> Kahless was determined to teach his brother a lesson because he had told a lie.<eos> But Morath refused to fight him and instead ran away.<eos> Kahless pursued him across the valleys, over the mountains and down to the edge of the sea.<eos> There, at the shore, they fought for... ..12 days, 12 nights.<eos> I've heard this story before.<eos> Alexander, it is important to tell these stories, even though we already know them.
Helm, set course for Vacca VI.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - Our chronicle.<eos> The history of our village.<eos> Doesn't your village keep a chronicle?<eos> Not in this manner.<eos> How do you teach your children their history, who their ancestors were, where they come from?<eos> We tell each other stories, make up songs.<eos> Stories change with each person who tells them.
Mulder, look.<eos> We're FBI agents!<eos> Federal police!<eos> I'm Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully.<eos> We're here to investigate a murder.<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to remain at a distance, please, sir.<eos> Your weapons are forbidden here.<eos> We can outlast you at this spot.<eos> You're not leaving where we stand until your guns are handed to our council.<eos> You will have them again as you leave.
I see you folks got a chance to take in the Holy Roller sideshow.<eos> I take it you're not one of the Reverend Hartley's flock.<eos> No, I remember Hartley when he was on his soapbox collecting dollar bills in coffee cans.<eos> Since the boy joined the act, he's got himself a Cadillac for every day of the week, bought for with money that we need for roads and schools.<eos> People want to believe, you know?<eos> 99o/o of the people in this world are fools.<eos> And the rest of us are in great danger of contagion.<eos> Even if Hartley and Samuel are fakes, it's still a long way from accusing the boy of murder.<eos> I got witnesses that say the boy was laying hands on those people when they died.<eos> You think that's how he killed them...
Clues?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Let's find out.<eos> Scully!<eos> It's potato.<eos> Someone left a trail of food in the ventilation system leading to the courtroom.<eos> You dump your locusts in here...<eos> - Instant plague.<eos> - Where did they all come from?<eos> Biological supply houses usually hatch them on order to farms and universities.
- So I gathered.<eos> Fine.<eos> Come into my office, Agent Mulder.<eos> Please.<eos> Would you inform the room as to why you regard your case in New Jersey as meaningless?<eos> It's a simple drugland body dump, not the type of case the fbi wastes time or manpower on.<eos> Given your recent history, you're not one to judge what is or is not a waste of time.<eos> - Sir, my work on the X-Files...<eos> - The X-Files have been closed, Agent Mulder.<eos> You will carry out new assignments, and investigate them to the best of your ability. ls that not clear?
Loves you... Jesus.<eos> Aurora...<eos> My God, what are you doing here?<eos> I told you not to come.<eos> Put that away. Don't you see they could kill us?<eos> Don't you see we're in danger?<eos> It works?<eos> I knew you would return.<eos> If you're looking for the missing pages, you're wasting your time.<eos> I ate them.
I had a letter from May from St. Augustine.<eos> They always spend the winter there on account of her mother's bronchitis.<eos> And what do you do while May is away?<eos> I do my work.<eos> I do want you to know what you advised me was right.<eos> Things can be so difficult sometimes, and I'm so grateful.<eos> The next day, Newland Archer searched the city in vain for yellow roses.<eos> From his office, he sent a note to Madame Olenska asking to call that afternoon and requesting reply by messenger.<eos> There was no reply that day or the next.<eos> And when yellow roses were again available, Archer passed them by.
Can we get going, please? Before I get seriously sick.<eos> - See you later.<eos> How you doing, fellas?<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Hi, guys.<eos> Bobby, every day I tell you turn it down or turn it off.<eos> I'm not gonna tell you again.<eos> You need to listen to some blues, man.<eos> You guys got any doughnuts up there?<eos> Well, we did, Dallis, but we ate them all.
Ambulate the canines.<eos> - What?<eos> - Take the dogs for a walk. - Oh, of course, Mr. Ireland.<eos> Ten dollars, Mr. Ireland?<eos> Funny, I, uh, thought this was the Bradbury, but it must be Fat Harry's Motor Lodge.<eos> Carmen, one day, you're gonna be a great concierge.<eos> In the meantime, go get the biggest plastic bag you can find.<eos> And don't make fun of her hair.<eos> Those things aren't candy, Douglas.<eos> I'm not gonna eat them all, ma'am.
And how would you do it?<eos> Me too!<eos> In my opinion from here is the most beautiful if I sit down lower I can see that ugly ship ... andfromfartherup, the top I see the other half...<eos> Nogood.<eos> And that's why this is the best spot.<eos> Are you investigating now?<eos> And how will you start?<eos> I set out from the immediate and most known circumstances.<eos> And I suspect everyone.<eos> Set up theories and check them through and through.
We could go by, ask there.<eos> Or church.<eos> - Did you go to church?<eos> Could she still be alive?<eos> I know where the girls are. - [Gasps]<eos> They sent me birthday cards for a while.<eos> - What sweet children. - Yes, they are.<eos> - Especially Diane. She's so thoughtful.<eos> - Where?<eos> Oh, they sent them to Sacramento.
How wrong I was.<eos> It was also An Sau's choice.<eos> He was just being a good son when he obeyed me.<eos> If I could, I'd have stopped you from going to America.<eos> What would've happened to your sons here?<eos> I'm so proud of you, Bay Ly.<eos> You've grown up to see the side of things that's hidden from most people.<eos> Tears are God's way of paying you back for what He's taken.<eos> I have no more tears.<eos> I have cried them out to all directions of the wind.
That's a change.<eos> Not really.<eos> I'm still surrounded by crazies.<eos> And very pleased!<eos> Mind if I film?<eos> Film what you want, but Ramón makes the decisions.<eos> I'm expecting him. Have you seen him?<eos> All I have left of us is this scar.<eos> I like the garden.<eos> The story I want to shoot is of a couple who killed ten people and discreetly buried them in the garden.
I read them in the paper.<eos> It wasn't the same person, or necessarily a woman, it's a license I've taken to give it more bite.<eos> You don't need it, it's fantastic.<eos> What more do you want?<eos> Talking about that love bite... Today in my office, an incredible woman came asking for you.<eos> She sounded Mexican.<eos> She came to my house afterwards.<eos> Be more discreet, don't give my address to whoever asks.<eos> She was pretty, I thought you'd like her.<eos> If I want to meet pretty girls, I'll find them myself.
Why, weren't you married?<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> A long time ago.<eos> Still, that hardly qualifies me for any reasonable answer to that question.<eos> All right.<eos> Do you want the short answer or the long one?<eos> Short, I guess.<eos> The problem is one of water.<eos> Water?<eos> Women have about 5% more of it than men, making them subject to different forces of gravity.
Come on, you promised to sit through the entire hockey game without being bored, and I'll sit through the Wagner opera with you next week.<eos> Yeah, well with your eyesight I'm surprised you can see the puck.<eos> Yay.<eos> All right!<eos> God, I can't wait to get into bed and stretch out.<eos> - You know there's a Bob Hope movie on television later.<eos> -I know.<eos> Can you believe this guy in Indiana?<eos> Killed 12 victims, dismembered and ate them.
-It's fantastic!<eos> It would be so perfect, because she's an actress, a would-be actress...<eos> We could use his theater.<eos> He's a playwright.<eos> This is so perfect.<eos> Your theater is empty all the time, anyhow.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's great.<eos> What are we talking about here?<eos> We get her in for a fake audition, and you write some lines that don't mean anything and she does them, and we tape-record it.
The ovens burn day and night. There is no respite.<eos> It is this vital oil that lights the homes and streets of Europe.<eos> Millions of salted cod are put out to dry as far as the eye can see, along the shores of this River now known as the St. Lawrence.<eos> In the fall, hundreds of ships carry off the dried fish to an insatiable Europe.<eos> Such intensive hunting and fishing makes no sense to the First Peoples.<eos> In the Great Spirit's Creation, they have no more rights than the animals, their brothers.<eos> Thousand of rivers enrich the Mighty One with the multitude of species spawned in their waters.<eos> But no tributary equals the powerful Saguenay as it surges into the River in a majestic fjord of unfathomed depth.<eos> Heavily laden with pelts, birch-bark canoes converge on Tadoussac, the largest trading post in America, from where millions of furs are shipped to France every year.<eos> Furs create fortunes for the companies that acquire them.
Yeah.<eos> Oh, move, move.<eos> - Where are you? - I'm in here.<eos> Oh, it's de-lovely.<eos> I see you've got a ceiling at the top with a floor on the lower level... and a wall at either side. And only a single bed.<eos> Sad, really.<eos> - You've got wonderful breasts.<eos> - Don't you mean "tits"?<eos> Are they both the same size, or is one bigger than the other?<eos> I don't know. Do you want to weigh them?
There's to be a very important conference in this house next week.<eos> People of great stature will be His Lordship's guests.<eos> We must all put our best foot forward.<eos> Because of Father's recent accident it has been suggested that you no longer wait at table.<eos> I've waited at table every day for the last 54 years.<eos> It has also been decided that you should no longer carry heavy trays.<eos> Now, here's a revised list of your duties.<eos> Look, I fell because of those paving stones.<eos> They're crooked.<eos> Why don't you get them put right before someone else falls?
How tiresome to be shut indoors.<eos> It's too stuffy!<eos> I'll faint if I don't get some light and fresh air.<eos> At least we can open the windows.<eos> No, get away from there!<eos> Don't touch them.<eos> They're nailed shut.<eos> My lungs can't take the spores.<eos> Spores?<eos> The wind carries them.
Thank you, Major Lewis.<eos> Oh! Jack was particularly hoping that you'd introduce him to your poetry.<eos> Now, we've got to find the key.<eos> Mrs. Young... Don't worry, I don't inflict my poems on innocent strangers.<eos> Not strangers, I hope.<eos> What about some of that long promised tea?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> You take milk, don't you?<eos> No, I'd be interested to know about your poems.<eos> What do you want to know about them?
Free yourself folks, if you see it, Piece-of-Shit, say it and walk away. You're right!<eos> You're right!<eos> Not those fuckers who want to tell you how to think!<eos> You're fucking right!<eos> Sorry, wrong meeting again.<eos> I keep getting my days mixed up.<eos> Tomorrow, it's the meeting at the docks.<eos> Tonight it's comedy entertainment with young Bill.<eos> Horrible film...<eos> And then I come to find out after that film, that all of the lesbian sex scenes, let me repeat that, all all the lesbian sex scenes were cut out of that film, because the test audience was turned off by them.
- Try me.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> It's just the rules of the game.<eos> Uh-huh. Rules of the game.<eos> Go on.<eos> It's a hunt.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> They're chasing Tosk in a hunt.<eos> They're playing by their rules, we're playing by ours and he's caught in the middle.<eos> I suppose if the Ferengi don't like the rules, they change them.
If you replace your dishes of lokar beans with these, your customers' glasses will never be empty.<eos> - What's your name again?<eos> - Pel.<eos> What do you think about my idea?<eos> I agree with the 59th Rule.<eos> "Free advice is seldom cheap".<eos> But the 22nd rule says, "A wise man can hear profit in the wind".<eos> - l see you know your rules.<eos> - All 285 of them.<eos> The commentaries on them, as well.
I listened to several operas known to be uplifting, I watched three holodeck programs designed to be humorous, and I made four attempts to induce sexual desire by using erotic imagery.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I'm curious.<eos> Why are you ignoring the one emotion you've already experienced?<eos> Why aren't you trying to make yourself angry again?<eos> Anger is negative.<eos> I wanted to concentrate on something positive.<eos> Data, feelings aren't positive and negative, they simply exist.<eos> It's what we do with them that becomes good or bad.
- Leave?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Both of us.<eos> Now, if you will help me get to the shuttle...<eos> Don't move.<eos> It's bad.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I won't move.<eos> You have three broken ribs.<eos> The restrictor device will hold the bones in place, let them...
Early 40s, five foot eight, 135 pounds.<eos> She may have an accomplice similar in appearance.<eos> Kendrick is driving a light-blue '93 Corolla.<eos> She has exceptional strength for her size... ..so consider her armed and dangerous.<eos> Quite possibly she'll display severe psychotic behaviour.<eos> The Oakland Bureau will orchestrate the search across the bridge.<eos> What if...<eos> What if she kills her?<eos> First Doug, now Cindy.<eos> The fact that Kendrick and her accomplice just abducted the girls... ..tells us they want them alive.
We changed watch. I went home to try to get some sleep.<eos> I got a call.<eos> Communication with the shuttle is down.<eos> We've got to get back to Houston.<eos> There's a press blackout.<eos> Chances are the media doesn't know about it.<eos> - You think this is sabotage?<eos> - l don't know.<eos> Things go wrong all the time.<eos> - Yeah, but they usually fix them, right?
And how do you want to get the body out of the apartment?<eos> And put it where?<eos> Without leaving any trace. When you bury something, it can resurface.<eos> We can burn the personal things.<eos> Where?<eos> We could take them to the farm.<eos> So, cut her in pieces... Pieces so small we can get them out.<eos> And the bones?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Break them, saw them, burn them too...
And then some, okay?<eos> Till it's done.<eos> He keeps going until he kills her?<eos> - What's the name of the bar?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> I was stoned.<eos> All right.<eos> How about the letters?<eos> The letters came first.<eos> I don't know who's writing them.
- Your diet is disgusting.<eos> - They're perfectly nutritious.<eos> Each life that I ingest gives back life to me.<eos> - A fly gives you life?<eos> - Certainly.<eos> You'll eat molecules with chopsticks before I eat the lesser carnivorae.<eos> I shall have to invent a new classification of lunatic for you.<eos> What about spiders?<eos> Spiders eat the flies.<eos> - Yes, spiders eat them.
A blue inferno!<eos> Listen to them.<eos> The children of the night.<eos> - What sweet music they make.<eos> - Music?<eos> Those animals?<eos> I did as Dracula instructed.<eos> I wrote three letters.<eos> To the firm, to my family, and to my beloved Mina.<eos> I said nothing of my fears, as he will read them, no doubt.
-Two pairs?<eos> No, just one...<eos> So I give him one and I say, "There are the panties."<eos> And I get my 200 francs.<eos> So for 200 francs, I sold Brigitte Bardot's panties.<eos> In those days, that's at least 1 ,000 francs nowadays.<eos> In those days.<eos> - He still thinks it's her real panties?<eos> I think he does.<eos> I recently asked him if he still had them.
Doesn't matter.<eos> Were you in it? In the war?<eos> - You didn't see that picture?<eos> - What picture?<eos> Me in my uniform.<eos> Used to be over the fireplace.<eos> In public restrooms, you're always standing in piss.<eos> It don't matter to you. You got sneakers.<eos> But I'm standing in piss in very expensive shoes.<eos> I don't want piss on them. I want to protect them.
We'll do a sidebar on going from sleeping in your car to sleeping in a posh suite.<eos> Also, Gale's checking into his background.<eos> What's it gonna be?<eos> Dirt or more poetry?<eos> We know which one you'd prefer.<eos> Inspector Dayton recovered your credit cards...<eos> - Who?<eos> - Inspector Dayton, from robbery detail.<eos> They caught the guy who stole your credit cards...<eos> Nobody stole them.
She got into dope for a while.<eos> She'd break that thing that you sniff when she'd have her orgasm.<eos> I was getting a real education.<eos> I was fascinated.<eos> I was absolutely nuts about her.<eos> And ultimately she wound up in an institution.<eos> I mean, it's not funny, it was a very sad thing.<eos> She was great, but nuts.<eos> See, I've always had this penchant for what I call "kamikaze women."<eos> I call them kamikazes because they crash their plane.
- Hello.<eos> - Hey, you want a smoke?<eos> - No later... - Be alert to this little eel. You can never trust him.<eos> My apologies.<eos> Here, nothing in my hands. - Yeah, mine are full.<eos> - Hey, Alan.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - What? What's up?<eos> It's Johnny. Says he wants a word.<eos> South America want their arms, pronto. We don't have them.
Oh, go on, Mam.<eos> Our Titchie said she'd take me.<eos> Oh, go on, Mam.<eos> Eh, Bud, get me those nets... out of the lads' bedroom, will you?<eos> Okay, Mam.<eos> Pass us a few bricks, will ya?<eos> Oh, come on, lad.<eos> Where's those nets?<eos> I want to wash them.<eos> That's before he'll bring them down.
People of all colors and races believing in one God, in one humanity.<eos> [ALL SPEAKING IN ARABIC]<eos> Each hour in this sacred land gives me greater spiritual insight into what is happening in America.<eos> The American Negro can never be blamed for his racial animosities.<eos> He's only reacting to 400 years of oppression and discrimination.<eos> But as racism leads America up the suicidal path I believe the younger generation will see the writing on the wall and many will want to turn to the spiritual path of truth the only way left to ward off the disaster that racism must surely lead to.<eos> Once before, in prison, the truth came and blinded me.<eos> Well, it has happened again.<eos> In the past, I've made sweeping indictments of all white people.<eos> And these generalizations have caused injuries to some white folks who didn't deserve them.
And white.<eos> All you got to do is want it... bad enough.<eos> My God.<eos> Like an old suit.<eos> My wife and daughter had a bond.<eos> I loved them both so much I wanted to eat them alive.<eos> Women make a life... inside their body.<eos> And that life comes out and holds onto them.<eos> Clings to them.<eos> Calls them up from school and says,
- Really full.<eos> - Poor thing.<eos> See how pretty this is'?<eos> Alright, but you keep the jacket.<eos> - How do I look'?<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Don´t think about it.<eos> - The shoes are tight.<eos> I´ll exchange them and get bigger ones.<eos> - If we could stretch them...
Better call the office.<eos> You're in deep kimchi, buddy.<eos> Better have it all in one sock for this one.<eos> Claims he was a company man who worked for you.<eos> What's his name? William Strannix.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> Not good.<eos> Not good.<eos> Mr. Breaker you better be candid with us here tonight.<eos> We need answers, and we need them now.
Opera is a dying art form, but all right.<eos> Go and pay the rent and then get dressed.<eos> You can go to the opera with Musette.<eos> I'll wait outside.<eos> I have to talk to Marcel.<eos> The poor girls - they are not made for a life like this.<eos> Being men, and therefore stronger in every respect - we make child's play of all misfortune.<eos> Nor do we become depressed - if our clothing isn't always neat.<eos> But it's different for the women.<eos> Even the slightest garment brings them joy, - nor should this be denied them.
Is it true God will never forgive me?<eos> If you have faith and willingness...<eos> ... he'llacceptyourinnocence.<eos> My child won't be a monster, will it?<eos> No child is a monster to God's eyes.<eos> She didn't put my name down.<eos> She put my name down until I did penance.<eos> Penance?<eos> Sufferings.<eos> The boss assigned them to me.
Wouldn't be caughtdead on his books.<eos> He knew you were coming, and didn't even go pick you up.<eos> Here's 5,000 lira, I'll send the rest.<eos> Think this a place you can study in peace?<eos> This is a sty.<eos> Not fit for people.<eos> It's a pigsty.<eos> Pietro's jacket...<eos> All the things...<eos> All his things I'll take them.
But if she's asking questions, then who else?<eos> How much time have we got?<eos> Tomorrow morning, I promise.<eos> That's when everything ends.<eos> But he's got the TARDIS... Maybe the Master went back in time, and has been living here for decades.<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> Worked for me.<eos> When he was stealing the TARDIS, all I could do was fuse the coordinates.<eos> I locked them, permanently.
Add your two to this.<eos> I miss you, Benny.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, we begin with item number one.<eos> - Sold to the lady in the white hat.<eos> - $2,750.<eos> Yes or no?<eos> This oriental rug.<eos> I'll sell you both 10% of the Flamingo. $60,000 each.<eos> - Aren't the shares already sold?<eos> - Not if I'm still selling them.
- I thought we had an agreement.<eos> You were going to see me until the end of the summer... before we decided whether you need a shrink... psychiatrist.<eos> That was an agreement that you and my probation officer made. I'm just a troubled kid, Doc.<eos> Who's been telling you that?<eos> You're no trouble at all.<eos> Eugene, I am thrilled you found a job.<eos> It's a positive move, but I don't think it precludes therapy.<eos> We've still got some things to talk about.<eos> Honey, those chops are gonna dry out.<eos> Nobody's gonna want to buy them tomorrow.
-What a gyp!<eos> -That sucks.<eos> I think I actually ordered some just the other day.<eos> Did you or didn't you?<eos> They'll be in soon.<eos> I'll come back then.<eos> Miss Sinclair, your card.<eos> Don't forget it.<eos> I like your nails.<eos> Where'd you get them done?
They said you're The One.<eos> Henry Sagan?<eos> Pardon me.<eos> Not long ago, I left some new sheets for Parry.<eos> They were lime-coloured, much like this colour, with watermelons.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They're being cleaned.<eos> The doctor had a little accident with the hypo.<eos> Just make sure that he does get them when they are clean.
Anybody ever tell you you got a cute ass?<eos> - Last job I had.<eos> - Are you blushing?<eos> Stop bothering the new guy.<eos> Everybody get to work for a change.<eos> Scrambled with bacon, two easy-overs with sausage and a Belgian waffle.<eos> I'm Johnny.<eos> Who are you?<eos> These eggs aren't runny.<eos> Mr DeLeon likes them runny.
- Susan, that would be... that'd be great.<eos> - OK, good. 12.00?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Right. Got it.<eos> OK, I'll be there.<eos> If I'm not still handcuffed to the goddamn sofaaaaa!<eos> I have to be careful.<eos> You understand.<eos> The police frown on the guns I make.<eos> People have occasionally used them for socially irresponsible acts, but what am I supposed to do?
When I awoke my hand was moving like this.<eos> People tried to stop it.<eos> I've even tied it up, but it doesn't stop moving.<eos> No one can figure out brain damage, Dottor Randazzo.<eos> I was lucky too, some people get blind, deaf or paralised.<eos> You should pay me more !<eos> I am a ruined man.<eos> I can no longer do anything, I can't eat, read or write.<eos> - I can only make "zabaione". - What ?<eos> I break the eggs and beat them like this.
Of course.<eos> Sam!<eos> That's enough!<eos> Play the other one.<eos> You can't let ghosts die, can you?<eos> You walk out on me. No explanation.<eos> - Didn't you get my letters?<eos> - Every one.<eos> Tore 'em up.<eos> Threw them in the fire.
- Is there really Aladdin's cave?<eos> - There must be.<eos> - Can we find it?<eos> - I'm not sure if I know where it is, but...<eos> You know, I was born in Persia.<eos> They call it Iran now.<eos> If I took you there, maybe we could look for it together.<eos> Iran's got caves and mountains and deserts, just like in the story.<eos> And mosques that are so beautiful they're like jewels.<eos> When the sun shines on them they dazzle your eyes.
I am a teacher... ... a coach... ... and a well-loved man.<eos> And it is more than enough.<eos> In New York, I learned that I needed to love my mother and father... ... in all their flawed, outrageous humanity.<eos> And in families, there are no crimes beyond forgiveness.<eos> But it is the mystery of life that sustains me now.<eos> And I look to the North... ... and I wish again that there were two lives apportioned to every man... ... and every woman.<eos> At the end of every day, I drive through the city of Charleston... ... and as I cross the bridge that'll take me home... ... I feel the words building inside me.<eos> I can't stop them or tell you why I say them.<eos> But as I reach the top of the bridge... ... these words come to me in a whisper.<eos> I say them as prayer.
- You wanted to see me, Guffy?<eos> - Just a minute.<eos> Can I ask you something, Guffy?<eos> Is there anything valuable here?<eos> - If there was, it'd be up north, right?<eos> - That's right, Mr Grafton.<eos> See this?<eos> This is Haiphong harbour.<eos> It's loaded with munitions.<eos> They take them out here and stick them here in Hanoi.
Stop fidgeting.<eos> Get rid of your gum.<eos> I don't believe you did that.<eos> I am Mr. Hollister, the manager. May I help you?<eos> - Edward Lewis.<eos> - You see this young lady over there? - Yes.<eos> Do you have anything in this shop as beautiful as she is?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> We have many things as beautiful as she would want them to be. That's the point. - I think we can all agree with that.
He says he doesn't have anything with him to give in return.<eos> But he's seen the trailer.<eos> On the day you go back to the States, he's gonna put his best horse in it.<eos> He says that if the woman you seek is alive in Mexico she's gonna go back with you and the horse.<eos> Hey, Cochran.<eos> You ought to be flattered, man.<eos> Never heard him talk so much at one time my whole life.<eos> Tibey rides this trail every morning at dawn.<eos> You know, he's gonna think you're a ghost.<eos> Be sure to keep your hands empty and out where he can see them.
Not always, madame.<eos> One of my men will bring you a mattress.<eos> It will not be very comfortable.<eos> But what can you expect?<eos> You are in Sbâ, not in Paris.<eos> Give him the pills every two hours.<eos> Enfin... Be courageous, madame.<eos> You have to take these.<eos> There are two pills.<eos> I want you to swallow them.
She thinks her father is still alive. She is crazy!<eos> I often come here to smoke.<eos> My mommy doesn't allow me to smoke.<eos> "Mustn't ever smoke."<eos> You know my mommy has a little thing between her legs.<eos> And you touch it, it goes up, and up, and up...<eos> It gets big.<eos> Everybody, everybody, even my mommy thinks my father died.<eos> It's not true.<eos> Someday, he will be back and commit such horrible things that the world will never forget them.
These are my questions and I think that yours as well.<eos> Who is Laura and why are you looking for her here?<eos> And anyway, who are you?<eos> I have a feeling that you are not very fond of the policemen.<eos> So you better start talking because sooner or later everyone talks.<eos> But by that time they are already... half dead!<eos> My daughter told me you are the new chauffeur we have been expecting.<eos> Be good enough to recall the sevent's two basic rules.<eos> Fuck you, mommy!<eos> He knows them.

No, everybody gets a ticket.<eos> I didn't.<eos> You lost it.<eos> No, I didn't get a ticket.<eos> Everybody gets a ticket.<eos> I didn't get a ticket.<eos> You said it cost $2.00.<eos> Here's the $2.00. I didn't get a ticket.<eos> Everybody gets a ticket.<eos> Mister, I'm going to describe the shoes to you, ok? And then you can give them to me.
Write to me.<eos> I'll write to you.<eos> Dear Iris. Well, I'm settled in.<eos> I've got an office about as big as a closet.<eos> It's next to the men's room and hasn't got a window, but my name's on the door.<eos> Small letters, but it's there.<eos> I like my boss.<eos> He wears cowboy boots and calls me by my first name.<eos> He didn't graduate high school, either, so we've got a lot in common.<eos> There are lots of pretty women in this town, but I don't see them for dirt.
In Salsomaggiore they hold conventions.<eos> Your father holds conventions? No, look.<eos> My father deals with economics.<eos> So he spends some weekends at the conventions.<eos> Some weekends, of course..<eos> And how is Salsomaggiore?<eos> You've never been there?<eos> No, no...<eos> No, but some day I'll go, too.<eos> On the other hand, one goes around.. One goes here, one goes there, one sends postcards.. and then maybe you pin them up in your office, like here.
- Huh?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You're a scientist, aren't you?<eos> Yeah, aren't you supposed to have a theory or something?<eos> Look, these creatures are absolutely unprecedented.<eos> Yeah. But where do they come from?<eos> Yeah!<eos> It doesn't matter where they come from.<eos> No name?<eos> We discovered them, we should name them!
That's the natural way of life.<eos> People today have forgotten they're really just a part of nature.<eos> Yet, they destroy the nature on which our lives depend.<eos> They always think they can make something better.<eos> Especially scientists.<eos> They may be smart but most don't understand the heart of nature.<eos> They only invent things that in the end make people unhappy.<eos> Yet they're so proud of their inventions.<eos> What's worse, most people are, too. They view them as if they were miracles.<eos> They worship them.
Goblins don't exist.<eos> Elliot, what kind of idiotic joke is this?<eos> You scared the shit out of me.<eos> I'm the victim of a nocturnal rapture.<eos> I have to release my lowest instincts with a woman.<eos> - Release your instincts in the bathroom.<eos> - Are you nuts?<eos> You're trying to turn me into a homo?<eos> Wouldn't be too hard.<eos> If my father discovers you're here, he'll cut off your little nuts and eat them.
Thanks, doc.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Holy smoke.<eos> Flesh World again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Harry, remember that ad with the picture of Ronette Pulaski?<eos> We traced that ad.<eos> It came into the magazine in a plain envelope, no name.<eos> Well, the magazine's a clearing-house.<eos> Readers write letters in response to the ads and mail them in to the magazine.
No, don't be.<eos> I... I was just, I mean...<eos> I mean, if that's evidence, shouldn't we give that to the sheriff?<eos> No.<eos> I mean...<eos> I've read this from cover to cover, Donna, and there are no solutions here.<eos> Besides she gave it to me.<eos> Why?<eos> People come to me and tell me their stories about the world outside.<eos> I take their stories and place them in a larger context.
I like it.<eos> - You do?<eos> - I like it, yeah.<eos> - You're so cold.<eos> - Josie.<eos> Josie, I gotta know.<eos> Were you really in Seattle?<eos> Yes, why are you so suspicious?<eos> Look at these boxes.<eos> You think I got them at Cash and Carry?
Albert, listen.<eos> If you come up through Lewis Fork, I can recommend a place for lunch.<eos> The Lamplighter Inn.<eos> They got a cherry pie there that'll kill you.<eos> - Hi, Nadine.<eos> - What are you doing here, Norma?<eos> I might ask you the same question.<eos> And I will tell you.<eos> I've gotten all new drapes for my house.<eos> Ed bought them for me yesterday at Gentleman Jim's. And we installed them together.
What the hell are you talking about?<eos> If we can't figure you a way to run so you don't melt the damn tires, we can't finish a race.<eos> So, what do you want?<eos> I'll tell you what, you run 50 laps any way you like, then 50 laps like I want you to.<eos> Give me an honest run.<eos> If you do, I'm gonna beat you.<eos> All right.<eos> Now we're going to do it 50 laps my way, all right?<eos> Now, when you were racing Indy cars out west, the tires were twice as wide and the car weighed half as much.<eos> Now your car weighs twice as much and the tires are half as wide and you're burning them up, all right.
[MEN CHATTERING]<eos> What is this?<eos> Coats? Henry, I need suits, not coats.<eos> Suits are coming Thursday.<eos> But it's the middle of summer.<eos> What'll I do with fur coats?<eos> You don't want furs?<eos> I'll take them away.<eos> No, I want them.<eos> We'll hang them in the freezer with the meat. How's that?
I brought this.<eos> It's the only thing I saved.<eos> -You were a dead shot.<eos> -CouIdn't miss.<eos> It was like it was supposed to be.<eos> You broke Pennywise's head open.<eos> -Inside was light.<eos> -Bright lights.<eos> DeadIights.<eos> We saw them too.
-You were a dead shot.<eos> -CouIdn't miss.<eos> It was like it was supposed to be.<eos> You broke Pennywise's head open.<eos> -Inside was light.<eos> -Bright lights.<eos> DeadIights.<eos> We saw them too.<eos> -How on earth--?<eos> -Mike went back down and got them.
Unavailable, sir.<eos> We cannot disengage the modified beams.<eos> - We must retreat!<eos> - Unacceptable.<eos> The Ferengi have stopped their attack.<eos> Transport the away team aboard.<eos> - Transporter functions gone, sir. - Shields reduced.<eos> Use this moment to escape.<eos> I have 40 crew on the Hathaway.<eos> Sacrifice them to save 1,000.
You should have the occasional bath yourself.<eos> Master Mita used to say that to me as well.<eos> Your maid's waiting outside. She wants to speak to you.<eos> - Tell her to come upstairs.<eos> - You should chase her off.<eos> - She has a mind of her own.<eos> - I'll chase you off in a minute.<eos> What do you want?<eos> What's the master supposed to do with these ropes?<eos> The weapons dealer Hauk is giving them back. Let me past.
The general picks that guy, he'll be making a mistake.<eos> It needs to get pulled together.<eos> So I think you're the man for the job.<eos> And I got a weakness for good men.<eos> The Krauts are working on this, full bore.<eos> If they get it before we do, I don't have to spell it out.<eos> Where would you start?<eos> Focus.<eos> You have great minds, but all dancing to a different tune.<eos> You bring them together in one place, isolate them, no distractions.
Where's Jamie?<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> Say it again!<eos> I love it!<eos> Tina, don't go.<eos> - I have to. Why?<eos> - Because!<eos> You might not understand, but ...<eos> When you're older, there are people you're gonna meet who make you feel ... like, connected. Like your heart is made of neon, and ...<eos> When you find them, you have to be with them.
Dr. Schneider, there are pages torn out of this.<eos> This book contained a map, a map with no names.<eos> Directions from the unknown city to the secret canyon.<eos> - So it did.<eos> - Where are these missing pages?<eos> You're wasting your breath.<eos> He won't tell us.<eos> He doesn't have to.<eos> It's obvious where the pages are.<eos> He's given them to Marcus Brody.
-Pull up!<eos> Speak to me!<eos> Dave! Talk to me!<eos> I can hear the car, but I can't hear you!<eos> I can't see you, Dave!<eos> My God, what have I done this time?<eos> Did you say something?<eos> I can't see your lips.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Can you see them now?
He asks me to give you his best.<eos> Tonight, Mr. Breitenfels, Georg's executive director, is coming to dinner in reciprocity for the dinner party he gave us a couple of weeks ago, where Georg's new role was more or less made official.<eos> They say he's a gourmet. So I'll have to do my culinary best to impress him.<eos> To which end, mother, your recipe for stuffed duck will be vital.<eos> Please wish me luck...<eos> I just stopped by to pick up my personal things.<eos> They're... they're not here.<eos> Why?<eos> They were...<eos> I had them set aside.
Of course. Otherwise, how can we learn?<eos> Is that why you're here with me tonight?<eos> To learn?<eos> Yes.<eos> - About our society?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, in our society, it is the men who are the fortunate ones, enjoying all life has to offer... ..while we women devote ourselves to the obligation of making life work.<eos> In our society, we share the responsibilities and pleasures.<eos> Which is why I am here with you while the women look for Ramsey.<eos> Remind me to thank them when they come back for giving us this time.
Tomorrow we will change the money.<eos> Yes, Captain.<eos> Belt, shoes!<eos> Belt, shoes.<eos> Change there.<eos> Why are you so sad?<eos> You look dejected.<eos> You are not Americans.<eos> The Americans gave us our uniforms.<eos> The American army gave them to us. The French army has taken them back.
You've heard about sex?<eos> Sure I have.<eos> - Well, I've discovered why sex is.<eos> - You have?<eos> Fantastic! It's because humans don't live underwater.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Fish don't need sex, because they just lay the eggs and fertilise them in the water.
I borrow 25 pounds from the Lehigh Lend every Christmas then pay it back over the next 12 months.<eos> It's like a tontine, really.<eos> Royal Liver Come in, Mr. Spaull.<eos> Can I surrender the policies on the two girls, Mr. Spaull?<eos> Certainly, Mrs. Davies.<eos> You've had these some time now, haven't you?<eos> Since they were babies.<eos> But as they're both married now, there's no point in keeping them on.<eos> All right, Mrs. Davies.<eos> I'll take them into the office for you.
- There never is of a weekend.<eos> No, they've gone to their country mansion.<eos> This was a different street when I was a kid.<eos> Before the middle classes took over.<eos> I bet your mum's the only council tenant left round here.<eos> Here, have a look at this.<eos> A pity your mum ain't got central heating, eh?<eos> Ain't the same, is it?<eos> Why do they want to live around here?<eos> They buy these houses for sod all and sell them for a fortune.
When I used to bolt the door at night... before going to bed--<eos> You never used to do that.<eos> When you worked nights at the theater... I couldn't fall asleep until you came home.<eos> When you finally came in... I'd pretend to be asleep. But I'd hear you moving around the house.<eos> Then, when you'd fall asleep... I'd get up and bolt the door.<eos> After you left... every time I did it... it felt as if I were leaving someone outside the door. Far away.<eos> You were right to leave.<eos> You did what you wanted to do.<eos> Every time I call you, a different woman answers.<eos> I pretend to recognize them... to save them the embarrassment of an introduction.
It really boils down to our ability to accept.<eos> We don't need pessimism. There are no limits.<eos> It figures it would be something like this.<eos> Uh.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You know, you look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.<eos> You, you're okay.<eos> This one, real fucking ugly. Oh.<eos> You see, I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person, doesn't she, huh?<eos> Put them back on, formaldehyde face-- That's what we got.
-I'll explain but let go of me... and stop drinking.<eos> -He humiliates you, makes you suffer?<eos> I'll explain that too.<eos> -Tell me the truth.<eos> I can handle it.<eos> But I can't handle lies.<eos> I'm losing the plot.<eos> I can't throw this in the garbage bin.<eos> I'm warning you.<eos> Touch them again and I'll kill you.
This is the lighter... that my dad brought from New York.<eos> No, I mean... that my friend brought from Algeria.<eos> -No, from New York. That's it!<eos> Is that clear?<eos> -Very clear.<eos> 5 minutes ago this lady rang my bell.<eos> -I had forgotten my suitcases.<eos> Which suitcases?<eos> -The ones that I hid in the room.<eos> Why did you hide them?
You pick your spot where you think it's nice to go in and blow.<eos> I remember the audience went crazy. I mean, they were just stunned.<eos> And I think he was literally stunned himself by the audience's reaction to this.<eos> And he suddenly discovered, "Yeah, it's all working.<eos> "It's not going to be the disaster."<eos> When they went on the first world tour, they went from Geneva to Australia.<eos> When they got to Australia Customs opened their bags and found all these empty Coke bottles.<eos> Empty Coke bottles. They paid overweight.<eos> The people were furious: "What are you doing with these empty bottles?"<eos> "We've got to take them back," was Nellie's answer.
- Kill them!<eos> Hideous monsters!<eos> - No!<eos> Good.<eos> You've heard of phasers.<eos> Now, over there.<eos> - Is this a female?<eos> - A human female, Letek?<eos> Yes, it is true.<eos> You work with your females, arm them and force them to wear clothing.
Sorry, doctor.<eos> I can't get used to these lenses.<eos> They hurt.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It's quite normal for them to feel uncomfortable at first.<eos> These drops will help.<eos> Please get them out of my eyes.<eos> I can't stand it!<eos> They're cutting into my eyes!<eos> Take them out!
No.<eos> I'm not allowed.<eos> My mother would...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Come back here!<eos> Where is Dr. Murphy?<eos> Get these things out of my eyes!<eos> They're hurting.<eos> Get them out!
Bastard.<eos> My God.<eos> Let's go find a phone booth.<eos> Mother?<eos> I'll be a good boy.<eos> John, don't do this to me!<eos> Think of the spiral!<eos> That's going to help you!<eos> And the snails, John!<eos> Remember we owe it to them, John!
- Dent's going broke, OK?<eos> So what he does is he heists some bank, heists some jewellery, then throws this easy code at the cops and puts Cain's name on it.<eos> It was real simple.<eos> You frame Cain, kill Cain,<eos> Cain's the Alphabet killer, Dent gets away scot-free, case closed.<eos> Why would an oilman risk all this, even if he was down on his luck?<eos> Dent's not buying oil equipment, he's buying guns from Thomopolis.<eos> Probably selling to his contacts or some shit like that in Central America.<eos> Why isn't he just splitting with the stolen cash?<eos> Dent could buy guns here for a million and sells them there for 10 million.
I'll tell you why all men fool around.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Hear the ladies go, "Why?"<eos> Men fool around because of this.<eos> Look at all the women in the audience right now looking up here like this:<eos> We fool around because we figured women out.<eos> We did.<eos> See, a lot of you ladies going:<eos> "What does he mean, he figured us out?"<eos> And dumb niggas going, "Yeah, what does he mean, we figured them out?"
It's our bad luck to be taken here.<eos> The Japs haven't enough camps for us all.<eos> This is disgusting.<eos> Get some water.<eos> Come on, children.<eos> She's with God now.<eos> What are you doing, Basie?<eos> Looks like your size, Jim.<eos> I don't want her shoes.<eos> I don't want them.

The husband jumps up.<eos> He starts removing the children's clothes.<eos> They look even worse...<eos> They're almost black.<eos> There are people across the street.<eos> They are sick.<eos> The carriage...<eos> That man is throwing people off.<eos> 20, 30, 40... I can't count.<eos> Just throwing them off.
For once in your life, try to stay firm.<eos> BODY IN THE STREET LEADS TO INVESTIGATION<eos> They will interrogate everyone.<eos> Hamlet must leave for London.<eos> We'll disguise it as a business trip.<eos> You'll meet Murdoch, he owns a small mail order chain.<eos> He'll take good care of you.<eos> Ophelia, and at this hour!<eos> I came to return your letters.<eos> Leave them on my desk, I'll burn them later.
Micky, we lost a file in the carpentry session.<eos> A pair of scissors in the laundry session.<eos> Boss Hung, you mean I have to find them?<eos> The jail is so big, where should I start?<eos> It's up to you to find them.<eos> These cards were found in your pillow.<eos> You know the penalty is 28 days.<eos> Find me the tools.<eos> And I'll forget about the cards.<eos> Really, I didn't take them.
- Hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Are you coming to play?<eos> - I have to do my homework.<eos> - You don't?<eos> - I only have three lines left.<eos> I wrote this, this and this and I only have three lines left.<eos> I have to do it all.<eos> Why did you go up wearing shoes?<eos> Don't you see how I take them off?
We fixed the contract for 3,000 tomans. And I have to get 500 from the engineer. But it did not come out well, so...<eos> I didn't cancel it.<eos> I kept it.<eos> But I have to pay the blacksmith, the carpenter the bricklayer, the workers...<eos> Then, I have to pay Mr. Jamali, and then I would not have nothing left.<eos> In that case, I myself will take care of Mr. Jamali.<eos> What can we do?<eos> I don't know, I only asked Mr. Agha Khan... that it makes the quality of doors that the children won't ever get cold.<eos> Certainly, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> I will do them right now.
Nothing, if he pays more I will bring the doors.<eos> - The engineer won't pay.<eos> - That's not my problem.<eos> Whether he pays or not, this is the price.<eos> - He won't pay!<eos> - You made the terms of contract!<eos> I didn't find the cigarettes.<eos> - Did you look for them or did your mother?<eos> - My mother.<eos> Why didn't you look for them?
Is Mohammad Reza your son?<eos> Come here.<eos> Don't move, beast!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Bring the other door!<eos> Bring it...<eos> When you finish the work, I'll go to Poorcom's house... to see if he has finished making the doors.<eos> - And you'll bring them together?
- Do you know where the public baths are?<eos> No.<eos> I am not from here.<eos> I am from Koker.<eos> - You are from Koker?<eos> - Yes.<eos> So, then wait, I will take you there.<eos> Buy some apples.<eos> I don't have teeth to eat apples.<eos> - Then buy them for your son.
I thought you were one of those who never apologize to anyone... But... you're like Donald Duck, you rebel out and then you regret.<eos> Runaway! You say you'll travel around the world, but then you're afraid and you will not.<eos> - Pippo told you?<eos> - Who told me was...<eos> Daffy Duck.<eos> Think, now someone is watching the whales.<eos> Splash, splash!<eos> Instead you lower your head and say: "Sorry, I didn'd do it on purpose"<eos> He forgives you and everything is fixed.<eos> You start doing things because you like them, but then you got afraid... and stop doing them, like Donald Duck.
Something is happening.<eos> Something evil.<eos> l`m just glad they`re selling.<eos> I was afraid that--<eos> They`re not selling, they sold.<eos> I don`t understand.<eos> You know I adore the little creatures.<eos> So unreal, and yet the detail.<eos> Little fingers and toes, little pudenda making a bump.<eos> But nobody`s even looked at them sideways in months.
My name is Francisco Manoel.<eos> And my name is Euclides...<eos> Euclides Alves da Silva Pernambucano Wandereley.<eos> I'm a da Silva too.<eos> It's only my chest and shoulders that are crooked - at night...<eos> I always dream I have to carry a whole mountain range on my back.<eos> You stand straighter than the whole town! - I'm hungry.<eos> - I'll bring you some food.<eos> How do you know all these things?<eos> From our priest, and he learned them from our Bishop.
I was asleep during almost the whole opera!<eos> We knew we'd find you here.<eos> I was looking for you the whole evening but I wasn't able get ahold of you.<eos> What do you mean? Didn't you send the usher to call Andreas a few minutes ago?<eos> No, how could I? I didn't even know which box you were in.<eos> Let's go.<eos> A friend of mine is convinced that the monster is her doctor.<eos> - And she still visits him?<eos> - Of course not, she's scared shitless!<eos> Oh, the crepes, I adore them and here they make them delicious.
Captain, are you back again?<eos> Whee!<eos> Set sail! -<eos> Your bride, oh, where is she? -<eos> Whee!<eos> Off to sea!<eos> -Captain!<eos> You're not lucky in love!<eos> Storm wind, blow and howl, you can't perturb our sails!<eos> Satan has given them his blessing, in all eternity they'll not burst.
Are they ghosts?<eos> I'm filled with fear!<eos> Sing our song!<eos> Sing loudly!<eos> Helmsman, leave your watch!<eos> Helmsman, join us here!<eos> Sing loudly!<eos> Helmsman, leave your watch...<eos> Storm wind, blow and howl, you can't perturb our sails!<eos> Satan has given them his blessing, in all eternity they'll not burst.
- Go along with those pushao, "pushao" means "girl" in Dai language.<eos> Every time I go out to work, ya always put lunch in my bamboo canister, and then put hot cakes into my hand.<eos> Ya always standing on the doorway, watching me.<eos> Her genial and dim gaze, make me bethinking my childhood.<eos> I don't understand what they are singing, but I know they are attracting and flirting each other.<eos> Girls from city also want attract other peoples, but they dare not.<eos> Yet Dai girls always compete each other in a big way, to see who's the most attractive girl.<eos> Looking at them, I feel so tired and despondent, I'm unable to work, as well as unable to live, I'm a vapid person.<eos> After a whole day's work, Dai girls always swim naked in the river.<eos> Yet me, only watching them primly, cause I didn't take my swimsuit.
Is that mine too?<eos> All of it!<eos> I dreamed your book was published.<eos> Why don't you think of something else?<eos> Get me a cigarette.<eos> -What are all these pills?<eos> -Nothing.<eos> Nothing?<eos> Are they sleeping pills?<eos> I don't take them often.
- We? Did you say "we"?<eos> You've got balls.<eos> I do the work, you take the credit.<eos> You know what your problem is?<eos> Your face.<eos> Come on, you're too good-looking.<eos> Girls go out with you and get nervous.<eos> They feel dumpy, they don't want to compete.<eos> They want a guy like ... like me.<eos> A guy who'll make them look good.
What is that?<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> A guardian.<eos> What it sees, Lo Pan knows.<eos> They have returned.<eos> And this time they are not alone.<eos> Egg Shen is with them.<eos> Little bastard sorcerer has brought them through the Bog of the Dead Trees.<eos> You have come a long ways to find me, but it is too late.<eos> There are two girls with green eyes, and I will marry them both.
It's an incredible relief to see the actors take over.<eos> But be careful with it, understand?<eos> - I'd better read it.<eos> The first day of shooting is always dreadful, so we decided to begin with something easy and pleasant.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> - What do you say?<eos> Will that do?<eos> - It was deafening.<eos> I've been thinking about it. You've all got slippers on.<eos> - Should we take them off?

You've all got slippers on.<eos> - Should we take them off?<eos> - I'm worried you might slip.<eos> What do you think? It's a bit risky.<eos> - I'll take them off.
We'll just take it one more time.<eos> Not all at once, but a second later.<eos> Understand?<eos> And with a sudden vigor it doth possess and curd, like eager droppings into milk -<eos> - This collar button is killing me!<eos> - Why not take it off?<eos> Gunnar Björnstrand sings "The Fool's Song" from Twelfth Night.<eos> Arne Carlsson's camera has been observing him throughout this long and arduous day.<eos> What we are witnessing is a great actor's heroic struggle with his own fear, his failing instrument, and his illness.<eos> It should be added that Gunnar Björnstrand saw these takes and gave them his approval.
Big light-bulb head must have a key to the PX.<eos> Any better ideas?<eos> Where's Aponte?<eos> Gunney, he's sick.<eos> He looked like proof of life after death.<eos> He's getting checked out.<eos> - That right?<eos> - Yes, that's right, Gunney.<eos> I want the barracks field dayed and squared away ASAP today.<eos> Gunney, we cleaned them just a little while ago.
- 'Cause of starvation.<eos> Yes.<eos> You better write a report and submit it to my man at the front desk.<eos> Mr. Mbusi, you do not understand...<eos> I do understand.<eos> Animals have attacked humans.<eos> It is the drought.<eos> It's happening all over Kenya...<eos> If we evacuate the people of Namanga...<eos> Where would we put them?
I'm afraid that's not gonna be much... My food supplier hasn't shown up yet.<eos> Stay on, my dear baby.<eos> Oh, Ringtree...<eos> I'm glad you're back, we should talk.<eos> On the porch.<eos> The supply truck is in a ditch...<eos> About ten miles outside of town.<eos> We gotta find a way of getting it here.<eos> What about the people?<eos> How do we protect them?
- Yeah, that's right.<eos> You don't by any chance know the way through this labyrinth?<eos> Who, me?<eos> No, I'm just a worm.<eos> Come inside, meet the missus.<eos> No, thank you, but I have to solve this labyrinth.<eos> But there aren't any turns or any openings or anything.<eos> It just goes on and on.<eos> You ain't looking right.<eos> It's full of openings, but you ain't seeing them.
It's only my job to find him.<eos> Barry's mom had this newspaper.<eos> It said you were in a special hospital.<eos> Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred into the psychiatric wing.<eos> That bothers you, doesn't it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Was it because in the papers it said it was this man Lecktor?<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> What happened?<eos> Well, Lecktor was attacking college girls, then he killed them.
Maybe he records it somehow.<eos> So he could see himself accepted over and over and over again.<eos> VTRs, Polaroids, stills, what?<eos> How do I know?<eos> How does he find them?<eos> When we find out how he found them, we'll find him.<eos> There is no connection between the two families.<eos> We've done a dozen computer runs.<eos> Jack, all the women have a bloom on them.<eos> He didn't win them in a lottery, he picked these women.
She's very pretty.<eos> But those models are so stuck-up.<eos> Eva's different.<eos> - You know her?<eos> - She is my girlfriend.<eos> What a coincidence.<eos> - How about a game of pool?<eos> - Okay.<eos> You do well with women, don't you?<eos> Being an ex-matador excites them.
Tell me about yourself.<eos> My mum makes me study agronomics.<eos> But I want to be a bullfighter.<eos> - You like bullfights? - Yes.<eos> I go to Diego Montes' classes.<eos> She thinks I go to a gym.<eos> Diego Monte.<eos> Angel.<eos> I'll show you some photos.<eos> Study them carefully, please.
Don't do that!<eos> Stop!<eos> We'll all die!<eos> That morning, Mom told us to take something we treasured the most.<eos> I put ln a harmonica.<eos> My sister put in a wool muffler and gloves.<eos> " When spring breezes blow,"<eos> " plums, peaches and cherries..."<eos> " They bloom majestically."<eos> " People admire them, birds chirp."
- Off the deep end.<eos> - We've got to find some humpbacks.<eos> - Humpbacked people?<eos> - Whales.<eos> 45-50 feet long, about 40 tons each.<eos> You're going to try time travel in this rust bucket?<eos> You'd have to slingshot around the sun to pick up enough speed.<eos> - Would you prefer to do nothing?<eos> - I prefer common sense.<eos> We go back in time, find some whales, then bring them forward in time, and hope to hell they tell this probe to clear off?
I'm glad you're here, but you picked a hell of a time to drop in.<eos> - Is this real?<eos> - Yes, take a look.<eos> - Storage tanks for your whales.<eos> - They're gone.<eos> - Gone?<eos> - They were taken last night.<eos> - They're in Alaska by now.<eos> - Damn!<eos> - But you can go find them, right?
- Me?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Want to go out for a beer tonight?<eos> Can't.<eos> The wife's leaving for somewhere.<eos> They always do.<eos> Three 2s.<eos> I was pretty well through with the subject.<eos> I'd probably considered it from most of its various angles, including the one that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merriment while remaining quite serious<eos> for the person possessing them.
Who?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Angel's Egg<eos> Director Mamoru Oshii<eos> Character Designer<eos> Yoshitaka Amano<eos> Screenwriter<eos> Mamoru Oshii<eos> Keep precious things inside you or you will lose them.
We forbid it. You're mad.<eos> You should be shot like a mad dog.<eos> No doubt about it.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm not guilty.<eos> I can't even punch a man.<eos> Solovyov hit him twice. The Tartar hit him once.<eos> So, you were hired on October 30 as a temporary watchman.<eos> I got a cut as a slaughter-house worker, too.<eos> I didn't eat the innards, I sold them on the market.
You make a good tour guide, Daulton.<eos> I always knew it.<eos> You know, you're not what I expected.<eos> And you're not black.<eos> - Pardon me?<eos> - It's a long story.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - To dinner.<eos> They'll ask about the frequencies, so don't trip me up.<eos> I told him he'd get them next month.
GASHERBRUM, THE LUMINOUS MOUNTAIN<eos> In June 1984, the mountaineer Reinhold Messner organized an expedition in the mountains of the Karakorum.<eos> Hans Kammerlander, on the right of the picture, was with him.<eos> Two summits in the chain of the Gasherbrums all two at few more of 8000 meters of altitude.<eos> Here is the Gasherbrum 1.<eos> Gasherbrum means "THE LUMINOUS MOUNTAIN."<eos> Their idea was to climb the two mountains, one after the other, without stoping, without stationary camp and without oxygen, without anything other than a bagpack.<eos> Messner already climbed them separately.
We have to go there.<eos> He will give me back Nokmoon and he'll take you instead.<eos> Because Death is not allowed any mistake.<eos> Are you asleep, old witch ?<eos> I can't sleep in soft images.<eos> Tell me a story.<eos> Is it an ill omen ?<eos> No.<eos> These things do not exist.<eos> We see them, so the must exist...
Think, McFly.<eos> Think!<eos> All right. I got to have time to get them retyped.<eos> Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting?<eos> I'll get fired.<eos> You wouldn't want that to happen, would you?<eos> Would you?<eos> Of course not, Biff.<eos> Now, I wouldn't want that to happen.<eos> Now, look. I'll finish those reports on up tonight, and I'll run them on over first thing tomorrow, all right?
My secretary.<eos> I knew my junkie pals were awaiting my good cheer on the beach but I needed a second wind, a beer and a wardrobe change.<eos> As I pulled up to my palatial imitation apartment building, I observed the familiar red OIdsmobuick of Mr. Arnold T. Pants, Esquire, attorney for the former Mrs. Irwin Fletcher.<eos> Time to use the service entrance.<eos> Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.<eos> What about trespassing and loitering?<eos> I am neither loitering nor trespassing.<eos> I've simply chosen an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.<eos> Well, I don't like to discuss business on the lanai. Let's go inside.<eos> Okay. lf you're wearing rubbers, leave them outside, would you?
Two more coming from Osaka tonight.<eos> Five girls and he's the youngest.<eos> Want some tea?<eos> Be happy to.<eos> It must be him.<eos> Him...<eos> Second time.<eos> Someone really hates us.<eos> That's bullshit!<eos> Found them near Tatsuo's place.
Hasi's aunt?<eos> Did you ever meet her?<eos> Hard as nails. She's got a deal in escrow. Major development downtown.<eos> Escrow closes in a week, and she's gotta come up with a bundle.<eos> She called me for a short-term loan, a big one, but, uh, I didn't need the headache.<eos> She mentioned that she might take Hasi in as a partner, if he could raise enough cash.<eos> She had to know about the stones.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> This is all about a real estate deal?<eos> - She can have them.
He examined the maps and then left.<eos> -What map?<eos> -Will you stop stalling?<eos> -l'm too embarrassed to say.<eos> -Give it a try.<eos> To King Solomon's mines.<eos> -What?<eos> -You see, Quatermain knows!<eos> There are hundreds of fake maps. Hundreds of them.<eos> I know many unscrupulous merchants... who pawn them off on unsuspecting tourists.
Please sit down.<eos> We've just finished a maneuver.<eos> These four distinguished themselves.<eos> I see.<eos> I wanted them to have the honor of meeting you.<eos> That's why we're in uniform.<eos> Please sit down.<eos> Your new uniforms are very handsome.<eos> Really splendid.<eos> Who designed them?
Bye.<eos> Did you save my life?<eos> No, the lioness did that.<eos> She walked away.<eos> So I am not indebted then?<eos> But I am.<eos> We pay our storytellers here.<eos> It's lovely.<eos> But my stories are free and your present's much too dear.<eos> Write them down sometime.
Almost.<eos> Crank it again.<eos> Once more.<eos> Well done.<eos> We're off.<eos> I don't know the scientific basis for it, but I know you can see further in the African night than any other place.<eos> And the stars are brighter.<eos> It's about the tents.<eos> When I'm out with Kanuthia...<eos> Used to be, we didn't use them.
Think so?<eos> I did it all.<eos> Except for Quentin's nudes.<eos> It was an obsession with him.<eos> I'll be sad to leave here, but the rent's too much for me.<eos> - How about something to eat?<eos> - No, I'm not hungry.<eos> It'll do you good.<eos> All right.<eos> What will you do with Quentin's things? Burn them?
My nose is fragile.<eos> You should've told him before.<eos> Happy now?<eos> Go on.<eos> Have a good laugh at my expense.<eos> You've been laughing behind our backs for the last eight months.<eos> That guy's been chasing you for eight months.<eos> Put yourself in his place.<eos> Where'd you steal these letters from?<eos> I found them in a corridor.
I bought this for you.<eos> - I bought it!<eos> It's the thought that counts.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Here, let me take that from you.<eos> It's really great to see you.<eos> I cleared out this drawer for you.<eos> And you can use this half of the closet.<eos> I bought some of those hangers you like so much.<eos> We'll just put your bags up there after you've unpacked get them out of the way.
Hey, come back here!<eos> Get back!<eos> You crazy bitch!<eos> Who are you? Goddamn it!<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> You're dead!<eos> Run, Edie!<eos> Come on!<eos> -Did you get the papers?<eos> -Yes, I got them!
- Full.<eos> - You lose.<eos> Go get the mirror!<eos> I'm telling you to go!<eos> Go on!<eos> It's the last one.<eos> Oum Salem is carrying her letter.<eos> Poor Oum Salem, she's still waiting for her son...<eos> He left with the wanderers.<eos> The teacher writes the letters, and the others deliver them to the desert.
- He's gone.<eos> Oh, will our past... come back to us one day?<eos> Don't go too far away...<eos> I'll surely be needing you.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It's sweet.<eos> Now, let's get back to the boat.<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> On the sheikh's order, we set out.<eos> The prints were easy to follow... because the wind hadn't effaced them.
- He's always saying that.<eos> - Right, I hate corruption...<eos> - It's unbelievable!<eos> Go to the bathroom and I guarantee you'll see massive quantities of drugs.<eos> Where is the bathroom?<eos> I must go and...<eos> I'm kidding, just kidding!<eos> Sorry.<eos> We were just discussing the new differential specs on the DYP.<eos> - Have you finished them already?
I got thrown out of a window.<eos> - Get in the car.<eos> - What's the charge?<eos> Possession of a concealed weapon and disturbing the peace.<eos> I got thrown out of a window!<eos> What's the charge for getting pushed out of a car, jaywalking?<eos> This is bullshit!<eos> You know, this is the cleanest and nicest police car I've ever been in.<eos> It's nicer than my apartment.<eos> Officers, if we see any movie stars could you point them out to me?
I don't speak canary yet.<eos> Fuck!<eos> This is getting weird.<eos> Didn't I tell you to stop that?<eos> I told you, Mom. It's for gym.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It looks crazy.<eos> She's calling you crazy.<eos> Ask her what she's been doing with our baseballs all these years!<eos> I think she buries them.

You could be anybody.<eos> Louis.<eos> Hey, try and stay with me, okay?<eos> I mean, let's forget about that woman that you saw on-stage.<eos> It's just you and me.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm flying at 4, so I've got to be to Kennedy by 3:00.<eos> I remember when Rodney decided to go on the road with me.<eos> As long as he didn't have to carry my bags, he said.<eos> He wouldn't even let me carry them.
It was like she was defending someone,<eos> Saying she wasn't there.<eos> I think she was talking to your family.<eos> My family's dead.<eos> I think their spirits are attached to that house.<eos> Their spirits?<eos> Their ghosts.<eos> And I think that they're using the dolls To tell us something.<eos> Why didn't she get rid of that thing?<eos> She doesn't want it.
Listen, if anyone's going to be successful, it's DARPA.<eos> They have unlimited funds, a mandate to invent the future.<eos> I mean, they're responsible for GPS, stealth technology... this.<eos> Is there any way to actually tell if the thing is, uh... alive or whatever?<eos> There's a test.<eos> It's named after the father of computing science, Alan Turing, and it measures a machine's ability to demonstrate intelligence.<eos> It's a series of questions and conversations with the computer intended to judge its level of thought up to and including human sentience.<eos> How do we know if a rose is real?<eos> If it looks like a rose, and you go to touch it and it's in two dimensions, it's only a photo.<eos> If you're holding it in your hand, but the texture's wrong. It's a cloth novelty rose.
Maybe that's how I tell them apart.<eos> Oh,oh, please tell me that's one of those Zen sand gardens.<eos> You know very well that's Sir Lancelot's litter box.<eos> You brought the cat?<eos> Of course I brought the cat.<eos> What did you think I was gonna do with him? I don't know.<eos> Return him to the wild?<eos> You're being ridiculous.<eos> Is it ridiculous to want the turds in my bathroom to be human?<eos> Fine,we'll put it in the laundry room.

And hunting and killing, I suppose.<eos> That's why they pay me.<eos> Okay, the gorilla wins.<eos> I'm not the client.<eos> What?<eos> So much for the job being legit.<eos> Look, all I know is that I'm supposed to pick up the case and deliver it.<eos> Tonight.<eos> To who, lady?<eos> Who wants it?
It wasn't the oversized baggage that did your friend Murph in.<eos> No.<eos> It was flames.<eos> Smoke.<eos> Heat.<eos> Immolation.<eos> We're here for the case, Malone.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Who wants it?
No.<eos> It was flames.<eos> Smoke.<eos> Heat.<eos> Immolation.<eos> We're here for the case, Malone.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Who wants it?<eos> Doesn't matter who wants it.
No.<eos> That changes things a lot.<eos> But if it's not too much to ask, can you just promise me something?<eos> Don't do anything reckless.<eos> For Charlie's sake.<eos> And I'll promise something to you in return.<eos> This is the last time you'll ever see me.<eos> I won't come back, and you can go on with your life without any interference from me.<eos> It will be like I never existed, I promise.<eos> If this is about my soul, take it. I don't want it without you.
If you want to get out of here alive, then you're going to tell me what happened in New York.<eos> Spike,what's going on?<eos> I need eyes in.Get up there with Jules.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> I will know the truth when I hear it.
If you want to get out of here alive, then you're going to tell me what happened in New York.<eos> You're going to tell me why you were there with him.<eos> What happened after tea?<eos> Nothing.<eos> What was so amazing then,hmm?<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> Huh,what do you want?<eos> I lose either way,right?<eos> What kind of answer do you expect when you wave a knife in someone's face?<eos> I will know the truth when I hear it.
Which I left in the kitchen.<eos> Does anyone know you're here?<eos> No.<eos> Oh!<eos> hey! help!<eos> Somebody help me!<eos> Get me out of here!<eos> Juanita, it's time for your bath.<eos> I'm watching my movie. you've seen it a hundred times.<eos> She loses her shoe, the prince finds it--end of story.
"Paige dash, 3 years old, daughter of lila and david."<eos> It says here she died inhe same crash.<eos> who are we dishing?<eos> I do hope it's not me.<eos> No, we've already covered you.<eos> We've moved on to my daughter, the thief.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> What happened?<eos> I'm missing my small candy dish.<eos> I had it last night when you guys were over for dinner, because I remember orson admiring it.
And, Derek, what the hell's the matter with you, man?<eos> - We've all been there.<eos> - We said that.<eos> - We've all had tough losses.<eos> - He knows that.<eos> We show up the next day, and we try and save the next life.<eos> Yeah, we covered that, too.<eos> Okay, what about this?<eos> Nothing we do can stop death.<eos> We can hold it at bay now and then, but everyone dies.
So she lowers a crap bucket to her friend every day, who empties it, cleans it, puts food in it and then sends it back up the tree.<eos> Oh, that's friendship.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, they teach us in med school how not to care so much.<eos> We drape the patients so we don't see their faces. We do a thousand different things to care a little less.<eos> But you care like crazy, and I love that.<eos> And I'll keep loving that, even if you decide to lie to your family.<eos> Nice work, Yang.<eos> Open the bag. See the bottle with the blue label?<eos> Open it and pour it into a sterile basin and give it to O'Malley.

See the bottle with the blue label?<eos> Open it and pour it into a sterile basin and give it to O'Malley.<eos> Okay, shake it onto the wound right over the bleeders, a lot of it.<eos> What is this stuff?<eos> Uh, uh, we used it in the field all the time. It's not FDA approved, but it's saved a lot of lives.
it's all so delicious... and humiliating.<eos> i'd tell you more, but i'm on my way out to a local thrift store to purchase one of wilhelmina slater's former possessions.<eos> oops. did i say her name?<eos> wilhelmina slater i'm sorry.<eos> because you know i'd never mock someone when they're down.<eos> i have no idea how it got out.<eos> i swear i didn't tell anyone.<eos> it's fine, marc.<eos> obviously, there's a mole here somewhere.<eos> and i promise you, i will find it, and i will have it removed.
You're gonna hurt somebody<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> It's so chilly in here, do you mind if I start a fire?<eos> Sure<eos> Oh it looks like you have a little something on your shirt<eos> Oh I guess the baby spit up a little<eos> It's no big deal<eos> Oh nonsense, let me wash it, I was just about to do a little laundry
I know what we'll do.<eos> We'll form a secret gang to help Nicholas.<eos> - What's a secret gang?<eos> - A group of heroes.<eos> We can call our gang "The Unbeatables".<eos> - We'll meet at the vacant lot.<eos> - We need a password.<eos> - "lnvincible courage"!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - And only those who know it can come in.
Moving on then.<eos> They will be put in a trust which you, charles, Will have access to on your 18th birthday.<eos> And as for Bass industries?<eos> Yes, I was just getting to that.<eos> 29% of the company will remain in the board's hands,<eos> And a 20% stake in the company has been left to Lily Bass.<eos> Okay, but that still leaves 51%.<eos> That's the controlling interest.<eos> Charles, Mr. Bass asked me to give you this letter.<eos> If I don't read it, do I still get my inheritance?
- Grew up good. You know that? - Yeah.<eos> Okay, it looks familiar, and yet...<eos> - Not bad, little J. - What are you doing here?<eos> Once I heard Poppy Lifton was coming to your party, I canceled mine.<eos> In the last 20 minutes, I've been hit on by two Bronfmans and a gay designer. It was so worth it.<eos> Kudos on rising from the social grave.<eos> Speaking of graves, did something die in that pot?<eos> It's cumin.<eos> I liked my social grave.<eos> I dug it myself and I was happy to lie in it. What's going on?
Your wedding day's gonna be perfect. I'm gonna make sure of it.<eos> I've always felt like there was this darkness inside me.<eos> Run!<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Lex is alive.<eos> Jimmy!<eos> I've forgotten almost everyone.<eos> I'm being taken over by brainiac.<eos> There is some sort of connection between us,<eos> And i know that you feel it, too.
Here's the plan.<eos> Taub, change the litter box.<eos> This is pathetic.<eos> You're still punishing me for calling you out on the green urine lady?<eos> Nope, this is for ratting me out to Cuddy.<eos> I'm not asking you to apologize, just scoop some poop out of a box.<eos> Just clean it.<eos> Let House do it.<eos> Yeah, that'll happen. He won't just continue to let our room smell like cat pee.<eos> I'll clean it next time.
I don't know what you're doing now.<eos> Cushing's means your body is overproducing a hormone called cortisol.<eos> The recommended course of action is to suppress it with drugs.<eos> And that will cure it?<eos> Just treat it.<eos> It could come back.<eos> The only permanent solution is to cut into your brain and remove your pituitary gland, but surgery's dangerous.<eos> Your heart stopped on the table once already.<eos> I want the surgery.<eos> This thing is gonna kill me if I don't kill it first.
Getting a little anxious in here.<eos> Somebody will be here at all times to irrigate your eyes, keep you company.<eos> Hopefully help make the time go quicker.<eos> My eyes still feel really dry.<eos> Thank you for thinking "up". For helping me find you in there.<eos> Man, when you moved that cursor...<eos> Bought my first girlfriend a necklace, it was silver.<eos> Cost 180 bucks.<eos> Had to save for six months.<eos> She hated it.
Look, security is tight and sniffer dogs are around.<eos> What's more important?<eos> Guitar's safety or scheduled delivery?<eos> Fine!<eos> Commit a final time!<eos> Problem, safety and all that. Tell me!<eos> Eight...<eos> - Eight o'clock.<eos> Tomorrow morning?<eos> Why don't you come over here and collect it yourself.
Five<eos> - Both?<eos> - T...<eos> T...<eos> Ten...<eos> With your ten excuses you stole my heart away...<eos> Arsehole!<eos> Kiddo!<eos> There is powder worth ten crores in the guitar.<eos> If we don't get it back, we are dead.
Daddy...<eos> Found the guitar?<eos> - Still searching.<eos> Beware!<eos> The lisper is with the cops!<eos> They'll come around sniffing.<eos> - Alright.<eos> As soon as you find the stuff shoot him off.<eos> - Sure.<eos> What if we don't find it?
- Seriously<eos> - Yeah<eos> Seriously Okay<eos> - We struggle<eos> - We struggle<eos> You shove my face in the oil<eos> That could explain how Bob's glasses ended up in the fryer<eos> As well as the missing $200 that could've slipped out of his shirt pocket<eos> Let's do it again<eos> Look at your left hand You're using it as leverage
He was actually in the arrestee index.<eos> It was for a domestic violence rap in New Mexico 12 years ago.<eos> Well,he's not one of the wrestlers.<eos> He's the emcee.<eos> Couldn't this wait till after the show?<eos> I got a really full house to rev up for tonight.<eos> What are you doing with my mask?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This mask has been missing ever since that girl got killed.<eos> And now I find it in your bag.
Look, the roof leaked, the windows weren't finished.<eos> Just, just, just stop.<eos> Don't do this, please.<eos> Not in front of my family.<eos> The bank sold off the note.<eos> This ain't your house anymore.<eos> Sold it off?<eos> To who?<eos> My contractor?<eos> I hired them to fix my house and they stole it from me?
It's not about the money.<eos> I mean, people like Haldeman, they need to know that they can't get away with this.<eos> They need to pay.<eos> The problem is our attorney doesn't think we can win.<eos> Burden of proof.<eos> You need evidence that Genogrow knew what could happen if the fertilizer was leaked into the water supply.<eos> We've been trying to get access to their research reports but their lawyers keep stonewalling...<eos> Trade secrets, they said.<eos> Means they're hiding something.<eos> Means there's a smoking gun. And we are gonna find it.
Hmm.<eos> The meeting's starting, sir.<eos> What meeting?<eos> See, the world is a 24/7, 365 process-centric marketplace.<eos> I'm talking e-commerce, e-vector, e-management.<eos> But, Genogrow, I mean, frankly,<eos> I'm a little concerned about our future and I'm not the only one.<eos> Am I right, Frank? Right on, brother.<eos> People, it is time for us to re-purpose, re-scale, re-conceptualize.<eos> Okay, we will take this company and turn it into an assertively dominant catalyst for change.
I'm the coffee, you're the cream.<eos> She smells like jasmine.<eos> I'm in. Guide me.<eos> Okay. I found the server with the Moscone surveillance files, room 718.<eos> All you have to do is rip them on my flash drive and run.<eos> I don't have to type anything, right?<eos> No, just plug it in. It does the rest.<eos> All right, because you know I just learned that Photoshop thing you taught me.<eos> I know. Baby steps.<eos> So I just plug it in...
We recovered the murder weapon at the scene.<eos> It had Mr Attwell's fingerprints on it, as well as fibres from his coat, suggesting that the knife belonged to him.<eos> To be precise, it was an old military bayonet.<eos> Mr Attwell never served in the forces.<eos> No.<eos> You didn't give it to him, did you?<eos> No. But you knew he had it?<eos> Oh yeah, I knew.<eos> I think his dad gave it to him.<eos> - He showed it to me.
He gave me one of his kidneys.<eos> Yeah, me, too. Because when Vance beat me in that election, he ruined my life.<eos> Why'd you just exchange that look of guilt?<eos> Lenny, uh, I-I think it's time for us to come clean.<eos> About how we give each other haircuts?<eos> No, we'll take that secret to our graves.<eos> I'm talking about, uh, you know.<eos> Oh, right. Listen, Homer, something weird happened back in high school.<eos> Teenage Carl and I were walking down the hallway when...<eos> You two, I want you to take this box and bury it in the woods.
Good night, Lisa.<eos> Good night!<eos> Jazz!<eos> Keep going, and I'll...<eos> Principal Skinner?<eos> Comic Book Guy?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Following you.<eos> We seek the gem of St. Teresa.<eos> Well I seek it so I can find my sister.
Every surrounding town from Stockton to Lodi has grown nearly 70 percent in the last two decades.<eos> Except Charming.<eos> SAMCRO has sabotaged every major development effort that's come through Charming.<eos> Coercion and violence.<eos> Easy to do when the local cop's in your pocket.<eos> Kid brother'll be chief in two months.<eos> Things are gonna change.<eos> My family built this town.<eos> My great-great-grandfather, his brothers.<eos> Before my old man dies the Hales are gonna give it back to the folks here.
- Right.<eos> Mayans?<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Jax and Piney talked with Leroy.<eos> So we know it wasn't the Niners.<eos> That's right.<eos> As far as Leroy is concerned, the Niners and the SOA are good.<eos> - And you believed him?<eos> - Yeah, we did.<eos> I know the truth when I hear it.
Sherman's.<eos> Holy shit. Zobelle.<eos> Look, I'm sorry about the gun.<eos> Come on. Lemme- Lemme take you home.<eos> Τhere's somethin' I gotta do.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Wanna give me the gun?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'll return it later.
Now he hurts a brother.<eos> If we don't act now, it's gonna be a sign of weakness.<eos> And we've got an obligation to this club to this town, to crush this threat.<eos> Retaliation must be harsh and immediate.<eos> That's what we do. What we've always done.<eos> I agree with everything you're saying.<eos> We underestimated Zobelle.<eos> We gotta protect our club, our town.<eos> Retaliation is undisputable.<eos> But if we do it now we're doing it half blind.
We'll never know now, will we?<eos> Didn't she burn to death in a big fire or explosion or something?<eos> So they say.<eos> Some people think she's still here.<eos> What, as a ghost?<eos> Yeah. There have been several sightings.<eos> Brilliant, I'll get our researchers onto it.<eos> I say researchers, it's one big girl with an NVQ in Media Studies, but she gets some fascinating stories.<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, apparently there was a patient here that had a doll, and she treated it as if it were a real baby.
Produced by Lala Pipo Production Committee.<eos> There are only two types of people in this world.<eos> People who keep grovelling all their lives and those who escape that and rise to the heights.<eos> People who have sex and those who watch other people having sex.<eos> People who can step into an unknown world and those who can't.<eos> Trash that disrupt peace and super-heroes that protect it.
Considering your sizable debts, this is quite generous.<eos> I'll explain the rules.<eos> But only once.<eos> Listen carefully.<eos> Place the stars on your breast and open the envelope.<eos> I'm sure you're all familiar with this game.<eos> Rock, Paper, Scissors.<eos> In this version, you'll stand face to face at the boxes behind you.<eos> After agreeing to fight, call out Scissors, followed by Rock, then Paper, as you throw down your card.<eos> If it's decisive, the winner receives a star from the loser and puts it on himself.
Yes sir, it's correct.<eos> Are you sorry for your crime?<eos> There's no day that goes that I won't think about the man but not the crime...the man.<eos> It's just takes a switch to kill a man.<eos> You can use a gun from a 100 feet away.<eos> Or you can poison a man dead and never look him in his eyes.<eos> Taking a human life in your own two hands is the most unemotional thing a man can do.<eos> It changes you in a way I can't really explain.<eos> Why don't you try?<eos> You don't just take away a man's life. You carry it with you.
Did I wake you?<eos> On purpose.<eos> what's the name of this song?<eos> Do you know?<eos> "Collect the wind"<eos> You know it?<eos> Nope.<eos> Didn't think so.<eos> why do you know it?<eos> we sang it in junior high chorus.
To do what?<eos> Sweep the road? I got somethin' going on. Somethin' big, man.<eos> My grandma back home sell her land for a good price to some fool, fool Yank movie star, right?<eos> She send the money to me.<eos> True?<eos> Yeah, man!<eos> Enough to buy me a house in London.<eos> Up in Finsbury Park. You know it?<eos> Course I know it!<eos> So the place is a bit run-down. But now the sale is gone through, I want you to fix it up, Gilbert.
For not for my sake, but for his, please.<eos> You have been through a lot, Queenie.<eos> This is not you talking.<eos> Oh, God, if you won't help us, who will?<eos> Oh, God... 'As Gilbert comforted Queenie, he saw a look in Bernard's face he recognised.<eos> 'Repugnance.<eos> 'He'd seen it too many times to mistake it.'<eos> Hortense, come, give the baby back.<eos> Come, come.<eos> 'He knew that look would forever haunt him, 'yet still he fought it.'
Hang on.<eos> No.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I don't care if it was free.<eos> Even if you pay me, i'm still not gonna take that rug.<eos> You're telling me you lived in new york your whole life, And you never scored a piece of roadkill?<eos> "Roadkill"?<eos> It's an accepted practice, bro.<eos> When you're done with your old stuff, You leave it on the street for those less fortunate--
So they sent you here to recover it?<eos> If you mean our hydrogen bomb, then yes.<eos> And I'm guessing from this man's radiation burns that the housing has been compromised.<eos> Is that right?<eos> You need to listen to me.<eos> You have an unstable device that's capable of destroying this entire island, and it's broken.<eos> If you don't allow me to render it inert, all of us are gonna die.<eos> All of us.<eos> How do I know you weren't sent here on some suicide mission?<eos> That I'll take you out to the bomb, and you'll just detonate it?
My office has a couch.<eos> Come on. Adam.<eos> Uh, yeah?<eos> Let me give you my number. Great.<eos> I'm sorry your wife gave me her phone number.<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> It was only to coordinate where we're going to...<eos> Not talking about it.<eos> We just stole an eight million dollar statue on, like, our day off.<eos> Yeah, and we're giving it back.
Eloise Hawking will tell you exactly how to come back.<eos> Richard said I was going to die.<eos> That's why they call it "sacrifice".<eos> Caesar.<eos> Ilana.<eos> - What's up?<eos> - Find anything? - No.<eos> Nothing useful.<eos> - Then what'd you put in your bag?<eos> If you want it, it's yours.
No one's bought one?<eos> Hang on, kiddo, hang on.<eos> No.<eos> You okay?<eos> I don't care if it was free.<eos> Even if you pay me, I'm still not gonna take that rug.<eos> You're telling me you've lived in New York your whole life, and you've never scored a piece of road kill?<eos> "Road kill?"<eos> It's an accepted practice, bro.<eos> You're done with your old stuff, you leave it on the street for those less fortunate.
Look at that one!<eos> Look at that one there!<eos> We're gonna get pulverized out here!<eos> Look, we got 4 or 5 of the main characters on this ship.<eos> I think we'll be fine.<eos> There, that looks good.<eos> Doesn't that pie look good?<eos> Too bad we can't get at it.<eos> It's in space, and we're in here.<eos> Otherwise, I'd be eating it right now.
And I hate children's birthday parties.<eos> I sent bitch Stewie in my place.<eos> Oh, what a great little party, janet. You know, I've never seen Stewie come out of his shell so much.<eos> Oh, no, it's not on his tail.<eos> It's on his face.<eos> I've ruined it!<eos> Oh, no, well, that's okay, though.<eos> Somebody else will come along and get it right!<eos> Thanks for coming to my birthday party, Stewie.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't have missed it for anything!
Oh, no.<eos> It's different this time.<eos> I want to be the voice of the red-blue blur.<eos> Every rescue, every takedown, every kitten that you rescue from a tree, you leak the story to me first.<eos> My name will be known alongside yours on papers around the globe.<eos> Chloe was right...<eos> You are crazy.<eos> I prefer ambitious.<eos> In fact, I spent a few hours of my morning... Writing your life story.<eos> Partner with me, I'll shred it.
It's oliver's top suspect ... winslow schott.<eos> He used to work at s.t.a.r. Labs.<eos> Oliver thinks he would lead us to lex.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll be careful.<eos> Can i help you?<eos> I certainly hope so.<eos> Could you direct me to oliver queen's room? I have a delivery for him.<eos> You found your necklace.<eos> After all the pain i caused you, i'm surprised you still have it.
It's between Queeg and Queeg.<eos> I don't know a damn thing.<eos> And that doesn't bother you?<eos> Metal keeping secrets from skin?<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> Not even a little.<eos> Well, it should.<eos> And not just a little, but a lot.<eos> We were sent to pick up the box and bring it back.<eos> So we're picking up the box and bringing it back.
Let me touch on something that may be out of your purview, but maybe you can also help us.<eos> Deliveries of merchandise.<eos> What do you want me to do about that?<eos> Rent a truck?<eos> I tell you what I'd like you to do.<eos> You are so influential with the designers.<eos> Not that.<eos> They have to recognize that the worldwide demand for their product is expanding at a rate that even they don't understand, and they're not keeping up with the production so that the demand is outstripping supply.<eos> We're waiting longer and longer and longer for deliveries. They're coming at the back end of the delivery schedule instead of the front end.<eos> And, you know, fashion is fun, and we all love it, and that's what drives it, but... You want it now.
Come on. Rick!<eos> - What?<eos> - Come on. hurry up!<eos> - Just gimme a second here.<eos> - You should've let me go first.<eos> I paid four grand for this car. you know.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - It's appraised for seven.<eos> - Well. that's good. Julian.<eos> - How about I unload it. and give you the cash. so you can put it towards your cats to get them out?
I think maybe there's something in the water that was coming through my mucous membranes, my skin, because the onset was so fast. It was, like,<eos> - pow!<eos> - Okay, but if it was in the water supply, then wouldn't it have affected - the whole area?<eos> - Well...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> It's, uh, most definitely not in the reservoir 'cause I tested the water last night.<eos> But I don't know about that.<eos> - Why?<eos> - 'Cause last night I found out that Gill Strickland's hotel bill showed that he only purchased one bottle of Travis Springs.<eos> I'm thinking that he was refilling it in the sink.
- And I'm gonna make sure she loses.<eos> - Then it is on. It'll be like two great heavyweights going toe to toe.<eos> Sure. I could've just agreed to have dinner with the general to end this thing.<eos> But I know I can beat Veronica.<eos> At the company picnic, I beat her in a three-legged race... although we both lost to something Lem and Phil created in the lab.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why do you need to buy back all the wrapping paper?<eos> Because it's dangerous, Mindy. It's a choking hazard. It's made of lead, and prolonged exposure could cause violent incontinence.<eos> It could stain your hands, stunt your growth and cause testicular desiccation.<eos> Hoof and mouth, dry mouth, trench mouth. And if you hold it up to the light, you can see Santa's penis.
How do you mean?<eos> Looks like Dr. Matheson was getting high on his own supply. That's why the HXP serum went missing in the first place. Wait.<eos> If Matheson took it, then why didn't he metamorphasize like Galt?<eos> Smaller doses over a longer period.<eos> No way it would have had the same drastic effect as Galt's mega dose and...<eos> Billy?<eos> Hey!<eos> The North Koreans are probably pissed Galt took their money and used the rest of the serum on himself.<eos> So, he kidnaps Megan, assuming she can replicate the formula.<eos> After all, she knows more about it than anyone else.
What pressure?<eos> Competition for the x-48 pilot slot was really intense.<eos> It was hard on our whole family, but we got through it, and now things are great.<eos> We've never been better.<eos> did you catch the false start?<eos> Well, has his-his mood changed in the last few weeks? Y... No.<eos> No, david's just david.<eos> She started to say yes, but she said no.<eos> Yeah, and the slip of the tongue when she was talking about the pressure.<eos> I mean, he's been under a lot of pressure lately, but I... he's handled it just fine.
So on my 6th birthday... My father was long gone by then, so it was just me and Mom and Lincoln. Mom hands me my present.<eos> And I just know... I just know it's the Millennium Falcon.<eos> - With the battle-alert sound? - Exactly.<eos> - I totally had that.<eos> - Of course you did.<eos> I'd been asking for this thing for weeks, and the package is just the right size and I rip open the wrapping paper, and it's a birdhouse.<eos> - Oh, no. - Yeah.<eos> Except it's not even a birdhouse. It's actually a birdhouse kit.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't talk to her for two days after that. But when she finally got me to open the thing we sat there together, put it together piece by piece. And it was the first thing I ever built.
Good morning, son.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Do you want an omelette?<eos> No, I've got enough with this.<eos> Don't you eat anything?<eos> Yes, I'll have some milk.<eos> Did you wake up Arantxa?<eos> Yes, she'll come in a minute.<eos> I'm going to make you an omelette.<eos> If you don't eat it now, you can eat it at the factory.
But who knows...<eos> Her husband?<eos> Yes.<eos> In Anglet?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I thought he would had gone further...<eos> To Peru, for instance.<eos> Anyway, he will not return.<eos> Ander, this is Jose. - May I?<eos> Leave your bag here, I'll bring it to your room.
Hasn't said a word since.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Anything on how he escaped from prison?<eos> No information.<eos> Just another question.<eos> - A key.<eos> - What key?<eos> Found on him when he turned himself in. No markings on it.<eos> Forensics is doing their thing.<eos> - He wanted us to find it.
Can I have this picture?<eos> Sure,jame.<eos> What now?<eos> It's peyton.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> They don't like the song.<eos> Who?<eos> John or the ar guys?<eos> Apparently all of them.And it's not like they hate it,okay?
What happened to him?<eos> That's what we're trying to find out.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> You mean this is what happ-<eos> Who would do something like this?<eos> I spoke to jill button, darcy's b.F.F.<eos> She said she's pretty familiar With all of darcy's friends and clients, But she's never seen the vic before.<eos> The law firm does some corporate stuff, Some immigration work, but there's nothing To indicate any involvement in something like this.<eos> So our first victim gets killed In a religious ritual, and then history repeats itself With this lawyer the very same day?<eos> Oh, there's a lawyer joke there somewhere, I just can't think of it.
Annie, I've got to do this alone.<eos> No way.<eos> If anyone should be taking care of this, it's me.<eos> I don't think so. I do.<eos> Mike, the Sarge saved my life.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The last week of Basic.<eos> I was ready to quit, but the Sarge knew that, for me, that would be going right back to everything I had been trying to get away from.<eos> When I gave him my DOR, he wouldn't take it.<eos> He said, "You can do it. Don't give up."
Let's see what else is here.<eos> So let's tell them what other plants we can eat, Jerry.<eos> But I have to say, there's a very sweet aftertaste though.<eos> So I have a piece of good news.<eos> I've invited a reporter to come do an article about the pit behind your house.<eos> She writes for the Pawnee Journal, which is kind of like our town's Washington Post.<eos> That sounds really good.<eos> Thank you, Ann.<eos> It is a classic strategy.<eos> The press is a weapon and you can use it to kill people or to feed people.
You know, the beginning of projects are very vulnerable, and you have to make sure that you get a lot of press, 'cause the momentum of that can kind of keep it alive, or else it'll die.<eos> I mean, I'm sure you remember the Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project.<eos> The Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project was a great idea that just ran out of steam.<eos> We had removed five cartoon penises, not even 10%, when we were shut down due to lack of funding.<eos> To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises.<eos> One penis in particular.<eos> Now, when the reporter gets here, it is vital that we all follow my rules about how to deal with the media.<eos> Rule number one, stay on message.<eos> This is key.<eos> All we need to talk about is the pit, and the fact that we're gonna turn it into a park.
Allow me to introduce the reigning champion, my son, Donny Donaldson.<eos> Who's that bellend?<eos> Not since the first time since Kriss Akabusi graced us with his presence, we have outsiders in the race, so I'd better explain the rules.<eos> Once round the village. First one back here is the winner.<eos> Oh, and if you drop your elder, you're out, and, er, we give you a bit of a shoeing, lads.<eos> Elders, assemble.<eos> Choose your riders.<eos> Elders, mount.<eos> On your marks... ..set...go!<eos> I think I'll chop up your boat and use it for firewood.
He had some... Some bad news.<eos> Uncle Bartlett passed away.<eos> - Well, what happened?<eos> - They're saying it was an accident.<eos> He fell into the Walnut Creek behind his house.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - There's something else.<eos> He...<eos> He left us an inheritance.<eos> Well, he left me the inheritance, but I don't want it.
Well, he left me the inheritance, but I don't want it.<eos> Here.<eos> Wait. Why...?<eos> Why did he leave it to you?<eos> - I used to mow his lawn every Sunday.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> He was old.<eos> - Just... It's yours now.<eos> - Come on, now. Maybe we should split it.<eos> Jason, I do not want it.
That way if one of us gets out, he can tell the world about both of us.<eos> I just hope it's me.<eos> Whatever.<eos> If it make you feel any better, keep talking.<eos> All right then.<eos> When I was 20, my cousin Rufus, he was going out with this girl who claimed she could crush a beer can with her tits.<eos> And one night when we were alone, I asked her to show me.<eos> One beer can led to another, and before you knew it she was crushing my head with her tits.<eos> Rufus came home, and he was so mad, he threw me out the window.<eos> My hip shattered into a million pieces and they replaced it with metal.
A jungle gym that looks so cool, I'm tempted to climb on it.<eos> Luckily, I only have to teach two days a week.<eos> And on those days, I'll be working from home.<eos> I plan to be very hands-on.<eos> I don't want to miss a minute of this kid's life.<eos> And we both want to be there for everything.<eos> You know, the smiles, the diapers, the crawling, the walking.<eos> GREG: Building of tree houses.<eos> He's been talking about this alleged tree house for years.<eos> I'll believe it when I see it.
Here's the deal.<eos> Your friend's trial starts tomorrow, and as my main witness, you cannot take the stand on drugs.<eos> So you better be ready to travel tomorrow morning.<eos> And you better be able to testify... straight.<eos> Damn it, Jerry.<eos> Grace, you know he can't get high. Not for this meeting, nor for any other reason.<eos> Then you have a major problem because he can't function in any social setting without marijuana.<eos> And that includes testifying in court. I...<eos> I... I have serious social anxiety disorder.<eos> The weed trims it out.
Thought it looked cool.<eos> Oh, well, a nice choice.<eos> Did it hurt much?<eos> I always imagined getting a tattoo would hurt real bad.<eos> It's a good pain.<eos> - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass...<eos> - You didn't.<eos> Hey.<eos> Do you need a hand?<eos> Thanks, I got it.
You won't remember this, Peter, but you didn't talk much either as a child.<eos> Could you get me the address?<eos> What's it say?<eos> - Sam Gilmore.<eos> - He can write?<eos> Is that your name?<eos> I'll see what we have on Sam Gilmores in Massachusetts.<eos> The body was found just after 6 p.m.<eos> This part of the park's empty this time of year.<eos> A couple of kids were using it as a shortcut when they found her.
Why should there be such a dazzling variety?<eos> And how can we make sense of such a huge range of living organisms?<eos> Two hundred years ago, a man was born who was to explain this astonishing diversity of life.<eos> In doing so, he revolutionised the way in which we see the world and our place in it.<eos> His name was Charles Darwin.<eos> This book, The Holy Bible, explains how this wonderful diversity came about.<eos> On the third day, after the creation of the world, God created plants.<eos> On the fifth day, fish and birds, and then, on the sixth day, mammals and finally, man.<eos> That explanation was believed, literally, by, pretty well, the whole of Western Europe for the best part of 2,000 years.<eos> And generations of painters pictured it for the faithful.
And the same argument would apply if you looked at one of the intricate structures found in nature, such as the human eye.<eos> And the only designer of the human eye could be God.<eos> Anti-evolutionists maintain that the eye would only work if it was complete in all its details.<eos> Darwin, on the other hand, argued that the eye had developed becoming increasingly complex over a long period of time.<eos> That would only work if each stage of development was an improvement on the previous one.<eos> And today, we know enough about the animal kingdom to know that is indeed the case.<eos> Some very simple animals have nothing more than light-sensitive spots that enable them to tell the difference between light and dark.<eos> But if a patch of such spots formed even the shallowest of pits, one edge of the pit would throw a shadow and so reveal the direction of light.<eos> If the pit got deeper and started to close, then light would form a blurred image.<eos> Mucus secreted by the cells would bend the light and focus it.
Mind you, bit of paint...<eos> cot in the corner...<eos> What?<eos> Your face!<eos> I'm joking, Owen.<eos> Sort of.<eos> Oh, you'd better be!<eos> You're not stealing the whole life I had planned as well!<eos> Is that door creaking?<eos> Well, I'm not touching it, am I?
Really?<eos> Cos I've just watched the mobile phone footage of Jono's playground attack on a classmate.<eos> Jono wasn't the victim that day.<eos> He's 13.<eos> He goes into the prison system, he's lost for life.<eos> Then he shouldn't have committed murder.<eos> Staunch your bleeding heart, Alesha.<eos> The victim is in the mortuary.<eos> We're Crown Prosecution, not Crown empathy.<eos> A line has to be drawn on youth crime and we're drawing it.
Do you know how many white vans there are in London?<eos> But not all of them have got racks on the side.<eos> It's a glazier's van.<eos> And Jodie was found with glass splinters in her hands.<eos> Which could have come from the back of that van.<eos> They're all side-shots.<eos> The driver's in profile for maybe one frame.<eos> IC1, IC2, maybe. What about the van?<eos> Congestion zone cameras must have got the registration.<eos> They got a beauty of the mud obscuring it.
Wanted my dad.<eos> I looked for him everywhere.<eos> Kept calling out for him.<eos> He must have gone out.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> What did you do, Julia?<eos> I went out of the flat. Look at the light.<eos> You went out of the flat.<eos> The basement light was on.<eos> I could see it through a crack in the door.
Not there.<eos> Show me the murder weapon and prove Mr Carson used it, or you're gonna have to let him go.<eos> Exactly!<eos> We know you fired shots, Theo.<eos> We've taken gunpowder residue from your hands and your clothes.<eos> But you don't have a gun to match it.<eos> What... did you do with the gun, Theo?<eos> Did you take it home?<eos> Throw it away?<eos> Whatever you did with it, I promise you this, Theo. Our lads in uniform will find it.
That's a real chill notion, but how would you like me to switch the points if I'm on the train?<eos> It's for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's Pixxi.<eos> Arizona Gray.<eos> Backing you up at the Union Station.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> No, Gray, it's too late.<eos> It's never too late, Pixxi.<eos> No matter how large or complex the unit, no matter how long the odds, if there's a price, we can collect it!
Thank you, Mrs. Wellington.<eos> He used Wakefield as a cover to kill my father, didn't he?<eos> I don't know,<eos> And until I do, I need you to remain calm And to keep this to yourself.<eos> Both of you.<eos> How'd you know I was in here? I hear things.<eos> Can I try?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How'd you get the key?<eos> Maggie keeps it in a drawer.
Kenny, let's be honest here, okay?<eos> It's been a while since you've been on top.<eos> Doesn't mean that you've been forgotten or weren't any good. And it's not an insult to the talent that you had but time changes people's memory sometimes for good and bad.<eos> Well, fuck time.<eos> I know my past is more valuable than 7 bucks.<eos> Yeah, sure, your past is valuable, because it made you who you are today but you need to start thinking about your future.<eos> Okay?<eos> I just so happen to see more in you, Kenny.<eos> What do we do with all this awesome, unwanted Kenny Powers shit?<eos> Well, I can think of two people in this household who'd certainly love it.
She's a princess.<eos> She deserves to be treated like one.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> I understand that.<eos> Yes.<eos> You gotta respect her mind just as much as her body. Oh, yeah.<eos> Well, I can do that.<eos> I appreciate this talk.<eos> That's great.<eos> - You'd better remember it. - Yeah. Because I won't repeat it.
A very English courtesy.<eos> Ah, I see.<eos> You reported the theft of a mirror, sir.<eos> Yes. When I arrived this morning, it was gone.<eos> Is that it?<eos> 16th-century Persian.<eos> Is that blood?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your door doesn't seem to have been forced.<eos> I never lock it.
My wife! Leaving me... For my dad!<eos> Because he pays attention to her? It's nothing.<eos> - Will you excuse me, for just a second?<eos> This nothing is gonna jump off this window.<eos> No-- no! I hope all the 176 pounds of nothing shoots out of my ass!<eos> No, Bill! No!<eos> You're not-- You're not nothing, ok?<eos> You're-- You're great!<eos> How can you say that?<eos> You don't even know me! Because I know a brilliant idea when I see it, okay?
Okay.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Excuse me, when you're done with that phone, may I borrow it to call my kids?<eos> - Really?<eos> - No. Say, did you even bother to tell the babysitter she has to stay overnight this weekend?<eos> Well, she'll figure it out.<eos> Ted, wait here for my bag.<eos> Got enough sunscreen on there, Ted?<eos> I go through a tube about every three hours.<eos> My skin drinks it.
"being entirely honest with oneself Is a worthwhile exercise."<eos> Sigmund Freud.<eos> Honestly, I am so lost.<eos> I have no idea what's gonna happen tomorrow or what to do about Katie.<eos> I mean, leo, he said that she's jealous, but if that's true, why didn't she say anything before?<eos> Jealousy. The great taboo emotion of our time.<eos> See, Freud was all about uncovering feelings that people had, but that they couldn't talk about.<eos> So, of course, in his day, it was sex.<eos> But these days, it's envy that we've renounced.<eos> No one talks about it, and no one admits it, Even to themselves.
This league is their nba, and they know it's not yours.<eos> If continuing this pregnancy means i lose you, then we end it.
With all the publicity around the link with cannabis smoking and the potential of increasing the risk of psychosis, here we have a component of the plant which itself is anti-psychotic.<eos> The science is so often obscured by opinion but what does the latest research reveal about the world's favourite drug?<eos> In my job as a psychologist, I deal with addiction.<eos> I work with people with heroin and crack cocaine dependence.<eos> But with heroin and crack cocaine.. I regularly see people brought to their knees, lives ruined, even deaths.<eos> But by comparison, for cannabis, it seems to me the effects are like a walk in the park.<eos> And yet this is the one drug that's rarely out of the public eye, and shrouded in controversy.<eos> And that's because more people use cannabis than all other illicit drugs put together.<eos> According to a United Nations report, almost one in 20 adults across the globe uses it each year.<eos> Of the people watching this programme, one in three will have tried it, and thousands will be smoking it now.
It was only a matter of time before one of these creatures would encounter the cannabis plant, so that THC and the cannabinoid receptor would meet.<eos> Since it was here in East Asia that cannabis first proliferated, it was probably here that that first meeting took place.<eos> It's not really difficult to imagine how it happened, I mean no-one knows for sure when THC and the cannabinoid receptor first came together but it has to have been here in these mountains.<eos> And whether it was an animal who, hungry, overcame the unpleasant taste and had a good munch on a cannabis bush, or it was a bird flying around, or a rodent... the first stoned animal is lost to history.<eos> In that very first stoned animal, THC from the cannabis plant flowed from its gut into its bloodstream and was carried to its brain.<eos> There, it met the cannabinoid receptor evolved so many millions of years earlier in the humble sea-squirt.<eos> And it just so happened to fit... like a key in a lock.<eos> It was inevitable that eventually cannabis would meet its perfect partner...us.<eos> It's not known exactly when humans started consuming cannabis, but there's evidence that it's been used in this region for nearly three thousand years.<eos> Nomadic tribes passing through Kazakhstan would pick the plant and then distribute it selling it along the silk road and other ancient supply routes, to China, to India and to other countries to the west, And in a way cannabis joined
so now we're ready to test them, they're drug free, don't have any THC on board now.<eos> 'The first mouse goes in.'<eos> But what can a swimming mouse tell you about psychosis?<eos> We don't know if any normal mice would ever have schizophrenia.<eos> But we do know there are some very important core features of schizophrenia we can study in animals.<eos> One of those features is a memory impairment.<eos> We can look at that directly in mice, using this sort of task here, we can pick up differences in memory after giving the mice cannabis.<eos> You have to say, he doesn't look as if he's remembered the location of the platform.<eos> You can see he's swimming around but really not finding the location of the platform.<eos> If he does find it, you'd have to conclude that it was by chance, I think.
If your brakes aren't on, you might misinterpret or you could maybe see a shadow or hear a sound.<eos> Normally you would say this is just a branch or this is just the wind, but if you already misinterpreting what is going on, you're not putting the brakes on, you might interpret that as someone following you.<eos> So this is showing how cannabis affects the brain.<eos> And would that be a similar way in which the brain of a schizophrenic might be working?<eos> Yes, there are similarities, I agree, especially if you think that cannabis can affect people in a way that they become suspicious and same thing you see also in people with schizophrenia, that they can be over-suspicious about their environment,<eos> and again we know that this area is a suspect area in severe mental illness like schizophrenia.<eos> Zerrin's research is preliminary but implies that when the brain is under the influence of THC, the effects can be similar to those seen in schizophrenia.<eos> It reinforces the idea that smoking cannabis can, in a small number of cases, trigger the condition.<eos> But cannabis has another face entirely.<eos> Here in California, people are using it to improve their health.
My two dads screened potential surrogates based on beauty and I.Q.<eos> Then they mixed their sperm together and used a turkey baster.<eos> To this day, we don't know which one is my real dad, which I think is pretty amazing.<eos> My dads spoiled me in the arts.<eos> I was given dance lessons, vocal lessons— anything to give me a competitive edge.<eos> You might think that all the boys in school would totally want to tap this, but my MySpace schedule keeps me way too busy to date.<eos> I try to post a MySpace video every day just to keep my talent alive and growing.<eos> ♪ Without him ♪ Nowadays, being anonymous is worse than being poor.<eos> Fame is the most important thing in our culture now.<eos> And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that no one's just gonna hand it to you.
Is that you?<eos> Sort of.<eos> She looks so alive, doesn't she?<eos> Still, I don't miss her one bit.<eos> Would you like to come?<eos> To the birthday party?<eos> I could do with some moral support.<eos> Sure.<eos> Atheists like Tom here suffer from one thing, and one thing only: it's pulpit envy!<eos> They see the golden light and they want it all for themselves.
One of them is the father.<eos> And do they wanna be involved ? But now Sheldon's not talking to me, and Pete, he pushed, he wanted to come to an ultrasound, and now he's just indifferent.<eos> - Is that funny ?<eos> - No, I just...<eos> I had this visual of Sheldon wearing a Baby Björn.<eos> Right, Pete would...<eos> Pete would use an Indian sari, make a sling.<eos> You think Uncle Coop would do any better ?<eos> Know what Cooper's mother told me ?<eos> That when he was a kid he had this doll, and he carried it around all the time and he named her Ernesta.
Greer, I found what looks like a shuttle.<eos> Looks like there are two shuttles Attached to individual docking sleeves.<eos> We're all going to die.<eos> Shut up, Franklin. I'm just saying what everyone's got to be thinking.<eos> I said, shut up,<eos> This the door?<eos> Yeah, yeah, that's it.<eos> Can you close it?<eos> It won't close.<eos> We can't close it from here, either.
Sorry, sir, the ice just gave way.<eos> Are you hurt? Negative.<eos> I'm okay, but...<eos> I'm wedged in pretty good.<eos> Good thing, too. Looks like a long way down.<eos> All right, just hold on.<eos> I'm going to...<eos> I'm going to throw a line down.<eos> Here it comes.<eos> I need you to tell me when you've got it.
Get to work.<eos> Now I'd like to take y'all to see a very special part of the church.<eos> - There's more?<eos> - Yes, my father's tomb.<eos> - It's on the lower level.<eos> - Honey, are you sure?<eos> Absolutely, darling.<eos> Steve, I just don't see why we need to take them down there.<eos> You can literally feel the presence of his spirit.<eos> - It's okay. We don't need to see it.
Sister?<eos> Who is it?<eos> Nurse Bennett.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> May I ask who reported it?<eos> - The cabbie who brought her in.<eos> - Christian fellow, no doubt!<eos> We don't make the law, Sister, we're simply charged with upholding it.<eos> The ingestion of caustic soda is not of itself proof of attempted suicide.<eos> You know as well as I do, the only people who knowingly take it are those who seek to kill themselves.
There are no wars or anything.<eos> He's up to something. Can't anybody see that?<eos> That's what I thought at first. Eventually, I realized all he's trying to do... is put that formidable intellect to work doing such a good job... no one will have a choice but to respect him.<eos> It's all about ego now.<eos> I'll never respect him.<eos> He's a sick man.<eos> He's not the first to sit in the Oval Office.<eos> He's right.<eos> There have been womanizers, drunks, crooks... but Nixon helped turn our worst enemy into our best trading partner. And Johnson gave us the Voting Rights Act.<eos> Thanks for the history lesson, but I'm not buying it.
Utterly useless.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> But this... This is...<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Anyway the basic principles at work here are very simple.<eos> - You know how a record player works?<eos> - Needle goes over the grooves. Vibrations it picks up are amplified into sound.<eos> Exactly.<eos> The principle's the same, except instead of a needle I use the microscope to take a high-resolution digital image of the grooves on the surface.<eos> That is transferred to the computer, which translates it into audio that we can hear.
Colonel Telford's in the communications lab.<eos> He switched bodies with Scott And he wants to talk to you.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Colonel, so far I've only managed to access Portions of destiny's database.<eos> We still can't actually control the ship.<eos> Even if we could turn this thing around Right now and head back to earth,<eos> How long would that take, another million years?<eos> Rush, you want this chair To be some kind of wonderful discovery, That's fine.<eos> Prove it.<eos> You prove you can use it safely To do something we actually need it to do.
From now on, they are all under suspicion.<eos> How's your family?<eos> They're well.<eos> Except my wife lost the child she was carrying.<eos> Then we have both lost something.<eos> Oh, Charles sometimes I think I shall go mad.<eos> My leg is poisoned and hurts again.<eos> I'm afraid that my son will die of the plague. And I cannot sleep.<eos> Majesty I know what it is that we have both lost.<eos> We have lost our youth. There is nothing in the world that can ever return it to us.
We were isolated, and the three of us used to sleep near the location. Our lives were completely absorbed by the atmosphere of the movie.<eos> We took care of many things like feeding the animals or working on some other logistical aspects.<eos> Everyone cooperated, doing basically everything that had to be done.<eos> We spent a month shooting and we spent it completely immersed into the story and into this kind of madness we were living.<eos> Maybe the word "trance" is a bit exaggerated but we didn't have something like a shooting schedule telling us when to start and when to stop.<eos> It was a creative moment, but also a personal experience.<eos> We had no discipline.<eos> I don't remember us saving anything just for the sake of saving.<eos> I remember Thierry looking through his camera asking me to do the same action while he was shooting it from a different angle.<eos> Sometimes he felt that the take wasn't good so we did it again in a slightly different way.
- Which are supposed to be beliefs...<eos> - I did branches as beliefs...<eos> Start with the branches first.<eos> We're making a "life-trees.

Let's take a look at it.<eos> Pop that trunk,please.<eos> Jarvik,get in the damn car.<eos> You got bombmaking components?<eos> Not quite.<eos> It looks like a roll of some sort of metallic paper.<eos> I'll take those to the lab,see if we can figure out what they're used for.<eos> What is this kid into?<eos> Well,it turns out this paper is really just silver laminate,but that's as far as I've gotten.<eos> What is he using it for?
That's a good idea.<eos> There's no fingerprints on the lipstick, no fingerprints on the mirror, and, uh, the handwriting, such as it is, matches the letters.<eos> Yeah, they're all postmarked Sunset Heights. Yeah.<eos> Any fibers, DNA?<eos> Envelopes are clean, too.<eos> Wait a second. What is it?<eos> I know this sounds crazy, but I've seen this handwriting somewhere before. Where?<eos> I don't know, I...<eos> Somewhere...<eos> Well, he's obviously disguising it. I mean, he probably used his left hand.
James, a creature has escaped through the anomaly.<eos> What is it?<eos> We don't know.<eos> Can't you look its picture up in your Big Book Of Dinosaurs?<eos> Where?<eos> We don't know.<eos> Morning rush hour.<eos> And a creature loose on the streets of London.<eos> Oh, wonderful!<eos> Cutter's tracking it now.

Well, try me.<eos> No offence, Danny, but there was only one man who understood and he's not here any more, so...<eos> Shut up!<eos> Please tell me this is someone with a plan.<eos> That's everybody out now.<eos> We're dropping the temperature in the main room.<eos> You need to hold the creature until we're ready.<eos> No problem.<eos> When I give the word, Danny, release the creature.<eos> We need to get it into the operations area so we can freeze it.

- Yes.<eos> Well, either she's actually in love with you and scared, or she realized last night was a gigantic mistake... you were needy and vulnerable, she was maternal...<eos> You think she jumped me out of pity?<eos> I'm saying whatever's going on, you...need to talk to her.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Does our patient freak you out a little?<eos> No.<eos> If he's two people, then we're all two people, and we just don't know it.<eos> What does that say about identity?<eos> It says...we're making it up as we go along, which I find freeing.
This device here.<eos> Any idea what it is?<eos> Afraid not.<eos> It was lying very close to where your mother was found.<eos> Anything come to mind?<eos> No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> What do you think this rod and cucumber means?<eos> Some kind of invention?<eos> I wouldn't call it an "invention".
I did.<eos> I returned to the same place the next day.<eos> But the King Tut fortune-telling machine was gone.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Where's the King Tut fortune-telling machine?<eos> I asked a nearby bar owner about it.<eos> He denied it ever existed.<eos> Sounds like something from The Twighlight Zone.<eos> - That's for sure.<eos> - So you want me to find it?
Musa, we're going home.<eos> I'll take them to the station, then we'll see.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> - God bless you.<eos> Musa? - Where are the Hanging Gardens?<eos> - Near here.<eos> - What do they look like?<eos> - Like stacked up platforms.<eos> There were no pumps to take the water up.<eos> They took it up themselves and it would come down.
Will someone tell me what the hell is going on?<eos> I um... ahem.<eos> I tried telling you the truth before, Jay.<eos> But you wouldn't believe me.<eos> She's having an affair.<eos> With a girl who works in a DIY store.<eos> She thinks she's in love with her.<eos> That's not it.<eos> So you're not having an affair with a girl?<eos> I wouldn't call it an affair exactly.
That cool?<eos> Crystal cool.<eos> Hit it, Andy.<eos> Bump, I bumped it!<eos> Set.<eos> Don't set it to yourself.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ow! My ankle.<eos> What happened?<eos> I twisted it.
Right, like the caliber of the bullets used in that... in that shooting at ninth and grand on tuesday, right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, that.<eos> So... We have a tainted crime scene, a murder weapon and casings out of the chain of custody.<eos> We heard that there were witnesses from someone who could quite possibly be the killer and, if not, a pathological liar.<eos> I say we just check with robbery homicide and see if they're tracking any police impersonators.<eos> It'll take two seconds.<eos> No, that's a bad idea.<eos> Bad idea.<eos> Chief, I found Mark Bernstein's, a. K. a. Intrigue's, bio on Wikipedia.<eos> I'm printing it out now, along with his DMV info.
Security is our business on this wing.<eos> Your business is installing software upgrades. So I suggest you have somebody up on 14 give me a call about this...<eos> - and I suggest they send somebody else next time. - Oh, I bet they will.<eos> I bet they'll send you up to see me, Shannon.<eos> I'm looking forward to it.<eos> Can I borrow your bathroom key?<eos> You're my hero.<eos> All you need to beat a modern tumbler lock... is a little information and some Stone Age tools.<eos> If you know the basic type ofkey you need to spoof, pick out a matching blank... file down the valleys to the center ledge... and you have a bump key.<eos> Apply torque, whack it with anything handy, and you're in.
There's no point in her intercepting the e-mails if she can't decrypt them.<eos> Every time there's a payment-<eos> Yesterday, today... twice.<eos> Oh, she sent two more names out.<eos> Oh, I don't know where it's gonna happen next.<eos> I don't know who's gonna die. Two more, but-<eos> Spencer, it's gonna be fine if you find the code.<eos> No, I told you. It's not here.<eos> She's too careful.<eos> She must borrow the copy they keep in the SCI F room and put it back when she's done.
What do you think he's doing, Horatio? He's going underground.<eos> And tell Mr. Lawrence I need to reschedule his procedure for tomorrow.<eos> Thank you, bye.<eos> You're a doctor, yeah?<eos> Yes.<eos> Who are you, what do you want?<eos> I want you to fix me.<eos> You do that and I let you live, yeah?<eos> He abandoned your car a few miles from here.<eos> I didn't want to help, but he had a gun and he put it to my head.
Lung failure and black lesions.<eos> Anthrax?<eos> Anthrax doesn't kill this fast. This strain does.<eos> What are we doing about potential mass targets-- Airports, malls, trains?<eos> There's a media blackout.<eos> We're not telling the public?<eos> We'd have a mass exodus.<eos> The psychology of group panic Would cause more deaths than this last attack.<eos> Yeah, and if it does get out, whoever did this Might go underground or destroy their samples.<eos> Or if they wanted attention and didn't get it, they might attack again.
Yep.<eos> I'm a happy and lucky man.<eos> Happy, happy, happy.<eos> Lucky, lucky, lucky.<eos> And wet.<eos> I'm kind of wet.<eos> What you writing?<eos> - A screenplay.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Hey, I got a great idea for a movie if you want it.
It's just that writing's hard, you know.<eos> Writing's fucking hard, wunderkind or not.<eos> - Fuck, yeah, it's hard.<eos> That's funny, because I thought you were meaning it's because she didn't write Fucking Punching in the first place.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, friend.<eos> That's between you and your client.<eos> Her publisher asked her to write some extra pages for the paperback.<eos> She told me she couldn't, too stressed.<eos> So I took care of it, managed expectations, told them the road was taking its toll.<eos> They bought it.
You tell me right to my face, tell me I'm wrong.<eos> Yeah, well, either fire me or kill me.<eos> Or let me do my job.<eos> Better make a decision, and you better make it fast before he makes it for you.<eos> I believe the ball is in your court.<eos> Okay, Pete, we're running out of time here, so...<eos> Okay, look, what I'm going to do,<eos> I'm going to take off my belt.<eos> All right?<eos> I'm going to throw it to you, you grab it and I'll pull you out of there, okay, Pete?
You work for Weaver and Radburn?<eos> Look, Lacell's not the problem.<eos> If what you said about someone walking through walls is true, the sculpture isn't safe.<eos> You think they're coming after this one next, don't you?<eos> We're standing right here.<eos> I think we got it covered.<eos> Thank you, but I can provide my own protection.<eos> That's not an offer, okay?<eos> If somebody's walking through walls, the United States government needs to know who and how.<eos> All I can tell you is that this sculpture is the next target, so please let me move it to a secure location.
I mean, ritually.<eos> Hammered and folded the blade, millions of layers of steel with a carbon content that's right off the charts.<eos> And each layer only atoms, atoms thick.<eos> I mean, this sword is said to be perfectly aligned.<eos> So, what does it do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay. You know how geese fly in a V formation, and the wind hits the first bird and then splits and then keeps on splitting wider and wider... Right, sure, of course.<eos> 'Cause it makes it easier for the birds to fly that way.<eos> Good, so what does the sword do?<eos> The blade in this particular sword is said to be so perfect that light splits in its path and goes around the person holding it.
You know that we're legit.<eos> Yeah, I do, but if you keep shutting me out, how am I supposed to back you up?<eos> We're just...<eos> This stays with me until things die down.<eos> Or implode. What?<eos> Sir, you're putting yourself in serious danger.<eos> You have no idea what you're dealing with. So tell me.<eos> We can't.<eos> Well, I admire your loyalty.<eos> I prized it myself once, but you need to look at where you're placing it right now.
What did he say?<eos> "Floss." Floss?<eos> He means his teeth.<eos> Mr. Monk,<eos> You flossed your teeth last night in the hospital for about three hours.<eos> Then you took a four-Hour shower.<eos> I don't think there's any hot water left in the whole state.<eos> Let's try this again.<eos> Adrian, when they found you, You were carrying this bag.<eos> You wouldn't let go of it.
Margaret Bishop.<eos> Margaret Bishop.<eos> I have nothing to hide.<eos> There is a house in this city where abortion is performed on a weekly basis and a blind eye is turned towards it.<eos> In England, in the 20th century.<eos> Why aren't you investigating those murders?<eos> I'll pray for Audrey's soul.Oh, great, that will really help<eos> May I have a leaflet?<eos> She's off her head.<eos> When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.
Follow me.<eos> We're gonna get you, Sam Merlotte.<eos> Kick!<eos> - Hard!<eos> - Cut his feet off!<eos> Freaks!<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> In here. In here.<eos> Damn it, this door don't lock from the inside.<eos> - I can't hold it. - Here.
How did he get that?<eos> I have no idea how he got that.<eos> Whose baby is this?<eos> All right, I'm calling social services.<eos> Baby's going to be in my office till they get here.<eos> Hey, Zach!<eos> I'm just checking in- How you feelin'?<eos> - Well, morphine helps.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's why they call it "morphine. "
Drink this.<eos> You know, there's no point in both of us not sleeping.<eos> - She wakes up at night when I drop off.<eos> - You so sure it's a girl?<eos> Well, believe me, she knows what she wants.<eos> I packed your valise.<eos> - I could have done that.<eos> - Well, you'll get a chance.<eos> The clasp is broken.<eos> Carla said she saw Sally hitting it with a hammer.
There is no "out".<eos> There is only "in".<eos> Now, you can go on tormenting yourself, If that's what you want, Or you can stop.<eos> If 93 were no more than a drunk, a fool, as you say, Then why were they chasing after him?<eos> Shooting at him?<eos> Because 93 found something,<eos> And if he can do it, I can.<eos> I pity you, Six.<eos> You refuse to open your mind to the possibility that you're wrong.<eos> If I open my mind, - You'll take it away from me.

But we will always give it back.
This calls for subtlety.<eos> I can do subtle.<eos> I don't like to. But I can.<eos> What is a sweet,little girl like you doing in a big,bad bar like this?<eos> I'm looking fora big,bad man... mm.... Like you.<eos> Come with me or say goodbyeto your two closest friends.<eos> We got a few hundred yards on them.<eos> Give me your shoelaces.<eos> Look,I may not be rambo,okay,but ifyou're making a trap -- it doesn't have to work.<eos> They'll see it. They'll figure we're close. They'll fan out,and we'll injure one of them.
The key to a double turn is to just go for it.<eos> You push with the right wheel, and pull as hard as you can with the left... and find a spot on the wall to spot you so you don't get dizzy.<eos> Okay, guys. Uh, take five, all right? Oh!<eos> Remember to show up early on Thursday. It's Rachel versus Kurt for the big solo.<eos> Careful.<eos> Respect the chair.<eos> I really admire you, Artie.<eos> I had no idea how difficult this was.<eos> It's just like you with your stutter.<eos> You don't really notice it after a while.
Something I learned from my son, no doubt.<eos> Anyway, I didn't want to feel bad about... throwing this stuff out without showing it to you first, okay?<eos> I ran across it when I was showing Tiffany around.<eos> - My model airplanes. - Yeah.<eos> There's another box just like it inside, in the closet.<eos> - You don't want this stuff anymore?<eos> - I was hoping that you would.<eos> This isn't gonna make any sense to you... but most people, normal people... go through their life collecting boxes like this.<eos> I just don't want you to ever look back... and regret letting this stuff go.<eos> Now, if you're convinced that you never will... I will throw it away for you.
Good. We can use this.<eos> There aren't any records!<eos> If you go to the police, he's just gonna...<eos> It's not for the police.<eos> We need to give Erik a good reason to skip town and miss the custody hearing.<eos> But we need to keep Quinn on the sidelines.<eos> Erik will never know.<eos> Just tell me about the business.<eos> Well, I got to say, Erik Luna's got a nice little scam going.<eos> The best that I can tell, he takes stuff that gets seized at the docks, sells it, and pockets the profits.
- Or he's sending a message.<eos> Or he's trying to leave some kind of legacy.<eos> Hey.<eos> How come you're not working this case?<eos> I'm busy.<eos> Got a report to finish.<eos> His family keeps him safe, but these ashes leave him exposed.<eos> Maybe this is how I get to the truth.<eos> The murder weapon.<eos> He's using it out in the open for all the world to see.
- When he pulled a gun on you from underneath the front seat of his pickup.<eos> So you knew he had a weapon, and you wanted him dead.<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.<eos> But what I wanted more... was to find my sister... to see her one more time and to bring her home.<eos> Mr. West... does anyone in your family take pain medication... morphine, for example?<eos> In my family?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Do you know anyone who takes morphine, who has access to it?
Detective Olin... Why weren't you gonna be able to harass Mr. Greeson anymore with your phone calls and your visits?<eos> I don't know why he said that.<eos> I wasn't planning on stopping.<eos> Mr. West here said all he wanted was to find his twin sister, to see her one more time.<eos> But these bags were sealed shut when we found them, and the killer unearthed both bodies, which makes me think that the person who dug them up was looking more for the scene of a double murder than a sister...<eos> Like you were, Detective.<eos> The only evidence you have against me is... my devotion to this case.<eos> You said yourself that Mr. Greeson must've gone willingly with his captor.<eos> I imagine he wouldn't have argued with a badge, even if yours is retired.<eos> And it had to be someone who knew that he had a weapon and where he kept it.
You mean Randall.<eos> No, I mean Ray.<eos> I had his wallet, Tanya. I know his name.<eos> Lenore, Ray's dance card is very full.<eos> Okay, well, why don't you just send me over one of your other guys.<eos> You don't have any other guys, do you, T-Brain?<eos> No, you just have the one.<eos> Lenore, I'm in the process of building a stable of qualified professionals.<eos> Don't bullshit a bullshitter. You're smart.<eos> You do one thing and you do it well.
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, that he should weep for her?<eos> What would he do, had he the motive and the cue for passion that I have?<eos> He would drown the stage in tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech, make mad the guilty and appal the free,<eos> confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears.<eos> Yet I, a dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak, like John a'dreams, unpregnant of my cause, and can say nothing.<eos> No, not for a king, upon whose property and most dear life a damn'd defeat was made.<eos> Am I a coward?<eos> Who calls me villain?<eos> Breaks my pate across?<eos> Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
These fragments are so precious that I'm not even allowed to touch them.<eos> They are what remains of one of the oldest pots in China.<eos> In fact, one of the oldest pots in the world.<eos> So, who made this pot?<eos> Well, the people living in this cave so many thousands of years ago would have been nomadic hunter-gatherers, still living an ancient lifestyle in many ways.<eos> But those insignificant-looking crude pieces of pot mark a great technological leap forward.<eos> ROBERTS: So prehistoric pottery's has also been found in this cave?<eos> ROBERTS: Pots are something we take for granted.<eos> But for those ancient hunter-gatherers, pottery was a part of a completely new way of life.<eos> So how did they do it?
It can wreak havoc with a growing skeleton, causing bones to grow bent and misshapen.<eos> These are all skeletons of patients with rickets, and you can see how it's affected the bones.<eos> These leg bones here are all curved, making walking difficult.<eos> And the chest is deformed, so breathing would be problematic as well.<eos> And not only that, rickets can affect your chance of having children.<eos> This is the pelvis of a woman who had rickets.<eos> And you can see the way that the pelvic bones have collapsed together.<eos> You just could not get a baby's head through this space.<eos> It would've been impossible for her to give birth naturally.<eos> So vitamin D is vital and we make it in our skin in the presence of sunlight.
Pull the trigger.<eos> Take the pain away.<eos> Maybe you're still here for redemption.<eos> I sat there in the dark, alone, broken.<eos> On the eve of my son's first game in the NBA I sat alone on a playground basketball court and waited for death.<eos> I had been given only days to live.<eos> That was 14 months ago.<eos> Listen, because we have a history of helping each other and because I'm the best damn sports agent that you deal with.<eos> Now, you guys turned it around last season in a very big way but Pennington needs receivers.<eos> Hackett's big, he's fast and you throw that ball anywhere near him, he gets up and gets it.
You're talking about my baby!<eos> I would never do anything to hurt her!<eos> Okay?<eos> How ya doin' in there? !<eos> Well, this is a very confusing shower.<eos> Actually, it's pretty standard.<eos> And the right handle is...<eos> Cold.<eos> Cold, Dolores.<eos> You can tell that because if you turn it to the right, it gets colder.
- You're very welcome.<eos> - I was being facetious.<eos> You wimped out.<eos> If you believe the short-sided pundits on CNN, - but I take a longer view of history.<eos> - That doesn't even make any sense.<eos> The coroner's report said McBain's been dead for five days. Yet the vandalism hasn't stopped since then. Therefore, we can effectively eliminate McBain.<eos> I'm now sensing that someone else wants that land.<eos> McBain's got the kind of money that's tough to beat.<eos> As a result, he or she...<eos> Or even a he-she. ... had to kill McBain before he got it.
- Navid, good to meet you, man.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> We went to summer camp together.<eos> I've known him since I was, what?<eos> - Eight.<eos> - Eight?<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Right.<eos> What's in the bag?<eos> no, my mom-- she was here the other day, and, uh, she forgot some stuff, so I'm gna go stash it in the car.
All you can do is live it.<eos> And you can't live it with my wife and my daughters and my baby.<eos> You wanna bet?<eos> [Theme music]<eos> Are you finished yet?<eos> Nope. Are you finished with your homework yet?<eos> I've been finished.<eos> Dad, just take a break and go and see the house.<eos> Hurry, you have to hurry.<eos> It'll be gone if George ever puts it on the market.
She's never gonna go near that guy again.<eos> - Are you interested in the house?<eos> - Yeah, I guess so.<eos> We haven't found anything in the school district.<eos> But I'd like to see it before I buy it.<eos> - Great. When do you wanna see it?<eos> - When can I see it?<eos> - Whenever you want.<eos> - I got a little time this morning, - but Cindy won't be back till tonight.<eos> - Take a look at it first, and if you hate it, tell her I'm not selling.
I didn't pay you anything for your input on the house that we renovated together.<eos> You didn't get anything for all your hard work, so take the car. Please, take the car.<eos> Goodbye, Anne.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> Good luck with the baby.<eos> Bye, David.<eos> - Hey, how'd it go?<eos> - It went really well.<eos> After the baby comes, Anne's gonna call me and go back to work with me.<eos> I decided to give her the new car. She decides if she wants Amy to drive it.
Dad, just take a break and go and see the house.<eos> It'll be gone if george ever really puts it on the market.
Lilith is trying to break the 66 seals to free Lucifer from hell.<eos> Lucifer will bring the Apocalypse.<eos> - You're possessing some poor bastard?<eos> - This is a vessel.<eos> I had to give my consent to invite him in.<eos> Chuck Shurley?<eos> We have a life.<eos> You've been using it to write books.
- I've got it.<eos> - I have the notes.<eos> I'm fine, really.<eos> Brought you a piece of my sour cream coffee cake before it disappears.<eos> Oh, thanks, Madge.<eos> I-I'm trying to watch it right now.<eos> With your figure?<eos> Come on.<eos> One piece won't kill you.<eos> I'll take it if she doesn't want it.
- I am so on it.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> This man is dangerous. He's some sort of superhuman cyborg. I don't want you to get hurt.<eos> You really do care about me, don't you?<eos> - Lois.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay. I'll just keep my eyes open.<eos> I swear. But if I do see anything, it's not like I can call you from the bullpen.<eos> Then I'll call you at our phone booth.<eos> You think of it as our phone booth too?
You know, I've been divorced seven times.<eos> Sometimes, I think I'm doing something wrong.<eos> You keep getting married.<eos> I never looked at it that way.<eos> Shouldn't you guys be studying?<eos> Yeah, things got kind of boring after you left.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> People becloud me for wearing this jacket ever since I got here, but If I take it off to make them happy, That just makes me weak, right?<eos> Listen, it doesn't matter.<eos> You lose the jacket to please them, you keep it to piss them off, Either way It's for them.
- Hi.<eos> Wait, sorry, what's the situation?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> How does this work?<eos> Derek is gay, but he's straight for me, but he's gay for Ben, and Ben's really gay for Derek.<eos> And I hate Ben.<eos> It's not that complicated.<eos> No. Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure. The thing about youth culture is, I don't understand it.
Oh, yes, it is.<eos> Oh, dear. Yes, I'm sorry.The Stig has gone all Scottish.<eos> He loves to Strip The Willow with all those other Stigs that the Daily Mail's invented.<eos> Just a very big mess in Chicago.So Hammerhead...<eos> Lord alone knowswhat's going to happen here.<eos> Under-steer...over-steer... Under-steer then over-steer again.<eos> Every sort of steer,and all happening practically at the same time.<eos> Is that bagpipes or is it the sound of someone deflating a cat?<eos> Through the tyres -very, very fast.<eos> Now he comes in to the second-to-last corner, holding it nicely.
And contrary to popular belief... I don't know them all.<eos> All right, this was taken off of an l.a. River surveillance camera last night.<eos> And we think this is the newest guy to join franzine.<eos> I don't know him.<eos> Why you guys looking at franzine?<eos> Part of a broader investigation. - oh.<eos> - It's a national security issue.<eos> Is it ever not with you guys?<eos> It won't be if brenner dies.<eos> Murder of a federal agent is the death penalty, and I will tear this city apart to make sure that franzine and his crew get it.
Dean - - He always gets in.<eos> We don't know what the job is.<eos> Whatever it is, I can tell you it's not gonna be small, carter -- not with franzine.<eos> Million-dollar question... is it enough for dean to flip?<eos> Last time he and I went under together - - City of industry.<eos> Something you forgot to tell me, ty?<eos> Night before the bust, franks calls us in.<eos> He's high, he's drunk, he's paranoid...<eos> Asking us who we are, where we come from.<eos> Dean pulls out his own gun, he chambers a round, he hands it to franks, he tells him if he thinks we're cops, he should shoot us.
- No, I'm serious, claudia joy.<eos> - If you don't, I may have to kill her.<eos> - Kill who?<eos> - Roxy.<eos> Who do you think?<eos> - Why?<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's going on?<eos> I swear, she is aiming for the bunkers.<eos> If there's water within 10 miles, she'll find it.
Well, you woke up the morning after your wedding and found yourself married to a mad woman.<eos> I've been just totally obsessed with finding Julie's attacker.<eos> And... I said "for better or worse."<eos> So, we start with the worse.<eos> Wow, I'm glad this night's over.<eos> I'm exhausted. Yeah, me, too.<eos> - You coming to bed?<eos> - I'll be up in a sec.<eos> On this street, the day begins with a cup of coffee.<eos> Some drink it while recalling a lover they once cared for.

He wanted me to decide.<eos> I am decided.<eos> Are you six?<eos> if i was two times six, you'd know it by now.<eos> What have i done?<eos> Yes, sit with me, hmm?<eos> the world is not a pretty thing<eos> When you look at it too close.<eos> We fell in love with atrocity.<eos> We make pornography and call it news.
I went over to throw him out personally, and no one was there.<eos> Well, I... I called the girl he used to live with.<eos> She says that he moved everything out to a storage unit in the valley.<eos> So, they all knew about the storage unit.<eos> Screwed me out of all my money.<eos> - Another girl... in our bed.<eos> - Nobody cheats on me.<eos> - Not with my daughter.<eos> Everybody wanted to kill him, feed him to the sharks.<eos> So, Sergeant Gabriel, if you were taking the lead on this investigation, how would you sum it up so far?
- We're ready, Chief!<eos> - Thank you, Lieutenant, gentleman.<eos> Explain, please?<eos> Each cooler contains a GPS system and a camera.<eos> We're sending one cooler to each of our suspects,<eos> Mr. Courtney's parents, his ex-girlfriend, his ex-landlord and his former best friend.<eos> Whoever opens the cooler...<eos> - Which we can monitor from here. - is innocent.<eos> Right, because why would you open the box if you knew it contained a dead body?<eos> So, whoever doesn't open it is probably guilty.
No one heard anything.<eos> Until James punched through these really thin walls right here into the next office.<eos> Your husband never called for help.<eos> No, we think that most of the mess that was created here happened after the murder.<eos> Russell Clark entered the office you shared with your husband.<eos> He saw his son standing over the body, so he started to look for the implement he believed James used to choke your husband to death.<eos> That's why the office is like this.<eos> But the weapon wasn't here.<eos> Where did it go, then?<eos> Well, I'm... I'm guessing that you must have taken it with you.
Damn.<eos> That's the last one.<eos> He's not here.<eos> There's another facility in North Carolina.<eos> I have another idea.<eos> Olivia Dunham is starting to remember her time on the other side.<eos> I'm thinking she may know where it's hidden.<eos> His head? Yeah.<eos> What makes you think that?<eos> If Bell knows that we're looking for it, it seemed like a likely reason why he'd bring her over to the other side.
She said she felt better.<eos> She felt better.<eos> The baby was downstairs dead and she felt better?<eos> By this, presumably, you mean she felt relieved and glad?<eos> I mean she...<eos> Sanguine and very calm...<eos> May the witness not be the subject of ventriloquism.I put no words into the mouth of the witness.<eos> You lead her like a farmer brings a cow to market!<eos> He speaks of his former calling.<eos> The cow very sickly, the farmer selling it hasty.Mr Garrow!
You will soon.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Sara.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, if you're watching this, I'm glad. Because that means you're safe.<eos> And that's all I ever wanted.<eos> I wish I could... be there with you.<eos> But as you probably know now, I wouldn't have much time anyway, so--<eos> I've made my choice, and-- I don't regret it.
- No, of course it is.<eos> She's daddy's little girl, following in your footsteps.<eos> Why are you doing this, anyway?<eos> - What do you want from me, anyway?<eos> - Hey.<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I just want your signature.<eos> I need you to sign an affidavit so I can exhume her remains.<eos> Well, you're not gonna get it, Aaron.
Cos when I said Brian Johnson's coming on the show to friends, they went, "The cricket bloke?<eos> He's dead." That's Brian Johns-TON.<eos> We enjoy keeping quiet.<eos> Black Hawk Down, obviously we've seen the film, but it was used as well, AC/DC.<eos> Is this right?<eos> Mike, the helicopter pilot that went down.<eos> He'd been shot and he'd been beaten and they put him in a cell, and he thought he was finished.<eos> They kept coming and beating him.<eos> His pals knew that AC/DC were his favourite band, so they hooked a big speaker on the skid of a helicopter and they played Back In Black and Hells Bells and they flew over the city and he dragged himself up<eos> and took his shirt off and waved it out the window so they knew where he was and they went down and got him.
That is a fantastic story.<eos> We could rap about AC/DC for some considerable time, but you're here because you are a massive, massive car fan.<eos> Is that not...?<eos> Since I was a kid.<eos> Me father knew there was something wrong with us when I'd be walking down the street going, "Javelin, Dad."<eos> It drove him nuts so he went to the scrap yard and got a steering wheel and he stuck a stick through it and put it through me bed head and put some pillows on it and said, "There you go."<eos> What, so that's a car?<eos> That was me car.<eos> It was brilliant.<eos> Although there was wallpaper up there, I couldn't see it.
That's gonna cost them.<eos> Go around!<eos> Now, I'm gonna push it up to 25 miles an hour. That's what we're allowed to do here.<eos> You've got to really pay attention.<eos> Fifteen minutes of news and nothing about the Holy Father.<eos> He's still dead, Ma.<eos> - The shower cap hold up? - Yes.<eos> Piece of junk.<eos> If you want, I'll have Gerry come over and fix your shower.<eos> It was fixed, but I think Ronnie the super sneaks in and breaks it.
What time isn't it?<eos> - Admiral is happy.<eos> We're happy.<eos> - They're not happy!<eos> "Morris, comma, in reference to retooling the factory "for London Fog children's and young adults... "<eos> I thought I'd bring you the minutes to the meeting, since you had to run off.<eos> You're wasting paper.<eos> I'd have to make 1,000 to keep up with your department.<eos> They waste paper because they throw out bad ideas.<eos> They waste paper because they use it to sop up spilled drinks, right after their mid-afternoon naps.
He's coming, right?<eos> I'm his representative.<eos> It's as if he's here himself.<eos> Yeah, except he's not.<eos> But it's not a problem.<eos> I mean, I'm - - I'm sure kang has told you how we help people clean up their finances, off-shore bank accounts, shell corporations.<eos> Is that all you do -- Help people wash money?<eos> Yeah, you could say that.<eos> We're sort of specialists.<eos> We do one thing. We do it well.
No.<eos> Why?<eos> The voltage is too low and the amps...<eos> So it turns out it's fine to throw a gee-whizz into a canal. Can't advise that.<eos> Yeah, it's OK.<eos> I'm not convinced by that, though, because I think electricity is a mystery.<eos> It is.<eos> I don't actually believe in it.<eos> You don't believe in electricity?<eos> No, nobody really understands it.
- I changed my mind.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Open the safe, Tommy.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> Open the fucking safe.<eos> Come on, Danny.<eos> Thought ...<eos> we were friends.<eos> Wrong.<eos> Open the safe, otherwise first I'll shoot you and then I open it myself.
Yeah, but it's an investment.<eos> You didn't sign anything, did you?<eos> Yeah, and I got it for a steal.<eos> - Take me home.<eos> - I can't.<eos> What do you mean, you can't?<eos> I let go of our lease.<eos> No.<eos> Call them.<eos> Tell them we want it back.
Could it be a small body of water?<eos> Sure, as long as it's saltwater.<eos> Dr Cosway's fish tank.<eos> Check out Nemo.<eos> Clown fish need saltwater to live.<eos> Okay, but how did this get on both of our vics?<eos> Wouldn't they have had to stick their hands in there or something?<eos> You see that salt encrustation along the top?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The pump just kicks it into the air.
They may have inadvertently witnessed something or been privy to some information that someone very powerful wanted to keep under wraps.<eos> There are any number of possibilities.<eos> We just want— –Grovner.<eos> What was that?<eos> Uh, this name—Grovner. It—it kinda rings a bell.<eos> Do you remember about five years back, some kid's dad shoved him for some reason?<eos> Y-yeah. School security got involved.<eos> I think his name was Grovner.<eos> We'll get a warrant for his patient file.<eos> If there's a connection, we'll find it.
Then help me out here, all right?<eos> You're the romantic.<eos> I mean, what's the deal with the bottle?<eos> It's an '82 Bordeaux. Yeah.<eos> Costs 800 bucks a pop.<eos> It does when it's full.<eos> I got it empty.<eos> Empty?<eos> Look, when Kate and I met, we had nothing.<eos> I got that bottle, and I used to fill it up with whatever cheap wine we could afford.
It was important for them to actually have a sense of where heaven was, where the gods actually resided.<eos> It is from his home base on Mount Olympus that Zeus engineers his rebellion against Kronos and the Titans.<eos> Zeus is gonna have to get others to come in and help him out so that he can achieve supreme power.<eos> This is the ultimate family feud.<eos> And so it is to his own flesh and blood that Zeus turns first.<eos> He knows his strongest allies will be his five siblings, the Olympians, now fully-formed adults. But still trapped deep inside Kronos' stomach.<eos> If they can be liberated, the Olympians could tip the scales in Zeus' favor, and help him destroy the Titans forever.<eos> He wanted to free his brothers and sisters so he concocted a potion.<eos> Quietly, Zeus enters Kronos' lair and slips the drug into his nightly cup of mead.<eos> Kronos drinks it and becomes violently ill.
It's got to be a gravity anomaly.<eos> Well, or a Fargo anomaly.<eos> What button did you push this time?<eos> Can you not recognizea victim when you see one?<eos> Well, you know, he's right. There's nothing in this lab that could cause that.<eos> Maybe he brought it in with him from the lab that recently exploded.<eos> The collider has nothing to do with gravity.<eos> Well, how about dark energy?<eos> You said you don't know what that does yet.<eos> Well, I know that you can't track it around - on your shoes.
Carter, that pager has an encrypted signal that could reach you in a cave in China if I go into labor, but only if you don't lose it.<eos> Well, I'll pick it up right after the birthing class.<eos> How's that?<eos> Ah, see? That was the message.<eos> Class has been canceled.<eos> They do a sonic cleaning of Global Dynamics once a year.<eos> The entire facility is shut down for the long weekend.<eos> But it's graduation day.<eos> I've been practicing my breathing.<eos> Well, you'll get to use it soon enough.
I'm saying you gotta handle it different.<eos> Educate me, my man.<eos> You're playing the game with every disadvantage.<eos> They outman you !<eos> They outgun you !<eos> You got one weapon.<eos> You hear ? One !<eos> Your mind.<eos> It's like what you said about the... the window to Ray-Ray.<eos> You can't force it open.
Didn't really, uh, peg you as a picnic basket guy.<eos> Yeah, my parents are Hollywood Bowl fanatics, and they never go without a full spread.<eos> Well, it's nice that you learned from them.<eos> Oh, no, I just took their basket.<eos> You stole their food?<eos> They were seeing Barry Manilow tonight.<eos> Anybody lame enough to see Barry Manilow deserves what they get, right?<eos> You're awful.<eos> I'm such an idiot.<eos> I had a perfect life, and I completely sabotaged it.
I think we're done<eos> These flower boxes are really coming along.<eos> If you have a moment-- no rush-- Would you hang this birdhouse for me?<eos> I was thinking on that big tree.<eos> You got it.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> Roy?<eos> Over there.<eos> That tree.<eos> Yeah, I was talking to Tom about it this morning, And, uh, he wants it over here.
Great work, Lassie.<eos> Did you just throw our cordless phone into a tree?<eos> A man's life was hanging in the balance. It was clearly our only move.<eos> You're buying us a new phone, Shawn.<eos> Your mind is not an opponent, Shawn.<eos> It's a teammate.<eos> {\pos(192,230)}A teammate that's there for you in good times and bad.<eos> {\pos(192,230)}You may not always get along... It may be moody... {\pos(192,230)}Wear your shower sandals without permission.<eos> {\pos(192,230)}But never doubt its loyalty.<eos> {\pos(192,230)}So when I roll this ball to you, I want you to scoop it up and deliver a perfect strike,
The music, the violin.<eos> I don't hear anything.<eos> it sounds like it's coming from the plateau.<eos> the plateau?<eos> there's nothing on the plateau but rocks and mud.<eos> i know.<eos> maybe the villagers are doing some kind of anti-rain dance or something.<eos> right.<eos> the music wasn't random.<eos> in fact i knew it well, it was a song from my childhood.
And Hades draws the short straw, he is left with the land of the dead.<eos> This was not something he chose for himself.<eos> It was fated him, he did it, but it bent him in some ways.<eos> It made him not a happy god.<eos> It is a tragic turning point for Hades.<eos> He could have ruled the universe, instead he is condemned to the realm of the dead.<eos> In ancient Greece, the attitude towards death was not so different to our feelings today towards death, so people would not worship Hades as much as they did Poseidon and Zeus.<eos> Other gods do not come to see him because death is hateful to the gods.<eos> Hades' new home is dark, bleak, and filled with the sadness of dead souls.<eos> Ancient texts describe it as a dank expanse of caves and rivers.
Meanwhile, my poor brain spins around, then freezes.<eos> No matter how hard I try, I can't make sense of it!<eos> Stupid, vile creature, who do you think you are?<eos> She doesn't belong among noble people like us.<eos> Brazen servant, don't dare mingle with the high and mighty.<eos> Go to the kitchen, worthless wretch, and don't come back.<eos> How dare you insult the woman I adore!<eos> My fury will strike you like a thunderbolt!<eos> I knew this comedy would change in the second act.<eos> Now the tragedy begins, and I'm loving it!
There is a place at the edge of New England-- An everyday sort of town.<eos> But if you look beneath the humdrum surface, what you'll find here is something quite surprising.<eos> Because once upon a time, the women who lived in our town were said to have certain... special gifts.<eos> That is, before they were burned alive by those nice pilgrims.<eos> Of course, nowadays we know better than to believe in witchcraft.<eos> We call it silly superstition and lies.
We have to be able to remove the tumor and with these adhesions, you can't.<eos> Ball-tipped electrosurgery helps get around the adhesions.<eos> His cancer's incurable. I'm not gonna put him through another painful surgery. - His survival rate's 13 percent.<eos> - I had five.<eos> - Stevens...<eos> - I had a five percent chance of survival.<eos> I have incurable cancer, but I am living with it. The reason I am, the reason I'm standing here is because no one ever said, "We've done everything".<eos> I'm alive right now because people fought for me.<eos> Cristina fought for me.<eos> He deserves the chance to fight. If he doesn't want it, I will shut up.
If I talked to my parents like that...<eos> My father would've...<eos> You don't even want to know.<eos> I had perfect grades.<eos> Perfect record.<eos> I said whatever I wanted, did whatever I wanted.<eos> Parents couldn't do a thing about it.<eos> Wanna hear about my childhood?<eos> No?<eos> OK. I'll just... think about it quietly in my own head.
I will draw the energy from you.<eos> What happened?<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> They've gone to the beach to find Eve's ship.<eos> Come on!<eos> Eve needs you.<eos> I've got to go.<eos> Help yourselves to anything.<eos> The ship was boosting Eve's energy.<eos> And now it's taking it back.
Get him off!<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> - Get him off! Get him!<eos> - Get him off of him!<eos> - He bit me.<eos> - Look!<eos> He is a vampire!<eos> He's not a vampire.<eos> But his skin burned when the light hit him.<eos> He has porphyria, some people call it "the vampire disease."
I know everything he knows.<eos> How bad could it be, then?<eos> I swear... he goes home with someone every year.<eos> One year, it was the divorced woman, Jodi Wilson, and last year, it was Mrs. Blye, the social-studies teacher.<eos> Am I right, Meliss?<eos> Oh, girl, I can't keep them straight.<eos> Was it Blye, honey?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> Isn't he a bit too old for the Peter Pan routine?<eos> I know the type. If he keeps it up, he's gonna end up alone.
I gathered that much.<eos> This stuff is classified, Lenny - I didn't have to tell you any of it.<eos> Apparently he was tasked to the MI6 in Afghanistan to help co-ordinate local opposition to the Taliban.<eos> God knows who was running him but they had no idea how cosy he'd got with the poppy growers.<eos> Three months ago, he deserted and turned to trafficking.<eos> And your solution was to tell me some sob story about British soldiers not getting justice? And your solution was to tell me some sob story about British soldiers not getting justice?<eos> All that is true.<eos> Look, unless someone does deal with him, more soldiers are going to get killed on his fields and more of his cheap smack will flood into London.<eos> OK, I've thrown you a curve ball.<eos> But unless you send it into the stands...
That's a long time.<eos> Coach Taylor, can I ask you something?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> DEACON: Why are we here?<eos> Oh, Lord have mercy, Deacon.<eos> I'm trying to enjoy my meal here.<eos> Damn.<eos> No, that's a good question.<eos> Listen, I just started coaching at this school.<eos> I would imagine that you would think of it as your high school, too.
I don't want anything!<eos> The closest he's been to Vietnam?<eos> Ordering the Mee krob at that place on the corner.<eos> - Mee krob is from Thailand.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> What did you do?<eos> - Why do you think he's faking?<eos> - I saw his mail.<eos> - Your broke in?<eos> - No. He was holding it.
- We could intubate him... - Need five more milligrams of Diazepam.<eos> DC the monitors.<eos> - Push 500 mg Phenytoin. - We can't push that much.<eos> Gotta remove the pressure, his brain could herniate.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> 50 mg of Phenytoin.<eos> Page Chase. Tell him to meet us in the O.R.<eos> We need your consent.<eos> - What's happening to him?<eos> - Pressure in his skull's too high. If we don't reduce it, it could damage his brain.
You would cover your ass at the expense of someone's life?<eos> We know she brought up your journal.<eos> That was helpful.<eos> He'd be crazy to risk his marriage for a one-night stand with a teenager.<eos> Sensible people only risk their marriage For something more serious?<eos> I'm not having an affair.<eos> We're talking about Keener.<eos> Fine. He doesn't care about his marriage. What about his career?<eos> Statutory rape would ruin it.<eos> It's admitting statutory rape that could ruin it.
And get out the car to try to help her out, you know?<eos> And there on the door handle was a bloody hook.<eos> That story isn't scary, not when you have a bravery badge.<eos> You want to hear something really scary?<eos> Bring it, Julia.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, this is a true story about an old witch who used to live in these very woods.<eos> Her name was Drag-leg Laura.<eos> And they called her that because she had a wooden leg.<eos> And you could always hear Laura coming because she would drag it behind her in the mud.
No, I was hired to build the hospital in Piatra, and I worked there.<eos> He retired from there...<eos> -Now, you tell us a story, dear.<eos> -Yes, tell us.<eos> Take the woodbed.<eos> But without this blanket.<eos> As you wish.<eos> -Can you carry it, darling?<eos> -Of course.<eos> -You better come back for it...
Was she dating anyone?<eos> No, she was too young.<eos> But very beautiful.<eos> I knew when she grew up, I'd be in trouble.<eos> Still got that nine-millimeter you bought in 1980, Joe?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Do you have new lead on who killed my Tam?<eos> Answer the question, Mr. Sung.<eos> I have the gun, locked up at home.<eos> Mind if we take a ride with you to go get it?
That'll be all, Cedric.<eos> Sleep well, Sire.<eos> Hello, ladies.<eos> Sound the warning bell.<eos> Whoever did this got more than they bargained for.<eos> I don't understand how they got in.<eos> The gate's not even damaged.<eos> - They must have used a key.<eos> - Arthur's got the only key.<eos> Where does he keep it?
Nevertheless, you must promise, or Camelot will fall.<eos> I promise.<eos> Now, please, give me the spell.<eos> Close your eyes and open your mind.<eos> Few men have ever been gifted such knowledge.<eos> Use it wisely.<eos> I will.<eos> You made a promise, young warlock.<eos> And one day...<eos> I shall keep you to it.
You said it yourself.<eos> Ghosts are scared.<eos> Whatever this thing is, it can hurt them, and they don't have the power to stop it.<eos> Well then, who can?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I'm going to find out.<eos> Tina, whatever this thing is, it can't mean more than you being where you belong.<eos> Can you see the light?<eos> Look for the light.<eos> She can see it, she just doesn't want to go in.
- It was wrong. I know that. But I had to do it to get rid of this really bad criminal.<eos> Well, that's not very nice.<eos> So quick to label.<eos> Or at least just his mind.<eos> And now his consciousness is rattling around up in here.<eos> - Well, there's so much space.<eos> - Will you shut up?<eos> Janice, Janice.<eos> Look, I can get rid of him.<eos> The answer's out there. I just gotta go find it.
- I don't know.<eos> Amanda,what's with all the questions?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just wanted to ask because... I know some great guys I could set you up with.<eos> Thanks.<eos> But,um...<eos> I think I'm gonna ask a friend.<eos> Maybe we should just hear him O.<eos> Mom,the "wit and whimsy" column has been in "mode" for 60 years.<eos> I'm not gonna cut it just to make room for ads.
Odysseus and his men are hostages in the cave of the cyclops.<eos> Unless something changes fast they will all be eaten.<eos> But Odysseus remains focused.<eos> There's a Greek fear that surrounds the entire episode, and the men around him tend to fall apart under this fear,<eos> Odysseus never does.<eos> He realises, in a very cold, calculating, rational way, that these emotions will only get in the way, and will only get in the way of his escape and his solution to the problem.<eos> He focuses always on the problem and only on the problem.<eos> While the cyclops is out tending his sheep,<eos> Odysseus spots the massive wooden club he left behind, and gets an idea.<eos> With the help of his men he shaves the narrow end to a fine point, hardens it over a flame, and waits.
It's the equivalent of him giving Odysseus a fleet of jet planes.<eos> The winds are the motive power of ancient shipping, so this is a very great gift because the winds can bring you home.<eos> For nine days and nights, the Greeks sail straight for Ithaca aided by favourable winds.<eos> Finally Odysseus is on his way home.<eos> He stays awake the whole way working his ship round the clock.<eos> On the tenth day Ithaca appears on the horizon.<eos> But in the last mile, fatigue finally overcomes the hero.<eos> As Odysseus dozes, his crew seizes the chance to find out what's in the mysterious bag.<eos> His men immediately decide "there's gold, there's silver, there's treasures, "and Odysseus doesn't want to share it with us."<eos> They want it for themselves, so curiosity tinged with a bit of greed leads to their undoing.
Don't think we said ten words.<eos> If it is the same people that took Colin, you do this girl's family a favor.<eos> Money drops at 6:00. at 6:01, you tell them their child is dead, give 'em a chance to get used to it.<eos> It would be a kindness.<eos> - Boss, I might have something.<eos> - What?<eos> Those squatters in the house where we found Haymer?<eos> They were drug dealers.<eos> A detective in Oakland narcotics said they're an extended family... eight or ten people.<eos> They grew pot on a farm called Crazy Hill in Goodhue County, brought it into Oakland and sold it out of the house.
No prints, uses burner phones.<eos> I mean, everything about this guy says pro.<eos> Except for the fact that he shot at us in the first place.<eos> Why even give himself away?<eos> Why not wait till the rally, then take your shot?<eos> Maybe he was trying to spook him.<eos> Polk's been shot at before, beaten up by the cops. I don't think he's the kind of guy that's going to flinch.<eos> All right, see, this is why we don't talk politics.<eos> We're not talking about politics, man.<eos> We're talking about a guy who gets threatened every time he opens his mouth, then he opens it anyway.
I know nancy's got big ass tits.<eos> Jonel sweet ass.<eos> That's the only way I know who the fuck it is.<eos> That's smart, you know?<eos> I don't know what I'm gonna do.<eos> I can't just vanish into thin air. That would be terrible.<eos> I mean, imagine doing that with a walker, okay?<eos> With a handicapped woman, just not call her like that, you can't do that.<eos> I'll be a pariah.<eos> If you saw the house, would you recognize it?

Thank you.<eos> Khun Ake wants to eat inside his room.<eos> He said he will eat there from now on.<eos> Full already?<eos> Your medicine.<eos> More water?<eos> The water made me cough, didn't you see?<eos> Want to watch TV?<eos> You don't like to watch TV?<eos> I don't watch it much either.
There are 11 names here.<eos> Really?<eos> There were only ten registered.<eos> Only ten people on the bus.<eos> Once in while we get looky-loo who sneak in without paying for the tour.<eos> This last name--<eos> Thelonious Cross.<eos> Do you remember meeting him? No, I don't.<eos> Everybody use the same pen?<eos> I keep it with the book.
And it turns out, my wishes are pretty damn powerful.<eos> I can make people choke on chicken wings, too.<eos> And... and I'm not sorry. Good.<eos> How is that good?<eos> I should feel sorry, but I don't, and that's why he's haunting me, and that's why I'll never have peace for the rest of my life, because I don't deserve peace, because I'm an awful person.<eos> There's nothing awful about you.<eos> You're a mother, and you love your daughter more than anything in the world, right?<eos> Well, Mia was hurt by this boy.<eos> And no doubt, many other daughters would have met the same fate if they hadn't already.<eos> Now why should you feel sympathy for someone who doesn't deserve it?
I will take care of them.<eos> Kidnapping innocent children?<eos> Seems like a small-time crime for the likes of you.<eos> Among the children of the Jedi, there are no innocents.<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> As long as I get paid, it makes no difference to me.<eos> A jungle world, domed cities I see,<eos> Rodia it is.<eos> A house in Kay Tap square.<eos> Yes, I see it, too.
You gotta see this.<eos> - R6.<eos> - What the hell is R6?<eos> It's what they're putting in that vitamin shot.<eos> They're experimenting on people.<eos> Is that the vitamin shot?<eos> No.<eos> It's the flu vaccine. What?<eos> Human vaccine?<eos> They're not mixing their drug into the vitamin shot. They're mixing it into our flu vaccine.
Free root beers are rolling in.<eos> If you just worked hard, you could go from being the guy that works part-time at a public course to the head pro at the country club.<eos> This is my kingdom, J-Bird.<eos> - I mean, look at this plaque over here.<eos> - Oh, God, not the plaque.<eos> - Can we just once not talk about the plaque?<eos> - They put this up when I shot the course record.<eos> And we're off.<eos> Robert "Bobby" Cobb.<eos> People see this, Jules, and they respect it.
Some estimates say the energy jet from the Death Star Galaxy has been firing for nearly two million years.<eos> For its fuel, 3C321 simply devoured an entire galaxy.<eos> It's got a lot of fuel.<eos> What we actually think is happening here is that there's been a previous merger, so another galaxy has fallen into the main galaxy.<eos> We see this beautiful dust lane, which implies that the galaxy's been shredded already.<eos> And so that act of shredding drives mass down onto the black hole.<eos> After consuming another galaxy's provision of plasma particles, the Death Star Galaxy has to somehow energize the particles into a jet.<eos> Black holes have powerful magnetic fields and superfast spin rates, a combination that somehow ignites the particle jet.<eos> Scientists believe the reason the jets fire in one direction has to do with all the dust and gas circling the black hole.<eos> In the case of an active galaxy like 3C321, which has a supermassive black hole in the center, you'll often have a doughnut, or torus, of material surrounding it.
He's gettin' some on the side.<eos> Oh, come on, Robin. Barney's not the type of guy who would... Go on.<eos> Plus, he keeps saying he's working late. But when I call his office, they say he left hours ago.<eos> Well, that doesn't prove anything.<eos> Yes. Proof.<eos> Go word. I'm glad you brought that up.<eos> Barney's briefcase.<eos> He forgot it here this morning.<eos> And what do you plan on doing with it?<eos> We, we-- you and I-- are going to open it up and look for evidence.
We can talk honestly and directly.<eos> I can help you with your case, but I can't help you.<eos> I've done other things in my life. If you want I can tell you about them. But I didn't do this.<eos> Did the officer who took your mug shot...?<eos> Shores.<eos> Right, Detective Shores.<eos> Did he put you in that Bulls sweatshirt? - No.<eos> - Did anybody else?<eos> No, I came in wearing it.<eos> Didn't they want it for evidence?
I'm sorry, it's not you, it's just... Even abolish the Dandelion Club.<eos> What?<eos> No-one's called a vote since the Civil war.<eos> I don't think anyone else knows the vote exists.<eos> Would it still work?<eos> This is Trinity.<eos> Things don't change.<eos> And this tribune post, would we need to revive it?<eos> Oh, the post still exists.<eos> We just don't call it by that name any more.
Hello.<eos> You said it has never been in an accident!<eos> Liar!<eos> Please calm down.<eos> Can we go talk inside please?<eos> There's nothing to discuss!<eos> My kid almost died because of your damn car!<eos> Bitch!<eos> Take your car back!<eos> I don't want it anymore!
They don't wear shoes, because they have very thick soles on the bottom of their feet and lots of fur on the top of their feet.<eos> They're sort of homebodies. They don't ever really go in for adventures.<eos> The slow pace of life in the Shire mirrors author JRR Tolkien's own childhood in the countryside of Western England.<eos> In some ways, Tolkien must have put himself into the hobbits.<eos> Many of his ideals are embodied in the hobbits, a sort of embracing the rural ideal, embracing the simple pastoral life, common good old-fashioned virtues in the face of grandeur and pretension.<eos> A hobbit is the last creature one might expect to save the world from evil, but Frodo Baggins is different.<eos> Frodo is not a typical hobbit, because he's learned.<eos> He's interested in elves and dwarves and outsiders, and he knows a little bit about the world, and he cares about the outside world enough to sacrifice everything he actually loves.<eos> If you go back to these original myths, you're looking at the heroes themselves, the warriors, if you will.<eos> Tolkien then takes this story, and he tells it from the point of view of a not likely hero, the reluctant warrior, and that, I think, is rather unique.
Here's the thing, Sophie.<eos> We both know you don't care about that jersey, so why don't you give it to me?<eos> And there's no hard feelings.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Look, you don't intimidate me.<eos> I was a cheerleader once. I had spirit, yes, I did.<eos> And now I'm just a cranky, tired mom<eos> - with nothing to lose.<eos> - I already gave it back to Axl.<eos> He said he wanted to give it to someone else.
Still, we can raise a toast.<eos> This, I am happy to announce, is a Pinot Grigio, available at the very reasonable price of £6.99 a bottle.<eos> Ross Bonham.<eos> Ross Bonham!<eos> A case of our finest, please.<eos> Why did you pay off Timothy Bonham?<eos> For the good of the college.<eos> We don't want nasty stories in the press.<eos> I had the situation under control.<eos> The press could have made a stink - we would have handled it.
Now, Matt would like to share some words of remembrance with us.<eos> I'm just going to tell you one story I remember, and that'll be it.<eos> We were at the supermarket.<eos> It was me, my mom, Grandma,<eos> and my dad.<eos> All four of us, our whole family.<eos> My dad was pushing the cart, and he stopped and grabbed some toilet paper and put it in the cart, and my grandma said,<eos> "No, that's not the right one.<eos> "That's not the right toilet paper that we use. "<eos> And she grabbed the right toilet paper and put it in the cart and stormed off.

Um, well, you know, the family is gonna be together for Thanksgiving for the first time in, I don't even know how long, so--<eos> I am so with you-- we should blow this out and throw Luke the best birthday party of all time.<eos> Yes, yes, and we'll order a whole bunch of pizzas, and-- and-- and set up an arts-and-crafts table.<eos> - A what?<eos> - Yeah, a crafts table.<eos> You know, everybody gathers around, and they make stuff, and, then, bam, they got their own party favor.<eos> Sorry, I fell asleep while you were describing the most boring party ever.<eos> See you in a few hours. Yeah.<eos> Thanks again for the karaoke machine.<eos> I'll get it back to you right after the party.
- That's what you paid Alex.<eos> - She's an award-winning actress.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Now she's one of two faces of Clothes over Bros.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> You fired her.<eos> That leaves me.<eos> Millie... you hear the words coming out of your mouth?<eos> The campaign's a hit for us, Brooke.<eos> The press loves it.
Have you ever done coke before this?<eos> Then trust me... it's time to stop.<eos> I will.<eos> And you can?<eos> Of course I can.<eos> I just wanted to try it, but I don't need to do it.<eos> That's right.<eos> You don't.<eos> You can roll with me, and we'll have a blast.<eos> But I can't be around cocaine, and I can't have friends that are doing it.
Hey, what happened to those cute girls?<eos> They left.<eos> Oh, too bad.<eos> I think the one liked you.<eos> They were looking over here a lot.<eos> I know.<eos> Next time, take a little initiative.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're not always going to be here to support you.<eos> So, you peek over your right shoulder and slide it into the spot.
Yeah, I got it.<eos> I called Sammy and guess what?<eos> The stupid goombah came through.<eos> No!<eos> He did?<eos> For you, a big meeting with a fancy designer today at 4:00.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Today?<eos> This is amazing!<eos> Hilda, if I can get this story, I can get it in this issue! Ah!
This is the hot designer bag of the moment.<eos> Every woman wants one, including me, but... we just don't make that kind of money.<eos> What's your secret, Shea?<eos> It was a gift.<eos> From Ronny?<eos> Your boyfriend makes less than you do. WILLOWS:<eos> Oh, but you know, it could be from his side biz.<eos> Except... this bag has been slashed with a razor, and totally ruined.<eos> No woman I know would do this to this bag.<eos> And if a guy is splurging on something like this, he's not going to destroy it.
Objection.<eos> This is not a court of law.<eos> Sustained.<eos> Frank, move to strike. They stole my idea.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> Whoa.<eos> How did you get that much propulsion on the gun?<eos> I made tequila bullets, but I guess I put too much gunpowder in.<eos> New deal.<eos> We are taking that propulsion and putting it in our shotgun.
They keep this guy chained in a box 600 feet under.<eos> Last time they hauled him up, Noah was building a boat.<eos> That's why the place is crawling with reapers.<eos> They're waiting on the big boss to show.<eos> You have any other good news?<eos> Well, in a manner of speaking.<eos> I've been researching Carthage since you've been gone, Trying to suss out what the devil might want there.<eos> What you just said drops the last piece of the puzzle in place.<eos> The angel of death must be brought into this world at midnight through a place of awful carnage.<eos> Now, back during the civil war, there was a battle in Carthage... a battle so intense, the soldiers called it "The battle of hell-hole." Where'd the massacre go down?
Sure. Let's go with that.<eos> - Thanks, Mom.<eos> - Mm-hmm. Hey.<eos> Oh. Is that the new picture?<eos> - Well?<eos> - Not good.<eos> Now, now. Let me be the--<eos> Yeah. No, that is not good.<eos> What even is that face?<eos> I had a blister in my mouth, and I was feeling it with my tongue.
Execution style, yeah.<eos> Pow, pow! So I'm trying to find corresponding slugs for all the spent .45 casings.<eos> I would say that it ended here, but it may not be where it started.<eos> Another bullet grazed the port side.<eos> It's smaller caliber than the others.<eos> .22.<eos> Could be.<eos> .22s deteriorate significantly on impact, so there's no slug and it's below the waterline.<eos> Boat wasn't in the water during the shoot-out.<eos> Maybe, or maybe somebody was using it for target practice.
If I were in his shoes, I'd probably get high, too. He doesn't want to get high.<eos> He wants to avoid the pain of withdrawal. If he doesn't make it through rehab, he'll just go back to heroin and keep using it until it kills him.<eos> So methadone's his only option?<eos> There is one other option, lbogaine hydrochloride.<eos> It's been remarkably successful in treating opiate addiction.<eos> Within 24 hours, he'd lose his craving for heroin without any withdrawals.<eos> So what's the catch?<eos> Crazy side effects?<eos> The risks are minimal. Fewer die from lbogaine than methadone.<eos> Clinics around the world use it to treat heroin addiction.
Your head thinks you've got potential.<eos> Mum talks a lot about that.<eos> It doesn't get you nothing.<eos> I haven't finished with you.<eos> DI Flynn.<eos> Don't let her out of your sight, I'll be back.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - They've lost the key.<eos> - What d'you mean, they've lost the key?<eos> - I mean they can't find it.
Walter, have you had any theories on how this man is suddenly sane?<eos> No.<eos> Not yet, but I'm eager to.<eos> A remedy for insanity, as you can imagine, I have thought long and hard about it.<eos> There they are.<eos> Huh. You see that lock?<eos> Can you zoom in right there?<eos> That's a lypticro-crypto.<eos> Top of the line.<eos> And these guys took it down like it's a bicycle lock.
She look so... Glum.<eos> She looks like I feel when I visit Sheffield.<eos> Well I don't think The Guardian liked us going on the record with Mail.<eos> I did and spin it<eos> - I got them to take "frowny" out<eos> No you didn't - frowny's the second adjective.<eos> Well - I did do something.<eos> "Nicola Murray looking glum, frowny and tired was overheard - moaning about ... "<eos> - Glenn, mate... what would you do if you found that a dongle that everyone had thought was lost was right at the bottom of your second best bag?<eos> I don't think, we'd want it back.
Thanks for breaking into the mainframe for me.<eos> Double irony.<eos> I'll need 50,000 for travel expenses.<eos> Fifty thousand?<eos> From your account.<eos> That's too much.<eos> It's all last-minute bookings for two.<eos> Wha...?<eos> Because when I hand the notorious Duchess to the KGB I won't just get a promotion, I'll get my own dacha.<eos> Too bad you'll never see it. What the...?
Move the truck!<eos> Police emergency!<eos> Damn! Come on, come on!<eos> Guess we got a siren.<eos> Keep digging.<eos> Sir, I'm not gonna tell you again.<eos> I want you to put the weapon down.<eos> We're not done yet.<eos> I'm gonna bring up a sore subject here.<eos> I don't want you to overreact, but Trudy and I used to talk about capital punishment all the time, and she never believed in it.
Then I ended up at the remains of old Fell's Church before I woke up back in the woods.<eos> And you always see your ancestor Emily?<eos> Do you believe in ghosts?<eos> - Two weeks ago, I'd say no, but now...<eos> - I think I'm being haunted.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why Emily?<eos> Grams said she was a powerful witch in the Civil War days. This medallion was hers. It's a witch's talisman.<eos> It all started when you got the necklace?<eos> I think she's using it to communicate with me.
No can do-sie.<eos> Just got my cholesterol results and i'm rocking three bills.<eos> Still cooking everything in that travel fryer?<eos> G-a-c.<eos> That not healthy.<eos> All ght, listen, don't tell jules, alright?<eos> She'll get all worried and caretake-y.<eos> That info is locked up.<eos> All right?<eos> now hide that key where i'll never find it.
this is her purse.<eos> She's not gonna leave without her purse.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Locate, justify, hide, ellie.<eos> Locate--i got it.<eos> Justify--i gotta do it.<eos> Hide--i'm on it.<eos> Why do we have to hide the bag outside?<eos> Because travis has found every present I ever hid from him except for the ones Buried in this backyard.<eos> Now we gotta grab a shovel and remember where we put it.
Not dylan?<eos> you caused all that damage?<eos> It was me. I had no idea. And you were acting so strangely.<eos> And then you started asking these questions,<eos> I thought you did something.<eos> I did, dad.<eos> But it was an accident.<eos> I never wanted anybody to get hurt. I just wanted to feel like i could protect you.<eos> I never asked for your protection,<eos> And i don't want it.
- Right, and this time the patterns were overwhelming, like a giant neon arrow pointing at the next job.<eos> If your numbers say it will happen here, I'm sold, Charlie.<eos> Well, that's the thing.<eos> Uh, they don't say it'll happen there.<eos> What?<eos> I pointed out to Charlie the big arrow was pointing directly away from the Charm School Boys' original target... the Federal Reserve shipments of old cash.<eos> And so, then I asked myself... what if the new robbers had studied the old robbers' tactics?<eos> Could it be at all possible that they were anticipating our methodology... choosing banks specifically to divert our attention away from the real target?<eos> Are you saying we're here on a hunch?<eos> Oh, I-I wouldn't call it a-a-a hunch.
That's all I can tell you.<eos> Did he say anything to you?<eos> Yeah, once he chilled out a little bit.<eos> Now that you are here... you're gonna stay.<eos> No, okay.<eos> Almost seemed sorry for what he did, even gave me his jacket.<eos> Told me I could keep it if I stayed down in the tunnel another couple hours.<eos> This jacket?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, hand it over. You ain't gonna take it from me, are you?
You will see that the announcements are now being done in video.<eos> Oh God.<eos> No!<eos> Lunch today is going to be pizza.<eos> Again.<eos> Friends, our school is dying and you know it.<eos> You feel it.<eos> You're like me, you wanna change it.<eos> But oh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen.<eos> This is not the school we grew up in and... and I don't know if we can get it back.
Ah. Pinup girl avoiding eye contact?<eos> Ugly don cheadle?<eos> What about you, legacy?<eos> Got anything?<eos> Well, uh, you see...<eos> No, curiously, I don't see.<eos> when dr. Cox gets like this, It feels a lot like second grade gym class.<eos> all right, you hairless babies.<eos> Show some sack and pick up a ball.<eos> Who wants it?
And the BMW, massage seat only in the front, so I win that pair.<eos> Right, BHP...<eos> OK, that's not working, so let's go back to the traditional, philistine Top Gear method.<eos> A drag race.<eos> I went in the Mercedes with Stig at the wheel.<eos> I think I'll have "Firm massage" for this.<eos> The BMW quickly took the lead.<eos> And stayed there till the end.<eos> That made Stig so angry he went home.<eos> So, the S-class. When you drive it, you realise it's got much more of a split personality than the BMW.
I could have told you that, if you've got a muscle car, you go round a corner, you're gonna hit a tree.<eos> Now you end wondering whether to rebuild that car again.<eos> True. One of the things I was facing...<eos> Whilst I was shooting the documentary,<eos> I never planned on crashing the bloody car.<eos> You know, I'd killed it basically, and then for a couple of months we thought it was... It was dead and that we couldn't in fact repair it.<eos> And I decided that if it required a reshell, that I would not rebuild the car. But does it?<eos> It doesn't.<eos> So you're gonna rebuild it again?<eos> We're gonna rebuild it again.
Eric Bana, you did it in 1... 40... 7... GASPING Five.<eos> There you go, mate!<eos> You did it!<eos> That is the fastest wet lap...<eos> Whooo! .. We've ever had.<eos> The fastest.<eos> You are 0.2 of a second faster than a chef.<eos> But you are the fastest Australian.<eos> Is there a wet track Ashes I can take back to Australia?<eos> Tell you what, we'll burn the car and put it in a little thing, you can take it back and Australia can have some ashes.
I'm running to the bar to watch the games with the guys.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why?<eos> - Where did that shirt come from?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Found it in the back.<eos> - I figured I haven't worn it in a while...
Yeah, they used, uh, electronic jammers, uh, anti-eavesdropping gear.<eos> They even took the... the cops on a four-hour chase using a dummy bus.<eos> Sound familiar?<eos> John Buckley, aka John Maynard, aka Maynard Dash.<eos> We have, uh, real estate fraud, identity theft, bank robbery, and last year, hijacking a tour bus.<eos> We had fun, didn't we?<eos> Oh, by the way, is that genius brother of yours still working with you?<eos> So, these three guys that hijacked this bus used your plan.<eos> You guys don't think I'm in on this, do you? I'm doing seven to ten here.<eos> You think some crook is gonna take my share of 16 mil and, uh, put it in a cookie jar until I get out?
The guy left with a lot of money. Hey.<eos> Clayton riggs.<eos> Why do I know that name?<eos> Because tyler and I met him at the hospital He ran the pediatric cancer ward.<eos> Why?<eos> Because riggs lied to us.<eos> Matt hudson wasn't a volunteer there, But he was helping those kids.<eos> Alex.<eos> I don't understand. How did you guys even find this place? Uh...<eos> There is a story there, T, uh, you don't want to hear it, and I don't want to tell it. Okay.
Shawn knocked down the bathroom door.<eos> And then he dragged me into the living room, mostly by my hair. And then he smashed my face into something, I don't even know what.<eos> And I couldn't see for a moment, and my face went hot. And then I saw he had my gun in his hands.<eos> And then there was yelling, and then Shawn moved away from me.<eos> Then I heard gunshots.<eos> Well, let me ask you this. How exactly did your husband gain possession of your weapon?<eos> Well, what do you mean?<eos> Your husband fired at Sergeant Dunn using your gun.<eos> How did he get it?<eos> Um... - Well, he knew where I kept it.
My son's safety is my priority right now. If you've connected me to him, it won't be long before others do as well.<eos> I have to get him out of here.<eos> Let us help you. Please.<eos> - This could be an opportunity...<eos> - To be polite, I'm not interested.<eos> Just leave us alone.<eos> We're looking for a friend.<eos> She works around here, maybe eats at this restaurant.<eos> We don't have a picture of her but we have a recording.<eos> Can you take a listen and let us know if you recognize it.
It's in your favor, man.<eos> It's in your favor if you just be quiet.<eos> Secondsubject...<eos> Dyessiscallingin the subjects now yo see if they have any arrest records, and he's also gonna run the gun to see if it's stolen.<eos> You just never know in the circumstances that when you get someone out of a car whether they're gonna have a weapon, and certainly, you have to take those precautions.<eos> That gun could have been pointed at us.<eos> You never let your guard down.<eos> That's why officer safety training is so important.<eos> Standby.<eos> Welocatedagun and ran it via NCIC, which determined it was not stolen.
All right, stand aside. I'll take it from here.<eos> Good afternoon, gentlemen, my name is Peter Griffin.<eos> I will be running the company from hence here forth.<eos> Now, I want you all to lay some business talk on me.<eos> I need ideas.<eos> What can we do to make this quarter more quarterly?<eos> Well, come on, come on.<eos> Okay, I can see I'm gonna have to get things rollin'.<eos> All right, we're gonna do an exercise called the idea ball.<eos> I'm gonna toss a ball to one of you, and whoever catches it, throw out the first idea you got, then pass the ball to the next guy, and he throws out an idea and so on.
And we can all learn much from the way Haley lived her life.<eos> Haley's death causes each of us to stop and take stock of our lives.<eos> To measure who we are and what we've become.<eos> I don't have all those answers for myself, but I know who Haley was.<eos> She was the woman who died protecting the child we brought into this world together.<eos> And I will make sure that Jack grows up knowing who his mother was and how she loved and protected him and how much I loved her.<eos> If Haley were with us today, she would ask us not to mourn her death but to celebrate her life.<eos> She would tell us She would tell us to love our families unconditionally And to hold them close, because in the end, they are all that matter.<eos> I met Haley at the tryouts of our high school's production of "The pirates of Penzance."<eos> I found our copy of the play and was looking through it the other night, and I came upon a passage that seemed appropriate for this moment.
Both their stomach contents were the same.<eos> Chicken, broccoli, pasta, salad, and red wine.<eos> He's playing out a fantasy.<eos> One he has to control.<eos> He sets the scene with flower petals and wine and then he cooks for them.<eos> Their last supper.<eos> So he cooked, and he cleaned up after himself.<eos> Why did he leave the petal trail?<eos> It's gotta mean something our guy.<eos> He's not just reliving a fantasy, he's repeating it.
If he matches pattern, she'll be a successful woman, probably brunette, early 30s to mid-40s.<eos> She'll be at home in Nashville's upper echelon.<eos> This means that he fits in.<eos> He drives the right car, he wears the right clothes, he's highly intelligent.<eos> He probably comes from a place of status.<eos> This guy's sociable, and he's endearing.<eos> You would never suspect that this man is capable of murder.<eos> But he will do whatever it takes to protect the fantasy that he's trying to relive.<eos> It's this fantasy which fuels his drive.<eos> He's recreating a romantic evening and repeating it with each of his victims.
You got the money and you immediately said, "What items?<eos> What auction?"<eos> Now the Treasury just, just basically cut that out of the bill. And, you know, what we have here is a situation where banks are, are hoarding the money that they're getting from the TARP. They're using the money to purchase other banks.<eos> And all of a sudden the Treasury sent a signal to the banks, "Forget about it.<eos> We're gonna give you the money that you want, and you do what you want with it."<eos> Unless you direct it specifically, it's not gonna happen.<eos> I don't think anyone questions, Mr. Kashkari, that you're working hard.<eos> Our question is, "Who are you working for?"<eos> Throughout its passage, President Bush and Senator Obama worked in tandem to get Congress to pass the bill without even having time to read it.<eos> Despite the fact that in major polls 98% of the American people were against the bill, the leadership in both parties were for it.
No, we're ready.<eos> We're ready.<eos> Artie Sloan.<eos> Tying his shirts in knots!<eos> I like to humiliate guys, sure.<eos> I'm no different than those guys are now, man.<eos> Yeah! You know? Like, I used to be the same way.<eos> I used to dress guys up like bananas and walk them around the quad.<eos> Or I'd take a banana and stick it up some guy's ass in front of his best friend. And I'd be like, "Hey! Banana ass!<eos> Or maybe I'd, like, uh- I'd like take the tip of my penis... and stick it in a guy's mouth for, like, just a second, you know what I mean?
But these kids these days in fraternities, it's like they don't have any respect.<eos> They don't care about anybody but themselves, you know?<eos> And I don't understand that.<eos> It's like they live in a fantasy world, where,<eos> "Oh, no. There's no consequences for my actions.<eos> "I can do whatever the hell I want! And treat people however the hell I want to treat 'em!"<eos> And I don't get that.<eos> What are you doing, Frank?<eos> What is that?<eos> Well, what I'm doing is I'm cutting the shower curtain in half waist high... so that when he's in using it, people can see his junk.
You came here to make me sign a loan for you?<eos> No, I came here to share money with you.<eos> Let me see that.<eos> 17 and a half million.<eos> How will you pay that?<eos> It's a foreign currency loan.<eos> I'm not taking part in this.<eos> The car's really comfortable.<eos> It's more a house than a car.<eos> You can take it to any garage and they'll all say the same:
Now you finally know.<eos> But now, my heart hurts too much.<eos> I still can't tell you things like 'It's fine'.<eos> Honestly, I really hate your mother.<eos> I have a request.<eos> This song...<eos> Please don't let your mother sing this song.<eos> This is my mother's song.<eos> I don't want it to be stolen again.<eos> I'll return it to you.
we tend to anthropomorphize its definition by giving it human qualities we mistakenly look past what an organism truly is in the first place.<eos> The definition of an Organism, is any living thing capable of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development, and maintenance of homeostasis as a stable whole.<eos> Our universe does all of these things.<eos> The consciousness of our universe is responsible for the form and purpose that all matter assumes<eos> The Earth's resonant frequencies are a result of its form.<eos> These frequencies are responsible for biological rhythms such as menstrual and circadian cycles as well as behavior and emotional patterns.<eos> The frequencies are then picked up by the flora and fauna which are biological instruments that respond to the wave patterns.<eos> The wave patterns resonate in the cranial structure of our head and converge in the center of our brain which is where we find the pineal gland.<eos> The pineal gland is believed in many cultures to be the spiritual third eye responsible for intuition.<eos> Descartes called it "The Seat of the Soul" where mind and body meet.
His team put lactose-intolerant cells in an environment with only lactose for food.<eos> Under a "Law" of nature, every one of this lactose-intolerant cells would have died.<eos> But surprisingly, they all survived.<eos> Every one of them understood the problem that they were facing, and replaced the defective lactase-enzyme with a functioning one to utilize lactose for food.<eos> If a cell has the ability to decide how and when to evolve because it's facing extinction then anything can.<eos> The existing beliefs are that a human body is a biochemical machine controlled by genes.<eos> And therefore, the behavior, emotion, and characters of our biology, our health, our lives are controlled by genes which we don't control.<eos> So this is what we taught people:<eos> You're a victim, genes control your life, you didn't pick them, you can't change them, the genes you end up with program what's gonna happen.<eos> My experiments on stem cells, which I started in 1967 I'd isolate one stem cell, put it in a Petri dish and then it would divide every 10 hours.
Thank you.<eos> So gentlemen the object of the game is to write the name of a famous person on your card.<eos> Real or fictitious, doesn't matter.<eos> For instance, you could write, Confucius or Doctor Fu Manchu.<eos> Eric! More pens.<eos> And they must be famous, not aunt Frida.<eos> When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table. And move it to the person on your right...<eos> Thanks.<eos> The person to your left moves his card to you.<eos> You pick up the card without looking at it lick the back and stick it on your forehead.
We were out looking for meteor samples.<eos> We'd found nothing for weeks.<eos> And then, the radar went off the charts.<eos> We hit something big.<eos> We debated what it could be.<eos> We came back to base to report what we'd found.<eos> That's when we heard the story about the lost Russian plane.<eos> Instead of filing the report, we went back out there.<eos> We blasted our way through the ice and found the plane with that goddamn box.<eos> - Aah! - Weiss tore up his leg getting into it.
No questions.<eos> I want her disappeared. Professional.<eos> - That's not what I meant.<eos> - It's what I mean that matters!<eos> She's valuable.<eos> Whitey, you just don't understand, do you?<eos> Kidnapping-- it's not right.<eos> We should stick to what we know, and I know about robbing banks. 10 million would set us up for life.<eos> Here, how's this?<eos> I get the reward, put it in a bank... you rob the bank.
Hey, what's the master escape plan?<eos> Follow me again!<eos> Quick!<eos> Give me that.<eos> Alright. Let's hit the five and dime on the way home!<eos> We need to make some fake price tags and wrap these chickens in wax-paper ...so it looks like we got them at the butcher shop!<eos> Where'd you get this chicken?<eos> I picked it up at the Five-and-Dime last night on my way back...<eos> It's got a Boggis Farms tag around its ankle.<eos> Must've escaped from there before I bought it.
I want you to meet someone.<eos> Ed, this is senator Wes Turner.<eos> - Hey. You made it.<eos> - Yeah. Barely.<eos> - More damn vampires.<eos> - Back off, Colin.<eos> They're trying to help.<eos> Being a vampire and a politician, it can be hard to make friends.<eos> Wes knows enough vampires in office that want this cure.<eos> And more importantly, will use it for the right reasons.
What have you done to me?<eos> Vampires think they own this world.<eos> That the humans have to hide from them.<eos> That ain't true.<eos> Every day, the sun comes up.<eos> And every day the vamps have to hide.<eos> Vampires can never survive.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> Elvis Presley once said:<eos> "Truth is like the sun. you can shut it out for a time
He only ever wanted... the one thing he could never have.<eos> Over the years, I have murdered many, many people.<eos> The first one I killed was that innocent little boy.<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> You see before you Nikolai's place.<eos> A millionaire built it at the turn of the century as his lasting legacy.
- Amazing things.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> - l don't know.<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> Tell me what you want me to say, literally, 'cause, frankly, at this point, I got nothing.<eos> - But you have touched several lives, Richard, through your work.<eos> It's not about your happiness but the happiness you've brought to others.<eos> - Hey, look, it's the fund-raiser for the children's hospital tomorrow night.<eos> And I was thinking of donating that bottle of wine, the '71 Château Petrus.<eos> I know we were saving it for a special occasion, but, well, it's for a good cause.
We haven't spoken in so long, I don't really even know why anymore.<eos> I need to tell you something.<eos> Yes?<eos> That sermon you preached every year at Pentecost, about the gifts of the Spirit, one was the gift of prophecy.<eos> 1 Corinthians 12.<eos> Yes, I remember it.<eos> The church should respect the prophet.<eos> I have a prophecy.<eos> It's about to be proven accurate.<eos> I need you to respect it and receive it as the truth.
But you are.<eos> I wonder if I'm a bigamist.<eos> I think you're allowed to marry the same person as many times as you want.<eos> Oh, no. Don't.<eos> Finally. Clare.<eos> Who'd you expect?<eos> I brought you a turkey leg.<eos> Our cook roasts the best turkey around.<eos> Well, that's what everyone says, anyway.<eos> My dad was saving it for lunch.
What is it?<eos> It's a walnut.<eos> Well, obviously this is between you and him.<eos> Day two. 0600, Zulu Time.<eos> Did not sleep last night at all, not one bit.<eos> Still no sign of the tachyon amplifier, our only way home.<eos> Field rations are running dangerously low.<eos> Thusly, I've made the determination that, if need be, if faced with starvation, we will cook and eat Chaka.<eos> I've been thinking about this a lot, actually.<eos> If Chaka meat were the secret ingredient on Iron Chef, I'm sure Bobby Flay would probably serve it with roasted red peppers and a dash of cumin and a braised polenta.
Now, where's Victor?<eos> Little dark for sunglasses, don't you think?<eos> -Please, don't!<eos> Please, don't!<eos> -Victor!<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> Where's Victor?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Victor's with Stryker on the island.<eos> They run it together.
She still dies!<eos> She's gone, you know.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> You okay?<eos> No.<eos> Not until we find that case.<eos> When was the last time you saw it?<eos> Not since yesterday.<eos> Not for lack of trying, though.<eos> If we don't find it soon, they're gonna kill my mom.
Greetings, Nine.<eos> It had such promise, my great machine.<eos> It was meant to be an instrument of progress.<eos> of creation... that was the agreement our, chancellor failed to honour.<eos> But the fault is hardly his alone to bear.<eos> The machine was born purely of my intellect.<eos> Which I now know, was not enough.<eos> My creation was hopelessly flawed and indeed dangerous.<eos> It lacked a human soul.<eos> and could easily be corrupted by those who controlled it.
Halloween just got awesome, bitches!<eos> Prepare for the entrance of Lord Vader.<eos> Give yourself to the Dark Side.<eos> It's the only way you can save...<eos> You wore the same thing last year.<eos> - You son of a bitch.<eos> - I'm sorry, guys.<eos> My codpiece is killing me.<eos> It's totally restricting my junk.<eos> You're gonna spill it or fill it, dude?
Okay.<eos> Can I visit?<eos> Of course you can.<eos> Whenever you want.<eos> And you can call me too, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> I got to go tell Mom.<eos> Be careful. She's still mad from breakfast.<eos> Hey.<eos> Look, my aunt's house is just gonna sit there until we sell it.
I got you a little treat for doing so well in trigonometry.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Trig's easy.<eos> It's just memory.<eos> God, I hope you don't remember everything when you get older.<eos> It's not just because you did so well in math.<eos> I've got some news.<eos> Come on honey, sit down.<eos> And how you take it is important to me.
Ketchup.<eos> Chocolate syrup.<eos> Hot sauce.<eos> And mustard.<eos> You know, I would have just went with chocolate sauce or honey or...<eos> - Don't worry, it's yummier this way.<eos> - But ketchup is... Wow. That's enough ketchup.<eos> - Now would you like chocolate sauce?<eos> - Well, I guess so, yeah.<eos> - You probably would prefer it.
- Don't.<eos> You do.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - It's nothing.<eos> So, on behalf of everyone in the room... and those who couldn't make it here tonight...<eos> Kelly and Alan... here's to a lifetime together, huh?<eos> Hey, there's a lot better things we could be doing right now than talking. I would like to say something.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Before you do... I would like everyone to toast our troops.<eos> Hear! Love the war or hate it, we support you guys all the way.
It's your turn, babe.<eos> Dead or alive?<eos> Don't you think that's a really stupid question these days?<eos> You know, he's kind of an asshole, but if you need me to take care of him, I will.<eos> I can hear you.<eos> He's the one in the family with all the brains.<eos> Is that right?<eos> All right, the interstate's coming up.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Don't get on it.
Look, he recovered the Pink Panther once, and I believe he can do it again.<eos> If he solves this case, I'm perfectly willing to run around for 24 hours wearing nothing but a tutu and carrying a big, pink, fluffy handbag.<eos> I say we take a vote to get rid of him.<eos> All in favor?<eos> Whatever it is, count me in.<eos> Clouseau, while you were falling off of the Pope's balcony dressed as the Pope, I discovered a key piece of evidence.<eos> And what is this key piece of evidence?<eos> A key.<eos> I found this on the Pope's bedroom floor. Something, of course, you overlooked.<eos> That could mean anything. But if this key is so important, I will take it and duly examine it.
I think that's why the food is getting bigger.<eos> Here's what I heard:<eos> "Science, science, science, bigger."<eos> And bigger is better.<eos> Everyone's gonna love these new portion sizes.<eos> I know I do.<eos> My dad thinks I should turn it off.<eos> Geniuses like us are never understood by their fathers, Flint.<eos> But what if things go--<eos> Who needs the approval of one family member when you can have it from millions of acquaintances?
Hello!<eos> Hello!<eos> He killed him.<eos> One-Eye's gonna kill us all.<eos> One by one.<eos> I had a dream about this once.<eos> I couldn't find my way home and then I realised I was dead.<eos> What are we going to do about our friend?<eos> Leave a sword.<eos> If he finds it, it's God's will.
- Pleasure to meet you.<eos> - And you must be Leigh Anne.<eos> - That would be me, Coach Saban.<eos> - Nice to meet you. - You too.<eos> Just call me Nick.<eos> This is an incredible home.<eos> The Windsor valances are a nice touch.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> You obviously have excellent taste.<eos> Well, we appreciate quality and recognize it when we see it.
You don't know, what might be down the road.<eos> No.<eos> You're going to be okay, Papa.<eos> You have to.<eos> -This has been a long time coming.<eos> Just keep...<eos> just keep going south.<eos> Do everything the way we did it.<eos> Keep the gun with you allways.<eos> Don't let anyone take it from you.
It represents the epitome of technology of weapons technology of its age.<eos> It is, I suppose in a modern analogy, something like a stealth fighter.<eos> The one thing I can say with certainty is that it's very, very difficult to make one of these.<eos> You wouldn't let a smith who knew the secrets of making a sword like this wander about.<eos> They would have been kept closely guarded by the king. The information would have been an incredibly jealously guarded secret.<eos> The process is very long and very arduous and requires an incredible level of skill.<eos> He would have had a mastery of metals. He would have known exactly when to take it from the fire, which bits to forge, how hard to hit it, when to hit it, more importantly when not to hit it.<eos> One single blow can shatter a blade like this easily if it's at the wrong temperature.<eos> Literally tens of thousands of hammer blows have to be fight.<eos> When you manufacture a blade like this you don't just make it, you live it, and you dream about it and you think about it every single moment.
Now, very still, please.<eos> No fidgeting.<eos> And above all, no smiling.<eos> - Excuse me, sir?<eos> - Hmm? - Will this hurt?<eos> - Oh, no, no, no.<eos> It is only a beam of light.<eos> - Papa?<eos> How can light make a picture?<eos> Well, they take a copper plate and they prepare it with chemicals, and these chemicals are activated by the light that reflects back from your face, and so the silver sticks to the places where the light is brightest.
Is it true that he only let you go if you married his fattest daughter?<eos> Absolutely true, George, but don't you dare tell my wife.<eos> - Dear Joseph.<eos> - Dearest Emma.<eos> Forgive the short notice.<eos> - You know Thomas Huxley?<eos> - Only by reputation.<eos> - He insisted on coming.<eos> - It's a lie.<eos> I have a question for your esteemed, reclusive husband and I didn't trust Hooker to ask it for me. I see.
- This is a joint anti-inflammatory.<eos> Maximum dosage may cause bouts of uncontrollable appetite.<eos> That's not so bad.<eos> The munchies.<eos> I could deal with that.<eos> Look at this one.<eos> High blood pressure.<eos> "Watch out for sudden loss of depth perception."<eos> This tiny pill lowers your bad cholesterol.<eos> But the first time I took it, partial facial paralysis.
Um...<eos> A little technical...<eos> - I can do it from my notes.<eos> - OK.<eos> The first market segment is, um...<eos> Let's go.<eos> The idea of sports to a kid...<eos> Dan, what's going on?<eos> How could you have tanked that meeting?<eos> The way I set you up, you could've told them we were hiring monkeys and they would have bought it!
Where's my boy?<eos> Where's my boy?<eos> Lucky, come here, boy.<eos> Where's my goo-go!<eos> Where is he?<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - We tried to call.<eos> Hello, Daniel, it's Charlie.<eos> Thought you'd like to know that after 14 wonderful, fulfilling years together, my true best friend, Lucky, has passed.<eos> Maybe my life isn't as blessed as you paint it to be.
We'll get him back.<eos> Gotta go!<eos> I gotta go!<eos> I gotta go!<eos> Careful, sweetie.<eos> You have the eggs.<eos> - Why'd you give me the eggs? - 'Cause it was the lightest one.<eos> - I gotta pee!<eos> - Okay. Remember to put the toilet seat down.<eos> Put it up first, and then put it down.
I appreciate your honesty.<eos> He exposes us, if he speaks?<eos> Now, we are sure he is not included.<eos> -You and Stephen are very similar.<eos> -Yes, I know, but...<eos> If I give you his ID card you can get into.<eos> Listen carefully.<eos> Take the elevator to floor 1 6; the Scandinavian Department.<eos> At Stephen's desk, in your backpack, You will find a Hello Kitty doll.<eos> As soon as you put it on the table press the navel.
What exactly did you see?<eos> I saw a man on a high mountain who saw in the valleys the deeds of man.<eos> He held a staff, and he allotted everything rightly, so that deserts blossomed and the sleeping awoke.<eos> On Sunday we were crowned and anointed King in Aachen.<eos> Now we wish to know what the future may bring.<eos> You plan to go to Rome?<eos> Yes.<eos> There you shall be granted what you wish for.<eos> The Emperor's crown?<eos> You have it in your hands.
Yes.<eos> You know what that means?<eos> I do.<eos> It's unheard of.<eos> I'll be the first woman.<eos> - And turn everyone against you again.<eos> And I'll read our clerics the Levites!<eos> Will you accompany me anyway?<eos> "But it pleased the Lord to touch a small feather that it flew aloft in wonder.<eos> And a strong wind bore it so that it did not sink. " Subtitles Alexander Zuckrow
Let's look at some of the gadgets you have.<eos> I'm particularly interested in the phone.<eos> Is there not a cell phone?<eos> It's not a cell phone.<eos> Okay, wow.<eos> I have to say, that looks modern.<eos> Each number is trying to dial itself all the time.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> When I take the stick - and I put it into the hole...
A single bill could be a coincidence, but what about a whole stack?<eos> These bills, from the same series as Mitchell's, were just scanned at a bank in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, deposited in the account of a Mr. Slate.<eos> Impress me.<eos> We have a Mr. Edmund Slate returning to Port-au-Prince from Heathrow this morning.<eos> His entry documents have him staying at the Hotel Dessalines. He's in room 325.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Do you have any messages for 325?<eos> The only message was about the briefcase that was delivered earlier.<eos> - Did you want us to continue holding it?
Nice investment, Sand.<eos> Passes its first field test.<eos> Let's die.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> No. Oh, God.<eos> Mother.<eos> I guess it's time to finally drop your armor, Sand.<eos> You lost something.<eos> Old man Kurtzman said he'd take it back.<eos> Well maybe I'll wear it now and then.
You wouldn't have understood.<eos> I saw them together often.<eos> It was very moving.<eos> Your mother was truly happy back then.<eos> #Call Fredaric to set up the phone#<eos> Majorelle didn't make many display cases.<eos> Yours is the last one to be found in a private collection.<eos> The key is in the office.<eos> Here's the Majorelle desk.<eos> We'll see it better once it's cleared off.
-You're not a doctor.<eos> Yoυ're a big, fat, curly-headed fuck.<eos> -Oh' yeah?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -l'm a cυrly-headed fυck?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Yoυ better not go to sleep.<eos> As soon as yoυr eyes shυt, I'm gonna pυnch you sqυare in the face.<eos> I hope you stay still when you sleep. .. . ..becaυse I'm putting a rat trap between your legs.<eos> I'm gonna take a pillowcase and fill it full of bars of soap. .. . ..and beat the shit oυt of you.
Oh, my God, where are you?<eos> Here. Here.<eos> I'm Seven, I forgot to say Seven.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I've got you, okay.<eos> Left, left, make a left and straight.<eos> Straight.<eos> Keep going.<eos> - Do you need a hand?<eos> - No. I got it.
Good.<eos> I got somethin' for you.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Open it.<eos> My birthday isn't till tomorrow.<eos> I know, but... thisis fortonight.<eos> Gee... .<eos> Mickey, it's so nice!<eos> I picked it out myself.<eos> Aren't you gonna try it on?
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.<eos> As it happens, I have.<eos> You have, you say?<eos> Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.<eos> It requires a specific corrupt motive.<eos> And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.<eos> What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.<eos> Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.<eos> Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?<eos> Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice, I was actively facilitating it.
Well, there is one small detail:<eos> Nobody knows where Santa's Fell is.<eos> So why don't we go back to the herd and ask around... ..and maybe someone might know.<eos> Really?<eos> The Flying Forces always disappear behind that big fell on their way home.<eos> Hey!<eos> So does the moon, big guy.<eos> - lt means Santa's Fell must be on the other side of it. - Nonsense!<eos> I have to be strict with you young man.<eos> I'm drawing this line here... and if you cross it, I will...
Marv, leave us the fuck alone.<eos> We gotta make sure his intentions are pure.<eos> We was watching out for you.<eos> Your rich daddy buy you this sweet ride, boy?<eos> Get outta the way, Stank.<eos> - Roach, give me those keys.<eos> - Look what I got!<eos> You are a rich boy, ain't you?<eos> No.<eos> I bought it on my own.
I think both groups are on the brink of an armed confrontation.<eos> We're ready to cooperate with the 26th of July Movement in all military maneuvers.<eos> We even agree with agrarian reform as long as it's done reasonably and brings in money.<eos> Landowners should be pressured to sell their idle land to the peasants. But it should be sold at cost.<eos> Will you be the one fixing the price?<eos> How can a peasant with no money buy land?<eos> But what do you want?<eos> Just give it to them?<eos> So they can destroy it like they did in Mexico?<eos> The owner of the land is the one who works it.
You know the one thing they don't teach you in basic?<eos> No matter how bad things get, there's always time for another joint.<eos> So, what do you do when you're not being a soldier of fortune?<eos> Drink.<eos> You know, in every culture, they believe all the souls of the men you killed<eos> haunt you for eternity.<eos> Guess that's us fucked, eh?<eos> Okay. I think she's ready.<eos> I really don't know how long it'll take to generate enough power.<eos> Well, keep the door locked until I come back and knock it down.
Rickie.<eos> Pal.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> This whole thing is fucking over, you guys, seriously.<eos> We're all going to get arrested or worse.<eos> I mean, JT...<eos> Look, how long have we known Wheeler?<eos> All our lives?<eos> He knows how to keep a secret.<eos> He knows a good thing when he sees it, don't you, Wheeler?
It's the Ghost Market thugs and Park Do-won.<eos> Knowing I, Park Chang-yi, would be after it?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> But...<eos> Looks like Park Do-won was after you, sir.<eos> The Ghost Market?<eos> It's a market for stolen goods.<eos> There was a gunfight last night.<eos> The fool who stole the map ran away to the Ghost Market.<eos> He'll probably sell it there.
Just answer the question.<eos> You're after the map, too?<eos> Damn bastards.<eos> I did, but not now.<eos> So there!<eos> Where is it?<eos> Use your brain, fool.<eos> I'm in this shit 'cuz of that map.<eos> You think I'd just go and tell 'ya?<eos> The independence army wants it, not me.
Worse?<eos> There are things swimming around in this sea that you don't want to come across.<eos> Have you been out here before?<eos> No.<eos> Only ever heard the stories.<eos> Me da used to go fishing out here.<eos> Yeah, my little brother and I used to watch him from the summit.<eos> That's a really nice memory, Arthur.<eos> There was this one time he was coming back in to land.<eos> The water all around him started bubbling up, and then we saw it.
- Shut up.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> Why is it on the floor?<eos> Is that even sanitary?<eos> Rod, open it.<eos> I'm not even coming in there, man.<eos> You open it.<eos> - George.<eos> - I'm not gonna touch that thing.<eos> Damn it, guys, somebody's gotta open it.
Yes, hairs.<eos> Pubic hairs?<eos> Pubic hairs.<eos> By mail.<eos> I couldn't manage a love letter.<eos> So you sent pubes. Logical.<eos> I don't know why I did it. I think it turned me on to think she touched them... or that when she opened the envelope, a hair had fallen on her bed.<eos> But that's not all.<eos> Delphine was totally traumatized by the letter.<eos> She threw it away, disgusted, saying that if it happened again, she'd tell her father, who was a cop.
Take a look.<eos> Jiro gave these stones to me.<eos> My daddy told me these are fossils of brackens.<eos> These are very, very old, older than 100 million years.<eos> He's me.<eos> Me as a child.<eos> You in the future asked me. When I see Jiro in the past, make sure to take him to the home town.<eos> My house is there, I think.<eos> We had a persimmon tree.<eos> People called it the Persimmon House.
You had made it by yourself.<eos> I'm not a fool.<eos> You can't treack me with the fake.<eos> I'm not a lesbian.<eos> It's over.<eos> I never want to see you again.<eos> Indeed.<eos> It was an easy mistake.<eos> The esteemed professor says the coin is very old... from Sappho's own time.<eos> We will place it in the town museum.
I thought, Wherever it leads you, move on from where you've been, from what you've been.<eos> Cut off from everything you know.<eos> I'd never been all the way down south, so I went on as far as I could go.<eos> I went offshore.<eos> I didn't bother to turn my clock around for the two weeks on shore between gigs.<eos> I started to feel like I was already dead, but didn't know it.<eos> I would have given up within a year if it hadn't been for May.<eos> Brought your boat.<eos> Thanks, but I don't want the boat.<eos> Uh... I'd like you to have it.

Your kids are very fortunate they have someone who loves them as much you do.<eos> Someone who tries so hard.<eos> And any man is a fool who doesn't know how incredibly lucky he is to have you.<eos> Paul.<eos> Wait.<eos> Her eyes were dark brown and soft like she'd never hurt a soul.<eos> And she wouldn't, neither.<eos> I knew Jill since we was in school.<eos> That thing on her face, she always had it.<eos> I didn't care about it. I never even saw it.

There's enough bullshit as it is. In fact, there's just enough, did you know that?<eos> There's just enough bullshit to hold things together in this country.<eos> Bullshit is the glue that binds us as a nation.<eos> Where would we be without our safe, familiar, American bullshit.<eos> Home of the brave. The American dream. All men are equal.<eos> The police are on your side. God is watching you. Your standard of living will never decline.<eos> The official national bullshit story.<eos> I call it the American okie-doke.<eos> Every one, every one of those items is provably untrue at one level or another, but we believe them because they're pounded into our heads from the time we're children.<eos> That's what they do with that kind of thing, pound it into the heads of kids because they know that children are much too young to be able to muster an intellectual defense against a sophisticated idea like that.
Something we said?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I just...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Can you give the joke again?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The penguin's on his way to a party and his car breaks down.<eos> Do penguins go to birthday...?<eos> On his way to the party, car breaks down.<eos> He drops it off at a mechanic.
- It worth anything or what?<eos> - No.<eos> It's just old flies and shit.<eos> There's nothing worth taking.<eos> Fuck, all right.<eos> Put your rig down, old man.<eos> - Easy there.<eos> - Yeah, he better take it easy.<eos> Put your goddamn rig down.<eos> I set it down, I could lose it.
Thank you for coming, Senator.<eos> We've asked you in to answer questions regarding certain financial irregularities.<eos> We can go to my office and talk first or get right to it.<eos> Lead on.<eos> If you'll follow me, then.<eos> He's pretty cool about it.<eos> The coming out tells the tale.<eos> Devon?<eos> Do you know this story?<eos> Or would you like me to read it to you?
No.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> McNulty, it's perfect.<eos> I couldn't believe it.<eos> I'm sitting there.<eos> All this bullshit coming at me, thinking, Christ, this is a waste of time.<eos> Then I realized:<eos> this is the wiretap.<eos> Right here.<eos> They're giving it to me.
But not as... Not so bad like it was.<eos> Ain't no shame in holding' on to grief.<eos> As long as you make room for other things, too.<eos> It's all right.<eos> So thank you for listening.<eos> - Thank you for lettin' me share.<eos> - Thanks for sharing.<eos> Where my gun?<eos> In the trap.<eos> You get it when we set up.
I've never tried it before.<eos> I'm starting a hunger strike on the 1st of March.<eos> That's why you're here.<eos> That's what I'm telling you.<eos> Aye, I heard that.<eos> Does your family know ?<eos> I got word to them, aye.<eos> Have you spoken with them ?<eos> Got a visit in two week's time. We talked then.<eos> How do you think they will take it ?
He is under my desk licking my thigh at the moment.<eos> That was dishonest of me.<eos> I apologize.<eos> I suppose it's not good to be dishonest, is it, Leigh?<eos> –I'm feeling hostility.<eos> –Are you now? Jerry says you categorically deny having told me to watch my back.<eos> Katie, I'm not going to get into accusations over who said what.<eos> I was hoping you and I could be friends.<eos> Um, excellent. How does one define friendship in Leigh Swift terms?<eos> Well, I would define it... by you keeping your slutty well-traveled hands away from Jerry.
I thought scalia would rupture a blood vessel.<eos> And did you see alito?<eos> He hasn't been so offended since they let blacks and girls into princeton.<eos> I didn't really mean to go on the attack.<eos> I just...<eos> Did I at least make sense?<eos> Not to me.<eos> But I'll tell you this, I admire you.<eos> To march into the supreme court and fight for a principle you believe in-- wow.<eos> How many people have such a chance and actually seize it?
No one's coming back.<eos> We were lured out of resurrection range.<eos> Ship was attacked.<eos> We survived.<eos> The baseship was damaged.<eos> We were set adrift.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Who attacked you?<eos> War has broken out between the cylon.<eos> Battle lines have been drawn between those who embrace their nature and those who fear it.
Is tre anything else?<eos> Yeah. Givee my gun back.<eos> We leave in ten minutes.<eos> Ready to give us a name,gizmo?<eos> He's not gonna tell you who his spy is on their boat,james.<eos> yeah?<eos> Why not?<eos> because that's the only thing that's keeping him alive.<eos> Well,here's an idea.<eos> Why don't we take a gun,point it to his big toe and send that little piggy to market?
I held up my end of deal. And I broke Whistler out.<eos> But the company, they killed Sara anyway.<eos> I don't know why the company want James Whistler out of prison. But I have tracked him here to Los Angles.<eos> He is with another company agent that I only known as Gretchen.<eos> The same agent who murdered Sara.<eos> This ends today.<eos> I came here seeking justice.<eos> The justice I now know the system can not provide.<eos> So if you reading this letter, You know I died revenging Sara's death.<eos> We drop it off in the racing form, and we get the hell out of there.

Soldiers that had been killing each other that morning, Walked across the lines that afternoon For the first Time as allies<eos> Now, I Don't expect us to exchange gifts, But that doesn't mean we can't be allies.<eos> Of course, you can't have a cease-fire<eos> Without both parties Getting what they want.<eos> You have five minutes.<eos> Put as many scars on my back as possible.<eos> I Don't want to rush you, but you have four minutes left.<eos> What was her name?<eos> This is a one-time deal, Sara.<eos> You want your pound of flesh, you take it now.
Let me clean you up.<eos> It was horrible.<eos> But it's over.<eos> No, no, no, it's not that.<eos> One of them asked a question I didn't answer.<eos> Who?<eos> At the lecture.<eos> He does say something about gravity.<eos> Einstein?<eos> He doesn't mention it, but if you look properly, it's obvious.
Raping her, or doing much, much worse?<eos> We're very fortunate to have with us the special agent in charge of the Riley Lawson case Special Agent Ralph Hotchkiss.<eos> Welcome.<eos> So, what's it gonna take to catch this maniac?<eos> Twenty-seven fifty, please.<eos> I'm a profiler.<eos> I live with the burden of empathy.<eos> FBI, huh?<eos> I see the world through the eyes of the bad men.<eos> When I see a woman's ankle, I see it with a shackle on it.
And that's a very interesting dynamic in Michael's journey.<eos> Who's the pet lover?<eos> He'll deny it but he's D. B. Cooper.<eos> Parachute out of a plane 30 years ago with a million and a half in cash.<eos> Doesn't look like the type.<eos> Much like the warden character,<eos> I think D. B. Cooper eventually represents some kind of surrogate father to me.<eos> I heard you were D. B. Cooper.<eos> You want a Cooper story?<eos> I can't give it to you. 'Cause I'm not him.
It's a broad desert.<eos> Nothing'll come of it.<eos> I prefer not to be hanged before my wife is queen.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> "Who but Reynald?" they'll say.<eos> It's always me.<eos> They'll believe it in Jerusalem, I assure you.<eos> You were at Nazareth, praying.<eos> You're a dangerous man.<eos> If the war's to be now or later, I would have it now.
Dead?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I tried to tell him, but he was adamant about staking his claim on the island.<eos> He died a Viking, sword in hand, sacrificing his life so Eric and I could survive.<eos> But you still live.<eos> Your king is dead and you still live?<eos> Gang, Jarl, Kogla, Raine all fell with the king.<eos> But you still live!<eos> And so do the others and so will our people because they know not to meddle in the affairs of the gods.<eos> If Odin wants the cursed island, then let him have it.
These are for you, because we believe in you<eos> Now run along, and paint your fantastic pictures and never mind those closed minded folks who think they know what art is meant to look like give them hell from me Jim!<eos> Excuse me, but I ain't Jim, I'm Jack, that's Jim!<eos> It is tricky, as a matter offact I've never been able to tell them apart either<eos> They're both colored and they both got curly hair why look any deeper than that?<eos> To be honest Grace had never been quite sure which was Jim and which was Jack<eos> A blunder that would, in her former life among her fellow whites merely have occasioned a Iittle laughter in her life at Manderlay it was disastrous<eos> But like her father, she did not take long to transform a defeat into anger energy and a counterattack<eos> This is what has created all this resistance<eos> Even you regard it as almost sacred, don't you?
- Oh, come on.<eos> It was a car accident.<eos> They call them accidents because it's nobody's fault.<eos> No, they call them accidents to make the guilty feel better. - Is that so?<eos> - I don't give a damn what they call them.<eos> My son's dead.<eos> Your granddaughter's not.<eos> Have you thought about how she's gonna remember you?<eos> You know, come to think of it, I don't feel like playing cards tonight.<eos> Put that bottle someplace where I don't have to look at it.
My life is half over.<eos> And I don't even know if I'm black with white stripes or white with black stripes.<eos> Marty.<eos> I'm thinking of a song.<eos> Alex.<eos> Please.<eos> Not now.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> It's a wonderful song.<eos> I think you're familiar with it.
You're my friend.<eos> We're a team.<eos> You and me, remember?<eos> I don't want to hurt you.<eos> Alex.<eos> I ain't leaving without you.<eos> Alex?<eos> I'm thinking of a song.<eos> It's a wonderful song.<eos> I'm sure you're familiar with it.
Get rhythm when you get the blues"<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Viv, I'm telling you, I think this is the best show we've ever done.<eos> Hell, it might be the best show I've ever seen, no kidding.<eos> Where are you?<eos> - Texarkana.<eos> Baby, I miss you.<eos> Hey, do you hear Orbison doing our song?<eos> He turned it to a two-step.
And I showed you everything she left behind in that box, but feel free.<eos> Maybe she left something else. Not something a cop would find.<eos> Something just for you.<eos> You were her twin, Angela.<eos> Twins tend to think alike.<eos> - I'm not like my sister.<eos> - But you were once.<eos> When you were kids.<eos> When you'd spend every second with each other.<eos> You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it.
The island.<eos> We're filming on an island now?<eos> When did this happen?<eos> Jack, keep your voice down.<eos> I don't want the crew getting spooked.<eos> Why would they get spooked?<eos> What's it called?<eos> All right.<eos> It has a local name, but I'm warning you, Jack, it doesn't sound good.<eos> They call it Skull Island.
You became my friend that night, Julian.<eos> You became my life-long friend...<eos> I'm not going to do it for you.<eos> You're making it on a late night... an exhausted desperate decision.<eos> And if I did it... You would regret it instantly.<eos> And feel guilt and shame for the rest of you life, believe me.<eos> I'm so scared, Julian.<eos> Guys like you you think you've no luck?<eos> But you got all the luck in the world.<eos> You just need to see it.
You're lucky I was born with a spare.<eos> There go one of my ho's.<eos> The old guy in the walker's one of your ho's?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why ain't his ancient ass out there making me my money?<eos> Kaiser!<eos> Get your old ass back in the booth!<eos> Deucey, meet me back at the float-crib.<eos> Bitches out here act like they never seen a pimp before.<eos> I raise my hand, they look at it like it's a goddamn croissant.
And I want my own makeup team in matching jumpsuits.<eos> And a leopard!<eos> I want a pet leopard.<eos> With a diamond-studded collar.<eos> Real diamonds.<eos> - That's enough, Jack.<eos> - And a cake.<eos> A two-story-high cake.<eos> Every Wednesday's Cake Day.<eos> And we're gonna bring it out and we're gonna pretend it's a surprise.
No wonder he kept the books locked up. They're empty.<eos> We don't own any of this stuff.<eos> We're broke. How can that be?<eos> You must have made a pile off the Dub MD's alone.<eos> - Weapons of Mass Destruction.<eos> - I know who they are.<eos> Well, whatever we made off them, I can't find it in the books which means we can't afford to record her, which means no masters, which means no CDs, which sure as hell means no more NTL Records.<eos> Hello?<eos> So what'd you think?<eos> I would love to produce your record, and because I'm going to produce it, it will rock.
Perhaps a game of croquet would be less hazardous to your health.<eos> Did you drop something?<eos> Or you just resting?<eos> You know, I think I like this game.<eos> Promise me when you lose you will leave us alone.<eos> What makes you think I will lose?<eos> Woman's intuition.<eos> To the victor go the spoils.<eos> Now keep your promise and go.<eos> You cheated, so I take it back.
I've been informed one of my shipping vessels is arriving tomorrow.<eos> They'll anchor off Maderas Cove.<eos> The cargo must be brought here safely.<eos> I want no mistakes.<eos> Now that we have the deed, will the track be completed on time?<eos> It'll take my boys two days to cover the quarter mile.<eos> I'll hold you to that, Mr. McGivens. Otherwise you get nothing.<eos> Listen to me, you backwards-ass frog you hedge on my money, you won't ever see me 00--<eos> This dagger, Mr. McGivens... ."Jake". ...Has been in my family for generations.<eos> If you ever talk to me like that again I will cut out your tongue and I'll feed it to my dogs.
It represents the Knights of Aragon an ancient brotherhood that ruled Europe in secrecy after the Crusades.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Armand is a knight?<eos> Some believe they are the masters behind all the kings in Europe even today.<eos> Here is a prophecy they wrote nearly 1000 years ago.<eos> "There shall be a land in the west of great power that shall rise to threaten the serpent.<eos> Only by turning the power onto itself shall the serpent survive."<eos> A land in the west.<eos> America.<eos> They want to destroy it.
She'll be right down.<eos> Bubbles here, I like that.<eos> It's a good touch.<eos> Is that wool?<eos> Looks itchy.<eos> Is it itchy?<eos> I think it's the biggest contradiction in the world.<eos> Jews eat carp, okay?<eos> Who eats carp?<eos> They don't serve it in restaurants.
- Yes.<eos> You want to sit down?<eos> I thought we could look at pictures, just to start things off.<eos> We have pictures of everything, of you and me you and dad and the three of us.<eos> This is from Legoland, and this is from Tivoli ...<eos> And the summer house.<eos> Look at these pictures.<eos> This is from your birthday.<eos> I made the cake.<eos> Or maybe dad made it.
All I'm saying is that you can whip it out anytime, Hank.<eos> We gotta pull the coveralls all the way down, you know?<eos> We start peeing in our seats I don't think the next shift's gonna be too happy about it.<eos> You got another load to get.<eos> So pull them up and go get it.<eos> This down here is taconite.<eos> That's what pays bills.<eos> We've taken to calling this area the Powder Room.<eos> Catchy, don't you think?<eos> Especially since you girls will be the ones cleaning it.
So how is Lincoln Six Echo today?<eos> Not so good, I guess.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Well, if I'm here, it means I'm not so good.<eos> That's a rather negative association.<eos> My only job is to see that you're happy, that things are okay with you.<eos> Right.<eos> Your file shows that you've been interacting regularly with Jordan Two Delta.<eos> There's no law against friendship.<eos> No, we encourage it, but obviously, proximity could become a concern.
It's my preference to blow things up.<eos> Once you blast the roof off a pub and seen all the parts flying off people, a little bang bang's never gonna match the sight of that.<eos> And here's me, with all these fine grenades and such a sweet beauty of a remote.<eos> But it's me knife I'll be doing you with.<eos> You killed me mates.<eos> Someone shoulda told ya - never give an Irishman good cause for revenge.<eos> Deadly little Miho.<eos> You won't feel a thing unless she wants you to.<eos> She twists the blade.<eos> He feels it.
"Dear Diary, my family is a disaster.<eos> Father is so far away, Mother doesn't understand a thing.<eos> Thank God I've got Grandma and Manuela, my best friend."<eos> Slow down!<eos> You shouldn't be afraid with me!<eos> Ever!<eos> Okay, but be careful!<eos> - You trust me?<eos> - Yes, you're the best!<eos> I hate gym but I'm sure Manu hates it more than I do.
You know who she is, right?<eos> You think I'm stupid?<eos> I heard you were at the U.S. Embassy yesterday?<eos> What did that jerk Ambassador Gleysteen say?<eos> The same old stuff.<eos> That bastard, Carter...<eos> He's so stupid, it's mind boggling!<eos> How would a peanut farmer know better, sir?<eos> Everyone's making a fuss about democracy...<eos> But how many countries are actually practicing it?
Don't you drink that water.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Up to get some samples.<eos> Can I go with you?<eos> Aren't you having breakfast?<eos> Are you sure no one's here?<eos> Sissy.<eos> Don't throw rocks.<eos> Right back at you, then.<eos> Nobody's going to drink it anyway.
'Their average lifespan is 16 years.'<eos> - Because they run too fast.<eos> - Too fast.<eos> To run a long time, you can't start fast.<eos> - Can not.<eos> - Slowly.<eos> - Slowly.<eos> - What happens if a zebra gets tired and falls?<eos> What happens?<eos> Lions and hyenas eat it.
Everything's still there, but don't worry, I'll get it out.<eos> We have to move soon, when the troops from the other groups come in.<eos> It's coming soon.<eos> These bastards are going to get it right in the face.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> - Is the boss here?<eos> - Sure.<eos> You came all this way just for a mule?<eos> - Yes, boss.<eos> - Why do you want it?
Good afternoon.<eos> - Is the boss here?<eos> - Sure.<eos> You came all this way just for a mule?<eos> - Yes, boss.<eos> - Why do you want it?<eos> To look for someone, my daughter-in-law.<eos> The mother of this boy?<eos> Yes, boss.<eos> Lend it to me just for a few days, I'll bring it back.
- That wasn't what I asked.<eos> Do I look like someone who has been assaulted?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Wait!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Do you like my room?<eos> Give me the key!<eos> - Have you been here before?<eos> - What? Of course not!<eos> You have. You just don't recognize it.
- I don't know... a few days.<eos> - It's impossible.<eos> At the post office, they told me it will be there tomorrow.<eos> No way.<eos> Tomorrow is Sunday.<eos> True.<eos> I think you should lie down and sleep.<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> I don't feel like sleeping<eos> What is she doing with that pill, inventing it?
- Should I put his coat on? - No.<eos> Lie down over there.<eos> A neurologist is coming to see you.<eos> Let's start with the EKG, Mrs. Sandu.<eos> First, you have left ventricular hypertrophy meaning your blood pressure is high.<eos> It's not serious, but you should be careful with the effort.<eos> Tell her, doctor, cause she doesn't want to listen to me.<eos> And you also have a beginning of calcification on your aorta.<eos> I'll take you on our way out, but first you need to be examined.<eos> I will prescribe you a treatment, and I'd like you to follow it.
It's hard enough already.<eos> Wurina!<eos> Your brother should enter school sometime soon.<eos> Yes, he's seven now.<eos> A letter from the city from the dance troupe.<eos> - For me?<eos> Pour me a tea first!<eos> - I should pour you tea?<eos> Pour it yourself.<eos> Get the national ball so they can admire it.
You put me in a very uncomfortable position.<eos> Sorry about that but you were right.<eos> I had not insulted her enough.<eos> I feel much better now.<eos> And why do you think you didn't insult her before?<eos> Why did we say that the worst had not happened yet?<eos> Because she cheated on me but did not leave me.<eos> And if I insult her she might leave me.<eos> And your panic would be directly related to the fear of abandonment ....<eos> We never see reality as it is. We see it through a lens.
Lord!<eos> You're out of your mind.<eos> How can you do something like that?<eos> —My God.<eos> —Who is the guy?<eos> He taught the literary workshop she took.<eos> How did you know?<eos> It took her too long to answer a simple question.<eos> And she didn't have her wedding ring on.<eos> Women usually take it off for that. We're not married, Díaz.
Where did you get it?<eos> I found it in the street not far from here.<eos> Do you want something for it?<eos> - So you do know who it belongs to?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> And does she actually live here?<eos> - Yes, she lives here.<eos> Well, I can give her her bag myself.<eos> Give me the bag.<eos> I'll give it to her.
If she deals with him, how can she will have time to fool around?<eos> She is going to Bodrum again.<eos> She has pretended to offer to take Deniz with her.<eos> Just pretended.<eos> Also, she brought half kilo of mince meat for him.<eos> I told her that his father fulfills all his needs meatballs or liver are not the case.<eos> Did you like my response?<eos> She brought a shirt as a present.<eos> It is so large that it is on his knees.<eos> I said he will start to wear it after 3 years.
As St. Bruno says, when wearied by our quite austere rule and application to spiritual things, our rather delicate natures can often be refreshed and renewed by the charms and beauties of woods and countryside.<eos> The fathers have a walk every week, with the exception of the Holy Week.<eos> Should it be necessary to go through a town or a village, they will be content simply to pass through, preserving due decorum,<eos> nor may they ever enter the houses of seculars.<eos> On the walks, we are not to eat or drink anything except plain water, found by the wayside.<eos> What you've read today is usually not read.<eos> Yes? What does that mean?<eos> The entire paragraph in parentheses?<eos> - Yes, exactly. No, no one ever reads it.<eos> Many translations treat it as an addition.
It's wonderful that a big family is coming up here to live.<eos> And they're not from the South!<eos> I told the mayor to give him our pastureland.<eos> I won't charge him, but he must keep it clean.<eos> A thousand, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, forty-five.<eos> If it's more, tell me.<eos> You could have come in Spring, like last year.<eos> Tell the mayor that I don't want any surprises on my land.<eos> Can you give me a receipt?<eos> - We usually send it to your house.
That room's the answer. It has to be.<eos> It's the only thing that doesn't fit.<eos> It's not part of this reality.<eos> If it even exists.<eos> You're the only one who can see it... i have to get back there.<eos> Hey, partner.<eos> Black, two sugars.<eos> So the guards tell me that you spent... five hours here yesterday, three the day before that, and, one saturday, you logged up 12.<eos> Yeah, so i like art.<eos> It's a nice, functional door, tom, but i wouldn't call it a work of art.
Having problems?<eos> Leave your family?<eos> I'm going to Seattle.<eos> That is a big city.<eos> Should I drop you off at the edge?<eos> I go to the 4400 center.<eos> There I go.<eos> Why then?<eos> Will you join us? Bring me so near if you can, please.<eos> If you are looking for salvation, you will not find it there.
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - How's Sloane?<eos> - Not well.<eos> We figured out what Dean was talking about.<eos> The network his organization's using is mobile.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Their communications are piggy-backed through a series of telecom satellites.<eos> The Glenheim people don't know they're being used, which is exactly the point.<eos> They wouldn't know the network was there unless they were looking for it.
You're part of it now.<eos> They're ready for the briefing.<eos> Thank you. We're coming.<eos> Yesterday a rare orchid was stolen from the Monte Inferno monastery in Umbria.<eos> 45 monks were killed to obtain it.<eos> Satellite photos confirm it's the same man we encountered in Santiago, the man who claims to be me.<eos> Details are in your briefing folders.<eos> What's so special about this orchid?<eos> It has chemical properties which heighten the receptivity in the neural pathways... we think -- we assume. Well, we don't know, really.<eos> It's just that nobody in the scientific community has laid eyes on it for centuries.
Previously on Alias.<eos> I got her.<eos> Blond hair, brown jacket.<eos> Hi there!<eos> How much does she know about this operation?<eos> Dean calls it "The Shed."
And the thing is that on average, it blows every 600,000 years.<eos> Well, then I don't think we have to worry about it.<eos> No, no, no. It hasn't blown for 600,030 years.<eos> We're due, sister.<eos> What is this?<eos> Fancy chocolate?<eos> That's not for you.<eos> No, it is. I like fancy chocolate.<eos> Where is the freezer bag?<eos> I left it in the car. - I'll get it.
Hey...<eos> This man's taken lives.<eos> I did what I thought was best.<eos> I know.<eos> In spite of all this, it's good to see you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Weekends aren't enough.<eos> - Tell me about it.<eos> Yes?<eos> I had an idea, but you're gonna hate it.
- How's she doing?<eos> - About how you'd expect.<eos> She was told Substance 33 was developed by a terrorist cell and was being transferred to U.N. weapons inspectors.<eos> Most likely, it's being sold to the highest bidder.<eos> Does she know when the exchange is to be made?<eos> Tonight, but she doesn't know where.<eos> She said it's all classified, and all classified intel is stored on Dean's own dedicated server.<eos> What else?<eos> How much does she know about his operation?<eos> Dean calls it "The Shed. "
Alexander the Grape! Look, Dad.<eos> Grandpa came to visit.<eos> Oh, hey, Dad.<eos> - Hi, honey.<eos> - Oh, Francine...<eos> Bullock stuck me with another pathetic assignment. I'm in a rut.<eos> My career is going nowhere.<eos> Well, ifyou need a place to go, how about the market?<eos> Oh, and, Francine, F.Y.I.... Cheese Nips are not the same as Cheez-Its.<eos> Why have a list ifyou're not gonna follow it?
- Dad? - No.<eos> I am former communist named Petrov.<eos> I too embrace insane left-wing philosophies which are best discussed in parents' home.<eos> - Dad, leave me alone.<eos> - I've had enough.<eos> You're coming home or else.<eos> - Or else what?<eos> - That'll be 38.40.<eos> Or else you can't use this.<eos> We gave you this card and I can damn well take it back.
Take the whole booth down, as a matter of fact. - You're cannibalising our business.<eos> - You're just scared of a little competish.<eos> Well, you know, you guys don't even have bananas, so I'm not too worried.<eos> In fact, you know what?<eos> Me and my son are gonna go ahead and kick your little shack's ass.<eos> Dad, it's okay.<eos> We can just work together with them, you know.<eos> Yeah, I mean, that makes sense.<eos> We don't really even know the recipe yet.<eos> There's no recipe. You just freeze a banana and then you stick it in...

I gotta kill this pre-engagement somehow. And after Mom's second vodka, and after Buster's second juice box... they're gonna forbid Ann from even seeing my son... much less taking his ring, and I'm still the good guy.<eos> So the devout religious family- they're the bad guys?<eos> You'll understand when Maeby starts getting proposals.<eos> [Narrator] Actually, Maeby had given two that day.<eos> I'm sorry. I can't read what you wrote on this buck slip.<eos> You've got the handwriting of a 15-year-old.<eos> Fifteen-year-old.<eos> Marry me!<eos> Hey, I'm almost done with that coverage.<eos> I can bring it to you tonight.
Let us pray.<eos> Oh, for God's sake.<eos> Praise the Lord!<eos> And Michael, now feeling a little woozy, arrived to see the triathlon course. Which consisted of several tricycles, five inflatable pools...<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> ... and fathers and sons being manacled together.<eos> Don't let it psych you out.<eos> Did that oxyincontinent set in yet?<eos> You knew this is what the race was?<eos> Kind of. I mean, they change it every year so you can't replicate it on your lawn.
First, it was "What's your son gonna think?" And now you think you're having a baby... because a woman who lies told you you weren't.<eos> That's a great way to say that.<eos> We really do communicate well, do you know that?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> You broke up with her because... somebody who doesn't want you might be pregnant with your baby?<eos> No, Sally broke up with me.<eos> And as for Maggie... I didn't even know that she was pregnant when I first saw her.<eos> All I could see was her giant chest- box.<eos> She had this<eos> - Some people call it a chest. I call it a box.
It did say "60 pounds" on it.<eos> Okay, l-I've done this wrong.<eos> I should've found out whether it was a real pregnancy before I told my dream girl about it.<eos> [Gob] You know what I do, Mike?<eos> Check their urine.<eos> Make 'em pee in a cup, and pee in a cup right in front of me.<eos> Yeah, well, thanks, Gob.<eos> But, uh, I think we should just keep on lookin'.<eos> I don't know how I can make that sound like me.<eos> So you get someone to break into her house, rig the toilet... collect the pee, test it, and expose the lie.
El-tee?<eos> Crash!<eos> Yeah, Chief, I'll be right there.<eos> Got them.<eos> What're they doing?<eos> Looks like they're dismantling the ship.<eos> Why?<eos> - Why not use it to fly the hell out of here? - I don't know.<eos> I can't tell.<eos> They're dragging it into the tree line.
Simes is senior pilot now.<eos> He can plan the SAR.<eos> You asked me to command the air group when I'm on duty, and I'm on duty... so am I in command or not?<eos> What's the status of the SAR, Captain?<eos> Well, we don't know in what area Raptor 3 went down.<eos> So the only realistic chance we have of finding her... is the hope that her transponder or disaster beacon is still functioning.<eos> I intend to take two Raptors... one with medical personnel, and make five low-level orbits of the planet.<eos> What about that Cylon base ship that Lt. Valerii supposedly destroyed?<eos> What if she was lying?<eos> Racetrack confirmed the destruction of the base ship... and I checked the gun-camera footage from the Raptors, which verifies it.
Starbuck, what's this second scar? I don't know.<eos> I don't think I wanna know now.<eos> You know?<eos> No.<eos> All right, how many women do they have at these farms?<eos> Hundreds. Maybe thousands.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I haven't accessed that data.<eos> Here's what we do.<eos> Take the Heavy Raider, cram it full of ground troops... find out where the next farm is, liberate it, then the next... and the next, and the next.
What few Marines we have... are assembling at their checkpoint, but comm. Is spotty.<eos> Where are the Cylons?<eos> It looks like they split into two forces. One moving forward...<eos> Forward, one moving aft.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I've seen this before.<eos> These are their objectives:<eos> Secondary Damage Control and Auxiliary Fire Control, sir.<eos> If they're successful, they will override our decompression safeties... and vent us all into space.<eos> Once we're all dead, they'll turn the ship's guns on the fleet and wipe it out... once and for all.
What shotgun ?<eos> The shotgun you used to kill Joel Ivey.<eos> Joel is dead ?<eos> This is Joel ?<eos> What, you don't recognize him with half his face blown off ?<eos> Wait a second.<eos> I got caught cheating.<eos> Obviously, you know that.<eos> Then they, uh... tuned me up pretty good.<eos> Tore my jacket, got some blood on it, so I threw it down the garbage chute, and, uh... then I left.
- Yes. - And this your cell phone?<eos> - No.<eos> Really?<eos> You didn't buy a prepaid cell phone at Circle K in Tempe 2 weeks ago?<eos> No.<eos> Oh.<eos> Ok.<eos> Well, so the court's major concern is your financial history, and apparently, you recently withdrew $75,000 all in increments under $10,000.<eos> What was that for?<eos> I just bought a house and i'm fixing it up so Keith can have his own room when he visits.
John... Alright.<eos> John ?<eos> What did he say ?<eos> He says he can't force Jenson to tell me anything.<eos> It's all connected to this.<eos> I still don't get why your father would hide some little girl's doll underneath the floor in his office ?<eos> Maybe...<eos> Our secret.<eos> Maybe he left it for me.<eos> But why do i find it now after all these years ?
I'm gonna need his name and address, alright ?<eos> I can put you in contact with the mother, they're recently divorced.<eos> Sure.<eos> Maybe you can see something ?<eos> We're heading over to the mother's house.<eos> That's not going to be fun.<eos> Why did you take off ?<eos> It was me, wasn't it ?<eos> The vision of my death,<eos> I've seen it nearly every day since I was a little girl.
That's weird.<eos> I had another vision too, off the guy with the pipe.<eos> I've seen people like migrants or something trapped in a container.<eos> They're gonna die if we don't find them.<eos> We better get Walt on the phone.<eos> No not yet.<eos> I think that's why I ended up with this baby.<eos> You know what ? I think finding the father is the key to this whole thing.<eos> Baby's asleep.<eos> I have got to get this shirt into the laundry before Walt sees it.
If Chloe was threatening to leave, he would have gone ballistic.<eos> This is what they mean by 'don't meet your heroes.'<eos> Hold on a second, you guys...<eos> He came to me for help.<eos> Scott Peterson called the cops, too.<eos> Allright, point taken.<eos> Ok, but Johnny you know the drill...<eos> I can't arrest a guy for a crime he might commit.<eos> Besides, we haven't even found the victim, yet.<eos> Walt, my visions are not an alter-reality, they are reality unless we can change it.
I got to take a shit.<eos> - Put it off.<eos> - Won't be put off.<eos> Besides, it ain't the kind that takes that long.<eos> I'm waiting.<eos> I ain't going back empty-handed.<eos> Fine, fuck it.<eos> Just keep your distance.<eos> Just 'cause I'm looking for a bottle...<eos> I might have misplaced during my drinking days... does not mean if I find a bottle... that I'm going to fucking drink it.
A great man who would have wanted you to sell me that bottle.<eos> He was no great fucking man!<eos> He was a long-haired cocksucker... that could have saved many lives by more drinking... and stopped being so fucking ambitious, and many still above ground... and not scalped by the fucking heathens and their guts spread over the plains.<eos> You're a short nigger, aren't you?<eos> For a fact.<eos> My name's Jane.<eos> I'm the Nigger General Fields.<eos> Want a drink?<eos> I want to buy that bottle, that's what I want.<eos> Well, you ain't buying it, but you can have a fucking drink.
Are we fucking done here?<eos> Because if you people ain't, I fucking am!<eos> If Hearst's geologist ain't pursuing remedies, and Utter ain't... that leaves you speaking for the camp.<eos> Adjourned.<eos> - He wants to talk to you.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Wolcott.<eos> - We transacted our business.<eos> He says he has Hickok's last letter.<eos> If you see him, he'll give it to you.
I was gonna go with sister Greta,but the region is so volatile,<eos> I decided I'd feel much safer with a male companion.<eos> Carlos,you can't do this.<eos> You can't just goto Africa.<eos> Honey,I'm only gonna be gone for two months.<eos> This journey is important for me.<eos> I want to be one of god's soldiers.<eos> And you will be one, Carlos.<eos> After you see the devastation over there, you're never the same.<eos> You see how selfish your old life is and you just want to get rid of everything that reminds you of it.
The Dalek survived.<eos> Maybe some of your people did, too.<eos> I'd know.<eos> In here.<eos> Feels like there's no one. Well, then.<eos> Good thing I'm not going anywhere. Yeah.<eos> We'd better get out.<eos> Van Statten's disappeared.<eos> They're closing down the base.<eos> Goddard says they're gonna fill it full of cement, like it never existed!
All this plastic stuff - who else knows about it?<eos> - No one.<eos> - What, you're on your own?<eos> Who else is there?<eos> I mean, you lot, all you do is eat chips, go to bed and watch telly, while underneath you there's a war going on.<eos> OK.<eos> Start from the beginning.<eos> If we're going with the living plastic<eos> - I don't even believe that - how did you kill it?<eos> The thing controlling it projects life into the arm.
Different house every night I told you.<eos> We thought you were dead. Or you'd run off.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I knew you'd come back for us.<eos> Found that old thing in the junk.<eos> - Thinks he's can write now.<eos> - Writing a letter to me dad.<eos> You don't even know where your dad is.<eos> How you gonna send it?<eos> - I don't know, stick it in an envelope.
The mother, she's the mother.<eos> It's got to be enough information. Figure it out.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - See?<eos> Recognizing the same DNA.<eos> Come on.<eos> Give me a day like this.<eos> Give me this one.<eos> Welcome back!<eos> 20 years to pop music, you're gonna love it.
- Dr. Shepherd?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - I have tim epstein'sc. t. Scans back.<eos> Ah, good.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - It's not great.<eos> Honey, what do you think of this scooter?<eos> Excuse me, i need to takeher blood pressure.<eos> Do you have any questions about the surgery?<eos> Apart from when you'reactually gonna do it?
It says you used to be a nurse here.<eos> - A scrub nurse.<eos> - And you have abdominal mass consistent with pancreatic cancer.<eos> Oh, and you are hoping they're gonna give me a Whipple.<eos> Pancreatic duodectomy.<eos> This hospital sees those one...<eos> Maybe once every six months.<eos> That's why you got here at 4:30, huh?<eos> 4:00.<eos> Grabbed my chart before anybody else could see it.
You're hotshot doctors.<eos> You'll come up with something else.<eos> As long as it doesn't answer to wilbur and say "oink," I don't care what it is.<eos> Your nostrils are flaring.<eos> They are not.<eos> You're into me.<eos> I can tell.<eos> Dr. Small-and-angry was a hot appetizer, but you, doc, are a smorgasbord of lust.<eos> Mr. Duff, you're pressing your luck.<eos> Would you press it for me?
Door would've broken the skin.<eos> This looks like something hard and smooth smashed it.<eos> I want my lawyer.<eos> The brain has a gating mechanism for pain.<eos> Registers the most severe injury and blocks out the others.<eos> Did it work?<eos> Well, my hand hurts like hell.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I feel much better.<eos> Don't splint it.
This isn't about race, unless annoying is a race.<eos> - Is he not getting better?<eos> - He's fine so far.<eos> I'm calling him back in.<eos> I'm getting him on the right stuff.<eos> Relax, Foreman, he already is.<eos> I told him it was the white stuff. I gave him the black stuff.<eos> He was right.<eos> You did exactly what white people do.<eos> You figure we don't need to know the truth or can't understand it, so you just lie to us.
Look.<eos> Look outside.<eos> This is where we go to die.<eos> You will not end here.<eos> Livia, Venice's reigning Venus.<eos> A jealous lover did that.<eos> Who wants her now?<eos> My cage seems bigger than yours, but it's still a cage.<eos> You won't get sympathy from me.<eos> I don't want it.
As long as you're happy.<eos> What?<eos> What do you mean, you can't change her back?<eos> If I could change her, do you think I'd stay a bunny rabbit?<eos> Not that I don't, uh, sympathize, believe me, but, hey, these things happen<eos> Ooh, what do birds your size eat, anyway?<eos> Oh, I was afraid of that.<eos> It's the Chronos stone.<eos> As long as the Titans control Mount Olympus, they have the stone, and we have no powers.<eos> Yeah, we're stuck down here while Hera lives it up on Mount Olympus with the Titans.
The thought of my mother spending the rest of her life, surrounded by a bunch of whining farm animals who think they should be ruling the universe...<eos> And Gabrielle staying the way she is.<eos> These aren't situations we're prepared just to sit back and accept.<eos> So, we've decided to attack Mount Olympus.<eos> Why not?<eos> The Titans took it from you.<eos> We'll just go up there and take it back from them.<eos> You've forgotten one thing.<eos> The Chronos stone.<eos> As long as Hera and the Titans control it, we have no powers.
When I went into the house of pleasure, I didn't stay in the room where they celebrate acceptable modes of loving in the bourgeois style.<eos> I went into the rooms which are kept secret and I leaned and lay on their beds.<eos> I went into the rooms which are kept secret which they consider it shameful even to name.<eos> But there is no such shame for me because then, what sort of poet, and what sort of artist would I be?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Submitting entirely to the service and pleasure of a dominant partner is, I find, a catharsis, in that all responsibility is relinquished,<eos> every move is dictated. No decisions are your own. You exist solely for the service and pleasure of another man.<eos> They weren't satisfied with just one, either. No, they were there all night.<eos> They did it three times each.<eos> Plus, after the first go, they removed the gag and replaced it with what I'm told is a piss gag.
Shouldn't we wait for the Govemor for this?<eos> He's in a mama-thon. That'll go in all night.<eos> My mama worked her whole life for her family...<eos> and never did anything for herself!<eos> and now they' re cutting her up! Cutting pieces out of her!<eos> Why is that happening to her?<eos> I looked over jordan and what did I see<eos> Coming for to carry me home. You know what Richard's favorite song is?<eos> It is the most American goddamn song I can think of.<eos> A southern governor wrote it.
All I ever wanted ... was for my family to be safe.<eos> I would do anything to protect them.<eos> Anything.<eos> Mr. Wei used my mother and sister to persuade me to do three jobs.<eos> The first two were criminals.<eos> It wasn't difficult.<eos> What happened with the third?<eos> I couldn't do it.<eos> If I don't get back to China my family will die.<eos> - What was that all about? - I have a passport. Fix it for me.
"This ball wants to be caught. "<eos> BARNES:<eos> Nobody built this thing looking into their third eye.<eos> They went to a lot of trouble and they didn't do it for nothing.<eos> Something put this thing out there to get picked up and brought back here.<eos> Have you forgotten the Trojan horse?<eos> It could be a trap.<eos> TED:<eos> Don't you think that's a little paranoid?<eos> No, I'm going to put a video camera on this thing and keep an eye on it.
Hurtin' bad today, ain't it?<eos> Nah.<eos> [ Woman ] I don't trust him, you know?<eos> He's mean to you.<eos> He wasn't always mean.<eos> You know, Thomas said he'll give me the money... but he wants to go with me.<eos> You know, people always told me I make the best fry bread in the world.<eos> Maybe it's true.<eos> But I don't make it by myself, you know.<eos> I got the recipe from your grandmother... and she got it from her grandmother.
- I'm 24.<eos> - 24?<eos> Not yet 18 I shouldn't wonder.<eos> No, I'm 24.<eos> It's not fair, everybody always thinks I'm younger, but I'm a man.<eos> Just feel like a boy.<eos> Why did you bury the rabbit?<eos> 'Cause it was dead, boy.<eos> Because I wanted to.<eos> When a creature is killed, I return it to the earth.
- Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> We lost Gruber.<eos> - Gruber's dead.<eos> - Let's get that bomb ready and go home.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - ls there a problem, Colonel?<eos> - The timer, the remote, the whole thing's dead.<eos> What, the bomb is dead?<eos> No, the trigger's dead. lt must've gotten damaged during the rock storm.<eos> So how do we detonate it?
No felines on this floor.<eos> Period!<eos> Where's the pay phone?<eos> In the foyer.<eos> Local calls only.<eos> And where does the little piggy stay at all times?<eos> In the room.<eos> Meow, meow, meow, meow Meow, meow, meow And where does the dear little fella do his necessaries?<eos> In the kitty litter.<eos> Who empties it?
I cannot stay long, but I had to see you.<eos> There is much to say.<eos> Come.<eos> I want to show you something.<eos> I used to play here as a boy.<eos> It was my father's most cherished retreat... before the war.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> I've measured my life by these trees... starting here... all the way up there.<eos> And still they grow.<eos> So much life to live... but I no longer imagine it alone.
He gave his name, the soldier started going through all the lists and then asked, "Whom are you here to see?"<eos> Shostakovich said, "Investigator Zakovsky".<eos> "Well, he can't see you today.<eos> Go home now, they'll inform you when..."<eos> "I returned home and I learned that Zakovsky, himself,"<eos> "had been arrested the day before, on Sunday."<eos> This decided Shostakovich' fate.<eos> When I listen to my father' work, it evokes in me some kind of nervousness.<eos> I can't say that I picture my father, but I can sense his nervousness.<eos> And if anyone ever saw how Father listened to his own music, he listened to it very nervously, covering his mouth with his hands.
Wait. So you live in Montreal?<eos> No, but it's only a two-hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.<eos> I should have thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to Chef Geller.<eos> It will be a lean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.<eos> Enough!<eos> Lean, lean, lean!<eos> Went to the store Sat on Santa's lap<eos> Asked him to bring my friends All kinds of crap<eos> Said all you need is To write them a song<eos> Now you haven't heard it yet So don't try to sing along
You deserve a little relief.<eos> Let go of the anger.<eos> Forgive the man so you can get on with your life.<eos> I won't forgive him.<eos> But I won't lie anymore.<eos> What are you looking for, sir?<eos> I'm looking for a second eyewitness.<eos> You got one.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Together on this day, we offer a prayer for peace and a tribute to those who defend it.
- It is.<eos> - What is your vision, captain?<eos> Twenty-twenty.<eos> Are you familiar with a technique called the deep squeeze?<eos> I am not.<eos> Apparently, if you squeeze your eyes with your lids shut, it momentarily changes the shape of the eyeball.<eos> It gives you one second of twenty-twenty vision, enough time to read an eye chart.<eos> Are you familiar with the technique now that I've described it, captain?<eos> No.<eos> I'm told some senior aviators use it to pass their eye exams.
There's an old saying:<eos> "Once you identify the enemy, you can defeat him."<eos> These are the letters from Petty Officer Carlos to Mrs. Holst.<eos> Read them.<eos> Petty Officer Carlos, you work in the machine shop with Chief Holst, don't you?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> And in fact, you are Chief Holst's leading petty officer, aren't you?<eos> Yes, ma'am, I am.<eos> So you would have access to his tool box during the day, right?<eos> Well, he would secure it when he wasn't around.
Very nice, major.<eos> You too.<eos> I was always a sucker for dress whites.<eos> Well, you know what they say about dress whites and gold wings.<eos> I wanna take Corporal Cordoba with me.<eos> Mac, maybe his weapon jammed and maybe he couldn't get a clear shot off when they grabbed Webb.<eos> And maybe he can't pull the trigger.<eos> You don't believe that or you wouldn't have defended him to Webb.<eos> Webb is an ass, and I don't wanna believe it, but I'm not gonna risk this op betting on it.<eos> No, but you will risk it betting on your crazy plan.
What does that have to do with Jimmy?<eos> They had me in the keep for six days.<eos> Used every trick they could to break me.<eos> I'll spare you the details.<eos> Suffice it to say, it was working.<eos> Until I started to repeat that poem to myself.<eos> Reminded me of you.<eos> And of Ireland.<eos> I didn't realise till now I must have been saying it out loud.<eos> Now that bastard's used it against me.
The earliest recorded disappearance of a United States vessel inside the Bermuda Triangle goes way back to March, 1918.<eos> The USS Cyclops vanished without a trace.<eos> Same thing's been known to happen to superstitious lieutenants.<eos> Tiner just faxed me these newspaper headlines from Admiral Chegwidden's office.<eos> "Navy pilot reappears in Black Sea ten years younger."<eos> "Suicide at 30,000 feet."<eos> "Missing pilot linked to radical militia groups."<eos> Where do they come up with this stuff?<eos> You know, same place they get stories about Bigfoot babies and Elvis sightings.<eos> Washington, however, is taking it very seriously.
Sometimes it is.<eos> Very complicated.<eos> Like right now.<eos> Sarah, you didn't come here to join me, did you?<eos> Uncle Matt, what did you expect Washington to do?<eos> Agree with you on ZNN?<eos> Say that they're a bunch of self-preserving bureaucrats and promise to change?<eos> I'm not naive, Sarah.<eos> Well, then why did you do it?<eos> Because I saw the torch lying there and no one was picking it up.

We provided them with 30 class-4 cloaking devices. It was our understanding they would use them on their ships.<eos> But they could've been mounted on the missiles instead.<eos> You see the problem.<eos> The Maquis had access to tricobalt explosives biogenic weapons, antimatter warheads...<eos> The death toll could be in the millions.<eos> I knew that the Maquis were desperate but I didn't believe that they would resort to something like this.<eos> A sabre bear is most deadly when it is trapped with no hope of escape.<eos> Cardassia's under Dominion protection.<eos> If millions of their citizens are killed by human terrorists they'll demand revenge.<eos> And their Dominion allies will see that they get it.
Confront.<eos> Evade.<eos> The risk is at ten with a purchase of seven and a sale of 14.<eos> Ah, nice move.<eos> But then you always had a knack for getting out of tight spots.<eos> It's a gift.<eos> Mm-hmm. Now, about my tongo wheel...<eos> It's not your tongo wheel.<eos> You gave it to me, remember? I know that I gave it to you, but at the time, I...<eos> I'm not giving it back... and that's final.
You expect us to join the Dominion?<eos> I expect you to behave rationally.<eos> Joining the Dominion will save billions of lives and keep the Federation from fading into the mists of history.<eos> By allowing it to exist under Dominion rule? No, thank you.<eos> I'm afraid you'll like the alternative even less.<eos> Dukat, if you have something to say to me, say it! Then I'll make it simple.<eos> A few days ago, I swore all Cardassia lost would be regained.<eos> That space station you're so fond of... was built by Cardassia.<eos> Funny, I thought it was built by Bajoran slave labor.<eos> Either surrender the station or I'll take it by force. The choice is yours.
Two players, two minds, two strategies each trying to outmaneuver the other... testing the enemy's defenses, advancing, retreating.<eos> We split up. Enter Ops through the main corridor.<eos> I'll go through the Captain's office. Wait for my signal.<eos> ...that, in the game we're playing the stakes are life and death which makes it so much more interesting.<eos> I haven't had this much fun in years.<eos> My heart's pounding.<eos> The blood's racing through my veins.<eos> I feel so alive... and I'd wager, so do you.<eos> It looks like I've captured your last piece, Chief.<eos> If you want it back you're going to have to take it from me.
And that someone... is me.<eos> Nerys!<eos> Father.<eos> Father, can you hear me?<eos> Are you up to it?<eos> I have no choice.<eos> I'm all he's got.<eos> If Ghemor's pain gets too severe, push this.<eos> It'll administer a small dose of triptacedrine.<eos> If you want to replenish the medication be sure and turn this valve disconnect it from here and replace it with a new supply.
-Nice aim.<eos> -It didn't stop them.<eos> We've lost shields.<eos> Firing starboard array.<eos> That one hit the reactant injectors. Shut them down.<eos> They'll leak antimatter.<eos> The magnetic fields are failing. The gas-flow separators are down.<eos> Dump the core.<eos> It's looking more and more like we're in a time loop. The question is:<eos> How do we break it?
We'd never have got involved if not for you.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You see this?<eos> Oh, yeah. I pointed that out to Agent Stonecypher.<eos> There was something in the cave that Scully fell into, an inscription.<eos> - Ad noctum.<eos> - That's Latin.<eos> It means "into darkness."<eos> The Spanish conquistadors used to carve it on the posts that they would lash the natives to, as a warning.
Ah, it's not bad.<eos> Velasca's lightning bolts won't do much damage here.<eos> Xena... Those rocks look like they're about to fall.<eos> I'm counting on it.<eos> And just how long am I supposed to be fighting this woman for?<eos> Get her beneath the rockledge.<eos> I'll do the rest.<eos> And then it's you and me and the ambrosia.<eos> I just had a marvelous idea.<eos> Why don't you and I both eat it?
Xena?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm ok.<eos> I'm ok.<eos> I'm ok.<eos> What's wrong with your eyes?<eos> I'm blind, Gabrielle.<eos> There must be something that we can do, that...<eos> The cure is egyptian senna.<eos> You can get it in Athens, but by the time we get there...
Let's go.<eos> Excuse me if I have mixed feelings at the moment, but you just saved me from an execution to take me back for my execution?<eos> I'm not taking you back.<eos> -Not yet.<eos> -Where are we going?<eos> -Meleager's cave.<eos> -Why?<eos> I wanna see that sword.<eos> There it is, right where I left it.<eos> Xena, if you bring it back, it'll be more evidence against Meleager.
Break the door down!<eos> -Don't you fail me now.<eos> All right, all right, I get the idea I think.<eos> Elona, Thalia...<eos> Finish the preparations on the podium.<eos> Everything must be perfect for the coronation.<eos> I don't remember seeing Velasca when I was here.<eos> Melosa's adopted daughter.<eos> When Velasca's real mother was killed during the first war of the centaurs..., ...Melosa raised her as her own.<eos> When Melosa named Terreis heir to the mask..., ...Velasca challenged it.
-How did you come to blind Polyphemus?<eos> On the way back from Troy, we stopped at Polyphemus' island.<eos> -That doesn't sound wise.<eos> -We needed food.<eos> We were hungry.<eos> Unfortunately, so was that one-eyed monster.<eos> He tried to bite off more than he could chew, I take it.<eos> I definitely wasn't on his diet.<eos> First thing we need to do is get your ship back.<eos> They're keeping it in a harbor not far from here.
- So for now we just go on?<eos> - Right.<eos> - And wait.<eos> - Right again.<eos> Well, you're the skipper.<eos> That's three in a row.<eos> What do you see?<eos> The sun's up, but that's about it.<eos> What about the ground?<eos> I can't see it, it's all clouds down there.
No, I doubt that.<eos> Well, you can tell from the clocks that the power in the cold case must have gone out less than five hours ago.<eos> You don't think it's spoiled, you try it.<eos> It's not spoiled.<eos> It's just tasteless.<eos> Like chewing paper.<eos> But I can understand why you might have thought that it was spoiled.<eos> It was spoiled.<eos> Try your beer, see how that is.<eos> - I don't want it anymore.
You've got a little piece of blade stuck in you and I've gotta pull it out.<eos> - You know that, don't you?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - I'm scared.<eos> - So am I, Dinah.<eos> So am I.<eos> Fold those tablecloths into squares, thick as you can.<eos> And kneel closer to me.<eos> Mr. Warwick, take off your belt.<eos> Now then, I'm gonna grasp the blade and pull it out.
We're on honeymoon.<eos> Yeah, she got pregnant, we had to get married...<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> You're a bad liar.<eos> This is a play we're both in...<eos> - and we would like to invite you.<eos> - You're actors?<eos> Not professional actors.<eos> Part-time actors for fun.<eos> It's a play about a cow and Indians searching for it.
Every couple's been having this conversation forever.<eos> And nobody came up with anything.<eos> I saw a documentary on that.<eos> It's a birth dance.<eos> - A birth dance? - Yeah.<eos> Should I give her some money?<eos> Everything that's interesting costs a little bit of money.<eos> So, a birth dance?<eos> Looked a little bit like a mating dance to me.<eos> No, but really. Women used it when giving birth.

Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.<eos> Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra $100 a week... just to watch the door.<eos> It's routine.<eos> Business as usual... in, out, hello, goodbye.<eos> That's all there is to it.<eos> Just another fat fuck walking out of a casino with a suitcase.<eos> Now, that suitcase was going straight to one place.<eos> right to Kansas City, which was as close... to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go... without getting themselves arrested.<eos> That suitcase was all the bosses ever wanted.<eos> And they wanted it every month.
Nobody out there was expecting a guy like him.<eos> For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fucking Wild West.<eos> I just got a shipment of diamonds from Israel.<eos> NICKY: What the fuck did they expect from me?<eos> I had to earn, didn't I?<eos> - This diamond has flaws in it.<eos> - There's no flaws in it.<eos> Don't tell me. I'm doing this for 25 years.<eos> You better clean your loupe, because there's no flaws in this diamond.<eos> NICKY: When we got local merch... we'd usually send it to Palm Springs, or Arizona, L.A.
What about you ? You still doin' the real estate ?<eos> Well, it's a tough market right now.<eos> I'm still representing some properties.<eos> But Roger's been doing so well, I've been able to back off some. Spend more time with the kids.<eos> Oh, well, wonderful.<eos> That's, uh, yeah-- That's, uh, really wonderful.<eos> Mary, there's, uh, something that you should know. It's the reason I came here.<eos> - Freddy--<eos> - I've got something I wanna tell you.<eos> You made me a promise. I hope you're gonna keep it.
You've got to be kidding.<eos> Forget it, just go to work!<eos> Calm down...<eos> Stop filming!<eos> Go to bed!<eos> That's enough Go on, get out of here!<eos> Later that night I caught dad having a sneak look at the tape. He really enjoyed it.<eos> My memory's not that good.<eos> But I did remember that it was his 60th birthday.<eos> God knows why. But he gets great amusement watching it.
Never see that hare again.<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> Hi, Sara.<eos> Hi, Angus.<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> Where you going?<eos> - To work on the boat.<eos> It's in the barn.<eos> I haven't seen it yet.<eos> - Angus won't let anybody see it.
Those who fight for a cause.<eos> Always the same, the world over!<eos> Stop!<eos> Or it's you we'll try for treason.<eos> Let me tell you why we're fighting this war.<eos> For the pleasure of it.<eos> Because we're dilettantes.<eos> Aficionados of twilight cannonade.<eos> We worship war!<eos> We play at it like a sport!
I mean no harm to Camelot.<eos> You know the law we live by.<eos> And where is it written "Beyond Camelot live lesser people, people too weak to protect themselves, let them die"?<eos> Other people live by other laws, Arthur.<eos> Or is the law of Camelot to rule the entire world?<eos> There are laws that enslave men, and laws that set them free.<eos> Either what we hold to be right and good and true is right and good and true for all mankind under God, or we're just another robber tribe.<eos> Your fine words are talking you out of peace and into war.<eos> There's a peace that's only to be found on the other side of war.<eos> If that battle must come, I will fight it.
Let me thank you in my own way.<eos> They're welcoming you back.<eos> We owe Lady Guinevere's life to one man.<eos> Lancelot.<eos> And I believe he comes to Camelot for a purpose, even though he doesn't know it himself.<eos> And what I'm about to offer this man is already his.<eos> One seat stands empty.<eos> You'd make him a knight, sire?<eos> What I offer is no life of privilege, but a life of service.<eos> And if you want it, it's yours, with all my heart.
I thought you'd regained your senses.<eos> It's "the seagull. "<eos> In "the seagull. " Nina tells her lover treplev,<eos> "no, please don't take me home. "<eos> "I can go by myself. " Then she kisses him.<eos> "Nina had left. "<eos> I thought you'd remembered nina and regained yourself.<eos> A milk stand in front of our theater... they played this "barcarolle of venice. "<eos> Right, tomie?<eos> We used to sing it... in the dressing room we shared.
- A typical belt...<eos> - Q, I'm familiar with that device. Not one with a 75-foot rappelling cord built into the buckle.<eos> Fire, and out shoots a piton, followed by a high-tensile wire designed to support your weight.<eos> I see. And what if I need additional support?<eos> It's tested for one, 007.<eos> Flight 878 to St Petersburg.<eos> X-ray document scanner.<eos> A pen.<eos> This is a class 4 grenade. Three clicks arms the four-second fuse.<eos> Another three disarms it.
Look, its David! How did he get filmed?<eos> I was right next to him, they didnt film me.<eos> I cant see anything. What can I do? Its shit!<eos> How did he get filmed?<eos> Hey, my money, Dixons.<eos> Asterix has got your money.<eos> Get off my jacket, youll make it stink!<eos> I bet youre happy, eh?<eos> Apig lost his gun on the estate.<eos> I hope that whoever finds it goes and burns down Paris for a change.
Can you rest?<eos> Six, seven hours.<eos> - That's it?<eos> - That's it.<eos> Take off your shirt.<eos> What?<eos> Take off your shirt.<eos> My daughter gave it to me.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> Take it off.
It's NAS, right?<eos> Yeah, the black shakes. Like half the people on the planet.<eos> Let me tell you something so you get this straight. It's not my work that got her this way. My work is clean.<eos> Besides, you don't get this shit from amp jobs. That's a myth.<eos> So what does cause it?<eos> The world causes it.<eos> This causes it!<eos> Information overload, all the electronics... poisoning the airwaves!<eos> Technological fucking civilization!<eos> But we still have all this shit, because we can't live without it.
And perhaps, even... hope.<eos> Hope?<eos> In the darkness of the sea?<eos> As I float up towards the surface I almost feel as though I could change into something else.<eos> As though you want to quit Section 9?<eos> Batou, how much of your original body do you have left?<eos> Are you drunk?<eos> Convenient, isn't it?<eos> With the merest thought, the chemical plants inside our bodies could metabolize all the alcohol in our blood in about ten seconds... Allowing us to sit here drinking while on stand-by.<eos> If a technological feat is possible, man will do it.
"It may sound fun for an outsider"<eos> "But not when you're a part of it."<eos> "We somehow avoided each other"<eos> "and didn't talk much, either."<eos> What's new since then?<eos> The letter.<eos> Well, on and off.<eos> What do you mean on and off?<eos> "Dear Fujii Itsuki"<eos> "How did he take it?"
- Thanks, Lenny. Wow!<eos> You're really sweet, Len.<eos> Put it down as a religious contribution.<eos> No, but seriously, you want to know why I liked you right from the start?<eos> - Why?<eos> - 'Cause I'm always attracted to losers. Losers?<eos> You think I'm a loser?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got no confidence. It's sweet. I like that in a man.<eos> I can't stand those johns who come here and throw down a couple of hundred... and whip out a big dick and wave it all over the joint. Oh, I-
Sometimes it's easier to work here than at home.<eos> - Would you mind if I join you? - No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Want some coffee... or tea?<eos> Anything under a buck.<eos> There's something I always remembered about your class, Mr. Holland. You have this very highly developed sense of humor.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I loved your class.<eos> The way you taught.<eos> You love music and you made the kids love it with you.
All right, here we go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> She was right in front of you.<eos> Whas wrong with you?<eos> Are you fucking with me?<eos> Get up there.<eos> - The gun isn't loaded.<eos> - Is not?<eos> Give it to me.
Come run the hidden pine trails ofthe forest<eos> Come taste the sun-sweet berries ofthe earth<eos> Come roll in all the riches all around you<eos> And for once, never wonder what they're worth<eos> The rainstorm and the river are my brothers<eos> The heron and the otter are my friends<eos> And we are all connected to each other<eos> In a circle, in a hoop, that never ends<eos> How high does the sycamore grow?<eos> If you cut it down then you'll never know
You are the only one who comes to us with an open heart.<eos> But your people have murdered my father with their lies!<eos> My name is Pearl. This is the story of my mother, Hester Prynne.<eos> It was the year of our Lord 1666, when she arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony filled with the hope that at last, in this new world would come the freedom to worship without fear of persecution.<eos> My esteemed colleague!<eos> Thy years of toil become thee!<eos> Thy fame preceeds thee, sir.<eos> Governor Bellingham, may I present the Reverend Thomas Cheever.<eos> Welcome, sir. It's a long voyage.<eos> 3 months at sea, will either take away your faith, or harden it to iron.
Ok, you can just throw that anywhere.<eos> You'll have to excuse all this mess. You know, we're still unpacking.<eos> I understand you two were high school sweethearts.<eos> Pretty hokey.<eos> You know something? I knew on our first date that this was the guy I was gonna marry.<eos> Really?<eos> He was the funniest guy I'd ever met.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, it's kind of rare nowadays, you know. I mean, that level of commitment.<eos> Oh, don't worry. I won't wear it to the dinner table.
Looks like a pro.<eos> Maybe.<eos> She caught John Doe's eye.<eos> Yeah, he came and collected it last night.<eos> Last night? Yeah. This man?<eos> Yeah, John Doe.<eos> It's an easy name to remember.<eos> What was this job you did for him?<eos> I've got a picture of it. Hang on. One sweet piece, actually.<eos> I thought he was one of them performance artists, that's what I thought. You know, the sort of guy that pisses in a cup on stage and, then drinks it.
Thank you.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Now, be a good chap and bugger off.<eos> C'est fini.<eos> Daccorod<eos> C'est bien.<eos> Oh... pardon.<eos> Très bien.<eos> Good sword, that.<eos> I'll have it when you're dead.
Ah, no, you see, I thought if I sprinkled some holy water on Major Sharpe when he was unconscious, I might be able to save his soul, despite himself.<eos> You can't have it, Harper.<eos> Have what, Father?<eos> That's a Toledo blade.<eos> Who told you about it?<eos> People say you were a great swordsman in your day, Father.<eos> And that you have the finest collection of blades in all of Spain.<eos> Major Sharpe broke his sword fighting at the fort.<eos> But I thought that if you gave me a fine blade. I could make a great sword out of it.<eos> And when Major Sharpe would see it, it might make him better.
But the Slavers are producing a good grade of poxy these days.<eos> Cost you a handful of dirt-- or maybe that wind chime.<eos> - What are you doin' here ?<eos> - Just waiting.<eos> Take your hand off the sail.<eos> Take it off !<eos> I've seen your boat before.<eos> Haven't seen you.<eos> Took it legal.<eos> Previous owner was dead on the tiller when I found it.
These documents record a transaction which took place in October 1930 between my government and Colin McKenzie.<eos> The agreement was that the money was going to be used for the completion of the revolutionary epic documenting the class struggles of ancient times.<eos> Leading a new army of extras,<eos> Colin returned to the city he had built on the west coast.<eos> But the Soviet's cash had strings attached:<eos> Colin was forced to removed all religious references from his Biblical epic.<eos> The Baptist became a socialist dissident.<eos> Herod became a fascist money lender.<eos> While Salome became a prostitute who abandons her evil ways and learns the skills of collective bargaining.<eos> Colin hated the new version. Loathed it. Despised it.
With one shot left to shoot, Maybelle collapsed.<eos> Maybelle went into early and violent labor.<eos> Nobody could stop the bleeding.<eos> The child, a boy, had no chance. And neither did she.<eos> The both died in Colin's arms.<eos> Colin was torn between guilt and despair.<eos> Guilt over Maybelle and despair because he'd finished the film, but at what a cost.<eos> And besides all that, He was afraid that Palermo Pictures or the Soviets would claim Salome.<eos> He made a very drastic decision:<eos> He took all the film - cans and cans of it - and buried it right after he buried his family.
Inside was a sight to rival the most opulant Egyptian tomb.<eos> Massive statues, exquisite handmade costumes and elaborate props, finely-crafted swords and shields,<eos> Laying undisturbed for 60 years.<eos> This was Colin McKenzie's storeroom for the production of Salome.<eos> But his greatest treasure surpassed all ends.<eos> The crypt held thousands of feet of processed film in hundreds of cans.<eos> Every scene Colin had shot for Salome.<eos> Colin would have wanted Salome to be finished.<eos> He was so afraid that the Palermo people, or the Soviets, would take his precious film and mangle it<eos> that he really wasn't in his right mind when he buried it.
- How did you know?<eos> - I guessed it easily<eos> in "red" you have left room for many possible interpretations<eos> do you have your own interpretation?<eos> No i accept them all that's the way my mind works i gather a lot of interpretations and i say "choose one"<eos> you went to the west for a while what did you miss abroad?<eos> Whether i'm making films abroad or not i feel like a stranger i'm never happy abroad i always want to go home you particularly dislike america why?<eos> What i don't like about america is the pursuit of empty talk combined with a very high degree of self-satisfaction if i ask my american agent how he is he'll say i'm extremely well not okay or well it has to be extremely well<eos> i'm not extremely well i'm not at all well putting it in english i'm so-so do you think western civilization is coming to an end?<eos> We are clearly going through a cultural crisis at the moment it's a phase where we are trying to distinguish values of life people are looking for a solution and perhaps they will find it but the radicality of the search
You find me all alone this morning, Mr Darcy.<eos> I beg your pardon.<eos> I would not wish to intrude upon your privacy.<eos> I was just writing a letter to my sister Jane in London.<eos> Mr Bingley and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?<eos> Perfectly so, I thank you.<eos> I understand Mr Bingley has not much idea for ever returning to Netherfield?<eos> It is probable that he may spend little time there in the future.<eos> If so, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he give up the place.<eos> I should not be surprised if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers.
I think there's little chance of that, mamma. Oh, well.<eos> Just as he chooses.<eos> No one wants him to come!<eos> I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill!<eos> If I was her, I would not have put up with it.<eos> My comfort is, she will die of a broken heart, and then he'll be sorry for what he's done!<eos> So, the Collinses live quite comfortable, do they?<eos> I only hope it will last.<eos> And I suppose they talk about having this house too when your father is dead?<eos> They look on it as quite their own, I dare say?
I can offer no justification.<eos> It was an arrogant presumption, based on a failure to recognise your true feelings and Miss Bennet's.<eos> I should never have interfered.<eos> It was wrong of me, Bingley, and I apologise.<eos> - You admit that you were in the wrong?<eos> - Utterly and completely.<eos> Then... I have you blessing?<eos> Do you need my blessing?<eos> No.<eos> But I should like to know I have it all the same.
- Hello there, Anni.<eos> Hello.<eos> Do come on in.<eos> Put your things there.<eos> - Did you find it all right? - Oh, yes.<eos> No problem.<eos> Can I take your jacket?<eos> Your colleague from the Youth Office had problems finding it.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> I'm so pleased you wore it today.
Let's explore the options for head coach John Thompson.<eos> He can take it down low, a high-percentage play.<eos> Maybe he'll get to the free-throw line and send it into overtime.<eos> But Kyle Watson's had the hot hand for the second half.<eos> Will he go to Watson and bomb away for the outside?<eos> Nine seconds left.<eos> Watson the lead guard for the Hoyas.<eos> Who will be the man to get it?<eos> Watson with the ball.<eos> Gives it up.
The business prospered, and I built bigger and better ones.<eos> -What do you think?<eos> -Fantastic!<eos> By then I knew there was no stopping me.<eos> Well?<eos> Now do you see what I invested in?<eos> -Water!<eos> -That's right. No one ever thought of it.<eos> -But surely water belongs to everyone.<eos> -It belongs to whoever has it.
I wish it would never expire.<eos> It'd save me loads of work.<eos> You like expired goods?<eos> Have a whole case on the house.<eos> When did everything start having an expiration date?<eos> Swordfish expires. Meat sauce expires. Even plastic wrap expires.<eos> I'm starting to wonder: is there anything in this world that doesn't?<eos> Buddy, how about some swordfish?<eos> It's expired. I don't want it.<eos> You don't want it?
Last night some girl -<eos> Can you turn that music down a bit?<eos> A girl waited around a long time for you last night.<eos> She left a letter for you.<eos> Really?<eos> A stewardess.<eos> You wanna read it?<eos> - After my coffee.<eos> Hey, your letter!<eos> Keep it for me. I'll get it next time.
- How dare you lecture me!<eos> - How dare you, sir!<eos> How dare you come here and bark at me like some little junkyard dog!<eos> I am the President of the United States!<eos> It gives me no pleasure to do it, sir.<eos> As acting Deputy Director of intelligence, it is my duty to report this matter to the Senate Oversight Committee.<eos> - You're not going to do that.<eos> You've got yourself a chip in the big game now.<eos> You're going to save that for a time when your own ass is on the line.<eos> And then you're going to pull it out.
Don't you touch that damn door!<eos> Sorry, kid .<eos> You had to be a cute ass.<eos> Had to stick your dirty little nose in my business, didn't you?<eos> So we should die together.<eos> Just you and me.<eos> Off to la-la land .<eos> Sweet dreams.<eos> Want the gun?<eos> -Why you looking at it?
Excellent news.<eos> We' re out of here.<eos> We'll call you.<eos> Move out, Walter.<eos> Go, Wally!<eos> Are we still going north?<eos> I don't know .<eos> Check my compass.<eos> -Take it off.<eos> -No, I never take it off.
I've used it in a lot of places.<eos> It's background here. Stuff like that.<eos> All this back here. In my story in here, I used it also.<eos> This whole background, all this stuff, I put it right over here.<eos> You can't make up this crap.<eos> You know, it's too complicated.<eos> On this cover here, I used a bunch of photos to take that stuff.<eos> In the real world, this stuff is not created to be visually pleasing.<eos> It's just accumulation of the modern industrial world.<eos> People don't even notice. They block it out.
He's saying, "Well, I got home an hour ago. " Yeah, it's Foont.<eos> Yeah, he's feeling guilty.<eos> Foont wants to bring her back over.<eos> He wants to get rid of her. He can't handle it.<eos> So Mr. Natural says, "Okay, bring her over. "<eos> He says, "Make sure you put the head back on before you take her outside. "<eos> So he goes to get the head, and he realizes it's been smashed.<eos> He doesn't know what to do.<eos> Actually, a lot of these poses in these panels... I took from freeze-framing the Fly Girls on In Living Color.<eos> So he ties up a T-shirt into a ball and puts it on top of the cap. Then he puts a hat on.
Not everything's for everybody, you know.<eos> Have you gotten criticism about the way you sometimes draw black people?<eos> Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. But it all came from white liberals.<eos> Here's an example of the kind of thing I'm talking about in "Ooga Booga. "<eos> It's actually a mockery of black people.<eos> It's sort of a vomiting up of Crumb's own racism... his own deepest, um, hostilities and fears.<eos> Of course, if you have a knee-jerk reaction, and that's as far as you get... then you say he's a racist.<eos> But once you start thinking about how he's toying with that... and how he's shoving it in your face... you start to think about your attitudes... and you start to think about the stereotypes - how they came about. You know, it gets very complicated.<eos> All that stuff I did in the late '60s...<eos> I didn't really know what it was about when I did it.
Susan got the Disneyland tickets for you.<eos> The E-tickets?<eos> You're comped for all the rides and at the hotel they'll upgrade you.<eos> Magnificent. I can't wait to tell my wife.<eos> She said you were full of shit.<eos> You know how women are.<eos> Yes, I sure do.<eos> I miss your face.<eos> Talk to Arthur.<eos> He sees it enough on the DVL. I'm always--
You will be my slave of love.<eos> My gosh, Bela! How do you do that?<eos> You must be double-jointed.<eos> And you must be Hungarian.<eos> Vampira, look at me.<eos> Look into my eyes.<eos> You're watching our Halloween movie, White Zombie, starring Bela Lugosi, John Harron, Madge Bellamy and a bunch of other people I've never heard of.<eos> I'm very tired.<eos> I need to take my medicine.<eos> - Do you want me to get it for you?
He's really good.<eos> Forrest, you go.<eos> We fish a lot.<eos> And every night, we read a book.<eos> He's so smart, Jenny.<eos> You' d be so proud of him.<eos> I am.<eos> He wrote you a letter.<eos> And he says I can't read it.<eos> I'm not supposed to, so I'll just leave it here for you.
The kids, the nuns.<eos> I just thank God she wasn't in one of those little sports cars like your girlfriend's.<eos> - They're death-traps.<eos> - What?<eos> His girlfriend drives a Chrysler.<eos> Big blue one.<eos> She's not my girlfriend!<eos> She's an instructor at the gym.<eos> I met...<eos> I left my gym bag at the gym and she was bringing it back to me.
"...no more snacks during the night...<eos> "...no more checking our weapons outside your bedroom door."<eos> You said that?<eos> In so many words.<eos> What I basically said was, "From now on, we go by the book."<eos> - And she stood for this?<eos> - She didn't say a thing.<eos> Yeah, she tells me to go find her ball.<eos> I said, "I'm not a caddie, I'm a secret service agent.<eos> - "You want that ball, go find it yourself."
'Cause I walked in the door and that's the first thing I see on the sign - "No openings."<eos> It ain't much better than a person without a college degree can get.<eos> So I feel like I'll be here for quite a while.<eos> What you lookin' at?<eos> I don't believe people when they be sayin; "Wow, school's hard.!<eos> The work weren't hard for me.<eos> If I gotta do, like, a report or somethin;.. I don't like none of the topics, so I'll just pick somethin' that's simple.<eos> So, what's the topic of your paper?<eos> The life cycle of the butterfly.<eos> - Gonna read it for us? - Mm-mmm.
does there?<eos> What if I could give it back to you?<eos> Pluck out the pain and give you another life?<eos> One you could never imagine.<eos> And it would be...for all time.<eos> And sickness and death could never touch you again.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> I'm going to give you the choice I never had.<eos> That morning, I was not yet a vampire and I saw my last sunrise.<eos> I remember it completely and yet I can't recall any sunrise before it.
Cattle prices continue to fall. The winter seems never-ending.<eos> Why don't you write?<eos> Are you never coming back, and afraid to tell me?<eos> Alfred continues to do well.<eos> His business has expanded to Chicago and Washington.<eos> He wants to send Isabel Two to school, but she won't leave.<eos> I think she, too, is waiting for you.<eos> I have nowhere to send this letter.<eos> And I have no reason to believe you wish to receive it.<eos> I write it only for myself.
- OK, now you let him go!<eos> - I thought you were gonna be cool.<eos> When motherfuckers get scared, motherfuckers accidentally get shot.<eos> Just know, you hurt him, you die.<eos> Well, that seems to be the situation, but I don't want that.<eos> And you don't want that. And Ringo here definitely doesn't want that. So let's see what we can do.<eos> Now, here's the situation.<eos> Normally your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken, but you pulled this while I'm in a transitional period, and I don't wanna kill you.<eos> But I can't give you this case, cos it don't belong to me.<eos> Besides, I been through too much shit over this case this morning to just hand it over to your dumb ass.
No offense, sweetie, but you don't have... any experience on a newspaper.<eos> You're TV. Well, I'm trying to make my transition to print journalism.<eos> Why? Well, newspapers are the last watchdogs... of our... our government.<eos> They enforce the checks and balances.<eos> And one half-hour of TV only adds up to...<eos> All right. Define irony.<eos> Irony.<eos> Uh... Irony.<eos> It's a noun. It's when something is... ironic.<eos> It's, uh... Well, I can't really define irony... but I know it when I see it!
Wait!<eos> I hope for your sake you were initiating a mating ritual.<eos> You got careless.<eos> The Romulans came looking for their trilithium.<eos> Impossible.<eos> We left no survivors on their outpost.<eos> If the Enterprise hadn't intervened, they'd have found it at the observatory.<eos> They didn't find it! And now we have a weapon of unlimited power.<eos> No, Lursa.<eos> I have the weapon, and if you want me to give it to you, - - I would advise you to be a little more careful in the future.
Red alert!<eos> I don't believe him.<eos> This has to be another one of Q's games.<eos> He's probably laughing at us now, watching us jump through his hoops.<eos> Normally, I'd agree.<eos> But this time, I feel that it is different.<eos> There was a deadly earnestness about him.<eos> I think he's serious. Which means, in some fashion, I am going to be the cause of the destruction of humanity.<eos> Didn't Q say you already had caused it?<eos> And that you were causing it now?
We could use their help right now.<eos> - For what?<eos> To do what?<eos> Why don't you just tell 'em?<eos> Why don't you tell 'em about the bomb?<eos> What's he talking about?<eos> My orders were simple.<eos> If I found any possible danger, blow up the Stargate.<eos> Well, I found some.<eos> Well, your bomb is his now, tomorrow he's sending it to Earth, along with a shipment of that mineral they mine here.
What is it?<eos> What's your name?<eos> Tete.<eos> Here, it's for you.<eos> - It's lovely.<eos> - His name is Wally.<eos> So cute.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - He drinks with a "porron".<eos> She offered me her breast and I touched it.
He does. More than ever.<eos> So?<eos> He changed his mind?<eos> No. It's me.<eos> Does it make a difference?<eos> No... - But it's you.<eos> - How?<eos> These days you can buy anything.<eos> The envelope is in my pocket.<eos> Take it afterwards.
I grabbed his things. These are his favourite pyjamas here. Honey, I've got to go.<eos> Remember what I said.<eos> We'll take care of everything.<eos> Don't lose it now!<eos> Seismologists at Cal Tech... have counted over 300 temblors so far.<eos> Though most were too faint for us to feel... seven have shaken our community in the last few weeks... and now scientists are speculating... there might be an unknown fault running beneath Los Angeles... a fault that could...<eos> Hi. You've reached the Englund residence. We're out of town.<eos> You can leave a message if you wish, but... we'll be gone for some time.<eos> I wish I could tell you where the script was going. The fact is I don't know.<eos> I dream a scene at night, I write it down in the morning.
Where is daddy?<eos> In the yard, playing chess.<eos> Kiss me or I'll not let you go.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Here is my little darling.<eos> Good morning, little lady.<eos> Aleksi!<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> Who has taught you this song?<eos> I've heard the choristers learn it.
People always ask me: why must the garlic be Bulgarian?<eos> Bulgaria...<eos> Bulgaria is a country.<eos> Speaking of Bulgaria, one thing that has always seemed remarkable to me is that in Bulgaria the women are called for example, Nadiechda, Svoboda, Dobrinka and the capital is called Sofia!<eos> Its called Sofia...<eos> Well, it was the Bulgarians idea, I had nothing to do with it, yes, no, no, in this case I am a simple reproducer, a simple repeater, shall we say...<eos> This brings to mind the Duchess Sofia von Stauben, selfless protector and lover of Mastropieros; I mean, so as not to lose the thread, right?<eos> ; yes, because there are many who cant see the forest for the trees speaking of trees; Sofia von Stauben belonged to the Prussian branch of the von Staubens, and it was she who commissioned Mastropiero... to pen the ballad "To the Beach with Wendy," which he was getting ready to compose that time he thought he saw the form of a strange animal swaying in the window of the study and he went and called the butler.<eos> Heh, heh... regarding Mastropieros butler theres a very interesting story.<eos> What, you know it already?
In the unlikely event that the dragon falls into someone's hands, ...it will be nothing but an ordinary figurine without this scroll.<eos> You're alive!<eos> I've got you now, Goemon.<eos> Are you a descendant of the Hattori?<eos> Indeed I am.<eos> Tsume no Gensai.<eos> Descended from the same blood as you. Which makes us stepbrothers.<eos> It is not the Zantetsuken you are after. Your real target is...<eos> You know what it is. I would like to have that scroll in your kimono.<eos> I will not hand it over!
All the money and wealth the world has to offer will come to you?<eos> Tell me, why is a dragon like that so amazing?<eos> You know about Goemon's Zantetsuken, don't you?<eos> What would you do if you had a metal that surpassed even the Zantetsuken?<eos> Surpasses the Zantetsuken?<eos> This dragon is both lighter and stronger than the Zantetsuken.<eos> This dragon?<eos> The master craftsman who made the Zantetsuken and who was Goemon's ancestor gave birth to an even better sword.<eos> But because it was so sharp and powerful, he sealed away the process for creating the alloy it was made of.<eos> He wrote down the process for making that alloy onto a plate, turned it into a dragon figurine, ...and hid it deep within the Iga Ninja House.
In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.<eos> -Did you make your money?<eos> -Not even close. Forget Vail.<eos> Forget seeing my family.<eos> Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.<eos> Here's your mail.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You can just put it on the table.<eos> Here's your mail!<eos> Thanks. You can just put it on the table!
- We're shushing because we're trying to hear something.<eos> - What?<eos> - Uh, don't you hear that?<eos> - See?<eos> - Would you like some gum?<eos> - Oh. Is it sugarless?<eos> - Uh, sorry, it's not.<eos> - Then, no, thanks.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it.
Remember, I lived with you?<eos> You were a little, you know....<eos> That is so unfair!<eos> When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.<eos> Okay, so I'm responsible.<eos> I'm organized.<eos> But, hey, I can be a kook!<eos> All right, you madcap gal!<eos> Try to imagine this.<eos> The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Hi, is...<eos> She's upstairs, playing that same mushy upsetting song... like, fifty times in a row.<eos> Great, well, here's her stupid backpack.<eos> You would not believe what was in it.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Forget I said that. Not to mention the fact that she still has my bicycle.<eos> She doesn't have it.<eos> She left it at Jordan Catalano's.<eos> What?<eos> What do you think, that I don't like need my own bike... and you can just leave it all over town?
You're trying to keep them off-balance, keep them guessing.<eos> Why?<eos> The Maquis have heard rumours about shifting loyalties in the Cardassian government.<eos> Certain hardline elements were unsatisfied with the Federation Treaty and are looking for a way to scrap it.<eos> We found an intelligence report outlining a suspected military build-up in the Orias system.<eos> A build-up that even the Central Command is unaware of.<eos> You've done all this to attack a secret base that may or may not exist?<eos> I'm convinced that it does.<eos> They're building an invasion fleet.<eos> If we let them finish it, these renegade Cardassians will use it.
Someone has to pay the price.<eos> Me.<eos> The deal is you'll be tried and convicted in a Cardassian court, then sentenced to spend the rest of your life in the Lazon ll labour camp.<eos> No death sentence?<eos> That must have taken some doing.<eos> Some.<eos> Give me a moment.<eos> There's no reason for you to continue.<eos> They're offering you a way out.<eos> Refusing it would mean you want to die.
Let's find out for sure.<eos> Send a probe into the sun's corona to scan the core.<eos> It'll take a minute to modify its shield configuration.<eos> How do modulated gamma bursts cause a dimensional shift?<eos> Do you always do that when you're concentrating?<eos> - Do what?<eos> - Bite your lower lip.<eos> - l guess I do.<eos> - The probe is ready, Commander.<eos> Target it to these coordinates and launch.
About 300%.<eos> By tomorrow, the station will be gone.<eos> Let's beam them into space and look for a solution.<eos> We have a solution but it's getting harder.<eos> It's us or them. We have to destroy it.<eos> You can't just wipe out a civilization.<eos> We'd be committing mass murder.<eos> It's like stepping on ants, Odo.<eos> I don't step on ants, Major.<eos> Not understanding a life-form doesn't mean we can destroy it.
- You've agreed?<eos> The Bajoran provisional government has agreed to it.<eos> A Cardassian transport will deliver the Bajoran prisoners within five hours.<eos> - You don't know what they'll do!<eos> - We're the ones they're after.<eos> Let Professor Lang go.<eos> The provisional government has ordered you all to be turned over.<eos> I'm fighting this every way I can.<eos> I'm not ready to give up.<eos> But this is a Bajoran station, and I have to abide by their decision, no matter how much I disagree with it.
You were well paid.<eos> Not well enough. I know the Cardassians can't be trusted.<eos> They'd love to destroy the Federation colonies in the Demilitarised Zone.<eos> - Then you agree with our position? - No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because your position is illogical.<eos> Do you propose to lecture me on logic?<eos> I don't want to, but you leave me no choice.<eos> It all comes down to the third Rule of Acquisition.<eos> - You don't know it?
Yes.<eos> That was Miranda, alright.<eos> She'd heard about all the children orphaned on Camor, from the Cardassian war.<eos> I see.<eos> I was only ten when we went there.<eos> I remember her telling me all about the boys and girls that didn't have anyone to care for them.<eos> So she got this big house. Practically falling apart.<eos> Then she started rounding up children.<eos> Eventually, there were over 40 of us.<eos> She called it a school.
My intravascular pressure is going through the roof.<eos> It is elevated. You've also got heightened electrophoretic activity.<eos> Electrophoretic activity?<eos> Is it serious?<eos> Well, based on this, I'd say you've got 70, maybe 80 years.<eos> 80 years?<eos> Yes, Reg.<eos> What you've got is a mild case of Urodelean flu.<eos> It's nothing serious.<eos> Most humans have an immunity to it. But the T-cell in your DNA that would normally fight it is dormant.
I've found it, Captain.<eos> This is the only place where Korgano's moon symbol appears by itself, not linked with Masaka's.<eos> I want you to access the transformation program.<eos> When you're ready, input the symbol.<eos> - Isn't that risky?<eos> - What will the result be?<eos> The symbol might generate Korgano's temple or Korgano himself.<eos> In one sense, Korgano is Masaka's nemesis.<eos> Whatever this symbol represents, it could be a means to control her.<eos> If anyone has a better idea, I will entertain it.
- Mulder, we should have it analyzed.<eos> - You're determined not to believe him!<eos> You're too determined to believe him!<eos> I am determined to follow a lead that may prove the existence of extraterrestrial biological entities.<eos> - Listen...<eos> - No!<eos> Will you just hear me? !<eos> I have never met anyone so passionate and dedicated to a belief as you.<eos> It's so intense that sometimes it's blinding.<eos> But there are others who are watching you, who know what I know, and, whereas I can respect and admire your passion, they will use it against you.
Get away from him.<eos> Get back.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Ricky.<eos> Son!<eos> No.<eos> No. No!<eos> His name is Gerd Thomas.<eos> He's owned the building for 21 years.<eos> He used to run a daycare center out of it.
Overwhelmed with joy to be able to serve you, to answer your calls.<eos> Mrs. Lorenza from La Colonia los Jardines de la Luz sends warmest regards to all the family and wishes happy times for everyone.<eos> Mrs. Lupita Raquel sends us a wish of glory to God in heaven and peace on earth for the people of goodwill.<eos> - How beautiful...<eos> - We're dead...<eos> Happy New Year.<eos> Tell me where it is or my uncle won't leave me alone.<eos> What is it exactly...<eos> this thing?<eos> What the fuck does the old man want it for?
Grab hold of me.<eos> Pull yourself!<eos> Go over me!<eos> So what do you think?<eos> You want to try the other way?<eos> - You ready, Roberto?<eos> - You see that line?<eos> - That's a road.<eos> - I can't see anything.<eos> Do you see it, Tintin?
Did you get Londo?<eos> He was supposed to meet me right here.<eos> The others are in the reception area.<eos> Station alert.<eos> Notify security.<eos> Get the doors open.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Be careful, Michael that's an environment suit.<eos> He can't take our atmosphere.<eos> Open it here and the air will kill him.
According to the autopsy of Varner's body, he's been dead for nearly 36 hours.<eos> Meaning you and Garibaldi saw a dead man at the casino.<eos> That's...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Stop, you'll kill...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Ben, the Ambassador?<eos> I think I got to him in time.<eos> Now, will somebody please tell me what the hell is going on around here?<eos> Commander, we've neutralized the intruder vessel and we're bringing it in.
- Yeah, so what?<eos> Are you joking?<eos> I mean...<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Let's, let's just take a walk.<eos> There's no one around.<eos> No, I know it's beautiful, but I'm not leaving the camera here.<eos> - I'll have to carry it around.<eos> - Who's going to take it?
I appreciate your coming, Mr McDeere. I'll call you Mitch if I may.<eos> My name is Denton Voyles.<eos> I'm with the Department of Justice.<eos> What happened to Eddie Lomax?<eos> We've been investigating Bendini, Lambert Locke for four years.<eos> No lawyer has ever left your law firm alive.<eos> Two tried to leave - they were killed.<eos> Two were about to try - you know what happened.<eos> We have reason to believe that your house is bugged... your phones are tapped, and your office is wired. They may have followed you to Washington as we speak.<eos> Are you saying that my life... Your life as you know it is over.
I agree... to carry your hardware... but not for long.<eos> If the stuff explodes... then good-bye, boat!<eos> Who'll pay for that? - It's my loss!<eos> - You're leaving?<eos> You know... work, home, family.<eos> - Stay well.<eos> Good luck.<eos> You again, Speedy Gonzalez?<eos> You know the old prophesy?<eos> "In the year of hate... when all that is foreign is despised... by the full September moon... dark riders will invade the harbor... take the ship with all the hands on board... and sail it into hell."
No, because if we really had the body, why tell him?<eos> Why not go straight to the police?<eos> If you tell the cops, you can't shake him down.<eos> She's wicked.<eos> Look how this works out.<eos> You go to the law, what do you gain?<eos> They put him in jail.<eos> What have you got?<eos> You haven't got anything.<eos> But if he wants the evidence, and has to pay for it, now he's nervous, right?
We could use his theater.<eos> He's a playwright.<eos> This is so perfect.<eos> Your theater is empty all the time, anyhow.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's great.<eos> What are we talking about here?<eos> We get her in for a fake audition, and you write some lines that don't mean anything and she does them, and we tape-record it.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> And then we edit the tape recording up and we make one end of a phone call and play it to Mr. House.
Ok, let's go.<eos> And don't, please, make any remark about the way i'm dressed- i'm saying nothing.<eos> Or my apartment or anything.<eos> You want to live in shit, that's your business.<eos> It's the same car, before you make any remarks.<eos> I'm not saying a word.<eos> It had a paint job, which was a trade-off.<eos> I installed this guy's alarm system.<eos> Gus, you love this car more than life itself.<eos> I never believed you sold it.
Alright, I'll buy cakes.<eos> Good-bye, madam.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Mui, you can eat now.<eos> Lam, eat up, dear.<eos> Enjoy the meal, mum.<eos> Here's your bowl. Eat.<eos> There's no soup left.<eos> What a nuisance.<eos> Upstairs or downstairs, we spread it out and have none left.
Could be a clue to who killed him.<eos> Are you saying Curtis was killed because he knew something about the assassinations?<eos> That's exactly what I'm saying.<eos> Do you think there may be papers in the safe- deposit box that may reveal what Curtis knew about the assassinations?<eos> There could be.<eos> My child's lost one parent.<eos> I can't let her lose another.<eos> I'll check it for you.<eos> No one has to know you have the key.<eos> They will only give it to his wife.
Andy, don't move now.<eos> It's not going through.<eos> We may have to flush it out again.<eos> The vein's closed. - We'd better call Barbara.<eos> - Nurse Ratchett?<eos> Tell her to come over.<eos> There's so much stuff I need to get done.<eos> Can't we just skip treatment for tonight?<eos> No, we are not skipping this treatment.<eos> It's my arm and my treatment, and I say skip it.
To tell you the whole truth, mother says most people speak rubbish and it's not worth the listen.<eos> Well, that is a strong opinion.<eos> Aye.<eos> It's unholy.<eos> What do they say?<eos> Are they selling? Offer blankets for half the land.<eos> Twelve.<eos> Offer the guns, Baines.<eos> What do they want the land for?<eos> They don't cultivate it, they don't burn it back.
But if they don't want Japan to buy it, don't sell it.<eos> - I will assist you in whatever way I can.<eos> - I'm very grateful.<eos> Tomorrow at noon for golf?<eos> Tomorrow at noon.<eos> I will try to make it harder for you to let me win.<eos> Senator.<eos> Are you comfortable with this new position?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Because I don't view it as a new position.
- I will assist you in whatever way I can.<eos> - I'm very grateful.<eos> Tomorrow at noon for golf?<eos> Tomorrow at noon.<eos> I will try to make it harder for you to let me win.<eos> Senator.<eos> Are you comfortable with this new position?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Because I don't view it as a new position.<eos> I view it as a modification...
There's one for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And one for you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> - John, here's some more faxes.<eos> - Ah, more support!<eos> Always welcome.<eos> Mind if I give you some advice?<eos> No.<eos> If a battle can't be won,... .. don't fight it.
Thank you.<eos> And one for you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> - John, here's some more faxes.<eos> - Ah, more support!<eos> Always welcome.<eos> Mind if I give you some advice?<eos> No.<eos> If a battle can't be won,... .. don't fight it.<eos> If a battle can't be won, don't fight it?
Oh, it's not so bad.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> Oh, my dear, beloved Sheriff of Rottingham!<eos> You've been run through!<eos> How do you feel?<eos> I'm dying, you fool!<eos> -You don't have to die!<eos> -l don't?<eos> I've got this magic pill that could save your life.<eos> And I'll give it to you if you promise to marry me and be mine forever!
We might as well know where we are.<eos> You never can really tell what's going on between people, can you?<eos> People jump to conclusions.<eos> Sometimes it makes me quite angry the way people aren't allowed to be...<eos> - What?<eos> - You know, just friends.<eos> What, like us, you mean.<eos> Like us.<eos> I don't mean to say that friendship is a small thing.<eos> As a matter of fact, I rate it as one of this life's most precious gifts.
know now hard it must be<eos> Sorry.<eos> Of course I don't...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm just trying to think of some practical advice after I've gone.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Get Patrick Harper on your side.<eos> Is that an order, sir?<eos> I want you to have my sword.<eos> Maybe if the men see you carry it...
And I had this sense of self-hatred, of fear.<eos> And this kid's father, the bravery of his films, gave me a direction, confidence.<eos> Simple as that.<eos> We're always paying off debts.<eos> Then my beeper went off - a patient in her tenth month.<eos> Her water finally broke.<eos> I gave the kid my keys.<eos> - Number 121. - Thank you.<eos> - Doug told me all about your brownstone. - Is that right?<eos> How you got it at a great price because there'd been a murder in it, and people thought it had a curse.
I went right to the top in a rickety old elevator and watched the men clean it.<eos> You've been to the top of the Sistine Chapel?<eos> Stood right under the hand of God touching the hand of man. Batti! Batti!<eos> Oh! One of the workmen said "Hit it!<eos> Hit it!<eos> It's only a fresco."<eos> Hit! So I did.<eos> I slapped God's hand.<eos> You... you slapped God's hand?<eos> Do you know what they clean it with?
Come on, where is he now?<eos> Look at you!<eos> You look like a sack of bones.<eos> Kind of hard to get Esther dumplings where I've been.<eos> Oh, Lord, Mr. Jack.<eos> You're home, you're home!<eos> Everybody here is missing somebody.<eos> Both Ezzel boys and their daddy got killed and everybody that ain't dead is leaving.<eos> This town finished, Mr. Jack.<eos> Ain't nothing left here but hard ground and nobody to work it.
You ever get a chance to buy that land you've been working?<eos> Hell, no!<eos> Hell, no. This is it.<eos> This is your chance, boy.<eos> Take it!<eos> What about y'all?<eos> You want in?<eos> I'm not helping niggers.<eos> You're saying that those who work the land ... I can't hear you!<eos> You're saying those who work the land get to buy it?
What were you watching?<eos> When?<eos> When you were inside.<eos> On TV. That wasn't "TV".<eos> It was a strange film.<eos> Silvana Mangano was first a nun and then she danced...<eos> - Well, I guess it also happens to you...<eos> - Never. - You never watch television.<eos> - Never.<eos> Haven't watched it for thirty years.
Look why don't you try and sleep, now?<eos> The door is locked and I'll stay with you tonight.<eos> Thank you...<eos> If you just came in to look at that it'll cost ya<eos> Sorry I just wanted to know, the boat which just left, was it going to the mainland..<eos> I need to contact the mainand. Can you help?<eos> Do you have a telephone?<eos> I don't suppose there's any chance I could post a letter?<eos> Well... put it in here..<eos> ... they haven't taken it away in more than a month.. ... but you can always hope.
I already asked Mr. Daumer.<eos> Yes, Mr. Daumer is an educated man. I will never learn as much as him.<eos> He told me about the Sahara Desert...<eos> ... andI can'tgetitoutofmyhead !<eos> Katy, have you been to the Sahara Desert?<eos> I'm just a housekeeper, I don't go journeying so much.<eos> I was in Erlangen once, but it's a long way from there to the desert!<eos> I know a story about the desert, but only the beginning.<eos> Yes, Mr. Daumer told me about it. He said you couldn't get past the beginning of your story...<eos> ... andthatyoushouldwait to tell it until you know the end...
We'll just have to find you a better number. Won't we, George?<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> - No, no, thank you, honey.<eos> We'll give that song to one of the girls.<eos> Now all you have to do is to write our star a new number.<eos> - Mr. White, about these bills...<eos> - Schwarz, you're fired.<eos> Can I have that in writing?<eos> It's a crying shame, that was a great song.<eos> Thanks, but no song is great until someone sings it.
I can give you one quarter-grain tablet.<eos> That's all I have in the house."<eos> "But, Doctor - a quarter G..."<eos> The doctor stopped him.<eos> "If your condition is legitimate, you will not need more."<eos> "If it isn't, I don't want anything to do with you.<eos> Wait right here."<eos> The doctor weaved down the hall, leaving a wake of alcoholic breath.<eos> He came back and dropped a tablet into Danny's hand.<eos> Danny wrapped the tablet in a piece of paper and tucked it away.
- And you believed it?<eos> - Yes, I did!<eos> I think you were wise.<eos> But your allowance is not enough to cover your expenses.<eos> Wardrobe, travel... other things.<eos> Bruce Bullerby wants to help you.<eos> That little shit?<eos> He wants to help me? !<eos> You misjudge him.<eos> Look, he'll buy your story, for the sake of history, and bury it for the period of your lifetime.
"Mooore, Faaather, mooore, more Goat Boy, Faather."<eos> "We are your goat children.<eos> We too lay in the forest waiting for young virgins to come."<eos> But you guys are weird, get this:<eos> I'm walking down through the West End one day, right, and this bus-load of tourists from Iowa gets off the bus.<eos> Big cow people, right?<eos> Bump into me and I go flying into this adult bookstore.<eos> And my hands were in my pockets and I took em out and money flew out of my hands and wafted down onto the cash register and this guy hands me a magazine.<eos> How embarrassing.<eos> I go home immediately to the hotel and throw it away. Toward the garbage, it breaks open, face up on the bed.
To make marijuana against the law, is like saying God made a mistake.<eos> You know what I mean, it's like God on the seventh day looked down on his creation:<eos> "There it is, my creation, perfect and holy in all ways.<eos> Now, I can rest."<eos> "Oh my me."<eos> "I left fucking pot everywhere."<eos> "I should never have smoked that joint on the third day... ...shit."<eos> "That was the day I created possums.<eos> Still gives me a chuckle."<eos> "If I leave pot everywhere that's gonna give humans the impression they're supposed to...'use' it."
The Gamma Quadrant is 70,000 light years from Bajor.<eos> It would take our fastest starship 67 years to get here.<eos> I'm glad I got the chance to see it.<eos> You'll see what it's worth to Bajor in a few years.<eos> If that is to be my fate.<eos> - Should I reverse course?<eos> - So soon?<eos> There's not much else to show you.<eos> Prophecy can often be vague.<eos> That's why we must test it.
But we know there were no wormholes and little activity in the area before it formed.<eos> We've looked for some common ground, a way to attack this thing.<eos> Frankly, sir, as funny as it sounds, pulse wave torpedoes may still be the best approach.<eos> If it didn't work very well last time, why...<eos> The Vulcans were using a primitive device.<eos> We've developed far better ways of controlling the flux density.<eos> We should be able to contain the reaction this time.<eos> If we can't, we destroy the whole Bajoran system.<eos> Major, the rupture is already expanding.<eos> We seal it or it destroys the system anyway.
What I'm trying to teach is pure science.<eos> Pure science taught without a spiritual context is a philosophy, Mrs O'Brien.<eos> My philosophy is that there is room for all philosophies on this station.<eos> How do you suggest we deal with this?<eos> I'm not sure you can.<eos> I can't tell you how much I've looked forward to this moment.<eos> I'm honoured to meet the Emissary to the Prophets.<eos> Had I known of your visit, Vedek Winn, I would have greeted you sooner.<eos> I did not wish to bother you with my insignificant visit.<eos> - l'd hardly call it insignificant.
Now. Or this one dies.<eos> Let's go... ally.<eos> - Were there any casualties?<eos> - That depends on you.<eos> - What's this all about?<eos> - Yeto, get the Ferengi.<eos> - Any more questions?<eos> - Don't hurt him.<eos> Mareel, the box.<eos> Put it in your stasis chamber.

Yes, the wormhole.<eos> I don't want the Federation here either, but they are serving a purpose for the time being.<eos> Without the Federation, the Cardassians would take control of the wormhole.<eos> The wormhole is the future of Bajor.<eos> It's bringing ships and commerce, making us a power in the quadrant.<eos> I don't want to be a power.<eos> I want Bajor for Bajorans.<eos> - l want our homeland back.<eos> - We have it back.<eos> As we grow stronger, we'll defend it ourselves.
Idiotic bureaucracy!<eos> Now they'll expect me to break in a new man.<eos> Li Nalas can handle the job.<eos> You did fairly well at it once I smoothed your rough edges.<eos> - What's so funny?<eos> - l thought you did fairly well once I smoothed your rough edges.<eos> Am I disturbing anything?<eos> Help me cry in my synthale.<eos> - Here's this epidellic lotion.<eos> - No, if you like it, keep it.
Halfway down the embankment, I slipped, went sprawling down to the lake as a Cardassian emerged from the water.<eos> He must have finished bathing.<eos> He stood there, frozen in surprise, dressed only in his underwear, shivering in the cold.<eos> I lay there, too stunned to move.<eos> It was only when he reached for a phaser rifle lying on a nearby rock that I realised I was holding my own phaser, and I shot him.<eos> His body fell on top of me.<eos> That's how my companions found us.<eos> One of them recognized him as Gul Zarale, responsible for the massacre of half a dozen Bajoran villages.<eos> I tried to tell them what had happened, but they were convinced that I had killed Zarale in some kind of savage struggle, which is what they insisted on telling every Bajoran we met.<eos> No matter how hard I denied it, the story spread until it seemed all of Bajor had heard it.
We know what we're doing.<eos> We've had a lot of experience of dealing with the Prytt.<eos> We'd hardly risk the safety of your people.<eos> After all, we hope you will recommend our entrance into the Federation.<eos> - One of us is hungry.<eos> - That would be me.<eos> Do you mind thinking something else?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Not a bowl of vegetable soup.<eos> My grandmother made it.
- This is not appropriate behaviour.<eos> - With all due respect, I have always voiced my opinions, even when they differ from Capt Picard's.<eos> But in those situations, you were Head of Security, not First Officer.<eos> The second-in-command carries out the decisions of the captain, in this case, me.<eos> But is it not my duty to offer you alternatives?<eos> But once I have made a decision, you must carry it out regardless of how you feel.<eos> Any objections should be given to me in private.<eos> I do not recall Cmdr Riker ever publicly showing irritation, as you just did.<eos> No, sir.<eos> If you cannot carry out this role, I will assign it to La Forge and return you to Tactical, recording it not as a reprimand, but as a transfer.
In a way that pleases people who care about your happiness, yes.<eos> But I am concerned about more than my own happiness.<eos> You think your feelings could change the way you function as captain?<eos> Yes. Relationships with co-workers can be fraught with consequences.<eos> That's true.<eos> But cutting yourself off from your feelings can be as serious.<eos> You see, I've always believed that becoming involved with someone under my command would compromise my objectivity.<eos> And yet...<eos> Are you asking my permission?<eos> - If I were, would you give it?
I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE, FOLKS. I CAN HEAR YOU BLEEDING.<eos> IS THIS ON?<eos> I KNOW WHAT THIS CROWD WANTS.<eos> A LITTLE SLAY ON WORDS.<eos> MAYBE A COUPLE OF NASTY FRIGHT GAGS?<eos> GET A LIFE!<eos> SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF TONIGHT'S NASTY NUGGET.<eos> IT'S A LITTLE TALE ABOUT MARRIAGE,<eos> OR IF YOU PREFER, ABOUT WIFE AND DEATH.<eos> I CALL IT TWO FOR THE SHOW.
OK.<eos> I have no money!<eos> No, let me go!<eos> No!<eos> Food. I think I'll pass.<eos> Hey, I know a good place to crash.<eos> Up the fire escape, through that window.<eos> Come on, I'll give you a boost.<eos> Pull it down.<eos> - l can't get it down.
Hold it.<eos> You want some good shit? - Yeah. - Pitch thrown to Len Harris.<eos> Swing and a miss.<eos> Strike one.<eos> Harris, like many of these Dodgers, came out on fire when the series opened, but seems to have just disappeared.<eos> Of course, Met pitching has had a lot to do with that disappearance. In the clutch, the Mets pitchers just could not be denied.<eos> Mets are now all standing on the dugout steps in anticipation.<eos> Pitch thrown is ball one. Lenny Harris thought about it, he laid off.<eos> And the count's even at one and one. At this point, well, it looks like the Met fans...<eos> Put your hand up there where I can see it. Here at Dodger Stadium.
Because that has not been my style.<eos> But, once...<eos> One time, many years ago I was living with this fabulous, interesting woman named Harriet Harmon.<eos> I'm ashamed to say this, but Harriet Harmon was the great love of my life.<eos> It was a very passionate relationship.<eos> I loved her very intensely.<eos> And, you know, we just made love everywhere.<eos> She was sexually carnivorous.<eos> We did it in stalled elevators and in bushes and people's houses, at parties in the bathroom.<eos> In the back of cars, she'd put a coat on our laps and grab my hand and stick it between her legs.
My dad's in Buenos Aires.<eos> Really. In the suburbs.<eos> He is an Evangelist preacher.<eos> It's true.<eos> But it's all the same. Truth, lies...<eos> It's always like that with a whore.<eos> Did you go to college?<eos> You go to college, you work, you grow up you screw, you read you enjoy yourself, you suffer, you live...<eos> Does it matter how?<eos> You work with your imagination when you don't turn it into a fucking whore to earn some fucking dollars so you can fuck a whore.
It's called Burghi Burghi?<eos> And what do they serve, chips and ketchup?<eos> Have you been there before?<eos> - Next time, we'll go there together<eos> - Promise<eos> Don't stay in the water, you've just eaten<eos> Antonio, can you give me your address?<eos> Do you want to send me a postcard?<eos> Give it to me now<eos> You can't read it now
Peter, come on.<eos> Access denied.<eos> Maintenance line access granted.<eos> A back door.<eos> Get out of here! Go now!<eos> July 10. Last journal entry for a while.<eos> I won't let Jobe's death be for nothing.<eos> What happened to him is my responsibility.<eos> For some reason, I've been given a second chance... so I'm taking my work underground. I can't let it fall into the wrong hands again.<eos> If we can somehow embrace our wisdom... instead of ignorance... this technology will free the mind of man... not enslave it.
"Dear Brothers: I thank you for your time and concern.<eos> All praises due to Allah for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.<eos> I wrote the mayor, the governor and the president but for some reason, I haven't heard from them."<eos> Hmm.<eos> Please tell the Honorable Elijah Muhammad that I have dedicated my life to telling the white devil the truth to his face.<eos> I greet you with the ancient words of peace, "As-Salaam-Alaikum. "<eos> P.S. I finally copied out the entire dictionary.<eos> I think the brother is coming along.<eos> "The thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill, and to destroy.<eos> But I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly."
Let's go that way then<eos> The County Town<eos> When I came back from work I found the door has been pried open So I came straight here to report it<eos> those papers, what're they for Complaint letters<eos> I haven't got one<eos> You haven't?<eos> He'll do it for you<eos> Can you help me write a letter?<eos> What sort to of letter A complaint letter<eos> How strongly worded you want it What do you mean?
Later, you go ahead Must be hard coming so far<eos> I'll tell you what you do Go and talk to the director of the PSB here He's a good man<eos> Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to keep you here After all, I only charge you<eos> $1.50 per night But in your condition I want to help you<eos> Over there<eos> Meizi we're going to see the director What should we take<eos> Let's take him some snacks City people don't like plain things What, then<eos> Fruit<eos> Meizi, it's not enough What, then? Something else, some snacks<eos> Snacks, snacks Fruit's not good enough People eat it and it's gone
- You got good sources.<eos> - CNN.<eos> I need help, Tommy.<eos> Come.<eos> Let us see the fight.<eos> Ming, you get that fucker to the back row and keep an eye on him<eos> Hey, Tommy, I didn't come 10,000 fuckin' miles to watch these guys whack each other with big toothpicks<eos> Why did you come, Tony?<eos> You know why I'm hurting, then you know why I came.<eos> I supply you with heroin, you distribute it.
What do you mean?<eos> Give it back to me now!<eos> The last fifteen minutes you've been droning on about names.<eos> Toby...<eos> Toby Wong?<eos> Toby Chung?<eos> Fucking Charlie Chan!<eos> I've got Madonna's big dick coming out of my left ear and Toby, the Jap, I don't know what, out of my right.<eos> Gimme that book.<eos> Are you gonna put it away?

You don't need to do the stock any more.<eos> Help her with those doves in the oven. Please.<eos> Let me taste this soup.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> May I ask you where the first course is?<eos> We have been seated for 15 minutes.<eos> I'm sorry, Herr Drescher.<eos> The soup is ready now.<eos> It's supposed to be cold cucumber soup.<eos> We serve it hot in Düsseldorf.
Look, over here.<eos> It looks great.<eos> Now don´t start.<eos> Maybe you could give it a little more firmness.<eos> Put the leaf over there.<eos> I can´t see.<eos> What was that?<eos> - What did you say?<eos> - I think this area is fine as it is.<eos> You may be suffocating it a bit.
The New Prince Hotel, 6 O'clock.<eos> Mr. Ishioka, he's under the name of Sato...<eos> No, it's alright there's a few things I can do in the meantime.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I can read what you need to do, but you must follow these three things to be a successful young woman.<eos> The first one, I see a TV and under it a.. telephone book.<eos> I will put one there.<eos> Second, don't plan on visiting the museum in the east of the city.<eos> There is a big mist in this direction, any single woman would get lost there forever.<eos> And third, buy a pink stone, and make it into a ring, wear it on your middle finger as a good luck charm.
Former Minister of Defence, first came to prominence when he shot down the Racnoss on Christmas Eve...<eos> But he goes back years.<eos> He's famous.<eos> Everyone knows the story.<eos> Look.<eos> Cambridge University, rugby blue, won the athletics thing, wrote a novel, went into business, marriage, everything, he's got a whole life.<eos> All of it, the school days, his degree, even his mother and father, it's all invented.<eos> Look, Harold Saxon never went to Cambridge, there was no Harold Saxon!<eos> The thing is, it's obvious.<eos> The forgery is screaming out, and yet no-one can see it!
Collegium Armonicum.<eos> -Oh, you called yourself like that because hee, hee<eos> Collegium Armonicum.<eos> And why in German?<eos> No, no, no. lt isnt German, its Latin.<eos> Its amazing how Latin and German resemble each other.<eos> Now, please, if youll be so kind, write down on this paper the title of the tune you will play.<eos> The viewers who call in and get the name of the tune right will get juicy prizes: two pounds of oranges, a dozen lemons.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> The orange, you squeeze it, juice comes out.
I came to determine whether you are a threat to us, and to examine the purity of your energy sources.<eos> Energy?<eos> Is that why you're draining our shields?<eos> Yes.<eos> The emissions from your field generators are far richer than our normal sources of energy.<eos> Picard to bridge.<eos> Report. Shields at three percent.<eos> We're diverting all power.<eos> Acknowledged.<eos> If it's energy you want, we can provide it.
It appears to be 200 million kilometers in diameter.<eos> That's as large as the Earth's orbit.<eos> Why didn't we detect this before?<eos> The object's enormous mass causes gravimetric interference.<eos> That might have prevented our sensors detecting it.<eos> Mr. Data.<eos> Could this be a Dyson Sphere?<eos> The object does fit the parameters of Dyson's theory.<eos> A Dyson Sphere?<eos> It's an old theory. I'm not surprised you haven't heard of it.
You're the third person today with something like this.<eos> An intense, emotional response provoked by an object.<eos> Did any of them know why?<eos> No, they couldn't explain it any more than you.<eos> At this point, I won't say it's coincidence.<eos> Maybe we should all get together.<eos> Talking about it would help you understand your response.<eos> I'll find out if anyone else has had these experiences.<eos> Will, you told me you had an unusual experience at the console.<eos> Why don't you describe it?
I'm sure she is, too.<eos> A breach in the biosphere.<eos> Get Hannah Bates.<eos> The refortification wasn't adequate.<eos> There's definite structural damage.<eos> The tectonic shifts created a breach.<eos> Can it be repaired?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll run a diagnostic.<eos> Unless we seal it, we may have to evacuate.
We will set up a muon feedback wave inside the beam.<eos> Particles will accumulate in their dilithium chamber.<eos> When they go to warp speed, their engines will explode.<eos> - We've got to warn them.<eos> - How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We have to find a way.<eos> The muon feedback wave isn't on any of the displays.<eos> The Romulans must be hiding it in a signal.<eos> Without a level-three diagnostic, they'd never detect it.
Cmdr Riker has been working with J'naii specialists, to formalise this hypothesis.<eos> During the creation of a star system, when clouds of interstellar dust and gas coalesce, turbulent magnetic and gravitational fields may develop.<eos> In certain conditions, these condense into abnormal pockets of space.<eos> We think your system contains one of these pockets.<eos> The pocket absorbs electromagnetic energy from anything entering it.<eos> - Like a shuttle.<eos> - Or probe.<eos> Making them powerless.<eos> But outside the pocket, the energy is bent around it, making it naturally cloaked.<eos> That's why we cannot see it, and our sensors cannot read it.
I suggest we postpone our greetings for another occasion.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Get us out of here.<eos> If we tune a phaser to the approximate frequency of triolic waves and lay down a field burst, it might respond.<eos> The ophidian the aliens were carrying.<eos> What the...?<eos> Those look like minute distortions in the space-time continuum like the one we saw on Devidia II.<eos> But they were so small and they lasted only a second.<eos> The aliens appear to be able to concentrate the distortion and direct it to a specific time and place.<eos> Maybe they have something... a mechanism that focuses it.
I'm not implying that you did anything intentional, I'm just trying to solve the mystery.<eos> We have nothing to hide.<eos> If you wish to examine us...<eos> Fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Deanna, I don't know if you can hear me.<eos> I've heard doctors say that even when someone's in a coma, they may be able to hear when people talk to them.<eos> That it might help stimulate the brain, speed a healing.<eos> I think you did that for me once, when I was in pretty bad shape.<eos> I just thought it might help to hear a friendly voice even if you don't know you're hearing it.
You know the answer.<eos> You've seen what I do.<eos> Farouche finds what's inside and brings it outside.<eos> If you've got the money and if you're brave enough...<eos> We could do business.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> Yeah. O.K., man.<eos> But I want a tiger.<eos> Ain't your choice.<eos> You see, your skin's got a story to tell, and I'll find it.
-Just tell her.<eos> -What?<eos> I hardly know anything about him.<eos> I don't mean his biography.<eos> Just there's some creep around.<eos> If you see him again, call the cops and then call me.<eos> What about a weapon?<eos> In case things get exciting around here.<eos> Would you feel more secure with a loaded gun in the house?<eos> We'd end up using it on each other. Or Dani would.
Set the trap and we'll see.<eos> What if we don't want to see?<eos> -Dani!<eos> -What?<eos> Maybe he poisoned the dog.<eos> Sam, watch out for the windows.<eos> You're not allowed to stand up, remember?<eos> -Didn't Cady go after her?<eos> -You don't know Dani.<eos> If she finds a palmetto bug in her bedroom, she takes it outside.
I'd like to talk to you about some research you did while you were working at Argo on the Meridian.<eos> What Meridian?<eos> A car.<eos> You did extensive research on its electrical system.<eos> It was project 0243.<eos> I'm no longer good with numbers.<eos> It was a 1985 model, station wagon, and you said there were problems with it.<eos> - The depth charge!<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> That's what I called it, the depth charge.
A person experiences a trauma and they want to erase it from their minds.<eos> The trouble is, they erase everything else along with it.<eos> - You a shrink?<eos> - No, not exactly.<eos> I'm a hypnotist.<eos> Here's the water, there's the door.<eos> Sorry about the stairs.<eos> Tastes a bit like bourbon.<eos> It's simply a matter of regressing the young lady back to a happier time and then asking her who she is.<eos> Your hand is feeling very light, my dear, so light that I'm afraid if I were to let go of it, it would just float up, all on its own.
He couldn't love or feel loved.<eos> He was sick with experience.<eos> He began to die.<eos> One day, a fool wandered into the castle and found the king alone.<eos> And being a fool, he was simple-minded. He didn't see a king.<eos> He only saw a man alone and in pain.<eos> And he asked the king, "What ails you, friend?"<eos> And the king replied:<eos> " l'm thirsty and I need some water to cool my throat."<eos> So the fool took a cup from beside his bed, filled it with water and handed it to the king.
There are other ways to get his attention... besides blowing up the garage. Yeah.<eos> He barely even blinked.<eos> All he wants me to do now is grow up to be him... an exact copy.<eos> I don't feel like playing football and date-raping coeds.<eos> One of these days, you're going to have to face your father.<eos> Maggie... look what I found in Spencer's room.<eos> A pipe bomb, huh? That?<eos> Just showing the kids survival techniques.<eos> Been confiscating stuff like this all week.<eos> Where do they get it?
I was jogging, and I heard this crying, and I looked under these bushes...<eos> Where was this?<eos> On Carmelina, around the corner. I looked under the bushes, and there she was.<eos> When was this?<eos> This morning. This morning?<eos> What time? This morning? What time?<eos> What did the police say? Hmm?<eos> My guess is the police did not say, "Hmm?"<eos> So I guess my next guess is you haven't called the police.<eos> Claire. You know, it's possible this baby was kidnapped, and somebody's been frantically looking for it all day.
- Tuesday.<eos> The kids are stripping the asbestos off the pipes now.<eos> That's great!<eos> Things couldn't be better for us.<eos> I'm so blessed.<eos> Oh! Your life insurance forms came for you to sign.<eos> Oh, my mirror!<eos> - I'll get another pen.<eos> - No need.<eos> I'll sign it when I get back.
- Tell me.<eos> - No, not now, lovey-bumpers.<eos> There'll be plenty of time for that later.<eos> And my investigation into JFK's assassination?<eos> You found the evidence you wanted?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's right here in my pocket.<eos> It's big, honey.<eos> It goes all the way to the White House.<eos> - Do you want me to hold it for you?
Or was it Okinawa?<eos> The one without the Indians.<eos> It's final orders.<eos> We strike tomorrow at 0600.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Wake me up at 0530.<eos> - Get outta your flight suit.<eos> You're not going.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> This mission is too important to let you screw it up.
I'll miss all the pleasant things you say.<eos> "Dad, I hate you."<eos> It's chocolate chip, your favorite.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You're an asshole.<eos> You know how I hate to waste food.<eos> Want to abuse me some more?<eos> Shock me.<eos> I hardly ever hear the word "asshole."<eos> - Bet you get it all the time! - That's enough!
'Cause I hate them.<eos> I've got to throw it away. What a waste.<eos> Such a picky eater!<eos> I'd rather you were a good eater than a good essay writer.<eos> How can you drink that horrible stuff?<eos> Milk's okay.<eos> It's onions I hate.<eos> I'm leaving carrots so I've got no choice.<eos> Who decided we can only leave one thing?<eos> Shall I drink it?
Dad loves the onions, right?<eos> Anyway, that kimono will be yours in the end.<eos> Always hand-me-downs.<eos> - Some people don't get anything.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Then give me that enamel purse.<eos> Didn't you give it to her yet?<eos> You're too old for that.<eos> Give it to her.<eos> I don't want it.
See, has to be thrown away.<eos> What a waste.<eos> Don't throw it away!<eos> Please Mother.<eos> It's your fault.<eos> Finish it yourself next time.<eos> You three are so selfish.<eos> Father, buy me an enamel purse.<eos> Yaeko won't give me hers.<eos> You said you didn't want it.
- I promise I'll be nice to the help.<eos> - I'm going to dress for lunch.<eos> I love talking to you, Thornton.<eos> You're so deep-dish.<eos> Lisa, I'll be leaving next month on the Ile de rance... for a linguistics symposium in Brussels.<eos> Brussels?<eos> The one in Europe?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Do send me a postcard.<eos> You can address it here, in care of my gilded cage.
What?<eos> My knees, they're bad. Ask me why.<eos> Why?<eos> Football.<eos> Wrecked them both playing college football.<eos> Man, it was my life.<eos> Football, what else was there?<eos> Not jack shit.<eos> Homecoming, right?<eos> That son of a bitch threw a perfect spiral, and I caught it... boom.
- Well, I'm apologizing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The best supporting actress in a daytime drama award goes to... Lori Craven.<eos> If I could just get you right here. A few words for your fans at home.<eos> Another big night for you, David Seton Barnes... winner of this year's Johnny Hockard's Humanitarian Award.<eos> I know. I mean, what a magical year.<eos> It's hard for me to take credit. The whole thing just snowballed.<eos> Well, you're certainly the man of the hour.<eos> Congratulations to you.<eos> It all makes for a storybook ending to a rather tumultuous year... for the cast here at The Sun Also Sets... a show in which life not only imitated art, it topped it.
It is an honour to serve with you.<eos> You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.<eos> I've always wanted to try that.<eos> You've done well, Val'eris.<eos> As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.<eos> And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.<eos> I do not understand this representation.<eos> It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.<eos> "The expulsion from Paradise."<eos> - Why keep it in your quarters?
This is Kid Kelly.<eos> Here's "Are You Listening, Luck y" by Joe Ely.<eos> Do you believe this body?<eos> I'll never get used to this.<eos> Be careful of Sheila.<eos> She can be dangerous.<eos> Do I detect a note of authentic concern over my future welfare?<eos> No, but these days my welfare seems to depend on yours.<eos> Kathleen Seymour lived with Sheila for ten years.<eos> She developed this fragrance for Faxton and she always wore it.
If they arrest you, please don't say anything about the little redhead.<eos> What makes you think they're gonna arrest me?<eos> They found your gun.<eos> This whole thing feels like a bad dream.<eos> Are you really sure that they can't trace that gun?<eos> Not a chance.<eos> You bitch!<eos> You planted that gun in my apartment.<eos> The gun's not registered!<eos> They'll never trace it!
Why in hell did you bring that?<eos> Psycho killere, bears, snakee.<eos> I juet don't know how to uee it.<eos> Put it away. Put it in my purse.<eos> Thelma, good Lord.<eos> So whose place is this again?<eos> Lt'e Bob'e, the day manager's.<eos> He's getting divorced.<eos> His wife's getting this place.<eos> He's letting friends use it till he turns over the keys.
That so?<eos> Here for rest and treatment<eos> Can't he rest here?<eos> We have room<eos> Must I spell it out?<eos> Great engraving.<eos> First printing<eos> See how the blacks stand out?<eos> Superb!<eos> And the central figure, remove it and it's a routine picture
Uh-uh-uh, this is not pills.<eos> It says, "take a vacation...<eos> From my problems."<eos> I'm giving you permission to take a vacation, Bob.<eos> Not a vacation from your work and not a vacation from your daily life, but a vacation...<eos> From my problems.<eos> Exactly!<eos> Now, I want you to get on that bus and go back to New York.<eos> But every single time a problem arises,<eos> I want you to take that prescription out and follow it to the letter.
Well, sit up until morning.<eos> Maybe you'll remember.<eos> Take him to the cellar. You, get out!<eos> Go!<eos> Mother!<eos> Mother!<eos> Our mother's gone.<eos> Who will cook for you?<eos> I don't know what will become of us.<eos> Take care of Olenka Guard the house, or they will come and tear it down.
Kill the little bugger!<eos> Kiss your ass goodbye, boy.<eos> - What the hell is going on?<eos> ! - He's loose again!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Open up!<eos> Sh!<eos> Police!<eos> We have reports of gunfire!<eos> If you do not open this door, we'll break it down!
I'm sorry. He's always been a liability with my firm. I'm only just beginning to realize it.<eos> Mr. Paulsen, I didn't mean it.<eos> Sir!<eos> Irmy!<eos> Irmy!<eos> We're closing.<eos> Just one beer? Please?<eos> Did anyone see a blonde woman wandering around alone?<eos> Short hair.<eos> Oh, mercy. We never know when we have a good thing. We always have to ruin it.
Yes, but this one was so irresistible.<eos> Sweet and innocent. But under the sheets, a tigress.<eos> A violent, screaming, passionate jungle cat.<eos> You mean a good actress.<eos> She swore not.<eos> Well, you're very young, my friend. Very naive.<eos> She dug her nails into my back.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> And then she yelled "Don't stop! Don't stop!" Yes.<eos> And stuck her tongue inside my mouth and wiggled it around.
We'd be apologizing till the end of time.<eos> "Hi, how are you?<eos> Sorry, man."<eos> You, guys, enjoying the show?<eos> Wow, excuse me, jeez!<eos> Sorry about that, just came into my head and I made a decision.<eos> I hate to turn my back on the audience, I really do.<eos> I think, nine out of ten of the worst impulses we get, though, are when we are behind the wheel of a car. You know?<eos> That's why I don't think it's a good idea to carry a gun in the glove compartment!<eos> 'Cause chances are, if it's there, sooner or later you gonna use it.
I'm sure he's fine.<eos> That's what Eddie says, that's what everyone is saying.<eos> Please, will you look into it?<eos> For me?<eos> For you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You seem like you have a heavy heart.<eos> Sometimes I'm not sure why I wear a mask with you.<eos> Well, maybe one day you'll take it off.
It's, uh... it's not every day a man comes face-to-face with his dream.<eos> What?<eos> Okay, you remember about a year ago when we were caught in that booby trap the Menthars set?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay. While we were trying to get out of it I went down to the holodeck to study an engine prototype that was made when the Enterprise was first designed.<eos> And the computer... well, it gave me an image of the engine but it also created this hologram of the designer Dr. Leah Brahms.<eos> So, you met a computer-simulated female?<eos> Yeah, but not an ordinary computer-simulated female.<eos> I mean, she was brilliant, of course, but... warm, you know... friendly and it was like we worked as one.<eos> I would start a sentence, she'd finish it.
I don't want to waste a moment.<eos> And when we came out of the cave, there was nothing left.<eos> Everywhere we looked, there was devastation.<eos> Trees gone, nothing.<eos> That's typical.<eos> It could take years for anything to grow again.<eos> Doctor, I ran a full spectrographic analysis.<eos> Trace elements confirm it is the entity which destroyed Omicron Theta.<eos> The crystalline entity functions like a gigantic electromagnetic collector.<eos> It needs a lot of power to keep going, so it strips every form of life and converts it all into energy.
Conquer them again later, if we wish.<eos> May I ask, what has this to do with us?<eos> The Governor has charged that the Federation is aiding the rebels.<eos> Does he have evidence?<eos> Council has sent me to examine that evidence.<eos> It was my decision to invite you to accompany me.<eos> Many on the Council have great respect for you.<eos> K'adlo.<eos> I have been happy to offer occasional assistance to the Klingons.<eos> Your modesty is very human, Captain. I will excuse it.
All right, Picard.<eos> You need proof?<eos> You've got it now.<eos> Captain Maxwell, you have disobeyed a direct order.<eos> Board the ship.<eos> You'll see that everything I've been saying is true.<eos> The Cardassian vessel will not be boarded.<eos> You will transport yourself aboard the Enterprise.<eos> Picard, if you don't board that ship<eos> I'll destroy it.
I wish you well.<eos> Thank you, Captain.<eos> Captain, I will not be coming with you.<eos> Ambassador...<eos> The reason for my coming here was never more clear.<eos> The union of the Vulcan and Romulan people will not be achieved by politics or diplomacy, but it will be achieved.<eos> The answer has been here before us all along.<eos> An inexorable evolution toward a Vulcan philosophy has begun.<eos> Like the first Vulcans, these people are struggling toward enlightenment.<eos> It may take decades, even centuries, for them to reach it, but they will reach it.
- The brothel, Miss.<eos> I can't recall.<eos> It's nice and hard!<eos> If you would follow me to the cloakroom,<eos> - I'll shove it up your ass!<eos> - What a great idea!<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Where is the coke?<eos> - I got it.<eos> - Put it in Auntie's saccharine.
The beauty is missing.<eos> The beauty of utter devotedness.<eos> - It still feels impossible.<eos> - The impossible has its price.<eos> If you're afraid to be judged, you won't succeed.<eos> Jugded?<eos> Why should I be judged?<eos> It is inevitable.<eos> Beauty is only tolerated in museums, motionless, contemplated... But to give it life, body and movement... is prohibited by the normal society.<eos> Do you want to avoid to be judged, because you can't find beauty anyway? Or can't find it because you're afraid of being judged?
Gas?<eos> Evans City is five miles away.<eos> We can make it on friggin' fumes.<eos> What if we can't?<eos> Are you willing to take that chance?<eos> Besides, Evans City is a war zone.<eos> I've been there.<eos> It'll take a lot more than five miles to get any help.<eos> There's a gas pump out by the shed.<eos> My uncle keeps it locked.
- Yeah.<eos> We were gonna go in with our guys... but we were told on a radio transmission nobody goes in under any circumstances.<eos> All units, be advised.<eos> Federal offcers will handle investigation.<eos> - We didn't hear that.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - You're the boss.<eos> This is Cheryl Tyer reporting live...<eos> Hey, nice flashlight.<eos> Mind if I borrow it?
Rozat K. Sabich?<eos> Rusty, I don't like to be here.<eos> A search warrant for these premises.<eos> Come on in.<eos> They're taking swatches from your suits.<eos> They'll try to match threads from my clothing and the carpet...<eos> With fibers they might find at her apartment.<eos> They're not looking for a murder weapon?<eos> I wouldn't be stupid enough to bring it home.<eos> If they look for it and don't find it, they'll have to admit that in court.
We're all familiar with that.<eos> Shit, if Mr. Sabich had come from my neighborhood...<eos> He would've said, "Your momma."<eos> But, in Mr. Sabich's part of town I would think they would say:<eos> "Yeah, you're right."<eos> And what they mean is, "You are wrong."<eos> Just to be polite.<eos> Your Honor, isn't that a question for the jury?<eos> On the contrary, Mr. Delay Guardia, it is first a question for the court.<eos> If you use Mr. Sabich's statement and risk my ruling it out of order...
To have escaped something so obvious as the use of a contraceptive spermicide.<eos> All the sperm were dead.<eos> I didn't have the forensic chemist's report about the spermicidal jelly.<eos> In the absence of any other explanation, I thought the guy was sterile.<eos> Do you recognize your notes of your autopsy of Ms. Polhemus?<eos> Yes, sir, my signature.<eos> Unless there is any objection...<eos> Would you please read the short passage marked by the paper clips?<eos> Page two, Counsel.<eos> Read it out loud, please.
- Yeah, yeah. Easy. Easy does it.<eos> Yeah, no, no!<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Will somebody shut him up?<eos> - We did it! - You've got it!<eos> I've got it!<eos> I'll just take my tail, and I'll pick the lock, like this!<eos> Frank, give it a rest.<eos> You'll thank me when you're free.<eos> Look, I just insert my tail, like this, and I turn it like this, just a quarter turn to the left, and then push it a little bit further.
Wait a minute.<eos> You think I'm scum, don't you?<eos> Blow it out your ass.<eos> You want a witness to back me up?<eos> I'll get one.<eos> And hey, maybe I'll see you at the Celtics, huh?<eos> I am not going to let them execute you. You're not gonna die.<eos> Look, Johnny, this is gonna be a lot easier on you if you don't cry, OK?<eos> I... I know your brother's hysterical.<eos> Number one, they always set a date for the execution, and they always postpone it.
But somebody might see her there.<eos> The action of dragging her would naturally pull up the nightgown.<eos> In this cold, how long could she survive?<eos> Remember what Sunny said?<eos> "I would've been better off. You would've been better off. "<eos> ...because the law is a blunt instrument.<eos> It is not a rapier. It is a cudgel.<eos> Tomorrow, death penalty.<eos> Which reminds me of the comedian who said<eos> "Why do they call it the death penalty? It's no penalty.
Whew...<eos> Hot. Quite wretched today.<eos> I suspect the malaria is coming back.<eos> He looks just like that young murderer in Massachusetts last year that went about slicing up little children.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> I think the murderer, his appearance, was more wholesome.<eos> Um... What revolting water.<eos> Then don't drink it, you sissy.<eos> I am so tired of all your talk about dirt and worms.<eos> Don't drink it.
Anything you want.<eos> Um, coffee and... 2 chocolate eclairs.<eos> Coffee, 2 chocolate eclairs.<eos> We've even got a scale in there.<eos> I'm not getting on it.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It's got a hole in it.<eos> Wouldn't you know?<eos> I brought old pajamas, too.<eos> Maybe I won't wear it.
Come outside.<eos> Come on outside!<eos> Come and see how nicely your car is burning!<eos> Now I'll kill him!<eos> He shouldn't have touched my car! Forget it.<eos> Please.<eos> He'll get tired of it.<eos> He'll see!<eos> Come outside!<eos> He shouldn't have touched it! Well?
Who are you?<eos> I told you.<eos> We are from the Wah Mountain School<eos> Yes.<eos> How do I know that you're telling the truth.<eos> What? imposter?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Don't get so worked up.<eos> You should recognize... my Teacher's sword-play.<eos> I'll demonstrate it... to prove my identity.
- Now what?<eos> It's a bit delicate, this.<eos> Remember you had that thing with Pat Woolton?<eos> I'd hardly forget that, would I?<eos> What a character<eos> - You liked him, though, didn't you?<eos> - What a maniac. He was all right. - Really good fun.<eos> - He's still carrying a torch for you.<eos> Torch?<eos> Is that what he calls it now?
But it's hardly cheering news for Labour either, is it?<eos> By-elections allow folk to let off steam.<eos> - Funny things happen in Dorset.<eos> - You're not worried?<eos> Oh, we shall take it seriously.<eos> It may be we're not getting our message across.<eos> - Can I quote you on that? - Yes, I think you may, Miss Storin.<eos> I'm very glad I bumped into you, Mattie.<eos> Another piece of news is going to break.<eos> And I know you'll handle it responsibly.
- Why not?<eos> I just... Oh, it's hopeless.<eos> I don't know why I'm still working on it.<eos> I have no job.<eos> No one except the BBC will even use me as a freelance.<eos> I just keep thinking, "Two days more.<eos> I'll give it two days till the election.<eos> "If I haven't got any further, I'll give up."<eos> The infuriating thing is, I feel as if I already have the answer somehow.<eos> I just can't see it for looking.
I'm wearing my gun tied down, and if I have to, I am going to use it.<eos> A man'd be a fool not to wear a gun and a bigger fool to use it too fast.<eos> Someone who meant no harm could die reaching for a chew of tobacco.<eos> You listen to Nick Evers and Rincon will have more dead than Gettysburg.<eos> I'll tell you this:<eos> I can't control the miners much longer, they're rounding up hotheads.<eos> Either you do something or they will, and I can't say I blame them.<eos> Nick says wear your gun and use it fast.<eos> Mr Morgan says wear it and use it slow.<eos> I say don't wear it and you won't use it at all.

Tell me without remorse whence you came - may the power of silence be proved through me!<eos> You have already to thank me for the highest confidence since I gladly believed the oath you made.<eos> If you never falter before my command I shall consider you to be above all other women!<eos> Come to me, O sweet, pure one!<eos> Be near my ardent heart, that the eyes in which I saw all my happiness may shine upon me softly!<eos> Oh, grant me that in sweet raptures I may breathe in your breath!<eos> Oh, let me clasp you to me firmly, that I may be happy in you!<eos> Your love must be the highest recompense for that which I left behind for your sake;<eos> no destiny in all God's world could have been nobler than mine.<eos> If the King offered me his crown I should rightfully reject it.
Two by fours, four by...<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> You can't do that to my workers.<eos> Don't walk away from me like that.<eos> Come on back here.<eos> You're not going anywhere and you're not gonna tell anybody anything.<eos> Katherine,<eos> I'm sorry if this offends you, but I am the owner of this sawmill.<eos> And you don't know the first thing about this mill.<eos> That's why I'm running it.
After the... fight, Dr Apgar came to find me.<eos> He was very upset.<eos> And he told you what happened?<eos> Yes, he told me everything that happened.<eos> Based on Tayna's deposition, we have recreated the incident as Dr Apgar described it to her.<eos> - Computer...<eos> - Inspector, this is hearsay.<eos> She wasn't a witness to this incident.<eos> But Dr Apgar is dead.<eos> Her statement is admissible in Tanugan law and I insist you consider it.
Shut down thrusters.<eos> Ensign, take us to 1,000 meters ahead of the barge and hold.<eos> External radiation levels increasing, sir.<eos> Coming into position at 1,000 meters.<eos> Worf, extend the shields around the ship.<eos> Lock on the tractor beam.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> Radiation levels at 70 millirads per minute and rising.<eos> Allenby, set a new course.<eos> We'll take it through the asteroid belt ourselves.
I hope so.<eos> Let me take you to your quarters.<eos> Good idea.<eos> I've had enough surprises for one day.<eos> Anything familiar?<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> And then Mr. Greenberg asked about the Fornax disaster.<eos> And I knew the Enterprise saved all the colonists, but I didn't know...<eos> Here it is.<eos> But I didn't know the exact star date of when their sun went nova, so if you tell it to me, I'll write it down and won't forget.
Yes, sir, I believe I have.<eos> I'll bet that I can find any card you hide in this deck.<eos> Furthermore,<eos> - I will make you help me find it.<eos> - Careful, Data.<eos> Your guidance is much valued, Counsellor.<eos> However...<eos> Pick a card.<eos> Don't let me see it.<eos> Now lose it in the deck.
Ja'rod, father of Duras.<eos> This Ha'Dlbah should have been fed to the dogs!<eos> His family is powerful.<eos> If the truth were known, it would shatter the Council, most certainly plunge us into civil war.<eos> You were in Starfleet.<eos> We did not expect you to challenge the judgement, nor did we know there was another son of Mogh.<eos> Worf's challenge is successful.<eos> The honour of his family must be restored.<eos> You do not understand.<eos> His challenge was defeated before he ever made it.
You may not like the future.<eos> It's been a long war.<eos> The Federation has lost more than half of Starfleet to the Klingons.<eos> We were negotiating a peace treaty when I left.<eos> A lot of changes, Lieutenant. A lot of changes.<eos> When we get a break, maybe you could fill me in on some of them.<eos> Photon banks are depleted.<eos> Auxiliary fusion generators are down.<eos> It is highly probable that the temporal rift is symmetrical.<eos> What would happen if the Enterprise-C were to fly back through it?
WHERE'S THE MONEY?<eos> WOULDN'T BE...<eos> HERE, WOULD IT?<eos> ALL RIGHT.<eos> WHAT DO YOU WANT?<eos> I WANT HALF. HALF?<eos> ARE YOU FUCKING NUTS?<eos> I'M THE ONE WHO STUCK MY NECK OUT.<eos> I'M THE ONE WHO PLANNED THIS WHOLE DAMN THING!<eos> I'M THE ONE WHO LET YOU GET AWAY WITH IT.
I, UH, I, UH... I WAS AIMING FOR THE WASTEBASKET. I WAS AIMING FOR THE WASTEBASKET.<eos> I<eos> - I DON'T THINK I'LL BE NEEDING THESE THINGS ANYMORE...<eos> NOW THAT WE'VE TURNED THE MUSIC DOWN.<eos> Conscience: HE'S LOOKING AT THE DRUM CASE, MARTY. HE KNOWS!<eos> PROPERTY OF DONNY OSMOND.<eos> HIS TOUR MOVED ON TO FAIRBANKS, ALASKA OVER A MONTH AGO.<eos> DON'T THINK DONNY WILL BE MISSING HIS DRUM KIT?<eos> YEAH, PROBABLY.<eos> WELL, WHY DON'T WE GET IT OUT OF HERE? HUH?
Cooper, you may be fearless in this world.<eos> But there are other worlds.<eos> Tell me more.<eos> My people believed that the White Lodge is a place where the spirits that rule man and nature here reside.<eos> Local legend.<eos> Goes way back.<eos> There is also a legend of a place called the Black Lodge, the shadow self of the White Lodge.<eos> Legend says that every spirit must pass through there on a way to perfection.<eos> There, you will meet your own shadow self.<eos> My people call it:
Could I speak to Josie Packard, please?<eos> - Well, she's not here right now.<eos> - Can you tell me when she'll be back?<eos> Well, she's out of town.<eos> Who's calling?<eos> I'd like to place an international call, please.<eos> Collect to Hong Kong.<eos> Doesn't that sound...?<eos> I mean, I ate it, but I didn't really know what it was.<eos> I read about it in this French magazine, and they take the entire head and dip it in a kind of blancmange pudding.

The deal as we discussed?<eos> The rest on delivery.<eos> Three nights, Leo.<eos> Green light.<eos> Is that clear enough?<eos> But if Mrs. Palmer knows about the necklace...<eos> - How?<eos> How could she know?<eos> - She said she saw it.<eos> She said she had a vision and she saw someone take it.
Good. Thanks, sheriff.<eos> The defendant is released on his own recognizance.<eos> Now, Leland, as you know, I will require you to remain in town and making your whereabouts known to the sheriff on a regular basis.<eos> Sid, check the calendar, and we'll set a date for Mr. Palmer's trial as soon as possible.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, what's behind those deep blue eyes today?<eos> I've got a proposition for you.<eos> I'll share my life with you. I'll tell it to you.
And they are in that box.<eos> If we open that box, the treasures will be ours.<eos> There are problems in your plan.<eos> What?<eos> Give me some bourbon.<eos> What are the problems?<eos> First of all, we don't know what the actual treasures are and what's their worth.<eos> Like I said, we should be able to find out after we open it.<eos> Second, we don't know where that box is.<eos> That's why we're going to look for it... get me the double.
You could wait for me!<eos> Hurry up, then!<eos> It's so beautiful!<eos> It doesn't seem abandoned to me.<eos> My father took good care of it last year. I'm afraid that this year he may not.<eos> It's silly, I'm afraid I'll crush the flowers.<eos> You'll get your feet wet!<eos> Wait, I'll lend you a pair of boots.<eos> Don't mind the wallpaper.<eos> My mother put it up. I don't like it but we haven't had time to redo it.
I have the perfect man for you to see.<eos> He's an acupuncturist. His name is Dr Yang.<eos> That's funny.<eos> My trainer mentioned him this morning.<eos> He's not just an acupuncturist.<eos> He's a diagnostician. He gives these herbs.<eos> The man's a genius.<eos> He diagnoses you from your pulse.<eos> He took Jean Lewis's pulse and told her she would develop an ulcer.<eos> No Western doctor could find it.
You're all right in my book.<eos> I'd like to buy you a drink.<eos> You don't have to buy me anything.<eos> It was no big deal...<eos> You can have this brand-new Colt Peacemaker and gun belt, free of charge.<eos> Free?<eos> I want everybody to know the gun that shot Buford Tannen... was a Colt Peacemaker!<eos> No problem.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> Of course, if you lose, I'm taking it back.
I want you to drop the gun when I tell you, OK?<eos> - Keep the gun pointed at me.<eos> - Why?<eos> Better me than at the cops.<eos> You ready, Lar?<eos> We're coming out!<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> That stuff you've got strapped to your bike... it's safe?<eos> It's OK.<eos> If a cop gets blown up trying to defuse it... our plan's down the toilet.
The whole world knows we're coming.<eos> The only thing they don't know is when.<eos> - What are we going to do?<eos> - We're going to proceed as planned.<eos> The only hitch is, our boy Ramon sent a message to Fogerty.<eos> He swears he'll execute all three DEA agents the instant any American military unit touches down in San Carlos.<eos> Let me go in 48 hours ahead.<eos> I'll get them out.<eos> - You mean you'll go up that mountain?<eos> - I can climb it.
- Like we figured... ajoke.<eos> - Colonel Stuart, could we have a few words?<eos> - You can have two: "fuck" and "you".<eos> No pictures, you pinko bitch.<eos> Old news.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - You got a key for this door?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why? Because I want you to open it up, that's why.
I am Lobo.<eos> I hunt alone.<eos> I need no one.<eos> I'll have to give it some thought.<eos> Come on, come on, move it, Gus.<eos> Come on!<eos> All right, look, we gotta work on the tan.<eos> Take your shirt off.<eos> The only thing that women like better than muscles are brown muscles.<eos> Put it on!
We'll get them, buddy.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Every fucking one of them.<eos> One more favor:<eos> Get Sonny out of that school now.<eos> With me up and running, they'll do anything to find Sonny to get to me.<eos> Get him someplace safe, anywhere.<eos> Consider it done.<eos> I'm going straight to get that film.<eos> As soon as you get that audio, and Sonny's safe we'll bring it in to Jerry Dunphy.
You don't like flying?<eos> This is nothing.<eos> You should have been here five months ago.<eos> Talk about puke! We ran into a hail storm over the Sea of Japan.<eos> The pilot shot his lunch all over the windshield.<eos> I barfed on the radio.<eos> It wasn't that lightweight stuff.<eos> It was that chunky industrial puke.<eos> You want a bite?<eos> Next time I get a bright idea, I'll put it in a memo.
this might stimulate those memory banks.<eos> silver.<eos> I ran across it in the pawn shop.<eos> Something made me buy it.<eos> It's got a flat tire, but that's all that's wrong.<eos> Here's the real kicker.<eos> I bought this tube repair kit on impulse...<eos> ... aboutthreemonthsbefore I saw this bike.<eos> there was some force guiding us that summer.<eos> It either came to help us or we created it.
What of my fame if everything is falling apart?<eos> - Why is that?<eos> - Because!<eos> Because I can't be everywhere at once<eos> You know that one, with an aureole around his head?<eos> - Well, he's my rival<eos> - Oh, I see!<eos> But tell no one, shhh!<eos> He creates, and I have to fix it<eos> For instance, He'll create this house and fill it with snails and frogs and I will put in a fireplace, all the snails will vanish from the heat
And let the Prophecy be realized, for it is said:<eos> An intercessor shall come in the final days and a great sorrow shall be his from his birth.<eos> And he shall have nothing but the great sorrow, neither the gift of prophecy nor of healing, neither providence, nor the gift of tongues.<eos> But he shall be heard on account of the prayers of the desperate.<eos> For the one interceding for you is the final Intercessor, there shall be no other.<eos> Amen.<eos> Lord!<eos> Let us out of here!<eos> I've gotten my coat dirty.<eos> Leave it, the maid will clean it in the morning.
What are you afraid of?<eos> Getting killed.<eos> - Where are you from?<eos> - This village.<eos> - Do you like mutton?<eos> - No<eos> What is the name of your horse?<eos> Templar.<eos> How do you dispose of garbage, here?<eos> We just throw it in the river.
The processors can handle the extra input.<eos> But how do we reconfigure?<eos> Energy reserves reaching critical.<eos> Standard procedure requires termination of all simulations.<eos> Override standard procedure.<eos> - Override authority restricted.<eos> - What?<eos> Computer!<eos> The crystal lattice is breaking down.<eos> We'll repair it at a starbase.
Impossible!<eos> That ship was rendered warp inactive.<eos> I told you he was the best.<eos> I'd like to hear more about this.<eos> Later.<eos> Right now, I have to work something out with Mr Data.<eos> Premise.<eos> The Ferengi want the Hathaway, believing it to be of value.<eos> We must remove it from their field of interest.<eos> They will soon locate it after a two-second warp.
He will understand.<eos> Right now there isn't much he can understand.<eos> He is holding all his feelings inside.<eos> Children often feel they must be true to the memory of a lost parent.<eos> If you offer affection too soon, they can feel guilty returning that affection, as if they're betraying the love of the parent.<eos> I only wish to honour his mother.<eos> I know and I understand this means a great deal to you.<eos> But you must be prepared.<eos> He's very angry, too, but his anger is deep inside him.<eos> When he touches it, it will strike out in many directions, including yours.
Theirs could be a scientific voyage.<eos> Klingons of that era doing research for its own sake?<eos> - But they may be reasonable.<eos> - That point is beside the point.<eos> These are Klingons, at war with us.<eos> Whatever their mission, once they see a Federation target, they'll attack.<eos> Can they be disabled rather than destroyed?<eos> We could knock out their engines without damaging the ship.<eos> No use.<eos> Disable the ship and K'Temoc will destroy it himself.
Yes, sir.<eos> The T'Ong is now on a heading of 42, mark 1 1 3, accelerating to warp five.<eos> - They're making a break for it.<eos> - Overtake, warp eight.<eos> Aye.<eos> Put us right in their path.<eos> Come to a full stop.<eos> Full power to shields.<eos> We've thrown down the gauntlet.<eos> Let's see if they pick it up.
We can expect more of the erratic behavior of the kind you've been noticing.<eos> His feelings towards you are very warm.<eos> He's attracted to you in many ways.<eos> Attracted?<eos> I know I've felt certain feelings from him and for him.<eos> Had I been older perhaps we could have been... but that's not the way it worked out.<eos> And now, it's like he's afraid to face me.<eos> The only one he talks to is your friend, Data.<eos> You mentioned your impending death, Grandpa.<eos> May I say you face it with remarkable courage and stoicism.
To try to put an end to the Gatherer raids, we have come to the Acamar system to enlist the aid of Marouk, the Sovereign of Acamar III.<eos> Their raids have made this sector unsafe.<eos> - Trade routes have been disrupted.<eos> - The Gatherers are elusive.<eos> We've only managed to capture a handful of them.<eos> But with Starfleet's help...<eos> Hunting them down is not what I am proposing.<eos> Reconciliation with the Gatherers is impossible.<eos> It's been tried.<eos> Every time we offer amnesty, they reject it.
Yes, Counselor.<eos> Come.<eos> Counselor you've had the opportunity to observe Dr. Pulaski for some time now.<eos> How would you evaluate her as a Chief Medical Officer?<eos> I've never met a more dedicated physician.<eos> I would say she has a passion for her work.<eos> Mm, yes, of course.<eos> I entirely agree.<eos> Is it possible that such consuming dedication could interfere with her judgment?<eos> I feel your concern, Captain, but I don't share it.
Group two:<eos> Podbechtywac podskakiwac, podkopywac<eos> Group three:<eos> Dranstwo, zaprzanstwo swinstwo, koltunstwo, panstwo...<eos> These are associative fields<eos> Now take a word which does not exist in the Polish language<eos> The problem only arises When we try to translate it into another language<eos> In exceptional cases only a foreign language becomes one's own intimate language<eos> We may have a very good rational knowledge of that language<eos> We may be able to use it to discuss most intricate problems
And their aircraft carrier?<eos> Some were heavily armed bandits.<eos> I don't remember if there was a bazooka.<eos> At some point we surrounded the house.<eos> At three o'clock I gave the signal like a turtledove.<eos> At night the turtledoves sleep, they don't sing.<eos> In fact it was in afternoon.<eos> ~ At night would be better.<eos> ~ This raid was made during the day.<eos> Next time we'll do it at night, to make you happier.
What's with a third person involved?<eos> Why do you care?<eos> Something to investigate?<eos> Enough!<eos> ~ Would you all stop?<eos> Want to keep quiet?<eos> ~ Let us close our eyes ten minutes!<eos> ~ And what'll I do?<eos> ~ Dig a hole.<eos> Don't let him touch the sand, he threw it in my eye!
~ I was referring to the child.<eos> ~ You know what it's like, this bag?<eos> He's smart.<eos> It is an important trace, like the shoe.<eos> ~ Have you heard the story of Tom Thumb?<eos> ~ Who?<eos> ~ Of Tom Thumb.<eos> You know the story?<eos> ~ No.<eos> Giulio knows it very well.
I'm as adventurous as the next.<eos> Your wife has an excellent palate, Mr Spica.<eos> It is always a pleasure for us to serve her.<eos> I want one of those hot, damp towels, Richard, served to me with tongs.<eos> Adele is no good with cash and figures.<eos> She's just decorative, all lips and tits.<eos> - We'll replace her.<eos> - Can I do the replacing?<eos> Stuff your mouth, Mitchel.<eos> Every time you open it, you just show how vulgar you can be.
All right.<eos> Look left.<eos> Now straight ahead, Ben.<eos> Now to the right.<eos> That's good.<eos> My mother said that I should go to the doctor, because I was... My eyes weren't so good.<eos> Well, you're an ophthalmologist.<eos> Do you agree the eyes are the windows of the soul?<eos> Well, I believe they're windows, but I'm not sure it's a soul I see.<eos> My mother taught me I have a soul, and it'll live on after me when I'm gone, and if you look deeply enough in my eyes, you can see it.
- Look, you're being very aggressive.<eos> That could be a problem on this small boat.<eos> I've seen it happen before.<eos> It doesn't work.<eos> I was watching you when you were sleeping.<eos> And I gotta tell you that your face fascinates me.<eos> Even when you're 80, Rae, you'll still be a beautiful woman.<eos> I studied art for a time.<eos> I found that painters, when they approach their subjects they always look at the face from behind.<eos> From the back, to see what's holding it up.
Why do you gotta fix in the car?<eos> Can't you wait till we get home?<eos> Shut up and watch your drivin'.<eos> Christ. Look at this traffic up here.<eos> Shit.<eos> We gotta get home.<eos> Idiot, move over!<eos> After any kind of drug haul, everyone in the crew indulged.<eos> I laughed to myself as I pictured blues or Dilaudid in such great amounts that the spoon would literally be overflowing.<eos> Upon entering my vein the drug would start a warm itch that would surge along until the brain consumed it in a gentle explosion that began in the back of the neck and rose rapidly until I felt such pleasure that the world sympathised
Guess we must've outrun that hex we had on us, Bob?<eos> - Sure glad we started crossroading.<eos> - Bob? Let's shoot it.<eos> You gotta be careful with this stuff.<eos> It can kill you.<eos> Dianne, get a glass of water.<eos> Do it slow.<eos> I'll show you how we're gonna hide this stuff.<eos> Right up here.<eos> Now, we'll take this stuff and then we'll cross over a couple of these units and stash it over somebody else's room.
What felonies were you convicted of?<eos> What do you want? My life story?<eos> Look, lady.<eos> I'm a junkie.<eos> I like drugs.<eos> I like the whole lifestyle.<eos> But it just didn't pay off.<eos> You know, you don't see my kind of people.<eos> Cos my kind of people, they don't come down here and beg dope.<eos> They go out and get it, and if they miss, they go to jail and they kick alone with nothing in some holding tank.
Discharge your weapon.<eos> Discharge your weapon.<eos> Do it!<eos> Now do it again.<eos> Only this time, I want it done quickly!<eos> A good man can fire three aimed shots in a minute.<eos> Major Forbes, give me your Colt revolver.<eos> - What?<eos> - Your gun.<eos> Give it to me.
- You followed him to the men's room.<eos> - I did not follow him in.<eos> - We happened to have...<eos> - He leapt up.<eos> What time is it?<eos> - It's 9:00.<eos> Why? - You miss the game?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, no, I didn't, I taped it.<eos> - Are you going to watch it later?
Stifling heat...<eos> The sun... flies...<eos> The vultures, stray dogs, rats.<eos> Death came by exhaustion.<eos> You suffocated, with your arms raised.<eos> Thirsty.<eos> For... saken.<eos> Often the Romans left the body to rot.<eos> That revolted the Jews.<eos> Crucifixion was so horrifying, early Christians never depicted it.
Still, it's too bad.<eos> Cookbooks are sure sellers.<eos> After seeing the play the authorities of the shrine are demanding substantial modifications.<eos> Naturally I defended your case as courageously as possible but without success.<eos> We're not censuring you.<eos> Had you put this on in a private theatre no problem.<eos> But you're on the grounds of a Catholic shrine.<eos> And that entails certain restrictions.<eos> So the compromise I suggest is to go back to the old script.<eos> Constance will certainly remember it.
Don't try this at home, kids.<eos> It's all over now.<eos> Put your money on the desk and get back to work.<eos> Suckers!<eos> How the hell did you do that?<eos> I dislocated my shoulder once.<eos> Now I can do it anytime.<eos> Doesn't it hurt?<eos> Yeah, it does.<eos> But not as much as when I put it back in.
Zip!<eos> But without my voice, how can I...<eos> You'll have your looks, your pretty face.<eos> And don't underestimate the importance of body language!<eos> ♪ The men up there don't like a lot of blabber<eos> ♪ They think a girl who gossips is a bore<eos> ♪ Yes, on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word<eos> ♪ And, after all, dear ♪ What is idle prattle for?<eos> ♪ Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation<eos> ♪ True gentlemen avoid it when they can
Yes!<eos> I hope it hasn't taken off yet.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Bertha's absolutely mad about lighter-than-air travel.<eos> I'm the adventuresome type.<eos> Turn the volume down.<eos> Kiki, would you open the box?<eos> Yes.<eos> What's this?<eos> Would you please deliver it to a girl named Kiki? She was kind and a tremendous help.
Give us fresh ham, not trash.<eos> lron-Heart ran out.<eos> The farmer-generals commandeered it all.<eos> You have a first class ham right here.<eos> I swear I don't!<eos> You search me.<eos> What about this?<eos> My leg!<eos> That's right!<eos> We want it now!
Borax!<eos> Honest to God, I didn't know.<eos> I'm as surprised as you are.<eos> Please Mr. Bletch, let's talk about this.<eos> I think that's a very good idea.<eos> Where's the merchandise?<eos> It's... it's...<eos> Speak up. I can't hear you.<eos> It's down on the docks.<eos> Mr. Big's shipping it out tonight.
- Yes, sir!<eos> Midge, find out why Harris has got a chair on his ass.<eos> Come on, Nick, we've been here since noon.<eos> - You haven't even told us what we're doing.<eos> - Look, you guys just have to trust me.<eos> - May I help you, sir?<eos> - I got my eye on that necklace there.<eos> It is beautiful.<eos> Shall I show it to you?<eos> No, thank you. I'll get it myself.
You won't escape me!<eos> Go away.<eos> We have nothing in common.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Angelis, Alberti, Matsasek, who else?<eos> These are artists' names.<eos> And only an asshole believes you were in the resistance!<eos> Not in the resisiance, in the camp.<eos> What for?<eos> Stealing the meat of beasts of prey and giving it to people, like your J-noéik.
Who sells you the stuff?<eos> Who?<eos> Who?<eos> Go home.<eos> Who?<eos> Who?<eos> You know who.<eos> Iwaki, your pal.<eos> What did he do?<eos> He sells it.
We had to breach the Barrier.<eos> Magnificent.<eos> You are the first to find me.<eos> - We sought only your infinite wisdom.<eos> - How did you breach the Barrier?<eos> - With a starship.<eos> - This starship...<eos> Could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?<eos> - It could, yes.<eos> - Then I shall make use of it.
C'mon. Puke or die, you bastards.<eos> Get it up.<eos> Let's go.<eos> C'mon. Wheel out that stomach.<eos> Tromavillian Aaaah.<eos> Go Home, puke, come back in 20 minutes. I don't want to see anybody without puke stains.<eos> Before I knew it, I'd become a toxic yuppie on the fast track.<eos> The Tromavillians tried to put on a brave face, and made the best of their mutated environment.<eos> But what does one feed to a creature that is half frog and half duck?<eos> Worse yet, what would you call it?
It's my mother.<eos> I'm in the middle of dinner.<eos> No, never mind... Yes, I'm listening... What can I say?<eos> It can't be helped!<eos> You heard the doctor... I must know you.<eos> What does " knowing" a woman mean?<eos> It's like music.<eos> You learn the notes, then you play.<eos> I don't get music.<eos> I'm like a blind man when I hear it.
Look. This is the greatest. You're gonna love this.<eos> This is a singing machine.<eos> Look, you sing the lead and this has the backup.<eos> - This is from Oklahoma! - "Surrey with the Fringe on Top".<eos> Yes, perfect.<eos> Now you!<eos> What?<eos> It's my voice, isn't it?<eos> You hate my voice.<eos> - I know, it's terrible. Joe hated it...
Understandable, given this particular life form's novel nature.<eos> What is that nature?<eos> Dr. Crusher is still making her determination.<eos> Mr. Mandl,... ..you know the Prime Directive.<eos> Are you saying that I knowingly defied it?<eos> You're a man obsessed with what you do.<eos> Who knows what an obsessed man will do to keep going.<eos> Kill, perhaps?<eos> I create life.<eos> I don't take it.
Were you able to help Tasha?<eos> No.<eos> Troi, we must talk.<eos> I believe we can outmaneuver this creature, and beam you and Ben up.<eos> We monitored the energy field around the shuttle.<eos> When the creature is here, the field weakens.<eos> - Do you know why?<eos> - The creature is filled with rage.<eos> Undirected, unfocused rage.<eos> When he confronts it, his guard goes down, because he's feeling it instead of suppressing it.
- To go where?<eos> Do you want to find those who left you here?<eos> She told you about them!<eos> How long have you been here?<eos> Since they left.<eos> A very long time.<eos> A long time to be alone.<eos> Save your compassion.<eos> It's revolting.<eos> You offer it like a prize when in fact it's an insult.
Let's see if we can find out.<eos> Computer, this is Counselor Troi.<eos> Request personal history on...<eos> What are their names?<eos> Tommy, he's eight, and Eddie is five.<eos> Full names, date and place of birth.<eos> They were born in Secaucus, that's in Jersey.<eos> Can this really work?<eos> Can this tell me what happened to them?<eos> There must be a record somewhere. There's a good chance we'll find it.
The only question I have is why you thought it necessary to be young to negotiate the hostages' release.<eos> Even willing to put your life at risk for it.<eos> I'll be on the bridge, Admiral, if you want to talk further.<eos> Why didn't you tell me, Mark?<eos> We've always been honest with each other until now.<eos> I did it for us.<eos> I'm sure you believed that, until you had a chance to lead a mission, and to command again. Then you just upended the bottle, or whatever it was, and damn everything.<eos> Did you think about me at all?<eos> I obtained enough of the dosage for both of us.<eos> But you never asked if I wanted it.
Billongamick...<eos> Does that mean something?<eos> Mick's place.<eos> OK, why does it mean that?<eos> - 'Cause I own it, I guess.<eos> - You own it?<eos> Yeah, an uncle of mine left it to me years ago.<eos> How big is Mick's place?<eos> It's not very big.<eos> You could walk across it in three or four days.
I will feel.<eos> I will feel in me your non-human translucence.<eos> I will feel impenetrable wind, complete chill.<eos> I am nobody.<eos> I have despised the belligerent.<eos> Now I, I myself deserve contempt, because I am fighting against myself.<eos> There is suffering, but there is no subject of suffering.<eos> There is action, but there is no subject of action.<eos> There is solace, but there is no man to reach it.<eos> ßThere is a road, but there is no one to follow it.
That's it.<eos> Simple.<eos> Anybody can do it.<eos> - 2 + 2 =...<eos> Net Head?<eos> Answer it.<eos> Come on, you know the answer.<eos> - 2 + 2.<eos> Fill the hole.<eos> If I had that on my hand, I wouldn't raise it, either.
If that's all you have left to teach quit.<eos> What kills me is that they lost the confidence in the system they are now finally qualified to be a part of.<eos> I don't know why I'm losing sleep over this.<eos> I don't need it.<eos> I could make twice the money and less hours and have people treat me with respect.<eos> Respect?<eos> Jaime, those kids love you.<eos> Hey, Kimo!<eos> Check out your ride!<eos> We fixed it up for you.
She has her own.<eos> Here.<eos> See?<eos> You get the picture?<eos> And that fits?<eos> Yeah, only it's made of rubber.<eos> It stretches.<eos> And still it fits?<eos> What's this stuff here?<eos> It is a resin. Newcomers working near methane gases at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
This year's going to be different.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Take my word.<eos> You'll wish your piece of shit excuse for a motorcycle was one of these sweet little rigs.<eos> So how about the ratchet?<eos> All right. Maybe I'll put in a couple of hours over the weekend.<eos> Maybe that'll lighten things up a bit.<eos> There are twelve sockets in that set.<eos> Twelve.<eos> They better all be there when I get it back.
There is no connection that can be proven scientifically.<eos> Resistance to the brain symbiotic wave causes hallucinations and you know it!<eos> Your mediocre mind cannot begin to comprehend the importance of my work!<eos> I suggest you look into your own neurotic behavior, then perhaps you will understand your continuing negativity!<eos> You have to stop this insane research.<eos> That thing isn't satisfied just controlling the minds of the people who watch your TV show!<eos> It's apparent you and I will no longer be able to work together.<eos> Fine with me.<eos> But wait 'til I tell people what's really going on around here.<eos> Now take that thing and bury it where it belongs!
Come on, Davy.<eos> - Strike three!<eos> You're outta here.<eos> Well...<eos> How you doin'?<eos> Fine, considering I'm the worst player in the whole league.<eos> That don't sound like the fella I saw hit the ball yesterday.<eos> I told you.<eos> It's different when I'm with you...<eos> you want me to hit it.

My condolences.<eos> Mrs. Dayton, I'm terribly sorry.<eos> Suzanne, I'm very sorry for your trouble.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My sympathies, dear.<eos> Do you mind, gentlemen?<eos> I happen to be at a funeral.<eos> I'd like to talk about your list.<eos> It's no big secret.<eos> The cast and crew knew about it.
- Give me that.<eos> This is Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson.<eos> Who is this?<eos> This is Hans Gruber.<eos> I assume you realize the futility of direct action against me.<eos> We have no wish for further loss of life.<eos> What is it you do wish for?<eos> I have comrades in arms around the world languishing in prison.<eos> The American State Department enjoys rattling its saber for its own ends.<eos> Now it can rattle it for me.
Ow!<eos> - 15% for you, Andre. - Nice work.<eos> And the rest is for me.<eos> - Au revoir, Lawrence. - Au revoir, Andre.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> What about me? What do I get?<eos> You are the student, Freddy.<eos> You get knowledge.<eos> Wait. I did most of the work. I should get my share of the cash.<eos> I wouldn't dream of giving you your share without being certain that you would spend it wisely on beauty and culture.
- Okay.<eos> [CONTINUES SINGING]<eos> The Grand Hotel Intercontinental.<eos> Richard Walker.<eos> [WATER STOPS RUNNING]<eos> SONDRA:<eos> So how about it?<eos> - Uh...<eos> They're gonna send somebody to pick this one up and then we gotta fill out a form for yours.<eos> And then we gotta hope that whoever's got your stuff doesn't like it better than their own.
Bitch!<eos> The ticket?<eos> Where's the ticket?<eos> Oh.<eos> I threw it away.<eos> Maybe it's...<eos> Wait.<eos> Okay.<eos> I gave you my ticket, you give me my suitcase.<eos> Are you gonna put it back in the locker?
Doctor.<eos> And if you can not?<eos> It does not have to.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - Hi, how are you?<eos> Brilliant. The best day of my life.<eos> I know because I told you, but if you want to make changes at home, go ahead.<eos> Honey, how kind of you.<eos> I had not thought of.<eos> He reached the birthplace, is very pretty, I can not wait to see it.
I'm a dwarf too.<eos> There are no women dwarfs!<eos> My father was a dwarf.<eos> He fought for KINGSIZE for everyone.<eos> Do you think that I found you in a hotel by a mistake?<eos> Adam called me.<eos> You were checking me!<eos> You were insincere.<eos> You didn't tell me That the elders have the formula.<eos> But they were giving it only to chosen ones.
- The casino is opening. I must go.<eos> Don't interrupt me, let me finish.<eos> That thing...<eos> I feel attracted by you.<eos> I want to hold you.<eos> That thing is the most beautiful...<eos> If I had it...<eos> I thought I was the most beautiful person in the world than I see that thing and I realize that I really miss everything.<eos> That thing...<eos> can I borrow it?
It's 3:00 in the morning.<eos> That's the point.<eos> Maybe we should have called first.<eos> If I'd wanted the Commissioner to watch me while I looked at his files... I could have come in during the day and made an appointment.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You mean we're breaking and entering illegally?<eos> -We are breaking the Law?<eos> -No.<eos> We are not breaking the Law.<eos> We are merely stretching it a little.
What do you know today?<eos> No more than I did yesterday.<eos> Honey.<eos> Honey.<eos> - Do you have any beer, sir?<eos> - No. No liquor.<eos> - Hessie, look.<eos> - What?<eos> Jimmy Joe, you give that here.<eos> Jimmy Joe gots the ball and won't give it up.
- American?<eos> - That's right.<eos> They have an enemy they would like to turn into a zombie.<eos> A zombie, huh?<eos> - That is all?<eos> - That's all.<eos> $100.<eos> You've come to the right place.<eos> Your enemy is as good as dead.<eos> I will catch his soul like a spider catches a fly in his web and pop it in a canari like this one.
Look at the matador.<eos> What does he fucking do?<eos> He dresses up in his...<eos> ... spanglesandputson his fucking sequined jacket... ... andwrapsthatsash around his waist.<eos> Then puts on his little pink stockings...<eos> ... andhishairupinalittle pigtail. I mean, that's a pussy.<eos> That's what a bullfight is.<eos> It's saying he's a pussy.<eos> And we're the bull.<eos> They got that thing and they wave it like a red flag.
Then how?<eos> -Listen, you two.<eos> Death to fascism!<eos> -Liberty to the people!<eos> Jesus, Vanc!<eos> You're red as hard communist.<eos> I'm an activist, a member of the KLOJ and I can help you.<eos> You have to be more careful until we achieve communism.<eos> You think they haven't asked me at the KLOJ ... why are you working for kuIaks?<eos> What's use of your meat if I must hide it?
But we live in his cottage.<eos> It's over for kuIaks and priests.<eos> You'II get land, if you're clever.<eos> -Land?<eos> Now, I'II rearrange the kitchen a little.<eos> You don't need that.<eos> We must be careful now when we have a freedom.<eos> One wrong word and they can lock you up.<eos> I'II get land because of these posters?<eos> Land for those who work it.
It's the end for Iand-owners.<eos> That's mean I'II get ... You'II get land ... as you were in the Red Army.<eos> -I'II get land!<eos> Yes, if you listen to me.<eos> Don't' go to church anymore.<eos> socialism can do all that in nine months!<eos> Our new government is just the right one for us.<eos> Now I will not only be a railway worker, but a man.<eos> But where will agrarian committee get land?<eos> We'II take it from big landowners and kulaks.
If the Iaw say so, than it's right.<eos> I've heard that some candidates have asked for 2 hectares.<eos> I'm not one of them.<eos> But you'II take my land?<eos> -Of course!<eos> And the church land too?<eos> -Whatever they'II give me.<eos> That would be steeling from God!<eos> It's God's land!<eos> But we poor people work it!
cattle grazing on it will die!<eos> hall will destroy everything.<eos> Remember that! You will not scare me.<eos> religion is the opium of people.<eos> What sort of propaganda is that?<eos> Have you forgotten who saved you at the front?<eos> You've sent your wife on a pilgrimage.<eos> You've forgotten Mary and God!<eos> You're a big sinner!<eos> If the communists give me land, I'II take it.
We'II buy a cow and plough with the commune tractor.<eos> I new it!<eos> First they'II plough with the commune tractor, than they'II communise the land.<eos> Like the bolsheviks.<eos> Everything went wrong in 1941 ... when there were no BoIsheviks or collectives.<eos> Look!<eos> I said nothing when you stayed in my cottage.<eos> But the land?<eos> If they give you my land, don't take it.<eos> If I don't take it, someone else will.
Swinburne.<eos> We quote before sending, in case you've already purchased a copy.<eos> Hardy, limited edition.<eos> Very nice.<eos> Some time ago you asked us for Newman's idea of a University.<eos> Very nice indeed.<eos> Are you interested in a first edition?<eos> We'll put that aside for Miss Hanff.<eos> He has a first edition of Newman's University for $6!<eos> "Do I want it?" He asks innocently.
There are some lovely old illustrated magazines.<eos> I stayed about half an hour hoping your Frank... or one of the girls would turn up. They must have been all out to lunch, and I couldn't stay any longer.<eos> What kind of a Pepys' Diary... do you call this?<eos> This is not... Pepys' Diary.<eos> This is some busybody... editor's collection... of excerpts... from Pepys' Diary.<eos> May he rot.<eos> I could just spit.<eos> I enclose... two limp singles.<eos> I will make do... with this until you get me... a real Pepys.<eos> Then... I will rip up... this ersatz book... page by page... and wrap things in it!
All killed by your own hand. Guided by me, naturally.<eos> You were doomed from the moment you slit that young boy in half.<eos> You've been living on borrowed time and another man's memories for 12 years.<eos> I want to tell Winesap, he knows!<eos> - He's dead.<eos> Nasty accident!<eos> Don't worry, no one will mourn one less lawyer.<eos> Death's everywhere these days.<eos> But what gives human life its worth, anyway?<eos> Because someone loves it, hates it.
And Rome, Signorina Speckler?<eos> Are you saying Boullée was the first Fascist architect?<eos> Ask my brother.<eos> Do you think Mussolini admired Boullée?<eos> Albert Speer did, and Speer was Hitler's architect.<eos> Augustus would have admired Boullée.<eos> Go to Via Ripetta.<eos> Look at his tomb.<eos> Don't encourage him, please.<eos> Augustus' wife chose it.
She isn't at all what I thought she'd be.<eos> What did you think she'd be?<eos> Blind.<eos> - Plan to have children?<eos> - Naturally.<eos> - I know what to get you for a present.<eos> - What's that?<eos> A vasectomy.<eos> The house is far too large for us without David here... but we're so emotionally attached.<eos> We bought it in 1953... the year after Harold became a judge.
Come on, Rambo.<eos> I want you to be quiet, you hear me?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Planting corn!<eos> What the hell do you think?<eos> I can't stand him.<eos> He's an idiot.<eos> Let's go back to bed and forget him, okay?<eos> Maybe if we think hard, he'll go away.<eos> If he leaves me this house, I'll sell it.
If you waive that right, anything you say can and will be used against you.<eos> For crying out loud!<eos> How come his is so much bigger than yours?<eos> - Miss?<eos> - The gun.<eos> I've never needed more.<eos> Come on, Joe!<eos> Gosh! I'm terribly sorry!<eos> Our car!<eos> We can steal it back.
Police Officer. You're under arrest.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> is this some sort of feeble joke?<eos> Oh, it's a knee-slapper, if you consider Penal Codes 484207 A597 and 217... theft, kidnapping, cruelty to animals, attempted murder things to laugh about.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> My partner and I witnessed that torchlight picnic you threw.<eos> We're gonna put you where your kind always ends up: in a 7-by-7 cage... in some hundred-year-old penitentiary with a wooden plank for a bed.<eos> Sure, this city isn't perfect. We need a smut-free life for all our citizens.<eos> Cleaner streets, better schools, a good hockey team.<eos> But the difference between you and me is you made the promise, I'm gonna keep it.
Can our boils work like that ?<eos> Yeah, why not ?<eos> The weather report for the second day of screenwriting promised north-easterIy winds and the first frost of winter.<eos> Many blamed the weather for the wave of neck aches that came.<eos> Others thought they had influenza symptoms.<eos> Headaches were nothing new for the authors.<eos> They often came in the wake of ideas.<eos> One detail I'd Iike to include is that after leaving the city, which should burn behind him...<eos> I really think it ought to.<eos> After he leaves the city, that's when the disease starts to spread, because he brings it with him in his doctor's bag.
She can go right ahead, I never do anything wrong.<eos> If you want you can tape right on this one and send it back to me.<eos> You don't have to keep this, you can erase right over my voice.<eos> It's not going to be worth anything.<eos> - Hi, claus.<eos> Come in.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> We're sitting in there.<eos> - Can I take your windbreaker ?<eos> - No, thanks. I'II keep it on.
- We're going, baby...<eos> - Nobody goes until daylight!<eos> - You listen to me...<eos> Hush, little baby don't say a word<eos> Momma's gonna buy you a mocking bird<eos> If that mocking bird don't sing Momma will buy you a diamond ring<eos> If that diamond ring turns brass<eos> Momma's gonna buy you a looking glass<eos> Remember that song, Annie?<eos> I used to sing it to you.
-I MEAN, THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF LOOKING AT THIS JOB.<eos> ONE IS, YOU'RE HERE TO HELP PEOPLE.<eos> WHICH IS FINE.<eos> THAT'S FINE.<eos> THE OTHER IS, YOU'RE OUT THERE TO MAKE A BUCK.<eos> NOW PERSONALLY, MY ATTITUDE HAS ALWAYS BEEN...<eos> SEE THIS?<eos> THIS LIKES TO BE PROTECTED.<eos> NOW, THIS WHOLE SECTION OF THE HOTEL WAS CLOSED FOR THE WINTER.<eos> SO WE'RE USING IT TO STORE COTS AND STUFF.
-YES SIR.<eos> WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?<eos> -I'D LIKE A ROOM.<eos> -CERTAINLY.<eos> WILL THAT BE SINGLE ACCOMMODATION?<eos> -I'D LIKE ROOM 2326, IN THE NORTH WING.<eos> -I'M SORRY, SIR, BUT THE NORTH WING IS CLOSED FOR THE WINTER.<eos> -I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE SITUATION IS.<eos> THAT'S THE ROOM THAT MY WIFE AND I SPENT OUR HONEYMOON IN.<eos> IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT I SEE IT...
Private Pyle has dishonored himself and dishonored the platoon.<eos> I have tried to help him, but I have failed.<eos> I have failed because you have not helped me.<eos> You people have not given Private Pyle the proper motivation.<eos> So from now on, whenever Private Pyle fucks up I will not punish him.<eos> I will punish all of you.<eos> And the way I see it, ladies you owe me for one jelly doughnut.<eos> Now get on your faces.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> They're paying for it, you eat it.
If you get killed, your mom will find me after I rotate back to the world and she'll beat the shit out of me.<eos> That's a negative, Rafterman.<eos> Okay, guys. Let's keep it short and sweet today.<eos> Anybody got anything new?<eos> There's a rumor going around that the Tet ceasefire is gonna be canceled.<eos> Rear-echelon paranoia.<eos> A bro in intelligence says Charlie might try to pull off something big during Tet.<eos> They say the same thing every year.<eos> There's a lot of talk about it, sir.<eos> I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.
The Warlords, ordered by Chang Kai Shek.<eos> The body of the Empress Widow was reduced to pieces.<eos> Her pearl necklace is Chang Kai Shek's wedding gift to his new wife.<eos> - 981 , you consider yourself Chinese?<eos> - Naturally.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - Japan.<eos> - What is this part of China called?<eos> - North east.<eos> - What did you call it as a child?
I look the same?<eos> The same!<eos> I have not decided.<eos> Marino says that if someone grabs me by the tail...<eos> - it gets off.<eos> - Well, we'll think about it tomorrow.<eos> Now go sleep. It's late.<eos> Do not tell dad nor mom.<eos> Do not worry, but tomorrow better hide the box.<eos> If mom sees it, she'll make a fuzz.
-Too sweet, just good.<eos> So C.O.P. is a community action program, sir.<eos> -Like Neighborhood Watch?<eos> -More.<eos> Much more!<eos> We show the community that we care.<eos> We train volunteers in crime detection, in first-aid and....<eos> -And it's a great idea, sir.<eos> -But we need citizen support.<eos> With all this neighborhood crime, I'm sure you'll get it.
Could I book time to take a leak?<eos> - What's your problem?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Excuse me a minute.<eos> You volunteered to do this.<eos> You said, "I'll drive so you can talk." Remember?<eos> It was this morning. Of course.<eos> So why are you giving me shit?<eos> Let's go.<eos> If my dinner reeks, I'll put it in the trunk.
Useful?<eos> How?<eos> Investigating some things I've noticed here.<eos> Gold would be lovely with this.<eos> I am sure there are reasons for a first officer to demonstrate energy and alertness to a new captain.<eos> But my duty and interests are outside the command structure...<eos> It's remarkable they had exactly what you asked for.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll take the entire bolt.<eos> Send it to our starship when it arrives.
"Dear Mr. O'Rourke.<eos> Earlier today I spotted Buddy Revell...<eos> "placing a large switchblade in his locker.<eos> "I feel it is my duty as an honorable student...<eos> "to alert you of this dangerous and felonious situation.<eos> Sincerely, Jerry Mitchell."<eos> You put my name on the note?<eos> There's no reason to get pissed.<eos> It's over now.<eos> Besides, I got the note before O'Rourke even saw it.
I'll get you some ice.<eos> So what do you think of her?<eos> I think she could relax a little bit.<eos> - Are you gonna do it? - Owen...<eos> I'm not gonna kill your mother. If you wanna do it, you do it.<eos> A guy kills my wife. He can't even kill his own mother.<eos> - You wanna see my coin collection? - No!<eos> I collect coins.<eos> - I got a dandy collection.<eos> - I don't wanna see it, Owen.
How many yachts can you water-ski behind?<eos> How much is enough?<eos> It's not a question of enough, pal.<eos> It's a zero-sum game.<eos> Somebody wins, somebody loses.<eos> Money itself isn't lost or made... it's simply, uh, transferred from one perception to another... like magic.<eos> This painting here, I bought it 10 years ago for $60,000.<eos> I could sell it today for 600.<eos> The illusion has become real.<eos> And the more real it becomes... the more desperate they want it.
I'm going for a cup of tea.<eos> Do you want one?<eos> - Do you want a cup of tea, Withnail?<eos> - No.<eos> Thirteen million Londoners have to wake up to this. The murder and all-bran and rape?<eos> And I'm sitting in this bloody shack, and I can't cope with Withnail.<eos> I must be out of my mind.<eos> I must go home at once and discuss his problems in depth.<eos> I have some extremely distressing news.<eos> I don't want to hear it.
Will we never be set free?<eos> - Danny.<eos> - You're looking very beautiful, man.<eos> Have you been away?<eos> St. Peter preached the epistles to the apostles looking like that.<eos> Have you got any food?<eos> Mmm.<eos> As a matter of fact, I got a saveloy.<eos> How much is it?<eos> You can have it for nothing.
His mechanism's gone.<eos> He's had more drugs than you've had hot dinners.<eos> I'm not having this shag sack insulting me.<eos> Let him get his drugs out.<eos> This doll is extremely dangerous.<eos> It has voodoo qualities.<eos> Trade, "Phenodihydrochrolide benzorex. "<eos> Street, "the embalmer. "<eos> Balls!<eos> I'll swallow it and run a mile.
You shouldn't have underestimated us.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> We could bleed Hamada clan of all their savings in exchange of this licence.<eos> You would cross swords with the most powerful clan in the country?<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> It would be stupid.<eos> Our clan would take over immediately.<eos> Take these 3000 ryos, give us the licence back, and disappear without a word. It's a friendly advice.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Since you're insisting so much I'm giving it to you.
As you can see, I'm doing nothing.<eos> I don't want to do anything.<eos> But if you stay like that, you'll catch a chill and die.<eos> That's right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What a strange old man.<eos> Here... Still...<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh, this is bad...<eos> As you can see, water keeps coming in, although we pour it out.
- You know, I was thinking about what I told you the other clay.<eos> - What mother?<eos> About leaving this place.<eos> I'm sick of this place and its people.<eos> What People?<eos> The people around here.<eos> They talk.<eos> They always talk too much.<eos> And this house is a hole.<eos> I can't stand it any more.
Because he has committed atrocities that words fail to describe.<eos> For which no extenuating circumstance can be invoked.<eos> Because of him, a long list of young people's names has been erased from life's pages at the moment in which life was opening up in front of them full of hope and promises.<eos> Serene families, solid in their affection have been devastated by the suffering that his homicidal hand has inflicted with aberrant cruelty.<eos> A man like you and me has sowed death and dismay upon a humanity already saturated with pain and grief.<eos> Now that man who until yesterday was an anonymous citizen above suspicion... who, entrenched in his Grey existence, had managed to hide his terrible secret... is here, in front of other human beings.<eos> After years during which I had also been among the powerless witnesses of the unexplained, absurd murders, today in this courtroom, as a representative of the prosecution my duty in front of the evidence of the facts may seem easy.<eos> But it's not.<eos> And my conclusions are nothing more than questions.<eos> Is it sufficient that I ask for a sentence and that I obtain it, for this case to be considered closed?
Dr. Hirose, Mr. Date...<eos> Mr. Maeda, Ms. Shiozawa...<eos> They're all dead.<eos> And now...<eos> And now?<eos> Only GT medicine is left...<eos> Mayumi...<eos> I'm gonna do it!<eos> Based on Dr. Date's research... I'll finish GT "Two".<eos> And annouce it in their names!
I can describe a movie.<eos> I can do everything... except thinking for you.<eos> Today the sun is shining.<eos> The sea is quiet.<eos> There's a dog... close to the trees.<eos> A little further... a bit further... a man wearing a raincoat walks with a child.<eos> He wears a raincoat in this heat?<eos> People are very... strange.<eos> He's offering a cigarette to the child.<eos> The boy... Yes... takes it.
Come along.<eos> I've told the maid to leave.<eos> I need money.<eos> Tell me where it is.<eos> I did it for you... and Rena.<eos> Please.<eos> In my desk in the right-hand drawer.<eos> But it's probably locked.<eos> Where's the key?<eos> Griselda wore it on a chain around the neck.
The whole place smelled of death.<eos> They were neither sad nor scared... just like animals whose feelings cannot be read.<eos> Then, I saw his tiny bright eyes.<eos> Everything in him was small.<eos> He was staring at an apple left on the table.<eos> I went up to the table.<eos> He looked at me.<eos> His eyes seemed to laugh.<eos> I sent the apple rolling to the floor.<eos> Several children jumped on it but he grabbed it.
The wallpaper?<eos> we constantly heard the choir rehearse in a nearby barrack.<eos> Then I often isolated myself with a child.<eos> At times, I could hear the soloist's voice while watching a boy agonize.<eos> There was a passage that I liked most of all.<eos> Unwillingly, I started to associate it with the pleasure death gave me.<eos> I discovered that hearing it excited me tremendously.<eos> At times, the panting of the boys before dying... seemed to be part of the song.<eos> It was as if they sang it.<eos> I don't know what gave me the idea... but I soon put it into practice.
Hey, Ace.<eos> - Buttercup.<eos> You know what I need?<eos> I need a new reed.<eos> A Rico number three.<eos> Well, can't you blow through what everybody else do?<eos> No.<eos> Even Bean uses a reed...<eos> - Listen, I ain't Bean... Or anybody else.<eos> I'll get it because you been good.
The Germans invented it.<eos> Think about it.<eos> God, Pat's going in for the kill.<eos> That's a nice turn.<eos> - Coy.<eos> - With just a hint of giddiness.<eos> Her big move will come at any moment.<eos> The combination hair flip with a giggle.<eos> There's a 3.2 degree difficulty.<eos> Let's see if she can pull it off.
I was ... I thought ...<eos> Well, maybe I am a little.<eos> Martin, you're 14-carat fuck-up!<eos> - Something wrong?<eos> - Goddam smartmouth.<eos> You think people like that mouth?<eos> Mr big shot.<eos> - Why didn't you cut out that dump?<eos> - The Swallow?<eos> I say dump, you connect it with the Swallow.
Time-out!<eos> Time!<eos> Time-out, Taft.<eos> We got time for one more.<eos> I can get open.<eos> He can't get open.<eos> I can get open.<eos> Come here, Jack.<eos> Half these people came to watch you catch the ball.<eos> The other half came to see you drop it.
- It's OK.<eos> Everybody relax.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Jack, I know where we are.<eos> This is a central... what do you call it?<eos> - Sewer?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Water comes in up there.<eos> Seawater from the bay fills this room.<eos> They divert it through pipes to different chambers.
I put up with everything.<eos> My old man pushes me around.<eos> I never say anything!<eos> Well, he's not the problem.<eos> I'm the problem.<eos> I gotta take a stand.<eos> I gotta take a stand against him.<eos> I am not gonna sit on my ass as the events that affect me unfold to determine the course of my life.<eos> I'm gonna take a stand.<eos> I'm gonna defend it.
- Yeah, you showed him.<eos> - Practise your english.<eos> - Tomorrow is the boy's birthday.<eos> - I bought him a bicycle.<eos> - Fine.<eos> At sears, where america shops.<eos> I cannot put it together.<eos> Here are the instructions.<eos> - Not tonight.<eos> - I want him to see it when he wakes up.
- You must have been very unhappy.<eos> - Yeah, unhappy and fat.<eos> And I still find the meetings very comforting.<eos> I'll never understand it.<eos> You're so bright and charming and beautiful...<eos> I think to myself "What problems could she possibly have?"<eos> Don't let me get started on my childhood.<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> There is a book store a couple of blocks from here.<eos> If you don't know about it, you should.
I didn't mean to spoil the evening.<eos> Let's move on to another topic.<eos> So you had my ex-partner's baby.<eos> Twins.<eos> And maybe that did cause some trouble, but I think we were drifting apart anyhow.<eos> Now, instead of man and wife, we're just good friends.<eos> Boy, love is really unpredictable.<eos> Lee? Frederick?<eos> Say hello to Dusty Frye.<eos> - Hi. Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's decorating it.
He just tore off my ear!<eos> He's lucky he had a chance to escape before I kicked his ass big leatherneck, jarhead motherfucker!<eos> Something must be done about this Gunney Highway.<eos> Yes!<eos> But what are we going to do?<eos> - Wait till the Swede gets out of the brig!<eos> - That's it!<eos> The Swede!<eos> - Yes! He'll rip his head off and dump in it!<eos> - Then he'll eat it!
Anybody have anything they wanna say?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's win this one for all the small schools that never had a chance to get here.<eos> OK.<eos> I wanna win for my dad.<eos> Let's win for Coach, who got us here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> With God of heaven it is all one, to deliver with a great multitude or a small company.<eos> For the victory of battle standeth not in the multitude of host, but strength cometh from heaven.<eos> And David put his hand in the bag and took out a stone and slung it, and struck the Philistine on the head, and he fell to the ground.
They're like pretty girls.<eos> Neglect them, and they're gone.<eos> Last year I saw a fiig tree there.<eos> That proves there's water.<eos> - There was water.<eos> - But there are new shoots!<eos> You know about mixing drinks, but you know nothing about springs.<eos> I say this one is dry!<eos> I say the olive trees are dead and the soil is rotten!<eos> And I say I wouldn't take that land if you gave it to me!
He's a tax collector, but I don't know where.<eos> The notary will surely locate him.<eos> Tax collectors are never hard to fiind.<eos> He's married... but, unfortunately, by God's will... he's a hunchback.<eos> What if some villager tells him about the spring?<eos> That's unlikely.<eos> The villagers here don't mix into other people's business.<eos> And the way you wrecked that house... would make any farmer sit down and cry.<eos> You're right!<eos> He'll sell it.
He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies.<eos> As an adult, someone should blow this sick fuck out of his socks.<eos> Do you think that's a contradiction, Jack?<eos> Does this kind of understanding make you uncomfortable?<eos> What about the mirrors?<eos> He uses the mirrors to see it happen.<eos> But he doesn't take anything.<eos> There's no souvenirs taken from the houses.<eos> He needs souvenirs or trophies to re-live the event.<eos> Maybe he records it somehow.
I'd never have forgotten a letter from her.<eos> I still have two faded notes she wrote to me... and a black comb from her hair.<eos> It's true.<eos> When I came back, she had left the village.<eos> She was married to the blacksmith in Crespin... and she already had a child.<eos> How could that letter have gotten lost?<eos> Over there, we moved from place to place.<eos> Sometimes our food and even our ammunition didn't reach us.<eos> Some letters may have been lost too.<eos> But if I had received that letter... I would still know it by heart.
We're getting soaked.<eos> - Let me do it.<eos> - I'll get it.<eos> It's just not working.<eos> Oh shit!<eos> - Things could be worse Cliffy.<eos> - How CeCe, how could things be worse?<eos> I'm supposed to be on my dream date tonight.<eos> I bought bought a great bottle of wine and and nobody got a drop and a dog named Venus drank it.<eos> I go.. I wear a really, a $30 tie and now some psychotic back at the gloom room is probably using it for a loose most of all I borrow this really terrific automobile and not one of you stupid girls is even impressed!
Sorry.<eos> What a girl, what a twirl.<eos> Peg "Leggy" Sue Kelcher.<eos> A brief but glorious career as a majorette.<eos> Baby!<eos> Looking good out there!<eos> Thanks.<eos> I love it when you twirl your baton.<eos> I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch.<eos> I guess I deserved it.
I'm looking somebody over.<eos> - I want it back.<eos> - What?<eos> The money. The smack.<eos> It's mine. I want it back. Oh, come on!<eos> What are we gonna do, knock over city hall?<eos> We don't even know where they got it stashed.<eos> But we know somebody who can tell us.<eos> That shit is mine. I paid for it, and I want it back.<eos> And I'm gonna get it back.
Did you love her?<eos> She was okay.<eos> Okay, okay, Feck, we've gotta get John out of state.<eos> Need your car.<eos> You're not using my car.<eos> You've got a car of your own.<eos> Mine won't make it that far. No.<eos> I might need mine.<eos> Feck, you haven't been out of this house in over five years.<eos> What if somebody sees it, then?
You'll like this.<eos> Everything from Russia is prohibited now.<eos> You shouldn't care about such nonsense.<eos> Anna Karenina.<eos> It's painful to enjoy such beauty alone.<eos> I'd like to shout over the wall: please note today is certainly a wonderful day.<eos> Do not forget it.<eos> In the middle of your hurry, lift up your heads, look up at the silver clouds.<eos> Feel the air, which the flowers in the linden trees breathe passionately, behold the days of luxury and beauty,<eos> It was given to you like a rose that has come full bloom, and expects you to pick it and press it to your lips.
He ain't going dancing.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Where did it come from?<eos> The balcony!<eos> Christ almighty.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Hey, you guys, stop right there!<eos> This way.<eos> The Fixer loves that car.<eos> If we take it, he'll kill us.
I believe I'm of benefit to my place.<eos> Without false modesty I will tell you that this place might have been taken by a man of far lower professional and moral capacity.<eos> I flatter myself that I'm good at my job, that I am a man of weight and significance.<eos> I'm interested in general questions but not excessively.<eos> because I believe that their resolution do not depend on me.<eos> Blame me if you like, but I am completely happy.<eos> And I have neither wishes nor fears.<eos> I don't even fear Death.<eos> And concerning families eager to secure everything I myself don't want it.<eos> I don't want Death, but I don't fear it you can't fear the unavoidable.
And this is for you<eos> Stop doing that<eos> Why?<eos> It's over<eos> If you say so<eos> Simon...<eos> Where are you going?<eos> What's it to you?<eos> Where are you taking your meat?<eos> If you don't want it, why ask?
I'm the one you come back to<eos> Take that.<eos> I'm going now<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You're going to Tonya<eos> You want her, because you can't have her<eos> You think I'm an easy fuck<eos> But only you and my husband ever had me<eos> Shut your damn mouth.<eos> Or I'll stuff it full of meat
"What taketh away"...<eos> "That taketh away the sins of the world."<eos> And then the scribblers,<eos> Addison of that damned sheet The Spectator, and ignorant and full of envy,<eos> His opera, Rosamunda, was it?<eos> A veritable disaster!<eos> An example, An opinionated cleric critic once approached me with such lordliness in Vauxhall,<eos> "What wretched music they are playing, "<eos> "You are right, sir, " I said,<eos> "It is very poor stuff, I thought so myself when I wrote it, "
I'm kind of an expert on rugs.<eos> Pakistani, right?<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> My associates are not so sure about the authenticity of your calling card. Oh, really?<eos> Here's the deal.<eos> Got your notebook handy?<eos> Good.<eos> I got a friend in LA who works for the government.<eos> He's not real crazy about the CIA.<eos> The deal is he gets the stuff out, gets it to me.
He can't even be reached by telephone.<eos> Well, in any case, he's placed you in good hands.<eos> I'm sure you're going to like our school.<eos> To begin with, we all speak English. And then our academic programme is based on the American one.<eos> Ah!<eos> A bee!<eos> Be careful it might sting you!<eos> No, leave it alone!<eos> Look out!<eos> No, don't kill it, please!
I'm not gonna tell him.<eos> I'm not telling him.<eos> I can't talk any louder.<eos> All right, hurry up.<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - It's great.<eos> I'm just giving him a shoulder.<eos> Look what you did to your shirt.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> - Give it to me, I'll throw it in the wash.
Oh, well, anyway.<eos> That's all right. It's all right.<eos> That's all right. Forget it.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> I'd like to open the register.<eos> What if I got a rush now?<eos> Yeah, I see your point.<eos> What about a key?<eos> Do you have a key?<eos> - Yeah, but I keep it up in my apartment.
You do?<eos> You know what I do in those situations?<eos> What?<eos> I don't worry.<eos> This is all wrong.<eos> I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing my brother.<eos> I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?<eos> Believe me, it makes perfect sense.<eos> Somebody's coming.<eos> You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm going to take it out of your ass.
Here's a lovely, juicy...<eos> Oh, great prince, give poor, starving Gurgi munchings and crunchings.<eos> Nice apple.<eos> Good prince. Good apple.<eos> Oh, boy, what a juicy apple.<eos> Hey! No, you don't.<eos> I didn't give you that apple. You took it.<eos> Hey, hold on, you hairy little thief.<eos> Come back with my apple!<eos> If you don't give it back, you'll be sorry.
It's a good lot this time.<eos> Hurry! In with it!<eos> Finally. He'll reward me for this.<eos> Don't stop, you weakling!<eos> Put some muscle into it.<eos> Let's get out of here before they come back.<eos> Where did you get that sword?<eos> Back there.<eos> You mean...<eos> Well, he's not going to use it.
- He tried to use his fists.<eos> - Where's Cindy?<eos> Junk, you idiot.<eos> Fiddlesticks!<eos> Here kitty, kitty...<eos> Forget the cat, you hemorrhoid.<eos> Get up.<eos> Let's not have any more of this foolishness.<eos> I understand your agitation.<eos> I won't hold it against you.
Where's your sense of humor?<eos> Buzz off.<eos> You little pecker.<eos> Try this, you flying shithouse.<eos> Mr. Norris.<eos> This is more fun than human beings should be allowed to have. - I'll kill you.<eos> - No, Mr. Norris.<eos> But I will most securely kill you if you don't get moving.<eos> The valve was only half open.<eos> If I open it all the way, I'll blow you out of this hole.
- No body.<eos> Nobody in the study.<eos> - No!<eos> - But there's a phone in the lounge.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - When you've finished, please wait here.<eos> - Certainly.<eos> - Where's the key?<eos> - The key to the weapons cupboard.<eos> - You still wish me to throw it away?
You'll know when I'm around.<eos> You don't know how close I came to buying a ticket.<eos> - You'd better go.<eos> - OK. I'm gonna miss you, Kitty. I really am.<eos> "May the Force be with you!"<eos> There can never be an accounting, in human terms, for the tragedy at sea which has taken the lives of these men and women in what should have been the beautiful and peaceful sunset of their lives.<eos> Do not fear.<eos> Your loved ones are in safe keeping.<eos> They have moved on to a higher expression of life.<eos> Not life as we know it, but in the spirit everlasting.
- Is football.<eos> - Football.<eos> Now, these trees are my defensive line.<eos> Those trees over there are your team.<eos> They're a bigger than real players, like the Houston Oilers, and a little bit slower, but not much, all right?<eos> You go down to that end of the field.<eos> That's your end zone. Okay?<eos> Go on.<eos> Hey-o!<eos> All right, now, when I kick the ball to you, you catch it and you try to run past me, if you can, through these two guys there.
Alfred, may introduce our new guest. - Tenente Velocchio.<eos> - Alfredo Velocchio.<eos> Redl.<eos> The most important thing for me is... that you love me... protect me and trust me.<eos> All my life I've been weak.<eos> Tell me what to do. Tell me how to be.<eos> Cynical, maybe?<eos> Why cynical?<eos> You don't believe in the whole thing, but you go on.<eos> You said war is coming, but you'll lose it anyway.
I brought Berkeley back.<eos> Has he been wounded?<eos> No, fever.<eos> More than usual, but he'll be all right as long as the gin holds out.<eos> And you?<eos> How is it with the fighting?<eos> We're taking a beating.<eos> It's likely to last for a while.<eos> I still have your compass.<eos> Why don't you keep it?
-Come on, punk.<eos> -Give it back.<eos> -You want the ball?<eos> -Give me the ball!<eos> -Here. Go get it!<eos> -You never seen a football?<eos> -Hey!<eos> Hey, copper!<eos> Throw me the ball!<eos> Come on, will you throw it back here?
They eat, smoke, sleep together, they listen to music.<eos> -Who are they?<eos> -You don't know them.<eos> But you do?<eos> I'm not going to rot here, I'm warning you.<eos> The woodwork's very pretty, but it collects dust!<eos> So be sure to dust them well!<eos> Be careful of my little cup!<eos> I'm very fond of it.<eos> My godmother gave it to me for my first communion.
I think I can work.<eos> First time in weeks.<eos> Are you taking heroine?<eos> Heroine?<eos> Right.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Do the others do drugs, too?<eos> I'm free to associate with Yajima.<eos> None of your concern.<eos> Does he get it from Osaka?
And such pyrotechnics!<eos> Everything genuine in episodes with chasteners.<eos> When we tried s.e. explosions, the peat that rose up in a black flame from grit stone - that was not true to life.<eos> So we tried genuine material. The effect was quite different.<eos> That produced an atmosphere when the actors, with their very marrow, felt that real horror, with explosions thundering, bullets swishing...<eos> Many things were done for the first time ever in cinema.<eos> Those crowd scenes on the marsh, and our heroes Flor and Glasha enacted by Alexei Kravchenko and Olya Mironova: everything was real there: people in that quagmire, and the quagmire itself real too.<eos> Amongst that squishing soil people behave differently.<eos> Also the air - the air was different, with all those evaporations of turpentine, juniper smells, carbon dioxide hovering over the marsh...<eos> Byelorussian peasants, when picking cranberry on the marsh, called it 'dopey berry': after a day-Iong berry-picking you became like doped.
I'll take my family and belongings and leave! I'll go where the air isn't so foul.<eos> I'm just sorry for my workers who'll starve.<eos> What will you do during your forced holiday?<eos> I'll listen to music, which I love, and I'll try to relax and try to forget what they've done to me.<eos> Financial blackmail!<eos> They want to turn everyone against us.<eos> - Five centimetres in a year.<eos> No, last year you came up to my waist.<eos> You forgot your tip.<eos> I don't want it.

I embrace the government of Ferdinand VII... and I want to give the names of those who conspire against his government.<eos> Mariana Pineda is a messenger, carrying mail for prisoners... and for the exiles in gibraltar.<eos> Her political complicity..."<eos> It is not true!<eos> You can't deny it, I have proof here.<eos> This letter was intercepted in the MotriI post-office... and this one was found among the documents taken from your house.<eos> - Now, will you confess?<eos> - I'm innocent!<eos> That handwriting...<eos> I've never seen it.
Study!<eos> When will Juan finish his work?<eos> Does he still work in the warehouse in the evenings?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I hope that the road will be repaired by the time he comes back.<eos> Mr. Gabino is hurrying up.<eos> Do you know they want to buy the house?<eos> Which one?<eos> The one of the Serpent's Well.<eos> Don't know why they want it.

Carrying Americans?<eos> I don't think they would allow that if they didn't have to.<eos> They don't have to.<eos> Have you checked Discovery's orbit lately?<eos> What?<eos> Have you checked the orbit?<eos> What about it?<eos> Now it's getting chilly here.<eos> This is very bad for my asthma.<eos> You know damn well we've been checking it.
-When's the next ferry?<eos> -Six hours.<eos> Shit!<eos> Should I be afraid of you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's beautiful, huh?<eos> If this were L.A., my stepfather would've bought it.<eos> Torn it up and built condominiums.<eos> Here, the land intimidates them.<eos> They leave it in peace.
You can't help her with this.<eos> But you can, Caxton.<eos> I think so.<eos> But it means doing things my way.<eos> I want that stuff from Kirsch.<eos> And Jessie's going back where she belongs.<eos> You'll leave him alone, Ben.<eos> I'll do what you want, but you'll leave him alone.<eos> What I'm most happy about is the opportunity to share this land.<eos> It's beauty and the beauty around it won't be sitting up here alone anymore, just going to waste.
I can't rewrite what's perfect.<eos> Please. Can't you talk to him?<eos> Please.<eos> Why bother? He's no friend of yours.<eos> I could kill him!<eos> I mean, really!<eos> Kill him!<eos> I threw the entire score into the fire, he made me so angry.<eos> - You burned the score?<eos> - No, my wife took it out in time.
Please respect my wish and go.<eos> Madame I will respect his.<eos> Your merciful God.<eos> He destroyed his own beloved, rather than let a mediocrity share in the smallest part of his glory.<eos> He killed Mozart.<eos> And kept me alive to torture.<eos> Thirty-two years of torture.<eos> Thirty-two years of slowly watching myself become extinct.<eos> My music growing fainter.<eos> All the time fainter till no one plays it at all.
Assam - may he be with God - dug for 50 years.<eos> The entire village made fun of him.<eos> With the discovery of the boat, everything seemed possible.<eos> They all became somewhat crazy... and started digging with Assam... to find the treasure.<eos> May God make me die at this moment of happiness...<eos> May God grant your prayer!<eos> If I catch you, you mongrel!<eos> First, catch the treasure!<eos> They dug for a long time without finding a thing...<eos> So they left Assam... and took the boat and divided it up.
Officers, if we see any movie stars could you point them out to me?<eos> That's enough talking.<eos> OK, that's cool.<eos> This is nice.<eos> It's about time.<eos> I thought you'd forgot me.<eos> I was hungry.<eos> I've never seen a cell with a phone.<eos> Could I stay cos I ordered pizza?<eos> Somebody'll eat it.
Don't worry.<eos> Don't stare, honey. It's rude.<eos> Shit, Birdy.<eos> The things you put me through.<eos> They always said you were weird. Even my kid brother.<eos> Do you remember the time with the knife?<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> These damn kids!<eos> Way to go!<eos> Now we'll never get it back.
Let Virgil guide you, man, and inform you on the ways of the night.<eos> Children withering away up here, brother.<eos> Worshipping the idol of capital.<eos> Lusting after the false salvation of here and now.<eos> Black brother and sister perishing up here, man.<eos> Waiting for scrap from oppressor table.<eos> Oppressor got us for a house pet.<eos> Doing tricks to get reward.<eos> Oppressor need a slave and find it here.<eos> Oppressor need a harlot and find it here.
Find a rope.<eos> Here, take this rope and tie up those pretty hands.<eos> It's really a pity because she's a nice girl.<eos> But however nice you are a little spell in jail won't do you any harm.<eos> You can sing your gypsy songs in there and the jailer will tell you what he thinks of them.<eos> I'll make out the order.<eos> You're going to take her.<eos> How tight you've tied this rope!<eos> My wrists will break.<eos> If it hurts, I can loosen it.
- What about him?<eos> - He sold you out.<eos> - To who?<eos> - Primo Pitt for 25 big ones.<eos> What did he sell?<eos> A cleaver big enough to cut yours clean off.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Pitt got the stuff?<eos> Not yet.<eos> - But you'll get it back.
Tactac, please stop your insults and provocations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Good evening.<eos> I've asked officially that the game be annulled.<eos> How dare you ask for the annulment of a game I played without consulting me?<eos> But you registered a protest!<eos> To make him apologize, to humiliate him.<eos> Withdraw that ridiculous request.<eos> The jury will reject it. The game was in order.
Hey, Dean Yeager!<eos> - Are you giving us better quarters?<eos> - You're being moved offcampus.<eos> Your grant has been terminated and you are to leave immediately.<eos> This is preposterous.<eos> I demand an explanation.<eos> The university will no longer fund your activities.<eos> - But the kids love us.<eos> - Dr. Venkman ...<eos> The purpose of science is to serve mankind, but you regard it as a kind of dodge or hustle.
- Stop it, I said!<eos> You'd rather be careful not hurting yourself.<eos> Go away from there!<eos> No!<eos> That's not OK!<eos> Just think of Erika!<eos> Think of Erika!<eos> Dad!<eos> How laborious was it getting this house!<eos> It's not that bad that a bit of it is broken.
What happened?<eos> I got poison ivy.<eos> You met Kevin and Kenny, who became your best friends in the world.<eos> You've got to give it a try.<eos> I know it's hard. We're not quitters, are we?<eos> I guess not.<eos> - What's with the karate place?<eos> - It sucks.<eos> Good.<eos> We couldn't afford it anyway.
What do you think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know either.<eos> - Is Sarun downstairs? - Sure.<eos> Let's get going.<eos> All right.<eos> Don't go back to sleep.<eos> I won't.<eos> K.R.'s making a push for the airport road.<eos> If they cut it, the city could be lost.
- You want to know what 'shunting' means?<eos> - No I don't!<eos> Calm down. It couldn't get worse!<eos> - What are we going to do?<eos> - We'll wait for all the trains to pass by.<eos> We can't trespass.<eos> But maybe... we could take that path and see if it takes us to the other side. - You know it?<eos> - That path there...<eos> - You know it? - That path!<eos> - I know, but have you ever taken it?
- We'll wait for all the trains to pass by.<eos> We can't trespass.<eos> But maybe... we could take that path and see if it takes us to the other side. - You know it?<eos> - That path there...<eos> - You know it? - That path!<eos> - I know, but have you ever taken it?<eos> - First of all calm down.<eos> I'm not the keeper, okay?<eos> What I'm saying is, perhaps that path could take us beyond the level crossing.<eos> But you've never taken it... I'll go all the same.
I reckon with the right kind of help... you'd make yourself a handsome living just farming cotton.<eos> All you need is somebody like me... who knows most everything there is to know about farming cotton.<eos> I was thinking that maybe... I could work around here for food and a place to stay.<eos> No.<eos> I can't give you any work.<eos> I could fix you some breakfast, and then you've got to leave.<eos> - No such thing as a job, nowadays.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I'll fix you a nice plate of food.<eos> You go wait out there and I'll bring it to you, okay?
Found him down by the tracks.<eos> He claimed he was working for you... but it looks like he was leaving town.<eos> No, he's working for me.<eos> I needed somebody to help out around here, and so I took on...<eos> Moses.<eos> Moses Hadnot.<eos> I took on Moses to do some chores until I could get straightened away.<eos> Mrs. Spalding, are you sure?<eos> I mean, I found all that silver on him.<eos> Oh, it's Mama's, and Margaret wanted to borrow it.
- Yes, sir.<eos> You are going to learn, Mahoney... that nobody... nobody... screws... with me.<eos> Pick it up! Come on!<eos> - This is great.<eos> Two assholes, no waiting. - Come on! Move it!<eos> Would you please just let me yell at him without interrupting.<eos> Come on, Mahoney, move.<eos> Son, where did you get this gun?<eos> My mom gave it to me.<eos> - Can I borrow it for a little while?
I knew it.<eos> He didn't listen to it.<eos> He probably dropped it under his bike and rolled over it.<eos> Wow. All right.<eos> You think about this.<eos> I'll be honest with you.<eos> I think you're being full of shit.<eos> Forget it, Wendy.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Every time we give you a song, you say you'll use it, but you never do.
I don't know why.<eos> And then I was trying to justify it somehow.<eos> Like, by proving to myself that I was a really bad person.<eos> I did deserve it.<eos> Jeez.<eos> You've given me so much, Larry.<eos> It's very easy to love someone like you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think we should have used the back door.<eos> We'll probably have to use it to get out.
- I am so happy!<eos> - What?<eos> Go back quickly<eos> You just wanted to have a look at the town<eos> - Why? - Why should I go back?<eos> Aren't we husband and wife?<eos> It's all so strange<eos> Darling?<eos> This thing...<eos> Do you want me to put it on again?
- I've almost got it.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Why should I listen to her?<eos> Hey, you haven't paid.<eos> Wait up!<eos> Don't try to get away!<eos> Don't try to get away!<eos> A ticket?<eos> I'm leaving right away.<eos> Then, I'll give it to you right away.
You lost al the buttons on this?<eos> I forgot to tell you, they all fell off.<eos> I didn t see anything at all.<eos> That means you saw everything!<eos> Not everything, just a little...<eos> Changed yet?<eos> Can I turn around?<eos> Telling me to change and not closing the window!<eos> What was that about?<eos> I never close it when I change.
- Short-range scan, Mr Chekov.<eos> Put it on visual, Mr Sulu.<eos> Range three thousand kellicams.<eos> Steady.<eos> Continue on impulse power.<eos> Range two thousand kellicams.<eos> Stand by to transfer energy to weapons.<eos> At my command.<eos> There!<eos> That distortion, see it?
- That'll be fine.<eos> - And whipped cream.<eos> - Coming right up.<eos> How long does it take to get to the crater from here?<eos> Driving?<eos> Not long. Five, six minutes is all.<eos> I want you to try this cherry cobbler.<eos> And if you don't like it, you don't have to pay for it.<eos> It's delicious.<eos> My wife made it.
You'd better hurry.<eos> - But I can't go on that plane.<eos> - But Hillary!<eos> I'm needed here.<eos> For as long as a single man is forced to cower under the iron fist of oppression, as long as a child cries out in the night, or an actor can be elected president, we must continue the struggle.<eos> No, Hillary. It is too dangerous for you in Germany, now.<eos> Yes, go with Nick.<eos> Don't worry about us.<eos> We will hear his music on the "Voice of America".<eos> We will hear it in the hearts of people, and in elevators everywhere.
It's really the technique of the Black Magic Clan.<eos> His father must have some relationship with that clan.<eos> I better not alert him now.<eos> You can go!<eos> I don't want to mess with you anymore.<eos> Old Eagle, I'm here for the sword.<eos> About time.<eos> Master Qin, this is the sword you covet.<eos> It's finished, take it!<eos> I don't want it now.
Is that nice, Ernst?<eos> Look, Uncle Eduard, a propeller.<eos> - Ernst, lefs build this.<eos> - No, We'll build an aeroplane.<eos> A great golden goose... gobbled With gusto... is a good gift from God.<eos> Here's the goose.<eos> That looks tasty.<eos> Look, Water comes out of the Valve.<eos> Will you put it beside my bed When I go to sleep?<eos> Don't worry, Anton, no one Will take it away.
Hannah, Hannah, they're here, they're here!<eos> Jane, dear!<eos> Merry Christmas!<eos> Welcome.<eos> Greetings.<eos> Oh, is it not wonderful to be all together in our own home for Christmas?<eos> The place shines like a new pin.<eos> The young lady came back with me a week since when school closed, and I must say she's worked as hard as me.<eos> Oh, bless, you Jane.<eos> I hope this means you regard it as your own home.
I have her and will hold her.<eos> Edward, there is no one to meddle.<eos> I have no kindred to interfere.<eos> No, that's the best of it.<eos> Are you happy, Jane?<eos> Yes.<eos> It will atone.<eos> My love and constancy will expiate.<eos> God will judge me kindly.<eos> For man's opinion, I defy it.
What are you going to do with those apples?<eos> Make them into pies.<eos> Give them to me and I'll peel them for you.<eos> Very well.<eos> Here, put this on your lap or you'll mucky your dress.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You've not been used to servant's work, I see by your hands.<eos> Never mind what I have been.<eos> What is the name of this house?<eos> They call it moor house.
You deceived me like you deceived them.<eos> It was a war!<eos> Your war is over<eos> -Stop!<eos> Don't run.<eos> -Don't hold me!<eos> I'll get out of the desert alive and get the money.<eos> This water is only for one.<eos> That money isn't yours.<eos> It belongs to whoever takes it.
And they started to clean it off.<eos> And it wasn't getting any better.<eos> And I went over to my wife and I kissed her ever so gently on the lips and I said, "Darling, I love you very, very much.<eos> You just had a lizard."<eos> Because the thing changed colors three times.<eos> And the neck and head wouldn't work, it just kept:<eos> And I said to the doctor, "Can you put this back?<eos> "'Cause it isn't done yet. lt needs to cook another three months maybe."<eos> But the hospital made us take it home.<eos> My mother looked at it and said, "Oh, how precious."
But the reason why the curse works is because all children have brain damage.<eos> And that's what makes the parent's face look like that.<eos> Now, those of you who have no children, let me describe the brain damage.<eos> You come in the room with a Coca Cola, you set it down, you go to get a newspaper.<eos> Child comes walking in, grabs the drink, starts to... You say, "Give me that.<eos> Didn't I just tell you not to drink it?"<eos> The child says, "Uh-huh." You say, "What did I just say?"<eos> (imitating child) "You said for to not for to drink your drink."<eos> So every time I tell you that, don't I? I say,<eos> "When I have a drink, don't you drink it. Don't I say that?"
Estrella!<eos> What...<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> I dropped it.<eos> Listen, Mum.<eos> Why doesn't Dad want anyone to go in the attic?<eos> Because all the power he keeps in there would escape.<eos> That's why he locks the door?<eos> If he lost that power, he couldn't do any of the things he does.<eos> Where does he get it from?
Give it, Eiko.<eos> You know that this is supposed to be for her.<eos> - What do you mean, for her?<eos> - Why'd she give it to us?<eos> She was just being nice.<eos> Mother needs to be strong for the baby that's coming.<eos> If you eat this potato, the baby will die.<eos> Now, do you both still want it?<eos> Eiko, go on, it's all right, dear.<eos> Let your brothers have it.
The carpet matched the drapes.<eos> You found my pubic hair?<eos> I'm not pressing charges.<eos> Anything above manslaughter goes straight to the DA. It's not your call.<eos> Ma'am, step aside, please.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Ma'am, please.<eos> You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> These kids, they make one mistake, and it follows them their whole lives.
I thought it was first one to laugh!<eos> Fine.<eos> Well, then you lose that one, too.<eos> Damn your pretty robot eyes.<eos> I have practice.<eos> - Yeah, I have two five-year-old cousins.<eos> - I have a five-year-old nephew.<eos> God, they're great, right?<eos> Yeah, it's like you get to learn the whole world again from scratch. Just...<eos> I have this three-seat tandem bike that I force them to ride.
They go missing, no one's looking for them.<eos> So you're saying this whole drug trial thing was a sham or...?<eos> Well, I contacted the pharmaceutical company.<eos> The trial's legit. - Okay.<eos> - Maybe the trial is how he got to these guys.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Ken Tanner. He's got a list of people willing to undergo a drug experiment.<eos> Uh, plus he got all their vital information.<eos> So Comescu bribed him to get the names of people that wouldn't be missed.<eos> And he uses them as guinea pigs.
Well, you don't care about water... ..or the dam.<eos> So, why did you go to all this trouble?<eos> - Stevie...<eos> - Don't lie to me, Dad.<eos> Just for once in your life.<eos> Justice.<eos> When I was building my fortune in Docklands... ..who do you think tried to bully me, tried to run me out of business, threaten me if I wouldn't get out of their way?<eos> And when that didn't work, they took my eldest son, your brother, and they cut his poor body to pieces.<eos> John was murdered... ..by two Pakistani men.<eos> And you had them killed.
I swear.<eos> - No.<eos> - Come in. I'm sorry.<eos> - They're here somewhere.<eos> - It's not about permits.<eos> It's more serious than that.<eos> Well, we're investigating a crime, Miss...? Ambrose.<eos> Lizzie Ambrose.<eos> We recovered two bodies on your property this morning.<eos> - Took them out of the creek.
Well, we're investigating a crime, Miss...? Ambrose.<eos> Lizzie Ambrose.<eos> We recovered two bodies on your property this morning.<eos> - Took them out of the creek.<eos> - That's awful.<eos> That's just awful.<eos> What can I do to help?<eos> - Look at some photos of them?<eos> - Let me get my glasses.<eos> - We need to know if you recognize them.
- They were.<eos> - "Were"?<eos> - Growing marijuana on res land.<eos> About 10,000 plants.<eos> - They were growing it here?<eos> - It's good business.<eos> Plant the supply next to the customer, cut down on transportation costs.<eos> - When'd you find them?<eos> - A month ago.<eos> Arrested five Mexican migrant workers. Held them for a week.
Marty...<eos> I hope you're all happy with your decision.<eos> For ten years I have led you safely through this night.<eos> But who am I to get in the way of candy?<eos> So allow these marauders to storm our gates.<eos> What do I know?<eos> I'm only the supreme leader.<eos> - Maybe he has a point.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Husband, you're frightening them.
Happy Halloween-ween.<eos> Trick or treat!<eos> Trick or treat!<eos> Well...<eos> Did I not warn you how frightening and dangerous tonight would be?<eos> - You did.<eos> - He warned us!<eos> Who do we fear?<eos> Strangers.<eos> And when do we fear them most?
"Sincerely yours, Raphael Baena."<eos> Does that mean Pablo's son Simon has just become incredibly rich?<eos> He's known to us.<eos> Narcotics. Theft.<eos> But a multi-millionaire leaves him money?<eos> I'll put an alert out for him.<eos> His father might know where he is.<eos> Not according to the Scanner magazines.<eos> They're estranged.<eos> I don't read them. My mother does.
There's 40 there.<eos> Why should I believe you?<eos> I thought you might ask that.<eos> It's all part of the deal.<eos> Look, let's get something straight.<eos> There is no deal.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Not ever.<eos> There's actually 101 names.<eos> And I remember all of them.
I want you to move into Waabri's sector.<eos> We're gathering intel on the Libyan.<eos> He may be the key to locating the hostages.<eos> Waabri's forces are just up ahead.<eos> Whilst he lives, African union soldiers are powerless to control the area.<eos> - What are you getting out of this?<eos> - There is always business for me here.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> What business is that?<eos> - I bury the dead... shroud them for their journey home.
Friend.<eos> Old friend.<eos> "Maalin nooga madoow."<eos> "The embers of hope..." "...<eos> Glow in our children's hearts."<eos> You remembered.<eos> Everything.<eos> Then it still lives.<eos> Waabri put guns in these children's hands, but... They decided to come with us.<eos> - You won't bury them today.
I downloaded documents from the Libyan's laptop... dodgy export licenses, money trails leading back to known human rights violators, nuclear hardware components originating from British factories.<eos> I wouldn't want to find my name on that.<eos> This was never about hostages.<eos> Now I am happy to give them to you if you give section 20 a clean bill of health because anyone seriously contemplating shutting down a unit of soldiers this dedicated and this committed is a fucking...<eos> Captain, you are way out of li... enough.<eos> Quite a testimonial for section 20.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, don't let them know I said it.<eos> What about you?<eos> Whoever has those triggers... I'm fairly sure they won't be using them as paperweights.
So...<eos> We've repaired her injury.<eos> There's no more bleeding.<eos> She's in Intensive Care but she's doing well.<eos> I bought her the car.<eos> For her 21st.<eos> She didn't want it. But I thought she was just saying that.<eos> I bought her the car.<eos> Whatever we do to make our children safe, you know what?<eos> It doesn't make them safe.
Don't look at me. I'm not authorised to answer a registrar's phone.<eos> And it's disturbing my ward.<eos> Hello.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, her phone was ringing out. Yeah.<eos> I'll come now.<eos> Right now.<eos> So tell me.<eos> How would you position the heart to do the LAD graft?<eos> Slide my hand under the heart, palm up, lift the ventricles up and rotate them towards the right so that the LAD comes into view.
DC Qureshi.<eos> Can you come with me, please?<eos> What for?<eos> I'll explain on the way to the station.<eos> Guv?<eos> It's me.<eos> Des.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Jurors are in the safe house.<eos> Yeah, WPC Cutout's gonna be keeping an eye on them.
You will not believe what happened to me this weekend.<eos> I met a cute guy at a bookstore.<eos> Like anyone who goes to the bookstore, I wasn't there to buy books.<eos> I do that on the Internet at, like, 50% off and free shipping and no tax.<eos> My God.<eos> $28.95 for a book?<eos> But luckily, this time, I made an exception, because if there's one thing that I can never resist, it's a good tote bag.<eos> Hey, are you gonna buy that book?<eos> I was thinking about it.<eos> I'm only asking because I have two books and you have one. So, if we combine them, I could get a tote bag.
And who knows, maybe in the future, my enemies will become my friends.<eos> Stranger things have happened.<eos> Let's keep it down out there.<eos> Yeah, I love cupcakes.<eos> Ellis hates you, and he has herpes.<eos> - Hey, what's your problem?<eos> - My problem is you, Smellis.<eos> Ben told you to finish the website, and if you don't do it, I swear to God, I'm gonna murder you in your sleep.<eos> I know where you live.<eos> 14th street, right? I'm gonna get a melon baller and scoop your eyes out and eat them, and your congressman uncle is gonna have to buy you a dog to drag your eyeless face around.
I forgive you.<eos> And no matter what you say, I am always going to forgive you.<eos> Always.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Pretty awesome, huh?<eos> It's a brand new location, Liz.<eos> I got a subway entrance right here, and I got a tour bus stop right there.<eos> Also, FOX News is right across the street, and word is Greta Van Susteren eats hot dogs like slimer.<eos> Yeah, who's usually here?<eos> Oh, right, those creepy, off-brand sesame street characters that harass tourists into paying them to take pictures with them.
But dinosaurs were the king of the land.<eos> We imagine in science fiction what it would be like to travel to an exotic, exciting, strange alien world where these giant creatures roaming around the planet, and it happened here on Earth in our pre-history.<eos> While scientists have been studying dinosaur fossils for nearly 200 years, their theories about what these giant creatures were and how they lived often change with each new discovery.<eos> Recently, paleontologists have determined that tyrannosaurus rex was most likely covered not with scales, but with feathers.<eos> We found feathers of dinosaurs that are actually preserved in amber, and so dinosaurs, we now believe that many, if not most of them, had a feathery covering of some kind.<eos> We know they had very complex behaviors.<eos> They ate eggs that we find show that many dinosaurs made nests on the ground that they protected from predators, and they brought food to the developing young.<eos> In the past, we envisioned dinosaurs as lethargic, gigantic reptiles that were slow and sluggish.<eos> That notion has changed completely.<eos> We interpret them now as being much more active.
Ancient astronaut theorists believe that additional evidence can be found in northern Cambodia, at one of the largest temple complexes in the world, Angkor Wat.<eos> Here, among the intricate stone carvings that adorn the walls of the sacred site, researchers have been fascinated by numerous images of animals that supposedly roamed the region where the temple was built.<eos> But one, depicting what appears to be a dinosaur, has archaeologists and scholars scratching their heads.<eos> There's a temple called Ta Prohm, and it has a series of medallions that are carved into its surface and one medallion in particular has attracted attention because it looks like a stegosaurus.<eos> And so some have cited this as an example of a dinosaur that lived into historical times.<eos> It's a stegosaurus not as a skeleton, but it's a stegosaurus with its skin and muscles, as if somebody saw it while it was alive.<eos> So how is it possible that the artist was able to carve something like this?<eos> Did they receive the knowledge of something like this?<eos> There is no doubt that ancient civilizations must have encountered dinosaur remains.<eos> Many of them lived in areas where dinosaurs are very abundant and I'm sure they found them here and there.
Peru, and on these stones is these fantastic engravings.<eos> Peruvian physician Javier Cabrera began researching what have become known as the Ica stones in 1966.<eos> Ranging in size from small pebbles to large boulders,<eos> Dr. Cabrera's museum preserves over 20,000 of the strange rock carvings.<eos> All dinosaurs died about 60 millions of years ago, so normally, no human being should ever have seen a dinosaur.<eos> But there are wonderful pictures, engravings on stone, where you see humans and dinosaurs together.<eos> Sometimes the humans are even riding on the back of the dinosaurs.<eos> What we have here is an Ica burial stone, which is very unique, and what it depicts is that man and dinosaurs lived contemporaneously.<eos> We see the various triceratops, brachiosaurus and T. rex... those type of creatures.<eos> So these Icas had to either see them or they knew a lot more about the dinosaurs, because they drew them precisely.
So anyway,<eos> Lacey grabs a giant spoon to go after Athena, but Nolan stopped her and went outside and got chased up a tree by a Toyota 4Runner.<eos> And this all happened in front of a bunch of screaming little girls.<eos> Well, I think I know what the giant spoon represents.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> This wasn't a dream.<eos> So what was the final outcome?<eos> Well, you were right and I was right.<eos> I inspired Lacey with my methods, but I inspired Nolan with yours.<eos> But by using your methods, I made them mine. So it was a total victory for me.
It'll be over in a minute.<eos> Just so you know, 45% of all of these tests turn out...<eos> Here we go. Ooh.<eos> Yup.<eos> We have a heartbeat.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I... have to apologize.<eos> I never should have allowed this woman to remove these children from my classroom.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> When I found them, these children were about to fornicate in a coat closet.
Do not upset the apple cart... monkey's toes."<eos> So many English sayings to say the same thing.<eos> "Know your place and be a good boy."<eos> Good morning, doctor.<eos> They've all had a terrible night, very little sleep.<eos> Who are these men?<eos> Talk to them.<eos> They're in pain.<eos> Find out who they are, where they come from, what they want, what they miss. What they long for.<eos> Let them talk about their pain.
You are one of the lucky ones, my boy.<eos> You stand to attention when you wake.<eos> For God's sake...<eos> If you rule yourself out of the competition, don't come weeping to me if you do not win.<eos> I've never had one.<eos> Girls. I've...<eos> I've never...<eos> I don't know who I am or what I wanted to be or why I even joined up...<eos> God, this isn't my life.<eos> Did you think you would make plans, and life would follow them obediently?
Yesterday.<eos> You think the psychic knew more than she was saying?<eos> Yeah, well, if she did, I doubt her intel came from a crystal ball.<eos> Best-case scenario, she is psychic and she can just tell us who murdered Billy Keats.<eos> - And where the hell I put my keys.<eos> - I'm sure it's just a con.<eos> You know what?<eos> Cons are observant.<eos> She might've noticed something out of the ordinary.<eos> Like somebody following them, or strange behavior.
I worked closely with the designer on these.<eos> The crest on the sole was my idea.<eos> - My wife has always been a polo fan.<eos> - It's why Spencer bought the club.<eos> I still can't believe it, Billy was such a strong rider.<eos> - It's just awful.<eos> - How can we help?<eos> We're gonna need a list of everybody with a pair of these boots.<eos> That's a long list.<eos> All the players have them, but we also give them as gifts.
I'm on my way, Lily Pad.<eos> Kids, your Uncle Marshall has faced many challenges in his life.<eos> But he still considers getting up these two steps when he was this drunk to be the hardest one of all.<eos> Tell me a Marshall story. I miss him.<eos> Got it.<eos> "The Tale of the Cursed Pants."<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> So, I'm starting worry about these pants.<eos> Starting to?<eos> No, ever since I got them, terrible things I stubbed my toe, I missed my train...
But he still considers getting up these two steps when he was this drunk to be the hardest one of all.<eos> Tell me a Marshall story. I miss him.<eos> Got it.<eos> "The Tale of the Cursed Pants."<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> So, I'm starting worry about these pants.<eos> Starting to?<eos> No, ever since I got them, terrible things I stubbed my toe, I missed my train...<eos> You put on the pants.<eos> And then the lady at the thrift store said that for years, no one so much as tried them on.
You want to see my candy apple?<eos> Get your filthy hands off me!<eos> Come on, Doc.<eos> Bend me over a bread rack and pound me into shape.<eos> You're a dirty little slut with a poisonous tongue.<eos> I just want to go outside for 15 minutes in the sun. Please.<eos> I just want to feel the sun on my skin.<eos> I'll do anything. No.<eos> Whores get nothing.<eos> Men like sex, no one calls them whores. I hate that word.
Tell me the truth!<eos> I was so young when it started.<eos> My father would come into my room at night... and do things.<eos> Sometimes I felt like I was in a dream, watching him do it to a stranger, or a corpse.<eos> I finally got the courage to tell my stepmother.<eos> She gave me candy to keep quiet.<eos> There was truth to the story I told before, Kit.<eos> I loved my horses.<eos> They were my escape.<eos> I found out he sold them all.
The ones from Danzig's car appeared to be opened, and then someone used a lighter to reseal them.<eos> I analyzed the salts in the GCMS and found that the resealed packets had a lot more than taurine and caffeine in them.<eos> 4-Methylephedrone.<eos> Designer drug that just got added to the Controlled Substances Act.<eos> Street name is MCAT or Drone.<eos> The trace that Sid found on the victim's face and nose?<eos> Sale for human consumption has been made illegal. But another way to get around that is to...<eos> Sell it as fertilizer for people's gardens.<eos> Exactly. So this drug makes the kids concentrate and focus better.<eos> It makes them feel invincible.
I know what it's like to be the one to keep the family together.<eos> It's a tough job. Don't make it tougher.<eos> If you know who did this, tell me.<eos> I don't know who did this.<eos> It's tough when you lose somebody.<eos> But you still carry them with you.<eos> I mean, your memories and... Choices you make in life.<eos> You made him those cool cufflinks, didn't you?<eos> At school in crafts.<eos> I gave them to Lem for being promoted.
The only disadvantage we have is that she is short, she has short arms, she attacks constantly.<eos> But when this one throws a right cross?<eos> She'll send her?<eos> ying.<eos> Besides, she knows she can't loose.<eos> Then we are going to La Pampa, we have a tough fight there.<eos> That's where we have to win.<eos> - Have you talked with Almada? - Yeah.<eos> What did he say about the gloves?<eos> Don't you know if he's bringing them?
- No problem.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Let's go get that blanket.<eos> Did Detective Bowen check out with the Boston PD?<eos> Yeah.<eos> His boss wasn't exactly shocked he was up here.<eos> Sounds like Bowen goes his own way.<eos> Have you ever had outside cops poking around Haven's Troubles before?<eos> Occasionally.<eos> Sometimes we keep them.
We do.<eos> And every second we stand here arguing about it, Nix gets further away.<eos> You want that on your head?<eos> You're lucky I hate the feds.<eos> If this guy gets away, it will be the least of your worries.<eos> Closest offspring are here and here.<eos> The guy packed a damn lunch.<eos> I don't think he's gonna go after his own kids first, not unless he has to.<eos> They're his last resort.<eos> Otherwise he would have killed them already.
But then I saw those photos of all of those kids at the fertility clinic, all of those kids that would die, or worse, and I knew... I knew that you were the only answer.<eos> So I thought if you could see the kind of monster that we were dealing with...<eos> This wasn't your decision to make.<eos> You're right.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Whatever happens, I'll deal with it.<eos> Yeah, you're damn right you will.<eos> Are all of these all Nix's victims?<eos> Yeah, he's been busy.<eos> Teams we sent to search for his offspring found them.
I am 50 frequent-flyer points away from a weekend at the Ojai Valley spa, which means...<eos> Hot stone massage and cactus oil.<eos> Thank you so much for breakfast. You're very welcome.<eos> Now, between that kiss and this ice tea, I better reapply my lip gloss.<eos> - Owen, look.<eos> - What?<eos> There are two bodyguards by the restroom.<eos> In L.A., that can only mean one thing.<eos> There is a celebrity going potty.<eos> Well, if it's Paris Hilton, she's probably calling the paparazzi and begging them to get here.
You're good at this... breaking and entering.<eos> My parents are proud.<eos> Thanks for meeting me, Dr. Santino.<eos> I didn't know who else to talk to.<eos> This thing with Gonzo... out of control.<eos> Has he contacted you again?<eos> No.<eos> I'm talking about his slump.<eos> He went 0-fer last night.<eos> He saw 12 pitches, swung, and missed all of them.
Who does that? !<eos> What are you doing?<eos> And what did you do to my Rebecca Lobo basketball?<eos> ! You can't take my stuff!<eos> Well, I already did, so, boo-hoo.<eos> Looks like you're gonna have to use your superior brain to try and win another way.<eos> Maybe you should be outside trying to catch a bird. Oh, wait.<eos> You're scared of birds. Ha.<eos> Okay, first of all, I'm not scared of birds, okay?<eos> They're just gross, disgusting, unnatural, and I hate them.
Could you grab me a basket on top of the fridge that I need in a minute?<eos> Can't reach stuff with your little dinosaur arms, huh?<eos> No problem.<eos> Human man coming through.<eos> Oh, my stars, what do we have here?<eos> Seriously, you're not scared at all?<eos> That's terrible.<eos> I was a night watchman at a doll factory, Kate.<eos> Nothing scares me.<eos> Look, I know you're trying to camouflage all her flaws, but I just feel like you're accentuating them.
".22 caliber smaller gun, $100, .45 caliber, $150.<eos> Guy on the corner of Washington and D has other pieces."<eos> And you went with a .45.<eos> I didn't buy a gun.<eos> I wanted one, just to scare these guys away from Tina and Eli.<eos> The guy on the corner, he wouldn't even sell it to me.<eos> The guy on the corner, what's he, a gun-control advocate?<eos> 'Cause you bought a gun, shot the reverend, then you went to Cliff's.<eos> I wanted them dead!<eos> Warrick would've wanted them dead.
It was right here.<eos> Right with the others.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Sometimes you can learn a lot about a person by looking at their bookshelves.<eos> And what have you learned?<eos> A lot of science fiction...<eos> Asimov.<eos> High-school yearbooks, which is odd for a man shank's age.<eos> He's either sentimental or living in the past.<eos> For years, the county has been taking Cheyenne children off the reservation and placing them in homes run by white men and white women.
I expect them to leave politics out of it when we're dealing with missing kids.<eos> Kids?<eos> Plural?<eos> Did Ryan shank ever call you about Neel's file?<eos> Not yet.<eos> It sounded like there was a lot of red tape involved.<eos> He lied. The file was in his office the entire time.<eos> Was shank up to something?<eos> He's missing, along with two boys from the group home.<eos> You think he took them?
Right at midnight, as grandma always said.<eos> How did you know it was him?<eos> I saw his face.<eos> And what did he look like?<eos> He looks like a soldier.<eos> He had a scar right through here.<eos> Each dog soldier wore a leather strap.<eos> They would stake that strap to the ground and fight to the death.<eos> These men were figures of defiance, figures of hope.<eos> The U.S. army hunted them down one by one, but there were rumors of one remaining survivor.
Just a shame that visions never hold up in your courts.<eos> Hector...<eos> This is me letting you go.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm concerned.<eos> Did you get a concussion last night?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Then why else would you let our prime suspect go?<eos> The boys were returned to the red pony while Hector was in custody.<eos> By who?<eos> They all claim the dog soldier took them and brought them back.
Here's what's confusing.<eos> Ryan made a phone call, 10:34, alive and well.<eos> Called you.<eos> I told you we talked that night.<eos> Ryan had just been assaulted.<eos> The boys had been kidnapped. Why call you?<eos> Why not my Deputy?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He called to tell you someone had discovered your scam.<eos> You take Cheyenne kids from their families and place them in shank's group home and collect the federal money.
Legally, it's the perfect crime.<eos> But there's something you're forgetting.<eos> Hector.<eos> He knows about your scam, crystal.<eos> He also knows you tried to frame him for murder.<eos> Right.<eos> He'll make a great witness.<eos> The scar-faced Indian who kidnapped those boys.<eos> The boys said it wasn't him.<eos> They say a dog soldier abducted them.
That's about three more jeopardized gunboats than I'd expect.<eos> Thank God we brought the bus driver. Huh?<eos> Seymour, what are you doing here?<eos> Taking four children across town to investigate a piece of paper we found on the ground.<eos> Don't you have better things to do?<eos> Sadly, no.<eos> Same old Seymour.<eos> I know why they're here.<eos> Because they can't let me have a secret.<eos> It drives them crazy.
How?<eos> I made him that way... Before he was even born.<eos> So you... you made him a Lowen?<eos> I altered his genetic material...<eos> I added to it. So he's both a Genio Innocuo and Lowen?<eos> Yes.<eos> He never knew, though.<eos> He still doesn't know.<eos> When the Lowen presents, he doesn't even know it's happening.<eos> Pierce never would have hurt his friends, but the Lowen must've seen them as a threat.
And now we can follow the journey through the fallopian tubes as the fertilized egg moves down to the uterus where it implants, causing the woman to become... With child.<eos> Tomorrow evening, we'll discuss the signs of preg... Being with child and the development of the baby in the womb.<eos> And hopefully we'll put to rest some of our more cherished superstitions.<eos> Thank you all for coming.<eos> I wish someone had told me all this when I was 13.<eos> I wouldn't have thought I was dying.<eos> I'm glad you found the class helpful.<eos> Not quite the turnout we'd hoped for.<eos> I've had new flyers made.<eos> I'll distribute them tomorrow.
And us.<eos> So you're going to Washington.<eos> That's where the money is.<eos> Willie Sutton.<eos> He was a bank robber, famous.<eos> Some reporter once asked him why he robbed banks.<eos> "That's where the money is."<eos> Same principle, I guess.<eos> If there's no need for me here, I'll saddle up and ride to the next opportunity.<eos> Those boys in D.C., I knew them all in Austin.
Whatever it takes.<eos> It just became my mission in life to put you behind bars. All of you.<eos> We're not just running.<eos> As soon as we get someplace safe, we're gonna sit down and figure out a way to fix all of this.<eos> I promise you I'll make this right.<eos> We got a problem, Mike.<eos> One of the cars is missing, and I can't find your mom.<eos> Where'd she go?<eos> Pretty flowers.<eos> I didn't bring them.

And if I am wrong... ..Miss Audrey will relieve me of my position.<eos> The dress is called the tea gown, ma'am, because it's worn without a corset, for comfort, for day-time entertaining.<eos> The soft lines give the dress an especially feminine quality.<eos> In France, it is known as the "cinq-a-sept", the hours when a lady might receive suitors.<eos> It is beautiful, ma'am, with its lace edging and dome silk-covered buttons.<eos> Silk bows on the front and on the cuffs.<eos> I'm sure we could have it delivered to your home for you to try on so you could see how it might look on you.<eos> In a month, this dress will be the talk of the town, just as it's the talk of Paris now.<eos> I've already spoken to my partners, and they're all of one voice.<eos> Retail makes them nervous.
I've known Dudley since we were boys, starting out together.<eos> There's no cunning in him.<eos> I could not get close enough to hear their conversation without being noticed.<eos> But I know the landlord of the Three Crowns and I passed him a small sum to help me with that.<eos> I was best man at his wedding.<eos> I sit at his dining table with him and his children.<eos> I find it almost impossible to doubt Dudley.<eos> The point is, sir, he seems to doubt you.<eos> There were four suppliers there.<eos> He appeared to be warning them they may not get paid for the orders you placed with them.
Ooh, Denise is in love!<eos> I fear we will all fall in love, Sam.<eos> It's not for me to say what you see, sir, but I see pastry.<eos> I see gravy.<eos> Sam, these birds have come a long way.<eos> At great expense.<eos> So we must treasure them.<eos> What I thought was, we'll price them so that we sell very few.

In the light of the last 24 hours, we had to check it out.<eos> And the dogs do love a run out.<eos> Hello.<eos> Kate Stewart, head of scientific research at UNIT.<eos> And with dress sense like that... BLEEPING DOUBLE HEARTBEAT<eos> ..you must be the Doctor. I hoped it would be you.<eos> Tell me, since when did science run the military, Kate?<eos> Since me.<eos> UNIT's been adapting.<eos> Well, I dragged them along, kicking and screaming, which made it sound like more fun than it actually was.

Always intact. That's impressive.

Will you tell your colleague here that I...<eos> Stop!<eos> Hey!<eos> Doctor, it's me.<eos> Hello!<eos> Er... So, the UN classified the cubes as provisionally safe, whatever that means, and Banksy and Damien Hirst put out statements saying the cubes are nothing to do with them.<eos> And the cubes, well, they're just... here.<eos> Still.<eos> What's it been, nine months?<eos> People are just taking them for granted.
I can disconnect all the Shakri craft from their portals, leave them drifting in the darkspace.<eos> Ah, but all those people who were near the cubes, so many of them will have died.<eos> I restarted one of your hearts.<eos> You'd need mass defibrillation.<eos> Of course.<eos> Ah, beautiful, but, Ponds, Ponds!<eos> We are going to go one better than that.<eos> The Shakri used the cubes to turn people's hearts off.<eos> Bingo!<eos> We're going to use them to turn them back on again.
You seem a little nervous.<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah, no. It's just a lot of pressure, and I want everything to be perfect.<eos> So... But when do I get to see you alone?<eos> That's all I care about.<eos> Not soon enough.<eos> Although, I, uh, imagine you wanna spend some time with your friends.<eos> So are they from Vassar or did you, uh, grow up with them in Wisconsin?<eos> Uh, Wisconsin.<eos> And I'm--I'm so sorry I didn't tell you that I invited them.
Yeah?<eos> It won't like that.<eos> Almost got my ass shot.<eos> She ain't a woman to be messed with.<eos> True.<eos> True, she ain't.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> If I could have a quiet word, please.<eos> My personal ledgers... How damning are they?<eos> You ask because you have lost them, hmm?

Never forget to put yourselves in the shoes of the people we serve, and not just the victims, but the perpetrators as well.<eos> They're all deserving of our mercy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There you are.<eos> Ma'am, your drink.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, little lady, can I get another scotch?<eos> I'm telling you, Laurie, the shorter they make these hemlines, the more these drunks think we're on the menu.<eos> Don't knock it till you try it.<eos> Not even this stops them!
This team is really important to Chris.<eos> With all due respect ma'am, Chris has missed too many practices. Now, in competition, a track team is only...<eos> You tell Chris he better bust his butt.<eos> [knocking]<eos> Just a second!<eos> Bro, you missed the sickest launch party for Dead Risen.<eos> I have been trying to beat that sucker 24/7 every night since.<eos> Dude, speak English. 24/7 every night?<eos> Well, see my mom's doing her night school thing again, so I'm hiding my controllers.<eos> I mean, she hides them when she goes out so I figured, why not hide them from her first?
Downey!<eos> I got this, Major.<eos> Mary.<eos> Pete, you okay?<eos> This was, uh, my wife's idea.<eos> Said she saw something about it on TV and thought it'd be good for me.<eos> Well, clearly she cares about you.<eos> Well, she's had divorce papers drawn up and ready to be signed for over a year now.<eos> Says that I'm not the same man she married. No shit.<eos> If she hasn't signed them, she must still have hope.
Shall we?<eos> Wait.<eos> If these beans... create... portals, why not just pick one and go home?<eos> Why the compass?<eos> Because there aren't any more beans.<eos> Whatever story you think you know, my dear, is most certainly wrong.<eos> There was a guy named Jack and a cow and something about an evil giant with a treasure and a golden goose.<eos> Or harp.<eos> Sounds like a lovely tale, but the truth's a little bit more gruesome.<eos> The giants grew the beans, but rather than use them for good, they used them to plunder all the lands.
Um... okay.<eos> Uh... so, it says here when you were arrested that they found several scratches on your arms.<eos> I volunteer at an animal hospital. T-they were from a cat.<eos> And they also found two drops of Brittney's blood on your pants?<eos> Back in February, before this all happened, the swim team was in Santa Clarita for a meet. On the bus, Brittney got a nosebleed. A few drops must have gotten on my pants.<eos> Wait a minute. Are these wool sailor pants?<eos> Yeah, why?<eos> Brittney was killed two weeks ago.<eos> It's spring. There's no way you'd be wearing wool sailor pants in spring.<eos> I haven't worn them since February.
I mean, she's the one girl Ricky chose and she's gay?<eos> It's genetic, you know.<eos> So it really could be true.<eos> Amy Juergens could be gay.<eos> No, that's not true.<eos> They haven't identified a gay gene.<eos> Still, I doubt youould put off marrying Ricky for another year if you weren't gay. And the Fourth of July is such a gay day.<eos> Fireworks.<eos> Sparklers. Parades.<eos> Sounds as if you've taken a couple of stereotypical images and gone to the limit with them. Yeah.
Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Your finances are a mess, Betty.<eos> The money from your late husband's insurance policy-- long gone.<eos> You couldn't make next month's rent.<eos> $2 million in stolen diamonds would have kept you living in style for a long time.<eos> What was he thinking?<eos> An old man walking around with all those jewels?<eos> He was begging for it.<eos> How did you know he carried them on him?
Place is empty.<eos> According to the building manager, they took off late last night.<eos> Any word on where they were going?<eos> No forwarding address, but they told the manager they were headed to Mexico to visit family.<eos> And we also tracked down the van that was used in the robbery.<eos> It was torched pretty bad.<eos> Yeah, it doesn't look like we're gonna get anything form it.<eos> All right.<eos> Flag the Arroyo brothers with customs.<eos> If they're on their way to Mexico, maybe we can get them before they cross the border.
That means that, until you behave, you'll be speaking at the Regional Senior Center of Greater Morton Grove.<eos> I've never heard of that.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Miss Hayward.<eos> Mr. Gold.<eos> You seem busy.<eos> Yes, we're preparing for a straw poll this weekend.<eos> It means everything and nothing.<eos> Why everything?<eos> Well, the straw poll votes don't actually count for anything, but if we don't get them, the press will say we're...
please give me these dried persimmons.<eos> You want these dried persimmons as your reward?<eos> Yes, Your Highness.<eos> As you promised me a reward, these dried persimmons,<eos> let me eat them.<eos> I promised you a big reward.<eos> Will these dried persimmons be enough?<eos> Yes, Your Highness.<eos> To me at this moment, I need these... more than anything else in the world.<eos> Please, let me take them as my reward.
That doesn't mean that somebody else didn't finish the job.<eos> You going to answer your phone?<eos> Victoria.<eos> Don't think me intrusive, but I see that you're awake.<eos> I was just turning in.<eos> Well, I thought the events of the day might be keeping you up.<eos> No, it's the reporters that keep knocking on my door.<eos> They saw me leaving Grayson Manor earlier.<eos> They want to know everything.<eos> Well, I trust you staved them off.
We gotta have Tracy play ts guy on the show. He looks exactly like him.<eos> I was thinking we would just lay off the political stuff.<eos> Liz, he's right.<eos> That guy looks exactly like Tracy.<eos> Did you guys see?<eos> I'm on TV but now I'm old. Oh, God, Liz Lemon.<eos> It's happening to you, too.<eos> Okay, fine. The guy looks like Tracy. But what's the joke?<eos> Ooh, I'm going to have to take a moment here.<eos> I sat on my testicles earlier and the heft of my body smashed them to smithereens. Okay.
I couldn't sleep.<eos> But I'm fine.<eos> You need to sleep, Peter.<eos> - On the move.<eos> - Rolling.<eos> We're okay.<eos> This is tape five of my plan to defeat the Observers.<eos> This is what you must achieve next.<eos> These cylinders were designed by the invaders.<eos> They are beacons that allow them to locate different points in spacetime.
He worked for them.<eos> He worked for them!<eos> Walter, that's from the movie Marathon Man.<eos> Huh. You called me in Boston.<eos> You told me that you were ready to implement the plan but that you needed my help to do so.<eos> Then you sent me to Grand Central Station to collect the thought unifier.<eos> And by the time I got to you and Astrid, you were with William Bell, but then the Observers found us, and we realized that the only way they could have known where we were is if he told them.<eos> That's when you ambered us.<eos> So if Bell led the Observers to you, how can we be sure that the cylinders were even there to begin with?<eos> Or if he even had them?
I don't doubt that.<eos> But wherever you think this gift came from or whoever you think bestowed it upon you it's simply an anomaly.<eos> I know that because I'm an anomaly.<eos> I've moved things with my mind I've lit things on fire, I've caught bullets midair.<eos> I've seen things that people only dream about.<eos> I've seen the seams between universes ripped apart. Things that humans shouldn't see.<eos> People make up explanations assign meaning to things without knowing because it's reassuring, it's comforting.<eos> But I can't do that because I know too much.<eos> It's all just numbers.<eos> And the invaders, as you call them they're just better at math than we are.
So, you feel lucky?<eos> Okay, okay!<eos> They call themselves the kraang.<eos> They been grabbing scientists from all over the city.<eos> Well, that worked pretty good.<eos> Of course it did. Would you wanna look like Mikey?<eos> I'm right here.<eos> What do they want with scientists?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All I know is they're taking them out of the city tonight, but I don't know where!
You're making fun of me for not mercilessly pummeling a helpless man.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> You showed weakness.<eos> Those guys only understand one language.<eos> Chinese?<eos> - No.<eos> Fists.<eos> - What about feet?<eos> They understand feet.<eos> That would make them bilingual. Argh!
Jonas, you must stop this.<eos> They are to be married.<eos> Why can't you try and be happy for them?<eos> She sees me as distasteful, a monster.<eos> Such easy judgement with so little knowledge of the beast she set out to slaughter.<eos> Before this, I was a safety miner.<eos> There was an explosion one day.<eos> Eight men were trapped underground. They told us to leave them.<eos> I refused, went back.<eos> Before I could reach them, the shaft collapsed.
Look, if you didn't wanna help, you could've just said something.<eos> It's not like that, Scarlett, all right?<eos> I know you don't like him very much, but you didn't have to... why does everyone keep saying that?<eos> What am I supposed to do, hand him a balloon every time I see him?<eos> I like him fine.<eos> It's got nothing to do with him.<eos> Then why would you tell a manager not to sign him?<eos> Bec...<eos> Marilyn only reps good-looking guys under 30.<eos> She only signs them. After a certain closeness has been established.
I don't know what the percentage is. It's small.<eos> Miniscule, even.<eos> But if I take her off life support, what if she's in that small percentage?<eos> What if the next day, she would've opened her eyes?<eos> You hear about it all the time.<eos> People just wake up.<eos> And she's such a fighter.<eos> We went on this cleanse once for three weeks.<eos> Day two, she comes home and catches me scarfing down a box of cookies.<eos> I mean, literally inhaling them.
kind of PlayStation game.<eos> You with me?<eos> Brilliant, I'll get them tomorrow.<eos> Safe.<eos> He sells PlayStation games.<eos> Oh, my back is killing me.<eos> I'll ask Steve to drop off some of those prescription painkillers for you.<eos> Dylan told us what happened with Nina.<eos> Well, what can you do, Lorna?<eos> Fate gives with the one hand, and with the other hand pops his fingers into your backside, pulls your intestines out and douses them with acid.
Fly back out?<eos> Ah, I was kinda thinking we'd just try to make it to the plane without being ripped to pieces.<eos> As a first step.<eos> Well, if there are any dinosaurs, I'm sure you shouting your face off let them know we're here.<eos> Well, maybe it's our lucky day.<eos> Oh, correction... night.<eos> What in hell are we going to tell the people on the plane?<eos> Well, first off, let's just hope someone survived.<eos> A tranq gun?<eos> Giant man-eating monsters come out of the anomalies, and you put them to sleep?
If it weren't for him, I could be dead now.<eos> So maybe you could trust him a little?<eos> Here.<eos> You told me to turn off the flashlight.<eos> I thought nocturnal creatures stay away from light?<eos> Cockroaches do, moths don't.<eos> Beetles are all over the scale, so I took a guess.<eos> Well, that's comforting.<eos> Those beetles have long antennae, which means they have bad eyesight.<eos> I figured the light was helping them find you.

What is this?<eos> A toy gun?<eos> It's an air soft gun...<eos> Here.<eos> So how much are they paying you to kill me?<eos> Who? !<eos> Why are you with Che Sausage's men?<eos> They're following me. Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They were going to kill me and I talked them out of it saying that I'd find you.
No flirting, you two.<eos> You are so pretty, Charles.<eos> That's not my name. Oh!<eos> You look so much like my third husband.<eos> We're here to talk about the robbery, ma'am.<eos> Robbery? Mm-hmm.<eos> The one the police talked to you about a few days ago.<eos> Someone broke into your old house and stole a stack of bearer bonds and, uh, some jewelry that you stashed under your floorboards.<eos> Oh, my diamonds, yes.<eos> I hid them there.
Rafael?<eos> All right, if there's an answering machine, we need to listen to it, and we need to check out Rafael's room.<eos> Just his phone.<eos> Rafael?<eos> Nick, she says she knows who took Rafael.<eos> He says that she doesn't know, and she's not helping.<eos> Let her talk.<eos> - What's La Llorona?<eos> - The weeping woman.<eos> It's a ghost story about a dead woman who steals children and drowns them.
That completes the symbol you showed us,<eos> - where does she drown the kids?<eos> - I don't know. The bodies are always found downriver, way beyond where they were taken.<eos> That could be miles of river.<eos> The Columbia flows all the way to the ocean.<eos> Unless the river's embrace is a place.<eos> Abrazo. Abrazo,the embrace.<eos> Brazos is "arms."<eos> We embrace something with our arms... the rivers are the arms, and where they meet, that would be the embrace.<eos> So she drowns them where the rivers meet... the confluence.
I'm not some kind of freak.<eos> There's nothing out of the ordinary about me.<eos> There is one thing.<eos> I'm having sex with her face from a distance and she doesn't even know it.<eos> Come on.<eos> That was the only way Robin van Persie was ever gonna get a facial.<eos> And he's back.<eos> That's right, Knutsford.<eos> Backer than before!<eos> By the way, I don't know what was in your weird-looking ice cubes, but I put them in here because your ice cube tray was mouldy.
Any more death threats?<eos> Just a couple.<eos> Someone's got a picture of my face and put a Hitler moustache on it.<eos> And devil horns, which I think shows how confused they are.<eos> I don't hate gay people, Josie. Do you believe me?<eos> I believe you don't hate gay people.<eos> I think you just hated that one guy because he had a gay magazine.<eos> I love gay people.<eos> Yeah, but in a Christian way.<eos> Like, I love them, but they're unnatural and they'll burn in hell.
Okay, now, see, um, enthusiasm will factor into your scores.<eos> So, I say again:<eos> Lily, spin...<eos> Spin that wheel!<eos> Ooh. Our demise.<eos> Barney, how would you explain to little Marvin why we're not around anymore?<eos> No.<eos> Easy, all I'd have to do is change a few words to one of my classics with the ladies.<eos> The President of the World has called your parents away on a super-secret space mission.<eos> For the sake of the planet, you will never see them again.
So paranoid. I know.<eos> I told him to relax.<eos> Everything's under control.<eos> - What the hell was that? - Ha, ha.<eos> I upgraded your tracker with a little voltage spike to the sciatic nerve.<eos> Makes running a little bit ouch.<eos> I thought torture was Amanda's thing.<eos> You're lucky you didn't have one of Amanda's trackers.<eos> They were paired with kill chips. Drop an agent like that if they got out of line.<eos> We deactivated them. Every last one of them.
Possible breeding.<eos> Ability to father children is something we think she's looking for in her victims.<eos> They're all age appropriate, and they are all fathers.<eos> But why kill the last victim?<eos> She may have seen him as being flawed.<eos> He was the least physically fit of the 4, and he neglected to pay child support.<eos> Making him undesirable.<eos> The victims may be surrogates for a man that she wants but she cannot have.<eos> Because she killed the last victim, we have to consider the possibility that the unsub is engaged in some sort of elimination process.<eos> Preselecting a handful of prime candidates and then whittling them down one by one until she has her ideal breeding partner.
Oh, yeah. She, uh... She did a couple episodes of Bryan's show.<eos> Mm? She's also the voice of our outgoing message.<eos> Ah. I always thought that was Bryan.<eos> You know, I'm...<eos> I'm really proud of you, son.<eos> The life that you've built here with your partner, the baby on the way... it's amazing stuff.<eos> Amazing.<eos> There you are, David.<eos> I can't find your serving spoons. Oh, yeah.<eos> I'll-I'll get them for you.
Wasn't that 18 years ago?<eos> It has really been a long time.<eos> Why are you still this beautiful?<eos> Aren't all the first loves in this world very pretty?<eos> You haven't changed one bit.<eos> I've mellowed a lot since I'm older now.<eos> Everyone's doing well?<eos> I heard that the 4 of you are still together everyday.<eos> Who says we don't have other friends?<eos> I won't see them if you don't like it.
Guys?<eos> Guys! No. Bryan.<eos> He's constantly on that thing.<eos> David, you are on your phone almost as much as I'm on mine.<eos> I am a doctor.<eos> I have patients who need me.<eos> Yeah, you are trying to buy a golf putter on eBay.<eos> Hey! I bring life into the world.<eos> Well, I inform and entertain millions.<eos> Who wouldn't be here if I didn't bring them into the world. Well... Oh!
No, she really did.<eos> In her Connecticut farmhouse.<eos> She rendered the tallow fat from her beloved but slower-moving pets, and then she added vanilla beans and then she poured it all into molds.<eos> And yeah, so we're good.<eos> Still, without the technological advances of modern science, we wouldn't have antibiotics, refrigerated foods, public sanitation.<eos> Our life expectancy would be 38.<eos> Ticktock, fellas.<eos> Well, these tomatoes look fabulous.<eos> Are these from the farmers' market?<eos> No, I got them from the neighbors across the way.
I mean, uh...<eos> Huh?<eos> What's that, Dash?<eos> Come on. We got plenty of time before Able gets back.<eos> Everything will get done.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Okay, now you can worry.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> My tanks have been sabotaged by that perfidious provocateur the Renegade.<eos> I need them repaired immediately.
I tried to tell myself the gun was just there so he'd give me the keys to the safe.<eos> But... I knew.<eos> I had already gone too far.<eos> I gotta hand it to her.<eos> She played you all.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Francesca.<eos> She just confessed.<eos> Once Jeremy's work went into cold storage, she knew he'd sneak back into the lab to steal his seeds.<eos> That's why she switched them out first, so she could sell them for herself on the black market.
Brian's symptoms-- the jaundice, the hair loss, the high blood pressure-- coupled with a hepatic lesion, it's all consistent with, uh, the use of anabolic steroids.<eos> What?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Brian...<eos> - Are you taking steroids?<eos> - No.<eos> Have you noticed changes in behavior, uh, moodiness, depression...<eos> Shut up!<eos> Just shut up!<eos> I said I don't take them.
Since Morgan drafted me.<eos> Really?<eos> Why?<eos> Don't let the skinny geek thing fool you.<eos> I know the good doctor's deceptively athletic.<eos> Oh, it's deceptive, all right.<eos> Blake, what did you find out?<eos> None of the pet owners had much.<eos> Each of their dogs just disappeared from their yard.<eos> But he did get into their yards unnoticed, so that means he stalked them and knew their patterns.
How adorable! Is it Tabu perfume?<eos> Open it.<eos> I think you'll be pleased.<eos> Well, knowing you, it's probably some cheap toilet water from the Woolworth's. Yardley's Lavender.<eos> Christ, why even get my hopes up.<eos> Well... la-dee-da.<eos> Mother of God, are they real?<eos> Very.<eos> Rubies are the most glamorous of all.<eos> You couldn't have found them in this dreary town.
Very.<eos> Rubies are the most glamorous of all.<eos> You couldn't have found them in this dreary town.<eos> Are they family heirlooms?<eos> They belonged to a Jewess in the camp.<eos> She was always reminding people that she was a woman of considerable means, and that her husband was an influential and wealthy doctor in Berlin.<eos> She was constantly complaining to me about her stomach problems, and as a doctor, I thought I ought to do something about it.<eos> So I followed her, one day, to the latrine, thinking I might diagnose her condition if I had a stool sample.<eos> She was in there, on her hands and knees, picking through her own feces to retrieve those earrings.<eos> She confessed to me that she swallowed them every day, day after day, carrying them around inside of her, as if, someday, she might return to her former grandeur.

Poor, ridiculous woman, she died from internal bleeding.<eos> The earrings were very hard on her intestines.<eos> Obviously, I retrieved them.<eos> I knew someday I'd meet someone who was worthy of their exceptional beauty.<eos> You were very clever to retrieve them, Arthur.<eos> Look how beautiful they are on me.<eos> They bring out the rose in my cheeks.<eos> Oh... you're such a sap.<eos> Not exactly for the reasons you may think, but a sap nonetheless.<eos> I so dearly hoped you'd throw them back in my face, that you couldn't bring yourself to touch those shit-stained earrings.
How many bodies so far?<eos> Three.<eos> They all appear to be female.<eos> Another desiccated fern leaf.<eos> Unless these bodies were buried in the Jurassic age,<eos> - they're not from around here.<eos> - And neither's this dark, rich soil.<eos> Could be that the bodies were buried somewhere else, and then moved here.<eos> Look at that-- military sure took off in a hell of a hurry.<eos> I think you scared them, Finn.
If I may make a suggestion, Captain. We start by speaking with the people who were the last to have seen the victims alive.<eos> Good idea.<eos> Joe and I were friends for over 20 years.<eos> This would be Joe Newell, the pilot?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Were you very familiar with the passengers?<eos> Walter Devlin flew with us quite a bit.<eos> But that was mostly for cases that he or his law firm were taking on.<eos> What about his associates? Uh, Hank Gerrard and Ellie Wilson?<eos> Yeah, they accompanied him once or twice, but I never actually met them.
Totally.<eos> Totally.<eos> Have you been a good little girl this year?<eos> Can you believe this?<eos> Another mall Santa, and no Krampus.<eos> What the hell is Krampus? Krampus.<eos> Yeah, saying it louder doesn't help.<eos> The mythical creature recognized in Germanic cultures?<eos> Krampus accompanies St. Nick everywhere he goes, and St.<eos> Nick rewards the kids by giving them presents, but Krampus punishes them by shoving them into his sack, bringing them back to his lair and devouring them for Christmas dinner.
You don't want to hate yourself by making your dad lose when there's a chance you could help your dad win.<eos> Okay.<eos> Best not to say I was here.<eos> You weren't here.<eos> I am ready to rule.<eos> This trial has been, above all, angering.<eos> I believe the defense-- the ostensible defense-- at the moment it seems to be the prosecution-- they have resorted to rank character assassination.<eos> They have inflicted on Judge Harrison Creary a personal examination that none of us could survive. They...<eos> They have dug through his confessions.<eos> They have subpoenaed innocent bystanders and forced them to testify.
I wired half the money to a Swiss bank account and got a phone number in return, and the rest was due after.<eos> I tried to call it off, but the number stopped working after the book signing.<eos> And Santiago?<eos> I tried to call him yesterday, tell him I changed my mind, but... he always hated you, honey.<eos> Yeah, he said I should consider it a favor.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> You said you want to go home.<eos> That's where we're going.<eos> You-- you said they'd be expecting us there.<eos> If we can't call off the dogs, we'll bring them to us.
It's $700.<eos> What the sh... Shut your face.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Baller move, springing for the giraffe lamp on a social worker's salary.<eos> She's gonna have to do a lot of filthy things to work that off.<eos> Technically, he's not just on a social worker's salary.<eos> I knew it.<eos> He's not helping those kids, he's selling them.
What matters is that after we win this war, we're all going home to lead healthy, long lives.<eos> To our families.<eos> That's why I joined this project in the first place.<eos> To protect my daughters.<eos> Our country. Dr. Chandler?<eos> Is everything okay with Lafferty?<eos> You know, we haven't seen her since she went down<eos> I mean, what happened?<eos> You created us and you never mentioned these side effects.<eos> We didn't expect them.
Only the women.<eos> Why?<eos> You don't need to know why.<eos> Just bring them here.<eos> Why does he want those files?<eos> And only about women?<eos> Have you brought them?<eos> Yes, Magistrate.<eos> As you know, there has been no magistrate in this town for over 3 years.<eos> Even if there were cases, no one reported them.
Come.<eos> Please.<eos> Get in.<eos> Put these blindfolds on.<eos> Why the hell will we do that?<eos> Zhou has many enemies.<eos> Better you don't know how to find him.<eos> Well, this should be fun.<eos> How fast can they pull these things?<eos> Depends who's chasing them.
Not without consulting me, you wouldn't.<eos> Because why on earth would you?<eos> Much obliged.<eos> Why wasn't I consulted?<eos> I'm Secretary of State.<eos> And you informally send a reactionary dotard to...<eos> What will happen, do you imagine, when these peace commissioners arrive?<eos> We'll hear them out.<eos> Splendid.<eos> And next, the Democrats will invite them up to hearings on the Hill.
For my family.<eos> Our animals are worth far more abroad than here in India.<eos> And if the town council stops supporting us... I don't know where we will be.<eos> So, it is what we have to do.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I'm sorry, what are we talking about?<eos> We are leaving India.<eos> What?<eos> We are selling the zoo.<eos> The zoo was never ours to sell. The land belongs to the town. But the animals are ours and if we sell them... we will have enough to start a new life.
All right, men, cut the chatter.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Would you look at that!<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Just like in the newsreels.<eos> Keep your eyes peeled for the Jerries.<eos> Bogies inbound, twelve o'clock.<eos> And they're closing in mighty fast!<eos> These pilots are rookies!<eos> Make quick work of them.
I've made so many mistakes.<eos> No, you've made one big mistake.<eos> That self-pity of yours, that's your weakness.<eos> But it ends right here, right now.<eos> You man up, you lead your squad.<eos> Every decision that you make isn't gonna always be the right one.<eos> All right, this is it.<eos> For the first time, the bombers are going all the way to Berlin.<eos> They'll be up against 109s and 262s the new jet fighters.<eos> Unfortunately, we're only going to escort them on the first leg of their mission, so I don't expect you'll see much action.
Kill him.<eos> And anyone that's with him.<eos> You gotta sober up, 'mam.<eos> Alright?<eos> It could be today.<eos> What did he tell you, kid?<eos> He told you nothing!<eos> Look. There's five men.<eos> He has killed them once.<eos> Now he must kill them again.
I want to kiss your tush!<eos> Nice, but maybe a little more square footage.<eos> I want a lot of monsters here.<eos> I'm gonna get you, little Mavis.<eos> I'm gonna get you!<eos> What out there?<eos> We never go out there.<eos> Ever.<eos> "And then the monsters ran away and were forced into hiding."<eos> "But Harry the Human found them and jumped out from under their bed."
Yeah.<eos> Vampire!<eos> Vampire!<eos> A human.<eos> Who are you?<eos> And how did you find this place?<eos> I'm Jonathan.<eos> And I was just mountain climbing with some dudes... and heard this story about a spooky forest.<eos> And who's not going to go into a spooky forest, right?<eos> So, then I see these goofy-looking dudes on fire. And I just kind of followed them to this, like, amazing castle.
Where are you with that?<eos> We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet.<eos> Cell phones, laptops...<eos> If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us.<eos> That's still not gonna find them in time.<eos> You have to narrow your field.<eos> How many spectrometers do you have access to?<eos> - How many are there?<eos> - Call every lab you know.<eos> Tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays.
Good morning.<eos> To think that I should have lived to be "good morninged" by Belladonna Took's son as if I were selling buttons at the door.<eos> Beg Your pardon?<eos> You've changed, and not entirely for the better, Bilbo Baggins.<eos> I'm sorry, do I know you?<eos> Well, you know my name, although you don't remember I belong to it.<eos> I'm Gandalf.<eos> And Gandalf means me.<eos> Not Gandalf the wandering Wizard who made such excellent fireworks?<eos> Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve. Heh, heh.
You what?<eos> I said drop him.<eos> Get the sacks!<eos> Stick them in the sacks!<eos> - Bilbo!<eos> - Don't!<eos> Lay down your arms or we'll rip his off.<eos> Oh! That's hot, that's hot, that's hot!<eos> Don't bother cooking them.<eos> Let's just sit on them and squash them into jelly.
You'll be fine.<eos> Fuck that!<eos> - Everyone, listen.<eos> The lights will be back on soon.<eos> I promise.<eos> - What are the cooks doing?<eos> - These gentlemen are going to help me take you back to your rooms.<eos> They're both fully authorized to discipline anyone who acts out of line.<eos> You'll eat and receive your meds privately.<eos> - Who authorized them?
Like how she streaked in wedding.<eos> Oh my God!<eos> There are so many. As when... your mom get chased by a shark... What?<eos> When that was happened?<eos> We were on Moloka'i with Mark and Kai, and your mom was out surfing and saw a shark right beneath her on a wave...<eos> Let's watch one of these!<eos> No, We're not watching porn.<eos> - Give me that.<eos> Reina's dad watches pornes.<eos> Reina calls them masturbation movies.

- How are you?<eos> Looking forward to seeing you at our show tonight.<eos> We love you.<eos> - Yours..<eos> - T.A.T.u.<eos> What is he saying?<eos> He say tickets are fake.<eos> No, they're not fake Check them again.<eos> Lana, they're not fake.<eos> I bought them in the store.
STU: I can give you four hours, that's it.<eos> Then I've got to catch my flight to Alaska.<eos> BARRY:<eos> No problem. JIM: How was your trip?<eos> - Louisiana was spectacular.<eos> - Lot of birds in the bayou.<eos> And saw a loggerhead shrike from my hotel room in Natchitoches.<eos> Adorable!<eos> It imitates the songs of other birds to lure them in close.<eos> Uh-huh. Then it impales them on thorns, breaks their necks and eats them.
Jacob, I'm afraid there's been a car accident.<eos> It's right in there, son.<eos> Is there any other family to call?<eos> No. No, it's just me.<eos> Accordingtoourrecords, there is no mistake, Mr. Jankowski.<eos> The house and all their assets, including your father's practice, are property of the bank in default of the loan.<eos> I'm telling you, you're wrong.<eos> My father owned that house outright.<eos> These documents are dated four years ago.<eos> He signed them.
Easy, now, Barbara.<eos> - Good night, ladies.<eos> - Good night, Camel.<eos> We like him, Camel.<eos> - Good night, Camel!<eos> - Good night!<eos> Now try not to talk till you're familiar with the vernacular, or you'll get your head bashed in.<eos> Like, townies are "rubes," and performers aren't performers. They're "kinkers,"<eos> but never call them that to their faces.<eos> So what do I call them?
Hey.<eos> Something's wrong with Camel.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, kid.<eos> How nice to see you.<eos> Hey, Camel.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I woke up this morning, and my feet was all floppy.<eos> I just can't feel them right.
All he seemed to care about was Rosie, and God love her, she played her part to a T.<eos> We all did.<eos> Everything went back to how it was before.<eos> At least, that's how it looked.<eos> But nothing was the same.<eos> August was right again.<eos> Everything is an illusion.<eos> Come on!<eos> Withstrawhousesell-outs,<eos> August promised the men he'd finally pay them with increases, once his debts were covered.
I could go back out.<eos> Give you more time.<eos> Or better yet, I could yell "Raid!" And clear the place out.<eos> In fact, it gave me an idea for the show.<eos> A new act.<eos> This is the story.<eos> A first dance.<eos> Two characters.<eos> A young awkward man, hopelessly in love with a woman beyond his reach, who teases his affections.<eos> We start with a romantic melody that sweeps them onto the dance floor.
I just remember politely asking him, "Hey, get off of my girl."<eos> This bridge gives me the creeps.<eos> - Willard!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - What?<eos> - This is Crosby Bridge.<eos> You know that photo in school?<eos> The one with the teenagers that all got killed.<eos> This is where it happened.<eos> My brother was driving them home.
- Mr. MacCormack.<eos> I have been more than patient with your intrusions.<eos> I would like to remind you that we speak for this town because we are from here.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Dunbar.<eos> For you to come into this council chamber and question our motives...<eos> Roger!<eos> Stop it!<eos> I think Mr. MacCormack has a right to be heard.<eos> I wasn't here three years ago, when tragedy struck this town.<eos> And I know it's not my place to mourn the lives that were lost because I didn't know them.
** I know I'll never be the same **<eos> ** If I don't get her back again **<eos> ** Because I know she'll always be ** ** The only girl for me. **<eos> When I saw George and Pattie together, the way they fit into The Beatles thing, all of their domesticity seemed to be like Camelot, you know.<eos> It was like...<eos> I saw The Beatles play at the Hammersmith Odeon when I was bottom of the bill in The Yardbirds.<eos> This band was like... They were like a single person.<eos> It was an odd phenomenon, in fact, that they seemed to move together and think together.<eos> It was almost like a little family unit. I was very, very suspicious about what they were up to.<eos> But when I saw them play, I mean, I was overwhelmed by their gift.
Doesn't really matter, in other words.<eos> And I thought, phew, God, you know, well, that's almost like giving me carte blanche.<eos> From time to time, during the spring and summer of 1970<eos> Eric and I saw each other.<eos> One day we were walking down Oxford Street when Eric said, "Do you like me, then, or are you seeing me<eos> "because I'm famous?"<eos> I replied, "Oh, I thought you were seeing me because I'm famous."<eos> And we both laughed.<eos> He always found it difficult to talk about his feelings.<eos> Instead, he poured them into his music and writing.
Well, that's what they all say till you get them alone in the room.<eos> - So this is for real.<eos> Just about in the bag.<eos> When are you going to announce?<eos> Nope, that's all you get for now.<eos> Okay, listen up.<eos> These are your new cell phones.<eos> Shelly's preprogrammed your numbers. Thank you Shelly<eos> No personal calls, Kevin.<eos> If you lose them, the DNC will come to your house.
Think I'm a freak. Oh, I can't believe that.<eos> The cayenne, that was nothing.<eos> I can taste every ingredient.<eos> This blanket-- Alpaca and silk.<eos> Plus 5% performance fleece.<eos> I can tell you that just by touching it. All my senses are that strong.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> Have you always been like that?<eos> You should hear what my parents say.<eos> I hear them.
Is that because the prosecution was complicit to your confession?<eos> Judge!<eos> Were you promised the same thing here, Mr. Corliss?<eos> To say that Louis Roulet bragged to you in the holding cell, isn't that what happen, you lie then...<eos> -that'll do! That'll do!<eos> -Objection, your honour.<eos> I'm sorry, your honour.<eos> I have no more questions.<eos> I'm excusing the jury for an early lunch.<eos> Bailiff, see them out.
- Nope.<eos> Then what the fuck are you talking about, man?<eos> If we try to play like the Yankees in here, we will lose to the Yankees out there.<eos> Boy, that sounds like fortune-cookie wisdom to me, Billy.<eos> No, that's just logic.<eos> Who's Fabio?<eos> He's a shortstop.<eos> He's a shortstop from Seattle.<eos> Now, this is no time to push the panic button.<eos> Our scouts will find players, Player Development will develop them.
Kelly's good people.<eos> He can help you men find... what or whoever you're looking for.<eos> We good here?<eos> No.<eos> Another round.<eos> It's been quite a morning.<eos> So you say you got horses, is that right?<eos> Yeah, I- - I-- I got some horses, sure.<eos> I just, um--<eos> Look, I don't have them personally.
It's a- - It's a snake.<eos> I killed it.<eos> - I hate snakes.<eos> - Hate snakes.<eos> Hello.<eos> How's that fish?<eos> Oh, it's-- It's real good, actually.<eos> So that right there is a really fine animal you got.<eos> Where are your horses?<eos> The horses, they died, because-- because we ate them.

Kali's gang is victorious, and Fang is never seen again.<eos> Now the invaders attack the rest of the River Pride.<eos> The fighting is over.<eos> Kali and his sons rule.<eos> Their will is now law on both sides of the river.<eos> Kali's sons try to make peace with the lionesses.<eos> But in the battle the youngsters were driven away.<eos> The pain of losing them is still too fresh.<eos> The pride's young males are in the greatest danger.<eos> Kali's gang view them as a threat and hunt them down.
These men have plenty to hide.<eos> You there.<eos> What say you?<eos> They say nothing. They hold vows of silence.<eos> Templars without tongues.<eos> Very well.<eos> Just be gone by the morning.<eos> Back inside!<eos> Marshal.<eos> When I accept guardianship over men who take the vows of silence, I'm also informed of what led them to me in the first place.
Home?<eos> We're not going home.<eos> Just because the knights betrayed us does not mean we give up on the quest.<eos> Together we can still accomplish what needs to be done.<eos> How?<eos> We're lost, I'm hungry.<eos> This stump, it's putting my asshole to sleep.<eos> Thadeous, your feet are bare.<eos> Put your boots on.<eos> They're filthy, I'm having them exfoliated.
I don't like that idea, sir.<eos> No, Simon can help us.<eos> Simon, you must take this message to father.<eos> Tell him that the Knights Elite betrayed us and he must send an army across the valley to Muldiss Darton and help us retrieve the Blade of Unicorn.<eos> Hurry, Simon!<eos> Fly to Mourne and deliver these desperate words.<eos> Fly!<eos> Come on, Manious, you've been sniffing dirt all morning.<eos> We would not be in this position, Julie, if you wouldn't have gotten caught communicating with Leezar.<eos> And if you ladies were proper assassins, you'd have cut them down back there as the Dark Lord commanded.
We just sold your little punk-ass tree, bitch!<eos> What?<eos> You sold it?<eos> To who?<eos> Those white boys over there.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Hey.<eos> Aah!<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Maybe if we catch up to them, they'll sell the tree to us.
Uh sorry..<eos> I just wanted to know if you wanted to grab some lunch<eos> I'm kind of in the middle of something, Lynn - my treat.<eos> You know, Lynn when I first started teaching I thought that I was doing it for all the right reasons<eos> Shorter hours, summers off, no account credibility... oh, I love my summers...<eos> fresh corn... mmmm from now on, my full time job is finding a guy who's gonna take care of me<eos> God I pray for that<eos> You know I spent my entire summer hanging out at bars near where the Bulls practice<eos> Had some fun, got some cool souvenirs But those guys are not looking to settle down i mean..<eos> They all wear condoms..then, they take the condoms with them, that's how paranoid they are like it's so easy to get pregnant from some dude nutting into a condom yeaa... ugh!
Yeah.<eos> I could barely work the microwave. I was fucked.<eos> We got this pedophile on the loose in Holland Park.<eos> He was luring children into his car.<eos> We knew who he was but we just couldn't catch him in the act.<eos> These kids were too traumatized to identify him.<eos> He was this big showbiz agent, you know.<eos> Major connections.<eos> The guys back at the nick... they just about put me on a par with him... because I was a queer, yeah?<eos> Wanked off into condoms and leave them in my locker... scratched the car, sugar in the petrol tank.
- It'll be tough.<eos> Sure would be good if I got one.<eos> - That's right.<eos> But business is slow at the moment.<eos> THE FISHTANK Bangkok, Thailand<eos> Taste good?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Are you almost done?<eos> Like yesterday with big curls and everything.<eos> I made them loose and bouncy.
I could tell by the stars we were heading east.<eos> Then they worked me for I don't know how long.<eos> Weeks, maybe months.<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> Everything.<eos> I held on for as long as I could to let everyone get the hell out of there.<eos> Did they?<eos> My networks in Hungary, did they get out?<eos> No, they were blown.<eos> The story is you blew them to save your own skin.
What's this about, George?<eos> It's about which master you've been serving, Toby.<eos> Intelligence has been leaked, Toby.<eos> Someone's been taking files from the Circus.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No.<eos> This is a mistake, a misunderstanding.<eos> Files were delivered to a Russian attaché, weren't they?<eos> Yes.<eos> And, yes, I delivered them.
Ladies and gentlemen. welcome to the Johnson County Finals for the State Mastery in Butter Competition.<eos> I would like to introduce our esteemed panel of judges.<eos> Betsy Lou Holt, our reigning Miss Dairy.<eos> Mayor of Iowa City, Bill Olberweis.<eos> And finally, State Head Judge Orval Flanagan's wife, Mrs. Helen Flanagan.<eos> Now, we're going to let each contestant say a few words about their work before the judges begin deliberating.<eos> Carol Ann Stevenson?<eos> That's mine.<eos> I just really love kittens.<eos> Especially when they get tangled up in a blanket, but I didn't know how to carve that, so I just put them in a basket.
And I can hear her pray<eos> As I walk through the yard I could feel your presence Giving me the time of my life<eos> Now I know what they mean When they said keep your head to the sky Don't be too quick to fit in<eos> This road is strange, so strange it is<eos> You know it really hurts inside<eos> Yeah, sometimes<eos> We're here.<eos> We're here.<eos> You must think I'm such a bitch.<eos> You shouldn't waste your feelings on people who don't value them.
Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves, and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush?<eos> Aye!<eos> It is not confirmed.<eos> It is not confirmed!<eos> We may deny him yet!<eos> And will deny him!<eos> I'll have 500 voices of that sound.<eos> - Yes! - I twice 500 and their friends!<eos> Yes!<eos> Get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties!
Give us another round, Alois has joined us for a drink!<eos> Someone broke into another house.<eos> Old Jurčák told me.<eos> Everyone's just doing what they want these days?<eos> Alois, let's go.<eos> ...this increase of crime was caused by the general amnesty granted by president Václav Havel in January.<eos> This Havel must be a real asshole.<eos> What is he up to?<eos> You got us into a real mess with those Prague students, Alois!<eos> I'd just take a big stick and shove them all in the river.
And all of them are saved the second we make this deal.<eos> The kids are gonna be so psyched.<eos> - Really?<eos> Psyched?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Are they really gonna be psyched?<eos> You're freakin' kidding me!<eos> It's a zoo!<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> Look, these animals need somebody to rescue them.
So, just tell me what, you know, just give me a list of what to do,<eos> - and I'll do it. - Are you sure?<eos> Yeah, we got it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Spar has a... A new medication, so let me just...<eos> Make sure that this gets in his food<eos> - and that he eats it all. - Okay.<eos> Turn off the lights in the garage.<eos> The garage.<eos> There is a new shipment of exotic snakes, so just leave them in the travel crates and I'll put them in the exhibit in the morning.
I keep forgetting!<eos> It's all about you!<eos> Why don't I just pack us up?<eos> We'll just go on the road together.<eos> We could be hobos.<eos> Because you wasted all our money!<eos> Some of that belonged to me, Dad!<eos> I didn't waste our money. I thought you liked it here.<eos> And I'm sorry, I thought your friends would come out and visit you, man.<eos> I called them all myself and I invited 'em.
I can't.<eos> Here's your foot.<eos> The warrior's path is a solitary one.<eos> How the hell did she afford that car?<eos> - Her boss.<eos> - Rich bastards!<eos> I used to hate them. Now, it's... Going to a gig on the hunt for two Russian cosmonauts.<eos> Nothing like driving in a Maybach.<eos> Germans know how to make cars, let me tell you.<eos> My Dutchman, former NSA cybersleuth extraordinaire, tracked them down here.
What're we doing?<eos> Listen, your God teaches, everybody's born equal, right?<eos> So, the women, the girls, which?<eos> What would you do?<eos> We must.<eos> What else we can do?<eos> He gave me these bracelets so I would go with him. I didn't trust him enough so I didn't.<eos> I should have.<eos> I was so stupid.<eos> You would be even more stupid wearing them to meet the Japs.
- Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll drop 'em in your mailbox when I get home from work.<eos> Nealy!<eos> Wow, this stuff is burning the skin of my hand just touching it!<eos> I doubt a raccoon is gonna come back here after he snorts up a nose full of this.<eos> So...<eos> I read online today about this guy he sticks a barrel into his grass and he throws steaks in, and during the night, the raccoons, they jump in, but they can't climb out.<eos> He runs a hose from his garage out of the tailpipe from his car, he sticks a lid on and asphyxiates them.
To quote the Babylonian Talmud,<eos> "A man can be jealous of anyone except his son and pupil."<eos> I got the impression that you and he represent almost opposite schools of research.<eos> Who gave you this impression?<eos> I spoke to people, and I read your son's book.<eos> I'll illustrate it for you.<eos> Say we both deal with potsherds.<eos> Yes?<eos> Broken pottery?<eos> One of us examines these potsherds, cleans them meticulously, catalogs them, measures them scientifically and precisely, tries to decipher which period they're from, and who made them.
'Cause there's a reason.<eos> I do this with you, I might as well burn my own house down.<eos> I promise we'll be careful.<eos> This already ain't careful, Miss Skeeter!<eos> You not knowing that is what's scaring me the most. Scare me more than Jim Crow.<eos> All right. Here's my phone number.<eos> - My car's here.<eos> I could take you home.<eos> "No person shall require any white female to nurse in wards or rooms in which Negro men are placed.<eos> Books shall not be interchangeable between the white and colored schools, but shall continue to be used by the race first using them.
So the fear of being abandoned and the fear that something might happen to us...<eos> - If you need anything... 꿌'm here.<eos> - It's your room.<eos> - My room?<eos> You'll be quite comfortable.<eos> Now I see!<eos> Don't worry, we're sworn to secrecy.<eos> You don't think I'd go around...<eos> If you'd like to phone home, I'll stay here, listen, and then I'll take your phone.<eos> No, my kids are in school now, I have to call them this evening, talk to them!
Stinky kids need bath time! Stinky kids.<eos> Are you gonna tell me what this novel's about?<eos> If I tell you about it, then...<eos> Well, then it all disappears, doesn't it?<eos> But I can see the characters, Libby. I can.<eos> Just... Just as clearly as I can...<eos> Thank you. ...as I can see you now.<eos> Thanks for the flowers.<eos> When?<eos> I didn't give them to you.

He says it's going to be six weeks before you can slap my ass again.<eos> Then get yourself ready.<eos> Oh, did Molly call to see you at the house?<eos> She was really sorry she missed you here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you have a good visit?<eos> What?<eos> I'm looking for any trace of irony in your face.<eos> Did they, uh... give you any pain killers?<eos> Yes, and I'm gonna hide them on you, Stella.
We are?<eos> Yeah. Sunday.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> It's at 3:00, behind the elementary school.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Right behind there.<eos> "That is how to transform into your true power self.<eos> "By taking responsibility for your perceptions<eos> "so that you are not the victim of the events in your life,<eos> "but the events of your life... "are the creation of what you perceive them to be.
The host of the program was some sort of toothpaste salesman not a moderator or journalist of any kind.<eos> I've collected books full of evidence in support of the idea that there are worlds beyond our own, and people, creatures... call them what you will, that have come here from somewhere else.<eos> So you believe these creatures are alien beings of some kind?<eos> I don't believe or disbelieve anything, Mr. Bradbury.<eos> I merely note the long history of remarkably consistent reports.<eos> The Pennacook Indians described similar things, did they not, Professor Wilmarth, ages ago?<eos> Yes, they did, Mr. Fort.<eos> In fact...<eos> They said that the beings were not native to this earth, that they had flown here from the stars.<eos> The later Puritan settlers described them too, as creatures in league with Satan, only too happy to lead mankind down the path to sin.
And that's how I got the name Motherfucker Jones.<eos> Right.<eos> They should call you Motherfucker-Over Jones to avoid confusion.<eos> - What's the confusion?<eos> - There's no confusion.<eos> We're gonna get back on track here.<eos> Sir, we each have a boss, uh that, you know...<eos> There's three bosses, and it would be best if those bosses maybe were no longer...<eos> - No longer around anymore.<eos> We want them...
I loathe them and they loathe me.<eos> Well, just 'cause you don't like 'em don't mean you ain't like 'em.<eos> And what's that word "loathe"?<eos> - Loathe.<eos> - That a pretty powerful word, ain't it?<eos> Not powerful enough, I'm afraid.<eos> How come you be loathing these other professors?<eos> - I know what you're thinking.<eos> - What am I thinking?<eos> You're thinking that I loathe them because I'm like them, and I loathe myself.
MAN:<eos> This is schnapps.<eos> MORIARTY:<eos> A telegram was sent from here.<eos> [HOLMES CLEARS THROAT]<eos> This isn't schnapps, it's aquavit, distilled from potato mash.<eos> A common misconception.<eos> Thank you, by the way.<eos> Who was it sent to?<eos> My horror at your crimes is matched only by my admiration at the skill it took to achieve them.
Listen, the kids are fine.<eos> I can't say the same about the house.<eos> Why?<eos> What did they do?<eos> They didn't do anything.<eos> They didn't destroy the house. Tick Tock's men did.<eos> What? !<eos> Argonaut, I told you to watch them!<eos> I am watching them.<eos> I'm watching them puke and scream.
Hello, do you copy?<eos> What's down here?<eos> As you see, just a bunch of storage cells full of junk.<eos> Hey, uh... uh, it's Mickey, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why do you have so many mattresses?<eos> Because I'm the super of a goddamn apartment building.<eos> So why do you have so many mattresses?<eos> What the fuck do you care?<eos> I sell them on the Internet.
You people have no fucking idea.<eos> Two three four.<eos> I need you to be strong and stay with me...<eos> Hey, man, do you think this is real?<eos> ...because you're the one who's going to have to kill me.<eos> Nah, it looks like viral marketing for some movie.<eos> And now, 18 years after the day I was born, I'm here to convince you that the monsters are real, that they live among us, within us.<eos> And hopefully one day you'll know who I was and what I tried to do.<eos> Please listen to me.<eos> I need you to gather all the silver and fire and kill them before it's too late.
Was he good for you?<eos> - The best.<eos> - Good.<eos> He was a good baby, too.<eos> He didn't cry too much.<eos> We'd build forts in the living room with pillows and blankets and shit.<eos> He loved that.<eos> That must have been fun.<eos> No, not really.<eos> I'd set the pillows up, he'd pull them down, throw them all over the place, then want me to set them up all the fuck over again, but it was fun for him.
Even today if you feel something is missing... what is it?<eos> Take time out for things that... give you genuine joy.<eos> Like cooking.<eos> Well, that's the plan, I mean... I'll retire at 40 and...<eos> Dude! How do you know if you'll be alive till then?<eos> Seize the day, my friend.<eos> First, live this day to the fullest.<eos> Then think about 40.<eos> Come on.<eos> My friends don't know why I made them come here.
Is all this for the dolphin? Winter?<eos> No, she can't eat this yet.<eos> She can barely move.<eos> I named her that.<eos> We had a Summer and Autumn.<eos> They got put back in the ocean.<eos> I figure season names are good luck.<eos> These were for the other dolphins, but since they were on the floor now they're for turtles.<eos> We're picky about what the dolphins eat.<eos> We get them from the same place as restaurants.
They believe that a long time ago, their goddess, Hutash wanted everyone who lived on the islands to move onto the mainland.<eos> So she built them a bridge out of a rainbow.<eos> Everybody was crossing the rainbow, excited to get to the mainland.<eos> The kids were jumping around having a great time, dancing, singing.<eos> You know, being kids.<eos> Well, they fell off the rainbow, and they went tumbling down toward the sea.<eos> Well, the parents were just scared to death that Hutash was gonna be really mad at them and let their kids drown.<eos> But no.<eos> She took pity on them, because she loved the way they played.<eos> So right at the moment when the children hit the water she turned them into dolphins so they could play forever.
When you're getting to be in your 40s and 50s and 60s, and you've been slaughtering your endothelial cells, you don't have those six or eight tennis courts.<eos> You may be down to one and a half or two, and they can't protect you.<eos> Yet according to Dr. Esselstyn, when we begin eating a whole foods, plant-based diet, the damage to our endothelial cells not only stops, it starts to reverse.<eos> About five years into his study, Esselstyn made a small but significant change in his patients' menu. It started in 1990, when he read the glowing review of Dr. Campbell's China study the New York times.<eos> Dr. Esselstyn saw that, and he invited me to come to a conference he was organizing in Arizona.<eos> These two revolutionaries, who, up until then, had been on similar but separate paths finally met face-to-face.<eos> On the one hand, I'm coming from the scientific group, getting some ideas. He's coming from the clinical route and doing some dramatic research.<eos> Here's the science, here's the clinical evidence.<eos> Put the two together, it's amazing. When he learned of Campbell's research, Esselstyn removed dairy products from his patients' diet.<eos> The results of his ongoing study continued to be impressive, and in 1995, he published a paper detailing them in a noted scientific journal.
- Dad?<eos> - What?<eos> I want to stay with you.<eos> - You do stay with me... most of the time.<eos> - Not since my party.<eos> Come on, quickly.<eos> We've got lots to do.<eos> - When are all the kids gonna come?<eos> - I told you, half an hour.<eos> Why didn't you invite them earlier?
But earlier, you said you knew Thierry Delay.<eos> No, I said I served two writs on him.<eos> My office handles over 6,000 a year.<eos> And his wife, Myriam Badaoui?<eos> - Neither.<eos> - And the two below,<eos> David Delplanque, Aurélie Grenon?<eos> They say you and your wife raped their children, since the winter of '99.<eos> Are you crazy!<eos> That you sodomized them, had them perform oral sex.
How come Jimmy Delay declared that you sexually abused him?<eos> How come? I don't even know the kid!<eos> He's my son's friend, we barely spoke.<eos> Under police questioning,<eos> Jimmy accuses my client, but photo-identifies someone else.<eos> Yet he recognized the room where you and your wife made advances?<eos> Impossible, he never came to our house.<eos> He also says his brothers were there during the alleged rape, yet they denied it and couldn't ID the house.<eos> Sir, I'll take your remarks later.<eos> How do you explain Badaoui, Grenon and Delplanque's claim that you sodomized their children in various ways and had them fellate you?
protect my wife and children and help that young judge to have little common sense and lucidity.<eos> Remove his handcuffs.<eos> The first time he came with an inspector, as I owed money.<eos> They noted the furniture and left.<eos> He returned alone that afternoon and I found it odd that a bailiff should joke with my husband.<eos> He came back that night.<eos> David, Aurélie and their kids were there too.<eos> It was tough, because the kids didn't want to.<eos> I had to beat them for them to obey.<eos> They raped them.
Alain.<eos> Am I disturbing?<eos> No...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Fine...<eos> And you?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Do you see the kids?<eos> Are they well?<eos> I saw them today at my Parents'.
"No, another."<eos> "Think hard."<eos> But as I didn't know any others, I asked him:<eos> "What kind of name is it?"<eos> And he said: "The children gave the name of Marécaux."<eos> "And children don't lie."<eos> So I confirmed it.<eos> But that's not how it's noted!<eos> Well, that's how it happened.<eos> Yet you photo-identified them?
Dirt and grit.<eos> You gotta strip her down once a day.<eos> Keep her well-oiled.<eos> No wonder she's jamming on you.<eos> Are you military?<eos> Hell, no.<eos> I just like my guns.<eos> The night commuters.<eos> They come from deep in the bush.<eos> Their parents send them out because it's safer to sleep here than in their own homes.
Welcome back.<eos> Don't reverse. Don't reverse.<eos> - They are going to kill us.<eos> - No, they won't.<eos> If you move, they're gonna shoot.<eos> Calm down, I'm going to go talk to them.<eos> It's okay, we're a relief convoy.<eos> Relief convoy.<eos> We've only got medical supplies, we're non-military.<eos> The men no longer trust you to lead them into battle.
Take a pill.<eos> You'll have a hard-on for five hours.<eos> Look, a naked woman!<eos> Spit it out!<eos> They cost a fortune!<eos> Spit it out, dickhead!<eos> Stop.<eos> Look at those boots.<eos> - I hate high heels.<eos> Stefan would love them.

I'm just repeating what he said.<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> No?<eos> You're the sensitive one.<eos> Gum?<eos> I'm diabetic.<eos> Not so funny second time around.<eos> Dumbass?<eos> Cops dig the vernacular.<eos> Puts them at ease.
How cheap is cheap, what I always say.<eos> You have not seen the necklace, the truth is that never what I have.<eos> I will show and you'll see why.<eos> Suddenly to around the world he dislikes the zirconium.<eos> Well, they are a bit simple.<eos> I thought that you loved the simplicity.<eos> Yes, that is the problem, too simple.<eos> Well, I know I, if It is too easy.<eos> And my pearls earrings?<eos> Pearl Earrings, has brought them? I don't remember you metieras them.

What are you running away from?<eos> A relationship.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> May I?<eos> Thank you.<eos> With who?<eos> Well, right now, with you.<eos> Who's looking for a relationship?<eos> Is this how you normally talk your barricaded suspects out?<eos> You just wear them down?
His ex-girlfriend.<eos> Mo, Molly, that was in person.<eos> Very well, thank you.<eos> Tell me about the break-up.<eos> Was he upset?<eos> On a scale of 1 to 10.<eos> It's personal.<eos> He must have been pissed, right? Getting dupped like that.<eos> What's it all about?<eos> I'm just trying to put all the pieces of the puzzle together, before I make them moving around, making them fit.
Even used, it's expensive, a bike like that.<eos> And the salary for an apprentice, it's not much.<eos> All mom does is work.<eos> But hey, it's always been Gino's dream.<eos> And you can save money on so many things.<eos> - Packets of sugar.<eos> - Mom.<eos> Just between us, Pim...<eos> The sugar packets...<eos> I take them from trays in the cafeteria.
Hey, nice shirt. Do they sell men's clothes where you got that?<eos> That's funny because woman are so inferior.<eos> You got no taste. I bought this for Melanie's baptism.<eos> - Who's Melanie?<eos> - Michael's kid. My granddaughter.<eos> - [Cell Phone Rings] - Oh, I forgot to tell Irene I landed safely.<eos> Hello? How could you not know that your own brother had a granddaughter?<eos> I probably knew.<eos> How can you forget when he's family?<eos> I have 29 cousins, and I know them all.
Say that again and I'll knock your teeth out.<eos> Stand up for what you love, man.<eos> See you after work?<eos> Boyfriend.<eos> I'm not asking you to give the statues back.<eos> Almost done.<eos> Listen, father, you're a fundraiser. I'd like to think that catholic charities is open to a generous donation in exchange for the safe return of the statues.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> $7,000— he's out of his fucking mind!<eos> Probably wants them in small bills too.
Come in.<eos> Come in!<eos> - I have a complaint.<eos> - I have many.<eos> Mine's mean-spirited.<eos> Makes me feel small hearted.<eos> - Is it justified?<eos> - I can't tell.<eos> Maternity keeps stealing all the good gloves from the E.R.<eos> Steal them back.
Come in!<eos> - I have a complaint.<eos> - I have many.<eos> Mine's mean-spirited.<eos> Makes me feel small hearted.<eos> - Is it justified?<eos> - I can't tell.<eos> Maternity keeps stealing all the good gloves from the E.R.<eos> Steal them back.<eos> Hide them. Hoard them. Show some initiative.
You're gonna be okay.<eos> Just hang in.<eos> We're gonna get you some help.<eos> Listen, if we can get him to the hospital quick...<eos> - He can't be helped.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't know about Arachne, but I do know about spiders.<eos> One brown recluse bite can kill you. This thing?<eos> Look at these guys...<eos> that poison's eating them alive.
Bring me creatures.<eos> Aim high on the food chain<eos> Whatever we bag... ends up there.<eos> That's where he tortures them, interrogates them... I don't really know.
A rest stop.<eos> Pull over. I really gotta go.<eos> We are not stopping!<eos> We're only 52 Miles from home, mom!<eos> Fine.<eos> If traffic's good, I think I can hold it.<eos> We're pathetic, Mike.<eos> Pathetic.<eos> Our parents would have never put up with this. Hmm.<eos> I hated green peppers, but my mom always made me eat them, 'cause that's what we had.
Give him what you want him to have.<eos> It's too late for me, but you're just starting out.<eos> It's not too late for you.<eos> Tell your friends.<eos> Spread the word.<eos> She won't.<eos> Mom!<eos> Coming!<eos> So why do we keep running around, doing for our kids, even when it makes our lives hard?<eos> 'Cause we love them, and it makes you happy to make them happy.
It's amazing.<eos> I mean, sure, you look like an idiot when you're doing it, but you don't care because you're skipping.<eos> And it really clears your head.<eos> I was thinking about Brick when I was skipping, and I had this epiphany.<eos> We know our son better than anybody, so why should we let someone who spends an hour a week with him tell us what he needs or doesn't need? Yeah.<eos> He's been going there a year, and all he's got is "I like kites"?<eos> Same me the $10 co-pay. He can like kites for free.<eos> Right?<eos> Our son is happy. He's content.<eos> That's why he doesn't try to make friends... 'cause he doesn't want them.
It all starts now... boys, breasts, bulimia, all the "b" words. It's our job to stay on top of it.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What?<eos> "January 7th. Went to school.<eos> Came home.<eos> "Going to bed now.<eos> January 8th.<eos> Where are my blue socks?<eos> Can't find them anywhere.
I'm sorry?<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not going to speak to you. You're not well.<eos> What is all this bullshit?<eos> It's my Christmas stuff.<eos> Don't touch that!<eos> Christmas is bullshit.<eos> "And there were in the same country Shepherds abiding in the field, "keeping watch over their flock by night.<eos> "And, lo, the angel of the lord came upon them, "and the glory of the lord shone round about them:
I will give you my final report at the end of the evening.<eos> It's a dilemma.<eos> I mean, by following our men all over the country, are we, as women, just fucking feminism right up the butt?<eos> And just like that, the conversation is no longer about me.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, Kate, but I have a baby now, so I'm thinking for two.<eos> Three, if you include Marshall.<eos> You getting cold feet about the move?<eos> I don't want to live in Texas.<eos> Oh, God, it's a horrible state!<eos> They are only famous for two things... their stupid presidents and the people who kill them.
Cut it down. Move on to the next job.<eos> Let me just get this straight.<eos> A landscaping company is advocating that I cut down a perfectly healthy tree.<eos> Frankly... I don't care what you do with the tree.<eos> Put a dress on it. Take it to the movies. I don't give a shit, but you got to move it along, Max.<eos> Oh, I know. I know what you're saying.<eos> You go, "Why is the giant coming to steal my poos?<eos> "Huh? "They're all I have to offer the world, and you steal my poos!"<eos> Well, let me tell you something.<eos> I save every plasma-colored sack, and I take them down to the basement, where I am building a shit golem.
You'll be recycling Kalashnikovs in a hut in Sudan.<eos> I don't know where he is.<eos> All he told me were the specs I needed to design the bullet.<eos> Which were?<eos> Draw.<eos> It was going to be used in a rectangular room, 30 feet long by 18 feet.<eos> It has marble paneling and a marble floor and a ceiling-- 12 feet high, made of copper.<eos> It has a window on this wall-- one by four feet, the bottom sill eight feet off the floor. When did he pick up the bullets?<eos> He didn't.<eos> I dropped them off in a locker at the bus station.
I'm merely demonstrating that the widest part of me is narrower than the widest part of Booth.<eos> See?<eos> - All right.<eos> - Wow.<eos> Okay. Comparing body parts.<eos> What else do you do during a blizzard, right?<eos> Okay, I got the idea, Bones. Thank you.<eos> Seriously?<eos> The only records you have of test results are on computer?<eos> I mean, didn't somebody jot them down somewhere?
♪ fortune and fame, it's time ♪ ♪ wait till the stars go blind ♪<eos> Mr. Hixton, is everything all right?<eos> Mr. Hixton?<eos> Kill me now.<eos> You got the cell phone bill?<eos> No. Uh, books from my publisher for back cover quotes.<eos> Wait.<eos> What about the cell phone bill? Nothing.<eos> Ah, more books to endorse.<eos> You couldn't possibly read them all.
- Yeah.<eos> I think I know how Damian got his money.<eos> It was terrible, what happened to Mrs. Westlake.<eos> She came to see you Tuesday afternoon.<eos> What for?<eos> Oh, she wanted her jewelry appraised.<eos> I'm afraid I had some bad news for her.<eos> The stones were imitation.<eos> I see that quite a bit.<eos> People need cash in a hurry, but they don't want to give up their jewelry. So they sell the diamonds and they replace them with high-quality silicon carbide.
I'm impressed.<eos> His watch broke when he fell.<eos> Ah, you shouldn't have told me.<eos> Less impressed.<eos> Cause of death fits, too.<eos> Looks like a 9-millimeter to the noggin.<eos> But there's something that doesn't fit.<eos> His fingers... were broken one at a time.<eos> Cabbies sometimes hide their money.<eos> Maybe they tortured him to tell them where the money was.
- Fancy.<eos> Yeah, over 10 grand worth of fancy.<eos> Those are worth over 10 grand?<eos> Please.<eos> Lanie loves diamonds.<eos> "Diamonds are forever, like my devotion to you."<eos> Who writes notes this cheesy?<eos> Well, not the husband.<eos> I checked on his financials.<eos> He didn't buy them.
Okay, so maybe Gloria was telling us the truth.<eos> Maybe Sarah was having an affair.<eos> Well, that makes perfect sense.<eos> Sarah was separated from her husband Vince, and after long, grueling days at work, she'd go home to a cold, empty apartment.<eos> Feeling lonely, betrayed, she seeks comfort in the arms of this mystery man... and she decides that she wants her husband back, so she writes his mistress, Mandy Bronson, off the show, in order to save their marriage.<eos> And her next stop would be to get rid of the other man.<eos> So maybe the other man didn't go off quietly into the night.<eos> Do you two practice this when we're not around?<eos> These earrings are exclusive to Arthur Klein's Boutique in Chelsea.<eos> Let's find out who bought them.
I thought you said Zack wasn't using steroids.<eos> The test wouldn't pick up stuff like this.<eos> Why not?<eos> It's loaded with masking agents and designed to beat the test...<eos> Virtually untraceable unless you look for it specifically.<eos> - So he was using.<eos> - Nope.<eos> I went back and tested for this, too.<eos> Your boy is steroid-free.<eos> Well, if he wasn't using steroids, then what was he doing with them?
Thank you, I'm much better now.<eos> OK.<eos> All right, time out on the game.<eos> It's your turn. Three, two, one...<eos> - Hey, Jules.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I really don't think that's why he's staring at you.<eos> You know, honey, he probably just thinks you're really hot.<eos> My calves do look pretty great.<eos> You know, the trick is to store your cookies on the top shelf. And then you just go for them one at a time.
Um, okay, let's get started.<eos> So, I've got one box for going with you... one box for storage and one box for giving away.<eos> I'm not going away forever, Emma.<eos> Rehearsals for April's show start two days after nationals. Opening night is 3 weeks later.<eos> I'm guessing we close that night, then I'm back on a bus... back to my vest the next day.<eos> Will you stop with all that?<eos> You're too afraid to admit that you're leaving, but you are.<eos> That's why you asked me to help pack up your apartment. That's why we're going through your vests.<eos> Do the kids know? No way.<eos> Can't let anything distract them from the task at hand.
Oh, I wasn't talking about the glee club.<eos> I was wishing you luck in your Broadway debut.<eos> How did you find out?<eos> It's all over the Broadway blogoshere.<eos> And by Broadway blogosphere, I mean the one blog that actually cares about Broadway.<eos> Can I give you a piece of advice?<eos> Don't tell your kids.<eos> It'll just shake their confidence at Nationals and they won't perform as well.<eos> I hate my kids.<eos> I would literally whip them if I could.

Just reminds me of everything I missed out on.
Keep fighting, no matter what.<eos> I remember what it was like here in Metropolis before he came.<eos> You couldn't even walk the streets.<eos> But since The Blur came, we have hope.<eos> So I just want to let The Blur know that there are still people who support him, and I'm one of them.<eos> Being a hero isn't about being able to save every person from a mugging or -- or pull someone from a burning building, but to give people hope for a brighter tomorrow.<eos> The Blur is a symbol for integrity and morality and selflessness.<eos> If you're listening to this, blur, thank you for everything.<eos> I want to be a hero to my kids.<eos> I want to be a hero that helps give them faith in themselves that they can accomplish greatness.
No.<eos> We're not leaving without my ring.<eos> I thought we were -- we were past that.<eos> Well, we're not.<eos> Ooh.<eos> - Got it?<eos> We'll be lucky to get out of here alive.<eos> I didn't exactly bring my Green Arrow gear to the bachelor party.<eos> Unless...<eos> The facial-recognition from the karaoke security footage showed that the fake cops actually have criminal histories linking them to this casino -- that is, if they work for this fearless Fortune.
There's no place for him to hide.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Enjoy the view one last time.<eos> Security's on their way up to escort you out of the building.<eos> Now, if you're threatening me, you need something more powerful than hot air.<eos> All the firepower I need is right here... copies of all the official documents that bear your signature.<eos> There's no discrepancies.<eos> Everything matches perfectly.<eos> My DNA, my handwriting... identical to the other Lionel.<eos> Then why would you have them all secretly reissued?
Don't question where my allegiance lies.<eos> It's time you embrace your lineage, Tess -- time to become the Luthor you were destined to be.<eos> Why did you bring me here?<eos> My son, Lex -- your brother, a genius -- carried on with the family business.<eos> As you know, Lex cloned himself.<eos> There were many clones.<eos> None of them were perfect, but some of the pieces were.<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> Lex took the best pieces and grafted them into a masterwork.
Ooh. Commentary by Philip Glass.<eos> Huh? No more distractions.<eos> Find those truffles.<eos> If you think that makes me a better musher, you're wrong.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Huh? This is our house.<eos> There's nothing buried here but hopes and dreams.<eos> The truffle's right over here.<eos> The truffle's in your room?<eos> I thought you'd been selling them.
It's worse than you think.<eos> I have to buy you a new anniversary present!<eos> Skinner and Chalmers loaded that bus with those kids.<eos> But why?<eos> I can tell you why.<eos> Otto?<eos> Are you the one who left the message on the blackboard?<eos> Yeah, it was me.<eos> I was the bus driver when those sweet young angels were swallowed up by the river.<eos> Now I'm gonna join them!
In the beginning there was only darkness.<eos> And in the darkness a demon Zaal was born. Ruler of the Underworld... oppressor of humans.<eos> But from the shadows came Crane, the warrior of warriors and bearer of the God Sword.<eos> He liberated men and led them to victory.<eos> But the price of victory was high.<eos> For Crane suffered a wound through the heart he bled for seven days and seven nights.<eos> But a hundred warriors drank his blood. And all were given his strength.<eos> Crane looked at them and saw that all was good.
My village has been burned, and I must find the sword of Crane.<eos> Can't you be quiet, for God's sake, so I can think?<eos> - I'll sing a barbarian song instead.<eos> - For God's sake, no.<eos> and Crane drew his proud sword and drove with all his force the blade deep in Zaal and Zaal's skull burst<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> The song.<eos> What was it?<eos> "The Epic of Crane".<eos> There are 2073 verses, and I know them all by heart.
Very few of us are still around.<eos> The land where I live now is a good one, quiet people, peaceful for the most part.<eos> But it's not home.<eos> That's why it's time for me to come back...<eos> You'll burn this letter after you read it, like your mother would've done, and wait for me.<eos> Much love, your uncle.<eos> I can't come tomorrow.<eos> We need you to pay us for this week's work.<eos> And for the seeds too.<eos> You never paid for them.
Some glitch, 'cause it looks like someone is illegally tracking dozens of Americans.<eos> Or there's hundreds of Afghan terrorists roaming around L.A.<eos> Okay, got it.<eos> It's not a glitch.<eos> No, it's not a glitch.<eos> The Pentagon just went on high alert.<eos> Software says it started about three weeks ago.<eos> 112 subjects have been tagged.<eos> So who are they?<eos> Why is the navy tracking them?
Time to bait the hook, boys.<eos> - Can I get a mojito, please?<eos> Yo.<eos> Listen, I'm so sorry to bother you again.<eos> Wondered if you could read my buddy's fortune quick?<eos> I'm just trying to enjoy my drink, okay?<eos> Oh come on, please, please, please?<eos> Okay, give me your hand.<eos> I'm telling you, she's good. You spend most of your time alone.<eos> Have friends who love you but you keep them at arm's length.
Got held up. Deeks thinks the world's going to end in 2012.<eos> Let me guess-- Jenkins' theory on a Sagittarius-A black hole.<eos> As a matter of fact, yes.<eos> He's mocking you.<eos> He's not mock...<eos> An MP from Camp Pendleton suspect that Marines are working on something with some dirty cops.<eos> It's a CHP crew.<eos> They take bribes from criminals for armed escorts and smuggling.<eos> The call themselves the California Gold Taxi Service.<eos> LAPD calls them an urban legend.
I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> We're holding them for questioning.<eos> We haven't charged them yet.<eos> Well, either charge them or let them go. Maybe you haven't heard.<eos> Murder one.<eos> - The execution of a robbery.<eos> - With weak and tangential evidence.<eos> The jars of prescription pills found in Alexis' room had bar codes.<eos> These bar codes link them to Colton and Lowell Pharmacy where Andrew Lightbox, a hard-working American citizen, was murdered at 11:00 last night.
You know, it's just that<eos> - we never really talked about it, Zach.<eos> - Dad, please.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - Well, you need to protect yourself.<eos> Zach and I talked last year when you were... away.<eos> - I found condoms in his backpack.<eos> - Not mine.<eos> It's a friend's.<eos> And I kept them.
Mr. Canning, it was not within your purview to negotiate on behalf of the class action.<eos> I didn't reach out to JNL.<eos> They reached out.<eos> This is a sweetheart deal.<eos> Even if what Ms. Lockhart is saying is true, isn't it better that a "Trojan horse" like myself get whatever deal can be made now instead of waiting five or six years...<eos> - I object.<eos> - Objection. - for the $50 million they hope for?<eos> Lockhart Gardner's position is to fight.<eos> And they make enemies of their opponents.<eos> I make them my friends.
- The FBI doesn't dream, Mr. Lee.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> What were you doing on September 11th?<eos> That was not us. That was the CIA.<eos> - It was the CIA, was it?<eos> - The CIA ignored credible intel.<eos> Have you read the 9/11 report?<eos> And you've kept the books for how long, Mr. Roja?<eos> Um, about three years.<eos> Oh, but I wouldn't call them exactly books.
And they don't like black girlfriends?<eos> They don't like people they can't relate to.<eos> It makes you look too cosmopolitan.<eos> Ugh, you don't know what voters want or think or anything.<eos> You just make this stuff up based on whatever biases you have swirling around in your head at that moment.<eos> I wish that were true.<eos> Well, you know what's true?<eos> Zach is going to Peter's speech with Nisa.<eos> Do you know how crazy this is?<eos> For the last six months, I've been asking you to let me put the kids in front of the cameras, and you've said no, until I wanted them not in front of the cameras, and now you want the opposite.
That means cells that light up.<eos> - Unique to?<eos> - Isi...<eos> Isitoru...<eos> Isi...<eos> Isistius brasiliensis.<eos> Isi... exactly.<eos> Or more commonly known as the cookie-cutter shark.<eos> Goodbye, boys.<eos> You know what else is weird about them?
The monster came in through the window.<eos> It wanted to take me away.<eos> It was...<eos> It had no face.<eos> There's no monster in here. It was only a nightmare.<eos> It was only a nightmare.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It's over.<eos> What if he comes back?<eos> If he comes back, close your eyes and count to five. When you open them, he'll be gone, you'll see.
I mean, if we, as a group, can decide what reasonable things we want, I'd be happy to talk to him.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Okay, I can't turn the air on, because I'd have to power the engines up. That wastes fuel.<eos> I'm assuming you don't want to stop for gas in the middle of the ocean.<eos> Okay, what about the bathrooms?<eos> Stewart did not study dance at Carnegie Mellon to become a flight attendant to clean bathrooms.<eos> Well, at least give us some food.<eos> Negative...<eos> Those potato-chip bags are designed to be opened in flight.<eos> You open them at sea level, somebody could be killed.
What's going on?<eos> I finally have my brother back.<eos> If we got together, it would ruin that.<eos> My friendship with you was like the only thing that made me happy.<eos> I feel it, too.<eos> Victor betrayed me.<eos> It's all over the Internet that I stole Javier's notebook.<eos> My life is over.<eos> The paparazzi are back.<eos> I shooed them off the front lawn, but now they're just standing in the driveway.
I mean, it may take all night, but... We both know you do some of your best work after midnight.<eos> That's true.<eos> You're here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're the best boyfriend.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Hey...<eos> - Oh, you poor thing.<eos> - I brought you some flowers. - Aw...<eos> I'll put them in a vase.
I just wanted to drop that stuff off.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> - But I'll call you later and check in.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> Bye.<eos> Well?<eos> It's great.<eos> - You're not just saying that?<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> You make some good arguments and you back them up with solid research.
Simon, don't let your ability stop you from living your life.<eos> I may not be able to read your mind, but I read his.<eos> This is what it's like to be me.<eos> No.<eos> I can see you didn't bring your bowling shoes.<eos> That's gonna ba problem if you intend break 100.<eos> Maybe next time.<eos> Tonight, I have a different problem.<eos> Tell me about the first people.<eos> Start with why those books seem to indicate that you wrote them, then move on to what the device is intend for.
You holding out on me?<eos> No, no, no, I'm just clarifying.<eos> It's about trust.<eos> So it's a great game if two people are playing.<eos> Uh, Doyle Street.<eos> Just turn left here.<eos> Looks like we found the second thief.<eos> Yeah, and I think there's a third.<eos> Unless he did that to himself.<eos> These bodies were dissected, but that's not what killed them.
And Dana Gray, why didn't she just pick up the gun and try to shoot herself?<eos> - Try to catch a ride?<eos> I think this is the story you were looking for.<eos> I'm surprised you've heard of it.<eos> I'm taking a night class, and we're doing an essay on the journey of the soul to the afterlife.<eos> Then you'll find this very interesting.<eos> The ascension of Azrael.<eos> It's about a sinner named Azrael whose soul was condemned to purgatory.<eos> After years of watching him suffer, the angels asked God to let Azrael free.<eos> But God ignored them.
Tell me about The First People.<eos> Start with why those books seem to indicate that you wrote them.
So where do we stand?<eos> We've doubled the thickness of the lead shielding around the machine.<eos> Good. You let me know as soon as the Faraday cage is completed.<eos> I'm told they're almost done.<eos> You really think this is all necessary?<eos> We're standing underneath a giant lightning rod.<eos> It's unclear what kind of electrostatic discharge the device may give off.<eos> Good morning.<eos> If you'll all excuse us, please.<eos> Based on Olivia Dunham's DNA profile, we were able to identify 23 chromosomes your grandson inherited from his mother and strip them out.
But this time, you simply need to make a different choice. And should something go wrong, then Olivia will be our fail-safe.<eos> Walter, stop.<eos> Olivia is dead.<eos> But she won't be.<eos> Not then.<eos> The Machine?<eos> I turned that on 15 years ago.<eos> And all the time I sat in prison, I couldn't figure out where it came from.<eos> I knew the pieces were buried millions of years ago but how did they get there, so deep in the past?<eos> But now I understand I sent them there.

Listen, we need to talk to you.<eos> Not now, Archibalds.<eos> Russell bit.<eos> My party tomorrow needs to be legendary if I'm going to secure my place after the takeover.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Whatever Russell Thorpe promised you is a lie.<eos> I think I'll take my advice from someone not interested in grinding an ax across my knuckles, if you don't mind.<eos> After you and Nate tried to get me fired, I realized that your actions weren't completely unwarranted, so I asked to be taken off of all Bass business, and Thorpe agreed.<eos> But this morning I was copied on a report I shouldn't have been.<eos> It was a breakdown of how Russell's gonna sell your company for parts and who he's selling them to.
- No. Please, please. - Yes, yes...<eos> All right!<eos> Damn it, woman.<eos> Okay, everyone.<eos> Shut up and look at me!<eos> Welcome to "Visions of Nature."<eos> This room has several paintings in it.<eos> Some are big.<eos> Some are small.<eos> People did them, and they are here now.
- I'm sorry.<eos> Are you eating turkey chili off of a frisbee?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's pretty cute, right?<eos> No.<eos> Do you know what "cute" means?<eos> What have you got against turkey chili for breakfast?<eos> What have you guys got against washing dishes?<eos> We don't have any dishes, okay?<eos> Burly took them all when he left.
It's not that bad.<eos> A year ago, I lived in a pit.<eos> Now I got a job, and a kickass wife. And my band is so good, and are you gonna eat that pecan square?<eos> When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.<eos> I read that once on a can of lemonade.<eos> But I like to think that it applies to life.<eos> I don't want lemonade.<eos> It's too sweet and it makes my tongue feel gritty.<eos> So maybe it's time for a change.<eos> Starting now, when life gives me lemons, I'm gonna slice them up into wedges and throw them into vodka tonics, which I will then sip in a burlesque nightclub that I co-own with actor Taye Diggs and two of the Pussycat Dolls.
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...<eos> Vampires and werewolves used to roam freely until a shaman put a curse on them To limit their power.
Vampires and werewolves used to roam freely until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power.
Were you able to find Klaus? No.<eos> Nobody knows where he is, but there are these rumors that are flying around that a doppelganger exists.<eos> Which means any vampire that wants to get in favor with Klaus will be lining up to capture you.<eos> I'm not buying any of this.<eos> The last time that you were here, you made it clear that you didn't give a damn about me.<eos> Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to believe that you want to help?<eos> Isobel's been helping all along.<eos> Klaus has been obsessed with finding Katherine for centuries.<eos> All it would take was any one of those 1864 tomb vampires to spread the word around that Katherine was still alive, and it would bring him straight here to Mystic Falls, where you were bound to be discovered,<eos> so we killed them.
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...<eos> - You must be Elena.<eos> - How do we look exactly alike?<eos> You're a Petrova doppelganger.<eos> You're the key to breaking the curse.<eos> The Sun and the Moon curse?<eos> Vampires and werewolves used to roam freely until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power.
You know, I find chopping... Calming.<eos> The feel of the blade in the hand, maybe.<eos> I'm still waiting for someone to tell me what the hell's going on.<eos> Well, would you like to tell her, Stefan, or should I?<eos> Tell me what?<eos> Do you believe in vampires, Jenna?<eos> No?<eos> Well, who does, right?<eos> But believe it or not, they do have a place in our history.<eos> And as a history teacher, I find them fascinating.
Elena.<eos> - I need you to get her out of here. - What about you?<eos> I'm not leaving until he's dead.<eos> Elijah?<eos> Hello, brother.<eos> In the name of our family, Niklaus.<eos> I didn't bury them at sea.<eos> - What?<eos> - Their bodies are safe.<eos> If you kill me, you'll never find them.
Klaus is a vampire born from a werewolf bloodline.<eos> The curse kept his werewolf from manifesting.<eos> He'll be vulnerable during the transformation, when Bonnie comes in.<eos> If she can deliver him to the brink of death, I'll finish the job.<eos> I had a family.<eos> Klaus hunted them down one by one.<eos> He scattered them where their bodies could not be found.<eos> I didn't bury them at sea.<eos> Their bodies are safe.<eos> If you kill me, you'll never find them.
Still trying to track him.<eos> He quit the force after the storm, left town.<eos> We need to see the homicide files on these cases, see what their story is, what's in there, what's not.<eos> I don't follow you.<eos> It's the cover-up that does them in.<eos> Shootings like these are usually ruled justifiable-- split-second decisions, imminent threat.<eos> They're allowed to use lethal force.<eos> Comes with the job.<eos> All they really have to do is say, "I thought he had a gun."<eos> But if they try to cover it up, you can get them on perjury, obstruction.
And there it all was-- all of seals's stuff, all of Abreu's, everything in heaps and piles.<eos> It was a mess, the clothes they were wearing, the bullets that killed them just rotting away.<eos> If this is a cover-up--<eos> I'm not saying that it was.<eos> --Why didn't the detectives go to the morgue, pick up their evidence, make it go missing like the Abreu casings?<eos> Because autopsies were at Saint Gabriel after the storm.<eos> So maybe-- maybe they just didn't bother to drive all the way out there.<eos> With everything that was going on, all the confusion, who's to know?<eos> Exactly.<eos> They blew them off, wrote some half-assed reports and closed the cases.
Sounded like somebody up high--<eos> Roof or balcony, projects maybe.<eos> - The Iberville?<eos> - Could have been.<eos> I don't know.<eos> So you get back to the station and...<eos> I get back to the house. The guys see the bullet holes, flip out.<eos> About a half dozen of us posse up, go back to robideaux's and lay down the law.<eos> And you go in the store?<eos> No, I stayed outside and chased them off as they were coming out.
He wants to move back to New York again and teach cinematography.<eos> But it's all just happening too fast.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> How can I help?<eos> Well, you can get her to move these boxes into the garage...<eos> No, no. I haven't gone through them yet.<eos> Holly, we're moving.<eos> We told the tenants that we would store these boxes in the garage.<eos> No, you promised them.<eos> I didn't even meet them.
I'm not a thief.<eos> At least not by choice.<eos> - So you're being forced to do this?<eos> - And I'm trying to do it with as little damage as possible.<eos> Okay, you can't go in there, man.<eos> You can't use those key cards.<eos> You just said they would work.<eos> Yes, you can go in there, but you can't get away... without getting caught.<eos> Have you ever heard of Micro-RFID trackers?<eos> Special forces uses them to keep tabs on terrorists -- about the size of a grain of rice.

I would hate to lose a watch like this, you know, if she were mine.<eos> Yes.<eos> That is mine.<eos> Okay, they just stole my watch.<eos> Sam, what the hell happened?<eos> You're supposed to be following them.<eos> Sorry, man. I had to bail.<eos> Those guys knew I was after them.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I heard them talking about the girls.
Please. Please.<eos> I can't move fast enough.<eos> You go.<eos> Go bring the men here. Tell them to bring guns.<eos> I can't go! I don't know where they are!<eos> Warehouse 113, next street over!<eos> Three men there.<eos> Password -- nihonto.<eos> Hurry!<eos> I lead them away.
A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...<eos> Should we shoot them?<eos> ...An old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...<eos> You know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.<eos> ...Family, too...<eos> Hey, is that your mom again?<eos> ...If you're desperate.<eos> Someone needs your help, Michael.<eos> Bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.<eos> Low-tech explosives may be clumsy and unreliable, but their simplicity makes them almost impossible to trace.
There wouldn't be enough time for help to get here.<eos> As soon as the mercs find that Cahill's boat is still here, they'll know something's up.<eos> What do you suggest we do -- take on 50 guys with our handguns?<eos> Well, if we can't beat them... I say we join them.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> We need a reason to explain our presence on the island.<eos> I say we go in, say we're a covert security team from the company that hired them.<eos> I like it.<eos> I like it very much.<eos> We say we, uh, we caught Cahill betraying them.
But like any job, some days are just harder than others.<eos> What do you think you're doing here?<eos> This is my island and my command.<eos> Take it up with commander Jackson.<eos> He brought us here himself.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Looks like Jackson sent his own team to protect the files.<eos> This is bad.<eos> What did you do with the files?<eos> Jackson took them -- back to Grand Cayman. Rubbish.
He's from the Pyramid Group.<eos> F.Y.I., your security sucks.<eos> He's not from the Pyramid Group, you moron!<eos> How do you know he didn't destroy the uplink?<eos> !<eos> Save your breath, mate.<eos> Cahill already admitted to --<eos> How do you know Cahill's not in his pocket?<eos> This guy's playing you! Take your gun off me and shoot him!<eos> Like good defense attorneys, spies know the facts don't always matter as much as how you sell them.
"Carrot Top's Wild Ride."<eos> How'd it start?<eos> It started at a, uh, strip club.<eos> I know, shocker, right?<eos> It's called Crazy Ponies.<eos> It was great 'cause some of my fans were there, and so, that's good, 'cause they buy you drinks and everything else, so...<eos> And this girl-- was, was she the "everything else"?<eos> She was the "everything else," yeah.<eos> I remember her high-beams. Very attractive. Oh, man!<eos> Couple guys there, too. I don't remember them as well.
They have some good stuff.<eos> They always sell body parts?<eos> No leakage.<eos> Killer was tidy enough to wrap the parts in plastic.<eos> Rest of him is probably in these other boxes.<eos> We're going to have to take them all back to the lab.<eos> Were these boxes drop-offs or pickups?<eos> Pickups.<eos> The manager said they just came off the truck.<eos> Where did the truck get them?
Hey, that's a big call.<eos> And you're gonna be in big trouble if you don't sit down, Mr. Trufant.<eos> What exactly do you do? Agent, manager, producer.<eos> Busy man.<eos> What kind of shows do you produce?<eos> Reality shows to strip shows and everything in between.<eos> What am I doing here?<eos> These your tapes?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I mean, I made them, yeah, but I-I gave them away.

Get back up against the wall!<eos> This is Officer Malone on the North Corridor.<eos> Inmate 415. Request immediate backup.<eos> Get down or you're going in the hole!<eos> Move, move!<eos> Hands on the wall!<eos> You heard me?<eos> CSIs coming in.<eos> I hate that sound.<eos> You guys might want to take your jackets and turn them inside out.
I was talking about dinner.<eos> Go ahead, take a look.<eos> I'd recognize that shape anywhere.<eos> She was pistol-whipped.<eos> Two bullets within three inches of each other.<eos> Killer had training in firearms.<eos> And all of the evidence points to a cop.<eos> From what I've heard, everything's pointing to Detective Lucas Martin.<eos> Well, then let's get those two bullets out of her and see if they point to him, too.<eos> We pulled two slugs out of Jody Cambry's head, right where you left them.
That would be a natural, right?<eos> Would you give the cycle a rest for a second, please?<eos> Cycle?<eos> It's, uh... when you get a homicide, accidental, suicide, and natural death, all in the same shift.<eos> Kind of like banging a white chick, black chick, Mexican and Asian chick all in one night, right?<eos> Been there.<eos> The colon appears punctured.<eos> Did you say she die at her desk? I did.<eos> People like to chew on office supplies while they're working.<eos> Swallow them.
Eight weeks ago, Haskell escaped from custody with Vivian's help.<eos> Then he went to Dr. Kole's for plastic surgery.<eos> Then he and Tina started making movies of Vivian in the old house to send to Daddy.<eos> Nate was careful to stay in the background. He didn't want us to know that he'd changed his face.<eos> Then he sent the two brides to kill the doctor and the nurse.<eos> They removed his chart but not before they kidnapped the patient on the table, took his car, his clothes, and the two bodies, brought them back to the house where they murdered him.<eos> And that's when bride turned on bride.<eos> Then Tina murdered Vivian.<eos> Now Tina starts to chop up the bodies.<eos> She disperses the body parts sloppily, scattering them, not unlike her scattered mind.
Hmm, yeah, you would say that.<eos> You just got caught red-handed borrowing a DVD without permission.<eos> You guys have to believe me.<eos> He's so much worse than tall Kyle!<eos> Hey, Jefe.<eos> - Hola.<eos> - Hola<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Who are these tiny people?<eos> I picked up Shirley's kids from school, and I'm helping them with their Spanish homework.
- It's great for us.<eos> - Great for us?<eos> - It's great for me.<eos> - The hookup always comes with a plus one.<eos> - There's no plus one here.<eos> - I get hooked up,<eos> - you get hooked up all the time.<eos> - You've never gotten a hookup!<eos> I got plenty of hookups, Larry.<eos> You don't see them.
Good afternoon.<eos> So we're troop 205 and we're here to collect the money from the cookies, Mr. David, that Kyra said you were interested in buying.<eos> First of all, I commend you on the demographics.<eos> All:<eos> Thank you.<eos> A black, an Asian and-- Are you a Jew perchance?<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> - Oh okay, still, wonderful.<eos> Regarding the cookies, there's been a change of plans.<eos> Sorry to say, I no longer want them.
Okay, you know what? We got a half hour to get out of here.<eos> I suggest you go pack up and bring your stuff down.<eos> - Fuck you, Larry.<eos> - Fuck you, Leon.<eos> Hi, Mr. Larry David, we have your cookies that you ordered.<eos> - Oh ho ho. - We are here for our money<eos> - then we'll leave you alone.<eos> - Oh, that's very interesting.<eos> I have a vague recollection, correct me if I'm wrong, - of canceling my order. - ( Girls clamoring )<eos> - You already ordered them.
Sorry, I'm late for work.<eos> Maybe say what kind of paper.<eos> You know, that it's wrapping paper.<eos> I'm really bad at this.<eos> You're not really bad at this.<eos> - Yeah, I am.<eos> - You just, um...<eos> You know, try a little...<eos> excuse me, miss. Have you wrapped your presents for Martin Luther King day yet?<eos> No? Okay, well, I have a dream that this would make them look super special.
And salsa.<eos> And fajitas.<eos> Watch out.<eos> Hot plate.<eos> I don't see 'em.<eos> Aw, blap me in the blap!<eos> They'll be on Coleman Boulevard, just two blocks east of here.<eos> That's where he goes racing all the time or tiempo.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> This entire time, you had cookies and didn't offer to share them?
Inseminate?<eos> Insemi-not!<eos> Donna!<eos> I dug up the old yearbook and saw that Patty's "senior wish" was to have sex with you in a hot-air balloon.<eos> In a way, we're-we're all still who we were in high school.<eos> Listen up, Patty.<eos> You're still thinking like a fat girl.<eos> You can do better than Cleveland now.<eos> Hurtful.<eos> You can do better than a man who tivos nine different judge shows and watches them all.
These people pay and want peace and quiet.<eos> Let's talk straight. All these illegals and these landings are bad publicity for us.<eos> Mr. Publicity is here!<eos> They're bad publicity for us!<eos> Do you think we should let them drown for publicity?<eos> Isn't there a chairlift, Filippo?<eos> We're here.<eos> What did we come here for?<eos> To see my animals.<eos> I haven't seen them in so long.
Fucking marshmallow.<eos> I dreamed of having river views my whole life.<eos> Yo, kapo, you hit up bunker last night?<eos> You're looking kind of worked.<eos> Oh no, opposite.<eos> I slept at the office last night.<eos> I'm in the middle of this deal.<eos> It's kicking my ass.<eos> But if this works out, I'm gonna buy you this apartment for hanukkah.<eos> So if you're interested in the ohm building Just fill out these papers and drop them at my office downstairs.
You know what would happen if the police suspected Drugs associated with my business?<eos> There's no telling what they would dig up on me Or you.<eos> See, petra, because you're from germany, You'd be like a doberman-<eos> Sleek, smart, with a propensity to kill.<eos> I mean, you're both fucking foxes, so what- we gotta talk now.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> How did those little bottles end up on the streets?<eos> Man, it was brand loyalty, not my fault.<eos> Those kids were fiending for rasta monsta minis. As soon as I changed the name to smoka-cola, nobody wanted the shit.<eos> Rene knows about them.
That's why they sent assassins.<eos> Where's Mr. Tobe?<eos> He went after the assassins.<eos> I gave the assassins eye-catching haircuts.<eos> That's all!<eos> And that is the Saito family's complicated story.<eos> The end!<eos> Mr. Tobe!<eos> Well?<eos> I cornered them at the temple on the hill.
Wow.<eos> He still tells war stories about you in the old days.<eos> Why you got us over in Trece territory?<eos> Usually not over here.<eos> Four Trey is my hood.<eos> Me, personally, I like working the latin gangs.<eos> They're all business.<eos> They respect the badge a little.<eos> It's always worse with the brothers when you're a brother.<eos> Always talking crap when you jam them up.
Is it too early for scotch? Not by my watch.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Thank you.<eos> GIBBONS: So this murdered couple that happened this morning...<eos> Steve and Linda Walling, sir.<eos> That kind of butchery in my ward... unacceptable.<eos> Well, hopefully, we can eliminate this sort of crime in the entire city.<eos> I'm an optimistic man, Teresa, but... I'm encumbered by living in the real world.<eos> Austin, Humboldt Park... we whack the moles where we can, but my part of town?<eos> We will catch these bastards and we will nail them to the wall.
She sings a lot.<eos> But she also caught mono from a boy this winter.<eos> A 16-year-old with an eyebrow ring.<eos> I'm just not sure whether she's downplaying real symptoms or faking so she can bail and get back to the city.<eos> She wanted to hang in the city all summer with eyebrow boy. But we bribed her out here with this recording project.<eos> With teens, sometimes it's better for them to see a doctor one-on-one.<eos> Well, she's certainly not going to say anything in front of us.<eos> For the record, I hate needles.<eos> Really?<eos> Because most folks love them.
What are you doing here?<eos> I been looking all over for you.<eos> Can't a guy go fishing once in a while?<eos> It's been 15 years, pops.<eos> And this water is a hazardous waste site.<eos> You never liked it here, not even when you were a kid.<eos> We never caught anything.<eos> You never caught anything.<eos> Your brother hauled in some big stripers.<eos> He bought them, pops, at a fish store, so he could come home a hero.
Well, it might just be the sanest thing I've done in a while.<eos> And, look, you're not the only one who's worried about my sanity.<eos> I go to bed at night, and I wake up, thinking, "What did I do?"<eos> I've been thinking the same thing.<eos> Not about you, about me.<eos> You know...<eos> I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.<eos> You see these old-timers right here?<eos> Well, I don't think a week goes by<eos> I don't look at them and wonder,
Be nice to know for sure.<eos> Well, I could always go ask him, although if he cops to it, I guess I have to shoot him.<eos> Don't want him to think I'm not a man of my word.<eos> - No.<eos> - My opinion?<eos> Sounds closer to home.<eos> What do your C.I. S say?<eos> Art told me to steer clear of the investigation.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> When Art gives you orders, you actually follow them?
- Why?<eos> 'Cause it smells like pot and piss in here.<eos> Outside.<eos> I ain't got all night!<eos> Against the wall.<eos> Let's go!<eos> How's that?<eos> - What is your problem? - What's my problem?<eos> I just find out you two are responsible for hijacking a shipment of oxy, and I got to kill two morons to keep your asses out of jail.<eos> Cutter and Elrod told me it was you right before I killed them.
I just thought that the conflict would be interesting.<eos> - You know what, Jake? Conflict isn't interesting.<eos> But you had no right to use that for your video.<eos> - Film.<eos> - No, video.<eos> Real filmmakers don't need cheap stunts to make good films.<eos> - Zoe, I messed up, okay?<eos> People mess up.<eos> You mess up.<eos> Remember that time your Barbies tried my soldiers for crimes against humanity, and then you had them all decapitated?
Guys, did it really look good?<eos> My death? - Dude, it looked awesome.<eos> What do you think happened?<eos> You mean why he crashed the train?<eos> I just got a horrible feeling.<eos> Dude, what are you doing?<eos> That whole thing's an Air Force train.<eos> What?<eos> I make models. Like, plastic ones.<eos> You know, glue them, paint them...
Somebody's going to fall in Splash...<eos> But it doesn't look that deep or that shallow<eos> A fish jumped<eos> Once in a while if you're watching, one jumps<eos> But it's hard to see from here<eos> Look, it jumped<eos> That was super noisy<eos> Really noisy<eos> Look, we're surrounded by fields<eos> I wonder who farms them
And if it's attached to a laptop and it's programmed to detonate like your daddy's is, well, 3:00 a.m.<eos> No.<eos> Oh Jesus.<eos> Oh man.<eos> How long is this gonna take?<eos> - Cliff, just take it easy, okay?<eos> - How the hell do you remain so calm?<eos> Because us panicking isn't going to help our kids.<eos> All right?<eos> We'll get them home.
- Why would you do that?<eos> - You fucking dumbass!<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Fuck-- fuck off.<eos> - She fucked the whole thing up!<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - Shut up, enough.<eos> - I was afraid--<eos> - I'm through taking orders.<eos> You'll still find them.
This is the last time you'll be speaking to me.<eos> In the meantime, I don't want you to make or take any phone calls.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> - Yes. - Good.<eos> And by the way, tell your kids the show has been canceled. - What?<eos> - They'll know what I'm talking about.<eos> Okay, I need to know our kids are safe.<eos> They're safe.<eos> He got the money.<eos> He says he'll have them back in an hour.
I doubt your mother sees it quite like that.<eos> He's rather lovely, don't you think?<eos> Caspar!<eos> So tell me, Herr Isherwood, have you come to Berlin to sample the culture?<eos> I wouldn't quite say that.<eos> In fact, I'm rather anti-culture.<eos> Like the Nazis?<eos> Oh, no, not in that way.<eos> It's just that I'm rather put off by culture worshippers.<eos> I find them somewhat precious and prone to gushing.
If you want to keep it like that, then you'll let me handle this.<eos> Partner.<eos> You getting all this?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> They're going to kill them all.<eos> You're right, it is all your fault.<eos> You shouldn't have lied to me.<eos> You put my friends in jeopardy.<eos> And after we get them back, I don't ever want to see you again.
These are your muffins?<eos> My muffins.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> You know... These muffins might just turn out to be your problem, mate.<eos> You are aware, Dr. Lightman, that this evaluation is to determine whether I can allow you to leave the care of this hospital.<eos> Yes.<eos> And you're telling me the reason for your behavior is a homemade muffin?<eos> He is.<eos> And you know this because you ate one of these muffins?<eos> Wayne Dobar has been eating them for years.
So she doctored the muffins to keep you talking to the trees, mate.<eos> Each visit another batch of magic muffins, right?<eos> Why would I do that? Wayne's half of the estate for starters.<eos> It's more than that, though, isn't it?<eos> You hurt a little girl.<eos> That's where I come in because I take that very, very personally.<eos> Why did you do this to me, Gina?<eos> The lifeblood of the estate are the horses.<eos> I'm the one that takes care of them.<eos> Wayne's never understood them.
We grew up together.<eos> Got into a little trouble, chased a lot of girls.<eos> Loved the Sox.<eos> Stood up at each others' weddings.<eos> Became cops together.<eos> Vinny was the best man I ever knew.<eos> The night I got a call, my brother was murdered doing his job as an undercover police officer, I made a promise to make it right.<eos> It's a promise I haven't been able to keep... yet.<eos> No offender is too small.<eos> I want you to get people inside, I want you to flip them if you can, because I want guns, I want drugs, and I want warrants.
He knows the situation better than you, or me or anybody.<eos> He's the point.<eos> You got to let him make the call.<eos> TERESA: What else?<eos> Uh, Chamber of Commerce wants you to speak for half hour next week instead of 20 minutes.<eos> (sighs) Fine.<eos> You still have to look over those budget reports.<eos> Later.<eos> Those FBI gentlemen are still outside.<eos> Think we've made them cool their heels off enough?
Lilly... buy the ticket... with the money, and tell nobody where you are going... not even me.<eos> Hey.<eos> What?<eos> The cops are after him.<eos> Let me call him.<eos> Wait, no, no, no.<eos> Your phone may be bugged, okay?<eos> He said he'll call you when he can.<eos> W-What does he want me to do?<eos> Told me to get you, tell you to get all the records, move them someplace safe before the cops find them.
Time is of the essence; just a couple of questions.<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Just don't upset her.<eos> We won't, we won't. Let's go.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Ethel, I'm Detective Wysocki, and this is Detective Evers.<eos> Just gonna show you a couple of pictures for you to take a look at.<eos> Do you recognize any of these men?<eos> They were wearing masks during the robbery, but did you see any of them in the bank in the days leading up to it? Mm-mm.

Mm-mm.<eos> No?<eos> What do you remember from the robbery?<eos> Someone, someone took my gun.<eos> These two men.<eos> Uh, they made me help them with the cash drawers.
From what?<eos> From jail.<eos> And that is the best I can do.<eos> Come on, Teresa, you won't.<eos> You won't tell the FBI what happened.<eos> If Robert doesn't, then yes, I will. I absolutely will.<eos> Our kids are off limits to you from now on.<eos> Oh, Amy...<eos> I don't want them near you.<eos> I don't want them near you and your, your loneliness!
What is, is it my dedication to a wide range of children's charities?<eos> Because say the word.<eos> I will, I will cut those little bastards off.<eos> No, that's not it.<eos> Please don't do that.<eos> Come on then.<eos> One date.<eos> If you don't have a good time, I'll show up here in a nurse's outfit and clean barf trays all day.<eos> Look... the first year I worked here, two cops came in shot.<eos> And I'd helped them from time to time just like I hope you and Jarek.
So you didn't actually see the altercation which resulted in Mr. Molaro's injuries?<eos> He was resisting arrest.<eos> Were you in the room at the time of the assault?<eos> I was in the room next to him.<eos> The door was open.<eos> I could hear the whole thing.<eos> But you didn't see it.<eos> I was there.<eos> I could feel the whole thing happening.<eos> So you can feel events, even though you don't see them?
Well, you may have to get a new favorite color, Because I'm running out of red.<eos> Hi, handsome. Hey, pretty girl.<eos> Speaking of pretty.<eos> Oh, try them on.<eos> I custom-made these for j-lo, But she sent them back to me.<eos> Told me to pick the diamonds, And I thought these would look nice against her skin. She disagreed.<eos> Well, either that bitch is blind or insane,<eos> Because these are bananas. I know, right?<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Besides, I only want women who appreciate my pieces to wear them.
- It costs more.<eos> - I know.<eos> Talk to me in Japanese.<eos> Go on, make it up.<eos> Make it up.<eos> More.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means my tongue comes towards you.<eos> Slowly. It slithers across the floor. It slips under the bed.<eos> It reaches your feet. It licks them. It glides up along your leg.
- Drink!<eos> Drink!<eos> Drink! Drink!<eos> - Who wants some of my plant?<eos> - I don't believe you people were invited.<eos> - We've come to take Adam back.<eos> How dare you barge in here, you ill-mannered trash?<eos> You mongrels.<eos> Bet you didn't even wipe your feet.<eos> No, but we'll wipe them on the way out.
Don't bury me in black.<eos> Buy me a dress.<eos> A red dress.<eos> I've always loved red.<eos> Come on, drink this.<eos> And something plain, so I'll have two outfits.<eos> All right.<eos> And a pair of shoes, high heels.<eos> You can walk around in heaven in your high heels, just like a city girl.<eos> You can wear them every day.
Don't get mad.<eos> I just wanna know.<eos> Haoyan has someone else, doesn't she?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Come on.<eos> They'll never be as happy as we are.<eos> Haven't I always loved you like a mother?<eos> I'm you wife, as well as your mom, right?<eos> When your wet your pants, I washed them for you.
And I'm not judging.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah. Sounds more like pillow talk between two people in love. Don't you think?<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, of course you don't know.<eos> I mean, no one really knows.<eos> But these photos don't prove an absence of love.<eos> But what is love?<eos> Giving someone a foot rub every night even though you think feet look weird and you'd just assume not be reminded people have them?
Bring 'em in, guys!<eos> You guys are going to love this.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> Okay, if there are purple pianos involved in this, I am on board.<eos> These pianos were repossessed from foreclosed homes.<eos> They're cast-offs, just like all of us.<eos> Used, in need of repairs.<eos> But they're still capable of making beautiful music.<eos> Right.<eos> So Mr. Motta, as a lover of the arts, agreed to donate them to Glee.

We saw you sign for diamonds.<eos> Lots of them!<eos> I know you've got diamonds in there smaller than my pinkie fingernail that are worth more than a Porsche, all right?<eos> I don't give a shit what's in the safe as long as you fucking open it, so I'm gonna ask you one more time really nicely.<eos> Open the goddamn safe, pretty please.<eos> Please.<eos> Please!<eos> Who's cutting them?<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> These diamonds, who's cutting them?
Why are you telling us this?<eos> Because I'm that guy.<eos> I'm the one who can get the stones recut without anyone tracing them to us.<eos> We'll be partners.<eos> I'll sell the diamonds, give you the cash.<eos> Report them stolen, claim the insurance.<eos> Everybody wins and everybody lives.<eos> That is fucking brilliant.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> We take the diamonds and then we give them back to you?
Shit.<eos> Hey, Jim.<eos> Curtis.<eos> Dewart told me you took equipment from work for a project at your house.<eos> Said that's why you wanted him off your crew.<eos> I came out here to see it myself.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was just a hauler and a backhoe.<eos> It was Saturday.<eos> I had them back in less than eight hours.
I'm Laura, by the way.<eos> Tyler.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - What's with all the questions?<eos> Just being friendly.<eos> - Switch seats with me.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> Would you mind switching seats with me? Uh...<eos> I-I'm waiting for some friends.<eos> So if I sit here, I can see them comin'.
Your wife will be deemed a bit 'more or is it still on the planet diaper?<eos> It 's still on the planet diaper but do not panic!<eos> Regain Intimacy As soon as the child... has a mustache.<eos> Meanwhile, I can do something?<eos> No, you do not, thank you.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - A little bit 'of torticollis.<eos> By dint of seeing you play...<eos> Psychosomatic a stiff neck...<eos> Did you know that diapers also make them with elastic side bands system"and"keep it all inside?
Who are these two fat guys?<eos> These?<eos> They are the uncles of Molise.<eos> Remember who are facing difficulties to speak Italian?<eos> We have got that horrible under the horse dies.<eos> It was a dead donkey... ugly.<eos> Horrible.<eos> Watch...<eos> These are my classmates.<eos> - I remember them... ugly.
not so much.<eos> Let me have a puff.<eos> I used to smoke 40 a day and more.<eos> But not while I was pregnant with you. not a single one.<eos> Good girl.<eos> Yes, good mommy.<eos> And you don't mind the dead bodies?<eos> I couldn't do it.<eos> Someone has to do it.<eos> Do you wash and dress them too?
Sarah, I need you to realize that going undercover in a place like this can require certain difficult choices.<eos> - I'm well aware.<eos> You might find yourself becoming someone you no longer recognize.<eos> I'm willing to do whatever it takes.<eos> - I was just coming over to see you.<eos> - Really, about what?<eos> I'm having a bit of an issue with Devon and I was hoping that you could help.<eos> I can't get him to stop cooking with no shirt on.<eos> It's not that.<eos> I keep proposing baby names and he keeps shooting them down.
Okay, well, call your super-mommy and tell her that you'll be coming home late this week.<eos> Skipping gym?<eos> If you really want to earn some bad girl stripes, I'd be happy to help.<eos> If you're proposing that we get matching tattoos, the answer's no.<eos> - Mom?<eos> - Hey, sweetie.<eos> What's happening?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I, uh... I thought I'd make some pancakes.<eos> I haven't made them in a while.
Seriously.<eos> You believed that he was innocent from day one, and I jumped down your throat.<eos> I said some really heinous things about Toby.<eos> You should apologize to him, not me.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey! Cute boots.<eos> New? - Oh, ish.<eos> What is with this line?<eos> All the vending machines are on lockdown.<eos> Someone's been breaking into them after hours and stealing food.
You talking about a hit man?<eos> Assuming that's still what they're called.<eos> Wrong answer.<eos> That's what the kids call "epic fail."<eos> All I would need is a phone number. I'd do the rest.<eos> Saul, there'd be a finder's fee.<eos> A big one.<eos> If you held my feet to the fire, I could come up with names.<eos> One or two guys west of the Rockies who do this work. But guess what. These guys?<eos> They know Mike and Mike knows them.
Good.<eos> What you doing?<eos> I'm...<eos> Hey, listen, I'll cut to it. Another favor to ask.<eos> I'm thinking about Gus Fring. How he never goes anywhere.<eos> One restaurant, home, back and forth?<eos> I'm even more convinced it's bullshit because he owns 13 other restaurants. Right?<eos> So I start thinking about this little empire of his.<eos> Fourteen restaurants.<eos> Who supplies them?
Do you guys use that here?<eos> Because it is the best.<eos> It's like having a calculator on your computer.<eos> Amazing. - Ms. white, how did you get this job?<eos> - Ted hired me.<eos> No, I mean your qualifications.<eos> What are your qualifications?<eos> Where did you get your training?<eos> Well, I haven't had any training, per se. I've always been naturally good with numbers.<eos> Got a good instinct for them.
So you think our psycho has got a flesh collection?<eos> Think he's got a pair of gloves.<eos> Finally.<eos> Great, I am in.<eos> Let's see what Froman was up to. Ooh.<eos> We did not find that.<eos> According to his history, Froman printed out the specs for a warehouse earmarked for the Phelps case.<eos> Her entire estate was deemed the result of a criminal enterprise.<eos> Rather than secure her 400-acre residence in Virginia, NCIS took possession of all her possessions.<eos> And relocated them to a secure warehouse.
Her parents and a younger brother still live there.<eos> She married?<eos> Single.<eos> Shared an apartment with a roommate in Alexandria.<eos> That roommate's actually here, being brought to the conference room.<eos> McGee, take DiNozzo.<eos> Go. Ziva, you're with me.<eos> We appreciate you coming in, Miss Park.<eos> Do Lauren's parents know?<eos> Casualty Assistance Officers are notifying them.
But it hasn't been right between you.<eos> Well, not lately.<eos> Can't just be something you did.<eos> Pushing you away, pulling this Barrett close.<eos> Even him and Kort seem to have something cooking.<eos> It's tough to miss.<eos> Well, I hope these old ghosts will tell you what you need to hear.<eos> You do hear ghosts, probie?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I see them, too.
There's no time to rest.<eos> We gotta keep movin'.<eos> Alcide, I know you don't like him, but if he dies, Pam'll kill me.<eos> Hey, Sookie!<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Come. Come play with me.<eos> It's wonderful here.<eos> I am Aegir, God of the Sea, and you are Ran, my sea goddess.<eos> There's big gators in there, you crazy Viking!<eos> Get on out and let's go home, before one of them chomps off your you-know-what.
(All) Hi, Dave!<eos> Dave, this is my grandma Nellie.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Boop! Oh!<eos> I'm gonna get a scotch.<eos> You want a scotch?<eos> Oh! You're so cute!<eos> Jane, what are you doing here?<eos> Well, you never got back to me on who you liked, so I picked the ten best roommate candidates and invited them over for a little open house.
Inform His Highness.<eos> All is in order<eos> Sir!<eos> Report!<eos> A carrier pigeon has arrived<eos> News from Red Rock Gully?<eos> Your Highness Su Huirong was rescued by a swordsman He gave his name as Zhao Huai'an<eos> Jinliang Which way do you think the fugitives will go?<eos> East would be back to the capital<eos> North would take them to the border
I'm gonna set up the ladder next to the crawl space.<eos> I want to talk to you about my boyfriend.<eos> Well, I don't want to talk to you.<eos> Oh, you tango divine!<eos> I don't know if you have heard, but there's going to come a time...<eos> How did we do up there?<eos> Terri?<eos> - Five mice!<eos> - That's not bad.<eos> Well, we'll put them in the marsh.

Poor woman.<eos> There's always one that can't keep order, isn't there?<eos> And what does Miss Burton do about that?<eos> Oh, she comes and gives us all a frightful telling off.<eos> She strikes terror in our very hearts.<eos> Does she now?<eos> What, and you, you don't mind that then?<eos> Oh, no, we all worship her.<eos> It's funny, everything's sort of changed since that night she stayed at Maythorpe.<eos> It's as if by wearing my things she's put a spell on them and made things different for me.
She wasn't in a fit state to be in charge of a class of lively schoolgirls.<eos> It really was all my fault, Daddy.<eos> I dare say it was.<eos> I've heard the way you talk about the poor woman.<eos> I think girls are worse than boys sometimes, don't you?<eos> Least said, soonest mended then.<eos> You'll live.<eos> Up to your room.<eos> I blame myself.<eos> There were warning signs weeks ago and I ignored them.
Hector beats up a kid for no reason and you just talk to him, he should be suspended.<eos> Quite frankly he should be arrested. Dan.<eos> You know I am right, but you're not going to let anything happen to him.<eos> Bottom line is Hector Torres is the best fighter this school, this town, has ever had.<eos> He's fighting the toughest league in the state and no one can compete with him, the kid's going to the amateurs.<eos> And if you're lucky you will be there to carry his spit bucket.<eos> It's a heck of a lot better than cleaning up after him.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> I am doing it too, alright.<eos> We see ourselves in these kids and we push them to be great, the only difference is my kid's got it and your's doesn't.
You know, he was low-balling you with that first offer.<eos> I showed him he's not the only one in this town that understands a value.<eos> He called you?<eos> Well, it doesn't matter how it happened. The point is I said yes.<eos> I'm selling.<eos> Yeah, but -- but -- but what about our customers?<eos> We have relationships, and -- nonsense.<eos> Internet killed all of that.<eos> And our employees?<eos> If they're any good, Scarpulla will snap them up.
Ok.<eos> Goodbye Mrs. Amalia.<eos> Jimena is still at the hospital.<eos> They still have to run some tests.<eos> You are not going to take Jimena.<eos> You can take me if you want...<eos> Better yet, my Grandma Carmela who is waiting for death to come for her.<eos> Do dead people float?<eos> Only for a while...<eos> Afterwards, the sharks eat them.
I will always take care of you.<eos> I will always look after you.<eos> Is there anyone home?<eos> Cayetana...<eos> Here, in the study.<eos> The swines took everything, Cayetana.<eos> They took your trophies.<eos> But you still have your paintings...<eos> Yes...<eos> Why do you think they left them?
You can't be in here!<eos> Go on...<eos> It' a sedative...<eos> You'll feel better with this.<eos> Get some rest...<eos> Cayetana...<eos> What' that smell outside?<eos> Are there flowers?<eos> Yes, a lot...<eos> But I'll throw them in the trash, just the way you would.
You didn't take my advice.<eos> Have you convinced your friend to be a witness?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Although it may have made him into a target.<eos> Do the people at High Star know that he's talking to you?<eos> He says no, but the explosion uptown may have been meant for him.<eos> Your firm is never gonna let you try this case, Ellen.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Because ever since Hollis Nye retired, they have no backbone.<eos> Defendants like this terrify them.
- Do you know the purpose of that mission?<eos> They go to a village, and then they take someone away.<eos> Who did they take?<eos> An Afghan.<eos> And that's all I know.<eos> And why did they take him?<eos> Every mission, they take someone away.<eos> Dangerous men who have knowledge.<eos> What did Chris' unit do with these men?<eos> Interrogate them.
We traced one the transistors back to Grey Industries.<eos> As in Lord Cooper Grey?<eos> Serving five years for fraud in a minimum security facility in Florida.<eos> Thank God I got my shares out before he went to jail.<eos> A lotta losers took a bath.<eos> Like my mother-in-law.<eos> She lost her savings because of that guy and now she lives in my den.<eos> Grey's sons are running the company while he's in jail.<eos> Simon and Ted, trust fund kids, kicked out of private school, so their father pulled strings to get them into Western.<eos> That's how I know them, Western boys.
The radioactive crown jewels of the Ultrasphinx.<eos> Careful, Lois.<eos> Plutonium-240 is lethal.<eos> Not for the next 24 hours it isn't.<eos> Look, guys, I'm flattered.<eos> But you'd have to go a long way to outdo Superman.<eos> You would spurn my affections for a dalliance with this--?<eos> Careful.<eos> If I win your heart I'll make the Titans kneel before you and give testimony to your loveliness.<eos> I'll crush diamonds in my mighty fist and make them into sparkling wine.
Oh. See you all tomorrow.<eos> We need to get Genie's paper back. Oh, dear.<eos> Um, Genie's paper's already gone into the Blue Box.<eos> So I'll just take the box. Uh, no.<eos> You see, the children take the paper from the box and bring it to the scissor and paste station, and--<eos> Just tell me where the paper is.<eos> Well, it's all been transformed into birds.<eos> You see, like a blue jay or maybe a robin or--<eos> Where... are... the birdies? Now?<eos> We finished the unit, so the children are taking them home.
There's a clog in the girls washroom.<eos> Can you take a look?<eos> Oui, si, bueno senorita.<eos> Mucho gusta nada.<eos> Dammit!<eos> Mm, these are good, Genie, really good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Can I have my stickers?<eos> Where did you get these?<eos> Tell her your Aunt Alex left them at your house.

- Lia?<eos> - Sia.<eos> Sia Tsouka.<eos> Father's name, John and mother's name Vassilia.<eos> Go, get out of here.<eos> ...the accused had broken the window of the boutique... had entered the boutique and was throwing clothes on the sidewalk...<eos> Police officer P.T. Was an eye-witness to the scene...<eos> He stopped...<eos> If I give the clothes back will they let me go?<eos> I'll wash them, iron them, they'll be as good as new...
They're scurrying away.<eos> And you know that for sure?<eos> I know what fear does to people. We will drive all those that remain from the ruins of Camelot. Then we will celebrate our wedding and make preparations for our coronation.<eos> Oh, come on, you've got to admit, it's exciting.<eos> I'd be excited if you were planning battles, instead of ceremonies-my Lord.<eos> My father stayed King because he never became complacent.<eos> I hope I won't have cause to doubt our alliance.<eos> Ready?<eos> Stronger together.<eos> I'm looking for my sons, Kay and Arthur. Have you seen them?
Those lanterns with these...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> It's just, uh...<eos> Oatmeal raisin.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You've been such a good friend to me.<eos> Hey, relax!<eos> There was, like, a hundred of 'em on a tray.<eos> So, take the drawings home.<eos> Live with them.
Like, which nurse has the shakes or where do they hide the good painkillers?<eos> Look, nothing personal, but I don't want to be your dialysis buddy.<eos> I wanna sit here and play scrabble on my phone while this... while this machine washes my blood.<eos> So you don't want to talk or be friendly or keep each other company?<eos> Sad, isn't it?<eos> You know, Dick... sometimes when I meet people, they say,<eos> "you don't seem like a Susan."<eos> But you...<eos> Why are you putting out those ugly candlesticks? Oh.<eos> Who gave them to me?
You know, I can see why you're frustrated.<eos> Waiting for a transplant is brutal.<eos> I-I get that.<eos> But that doesn't mean that you can't try to stay positive while you wait for the good news.<eos> The good news?<eos> When this beeper goes off, that means someone died.<eos> That's what we're waiting for...<eos> for some poor son of a bitch who didn't use a helmet or a seat belt to die.<eos> We're waiting for a doctor to ask a family who, moments earlier, lost someone they loved to let them harvest their organs.<eos> And then we're waiting to see who gets them.
Yeah. I think I'm gonna hold off on that for a while.<eos> Why?<eos> Because...<eos> I kind of love this smell.<eos> Okay, now you're becoming delirious.<eos> We've gotta get you out of here.<eos> Hey, you don't have children, so you don't get it.<eos> But raising kids is an amazing experience.<eos> It is the most meaningful thing I've ever done.<eos> So anything that reminds me of them is a good thing.
Oh, hello, Gaby.<eos> What is this?<eos> Juanita's helping me make dinner.<eos> Good job. Now after you're done washing the brussels sprouts, you can help me set the table.<eos> Yes, Mrs. Van de Kamp.<eos> Brussels sprouts?<eos> You do know the girls are eating here tonight?<eos> Yes. Don't they like brussels sprouts?<eos> Sure... as projectiles.<eos> Well, they'll eat them tonight, or no cupcakes.
- Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My brother told me that there was a hospital for the criminally insane on the outskirts of town.<eos> And at night, the inmates would escape and kidnap little boys and girls.<eos> But it's not real.<eos> His brother was just trying to scare him.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It was totally real.<eos> One summer, three kids went missing.<eos> - Until they found them...
Would you like me to put it on a plate for you, or do you wanna eat it later?<eos> I think I'll have it now.<eos> In fact, I'd love for you to join me.<eos> Oh, I can't.<eos> Actually, I'm on my way to a function at M.J.' school.<eos> I'm sure you have a few minutes.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Uh... I'm kind of in a rush.<eos> But it's not fair.<eos> You go to all this trouble to bring me these delicious meals, and we never share them.
I'm 38.<eos> Am I under oath?<eos> - No.<eos> - 38.<eos> I don't think you appreciate The seriousness of the position you're in.<eos> You could have killed someone at that school.<eos> But I didn't poison the cookies.<eos> Yet you knew they were poisoned.<eos> Yes, by Felicia Tillman.<eos> I mean... Okay, I baked them, but she added the poison.
Right.<eos> Of course.<eos> I knew that.<eos> It's funny the way life works out sometimes, isn't it?<eos> I mean, I wasn't even supposed to be here today.<eos> Once again, in the wrong place at the wrong time.<eos> Now I have to carry this around with me for the rest of my life.<eos> Don't be sad, Mrs. Delfino.<eos> Cupcake was kind of a bad hamster.<eos> She had three babies and ate them.
I thought you should know, young Skywalker, that your friends are walking into a trap.<eos> Wow.<eos> You're white?<eos> You totally sounded black on the phone.<eos> Silence!<eos> You will turn to the dark side, and your precious rebellion will be destroyed.<eos> Oh! I'm afraid the shield generator will be quite operational when your friends arrive.<eos> Jeez, you don't have to be a dick about it.<eos> All right, everybody, hands in the air!<eos> All right. Now I want you to take off your helmets, go outside and dig your own graves with them.
Most people would have just walked past.<eos> That's it.<eos> These clothes belong to the murderer's victim.<eos> They were covered in blood.<eos> But blood stains don't necessarily mean a murder.<eos> Yes, but this...<eos> Don't you think your story is a bit weak?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> If those clothes belonged to the person that man killed, why didn't he burn them?

Oh, but I think you will.<eos> I have ordered my children to kill your friends.<eos> The question is, which one will you choose to save?<eos> Your master? Or your apprentice?<eos> You must now release the guilt and free yourself by choosing.<eos> No!<eos> Their powers are too strong for us, Anakin!<eos> Save Ahsoka!<eos> Let them go.<eos> Only you can make my children release them.
Uh, sir, the prisoners did not make it to the interrogation level.<eos> What... Did... You...<eos> Um, we think they might have gone to the...<eos> Sir, count dooku commands you to contact him immediately.<eos> Inform count dooku that I am unreachable.<eos> Send all units to the airfield.<eos> It's their only possible way of escape.<eos> Hold it.<eos> Where are you going with these prisoners?<eos> We're transferring them aboard the shuttle from Citadel to Point Tarron.
Would you mind?<eos> I know she's gotta be here somewhere.<eos> 98, 99, 100.<eos> Ready or not, here I come.<eos> Male reporter: Earlier today in an upscale suburb of Cleveland, the unthinkable has happened.<eos> Eight-year-old Samantha Weller has been abducted in front of her family home.<eos> Through the afternoon, evening, and late into the night, police and volunteers continue to search for the little girl whose disappearance has gripped the hearts of Ohio.<eos> As an anxious Cleveland holds its breath, wanting to know what happened to little Samantha.<eos> By all accounts, the parents are loving, they're responsible... And they're terrified.<eos> The police interviewed them separately?
Objection! Step up, please.<eos> Did I do something wrong again?<eos> You're very clever, Ms. Korn.<eos> I'm not sure I know what you're referring to.<eos> I think you do.<eos> The adorable old lady routine... bumbling around the courtroom as she accidentally sneaks in inadmissible evidence, back-dooring that this kid wasn't the target, that he was in a clinic.<eos> Well, Your Honor, I'm still familiarizing myself with the criminal rules of evidence.<eos> I suspect you know the rules of evidence just fine.<eos> Here's the deal, Ms. Korn.<eos> The tricks you pull as a patent lawyer... don't be pulling them in my courtroom.
- They are few, but the most grave.<eos> Tell me.<eos> - My husband, Your Holiness, has long been distasteful to me.<eos> - I fear you are not the first woman to share that fate.<eos> - His person I find repellent.<eos> His advances sicken me.<eos> His hand upon my body makes me retch with disgust.<eos> - Have you denied him your duties as a wife?<eos> - No, Your Holiness.<eos> I performed them as the Church says I must.
This is the right thing, trust me.<eos> I've spoken at last to the captain of Transporter 9, which is now orbiting Carpathia.<eos> 'They are entering the most dangerous part of their journey.<eos> 'I will be in constant contact with Captain Kellerman' and will keep you informed of all developments.<eos> 'All public screens will now show the transporter's position 'and significant flight data.<eos> 'Let's all unite in hope' for the safe arrival of our brothers and sisters nearing the end of their long voyage from Earth.<eos> Mitchell's back, a day earlier than I expected.<eos> Mmm...bet he's pleased with the weapons ban.<eos> When Linus was a baby I used to take him down to the fence when the expeditionaries came home, hold him up high above the fence so Mitchell could see him.<eos> Nobody goes to welcome them back any more.
Go long.<eos> Come on, Kennedy!<eos> You got hands like bricks!<eos> Henry cabot lodge and I have had the opportunity of serving with president eisenhower...<eos> Hell, I don't think I'd buy a used car from that man.<eos> Would you, Mike?<eos> Who'd you vote for, senator? Me?<eos> Well, I'm a, uh, I'm a strict party guy, so...<eos> Senator.<eos> I've, uh, been putting together some clippings, in case your wife might want them.
Please, continue with your work.<eos> Rousseau!<eos> What are you doing? !<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That's the wrong building.<eos> Bovine.<eos> Got it, boss.<eos> Let's get home, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just going to check the fuses, make sure the dust doesn't clog them up.
OK, mister, you need to show us some ID and come with us.<eos> What is it?<eos> Diamonds.<eos> What's this joker doing throwing diamonds around like peanuts?<eos> Come on.<eos> Come and see!<eos> Come and see your planet!<eos> He had dozens of them.<eos> Well, maybe he knocked over a Tiffany's before he jumped the transporter.<eos> No, he found them right here, on Carpathia.
Good. We need this baby to survive.<eos> Mum?<eos> Stacy wants to know if you want to eat with us.<eos> - I'd like that very much.<eos> - Mum's weird.<eos> - So what? You're always weird!<eos> Radio contact to be maintained at all times and shoot on sight any assailant or intruder.<eos> - Hang about.<eos> - This is my operation.<eos> Yeah, operation, not war. We're finding your men, Jack, not avenging them.
She had to feed seven children.<eos> She was in the field that morning when they came.<eos> August '44.<eos> With her three older sons, and my sister, Milica,<eos> four years old.<eos> I was the youngest.<eos> My grandmother had taken me and two of my brothers to the side of the mountain to look after the cows.<eos> Thirteenth Handzar Division, full of Turks and Ustashas,<eos> was passing by.<eos> They found a woman with children in the field, and they killed them all.
Trade?<eos> No.<eos> Shit.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> This trinket of sensation you feel now will be a delight compared to the onslaught of agony that awaits at our hands.<eos> These banal beings have nothing.<eos> Desire has abandoned them all.
No, but... it's just that I was going to use my grandad's money to set us up in business, selling car stereos to Premiership footballers.<eos> Neil was going to work in the depot, but... me, you and Rio Ferdinand are on sales, like, having a laugh and that.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yeah, I'm going to do sociology.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'm sorry I ripped your tickets up now.<eos> Could have had a bit of a send-off.<eos> - What tickets?<eos> - Boat party ones.<eos> I bought them when I was pissed the other night. I thought I'd surprise you.
Just... Just say thank you.<eos> Is that a new sweater vest?<eos> You never say thank you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Kate.<eos> Hey, Lauren.<eos> What?<eos> You wanna give me a raise?<eos> No, you are willing to admit that lawyers burn bridges and mediators build them.
You log every access request?<eos> - Yes. - Can you tell me the last person to ask to access that file?<eos> Well, you were... - and a... - Detective Sergeant Delaney.<eos> See?<eos> They're geeks.<eos> The reason no-one's here is cos they can talk to each other without even speaking.<eos> I know why I got shot.<eos> Harvey Wratten needed to get himself out of jail.<eos> To do that, he got Gatehouse to buy up a huge amount of drugs and pass them on to Customs.<eos> Delaney found out and wanted to get in on the act, so he stole 30 kilos of heroin from a leaky property room and sold them on to Gatehouse and when Customs got them, they gave them back to you.
The villagers said they had never tasted anything so delicious<eos> You must be familiar with the case<eos> Are you alright?<eos> I'm fine, Captain You'll get used to it in time<eos> Listen<eos> The 72 Demons are the last surviving Tanguts They used to be civilized, like us<eos> But after the massacre of 800,000 Tanguts<eos> The survivors became savages<eos> They ate raw meat and left their dead unburied<eos> Hunger for revenge is what keeps them alive
Everyone looks to me now.<eos> I saw how you handled the hearing with Katelyn's father.<eos> You listened and you questioned.<eos> Even the fact you convened it in the first place.<eos> You understand the people, and you care.<eos> Well done.<eos> Family disagreements, territorial wrangling-- you handled them all superbly.<eos> And when the time comes, all of them shall owe you loyalty.<eos> But now you must apply yourself to your new powers.<eos> You asked for them, and yet you shy away from using them.
This feels another life away.<eos> I'll go in first.<eos> I've been kidding myself I could walk back in and my parents would still be here.<eos> I know.<eos> The books are gone, Merlin.<eos> No...<eos> They have to be here!<eos> They're not.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> Maybe someone took them, or used them as fuel for their fires.
Come on.<eos> Good night.<eos> Father.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> We could stay longer, if you want.<eos> No.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> So many books. And they're all different.<eos> All human experience is here.<eos> - Why did he hide them?
Find the attackers, assess the weight of their forces, and return.<eos> Don't engage them.<eos> Whatever happens, be back here by dawn.<eos> - You can depend on us.<eos> - Go!<eos> A fuck and a fight!<eos> This is turning into a good night.<eos> Men treat all this like some kind of great game.<eos> Guinevere, they're warriors.<eos> The prospect of battle excites them.
Well, are you going to sabotage this case, for example?<eos> Or is that just something you do when you're prosecuting psychopathic teachers?<eos> You don't scare me.<eos> It's an adversarial system. No point pretending we're not adversaries.<eos> Joint enterprise.<eos> What is it?<eos> Well, we say that Mark Draper did the actual stabbing that caused Colin Guthrie's tragic death. But the getaway driver is just as guilty of robbery as the man standing in the bank with the sawn-off shotgun.<eos> Emma Slater had control of the knife for some time within the house.<eos> Her fingerprints are on the knife, she may even have brought the knife into the house.<eos> Neither of the defendants will be denying that they were there that night. But you would be wrong in thinking that it's irrelevant that Mrs. Guthrie subsequently picked them out on an ID parade.
When Malcolm jumped off that building, bounced off the awning and then landed on you, and then Adam hit you with his fully-loaded Mercedes...<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm temping.<eos> It was to bring the four of us together.<eos> You protect me and my place, my law firm will defend you for free.<eos> Cut the condescending crap. It makes you come off bald.<eos> This how you ask for a favor?<eos> The tricks you pulled as patent lawyer?<eos> Don't be pulling them in my courtroom.
I, uh, I'm not sure.<eos> Vivian!<eos> Let me through before I cut you!<eos> Butter Buns, you okay?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Vivian, it's me, Tommi.<eos> Remember?<eos> Sort of.<eos> What about your parents?<eos> Do you remember them?
Well, I'm ready to pick some pockets.<eos> That sounds like work and I said no working.<eos> Boss's orders.<eos> It's how I cut loose.<eos> Oh, I see a DJ. Whoo-ooo!<eos> So, there I was in the middle of the Congolese rainforest, cradling my dearest friend, Lahoti, the blood gushing from his heart wound.<eos> And with his last breath he leaned up and whispered in my ear, "Benjamin, you are my hero. "<eos> Something similar happened to me the other day.<eos> I was in the office cradling a box of staples when I realized I needed paperclips.<eos> So then I got the paperclips and I spilt them.
Hendricks: Where are we?<eos> I think we're headed northeast.<eos> Canada is northeast.<eos> Wouldn't that be something?<eos> So how did Lafayve catch Gunther?<eos> Well, after the five boys were found dead, the little girl went missing and we looked for days.<eos> What happened?<eos> You know, that farm out by Munger Road--<eos> The farmhouse that Jimmy Pratt used to use for farming?<eos> They had a house there with a basement and that's where Gunther used to take them.
None of this looks good.<eos> I'm still here.<eos> I just wanted to make sure that you're okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I was running... around Washington Square Park.<eos> And this couple with a stroller crossed my path, and I didn't see them in time, and I fell, and I scraped my knee really bad.<eos> And so I went into the restroom in the park, and I grabbed a bunch of toilet paper off this damp roll in the sink, and I tried to clean myself up.<eos> It hurt like hell.<eos> Anyway, there were these two guys... and they were standing, uh, like, back-to-back at the urinals.<eos> I barely even noticed them... Until I was about to leave.
I keep saying I'm not. But... oh, I can smell myself.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Well, there are worse things than being dead.<eos> Just look at me. You can be seen and heard by others.<eos> And I can't.<eos> What, you're really a ghost?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you've stayed so pretty. Like the dead stay pretty in our memories.<eos> You don't think of them like me.<eos> You never picture them rotting.
Cut it, cut it, cut it!<eos> Okay, so it might take longer than we thought.<eos> Flashlight?<eos> Wait, I thought the FTL was fixed.<eos> It is, but without full shield coverage, we risk tearing the ship apart the second we jump.<eos> How long till the second cluster gets here?<eos> There's no way to know for sure. It could be anytime.<eos> I don't suppose there's any chance of negotiating with these things?<eos> It's an automated weapons system.<eos> The Ursini believe that the civilization that created them died out a long time ago.
The alien ship just jumped to hyperspace.<eos> Good for them.<eos> No, but the drones they were attacking, they're heading our way.<eos> That's too many.<eos> We can't hold them all off at once.<eos> Rush, how long till that program is ready?<eos> Give us five minutes.<eos> You don't have five minutes.<eos> Uh, Destiny, I'm not sure if you're seeing this, but we've got a whole bunch more of those drones coming your way.<eos> We're tracking them. I want you out of there.
We'd best let Eli and Ginn know for their sake.<eos> For now is it okay if we keep it our secret?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> I really need to go now.<eos> Do you have to?<eos> Well, for one, I've been away long enough for Colonel Young to start getting hysterical...<eos> And another is, I have to work.<eos> So... Is there a door somewhere, or do I just click my heels together?<eos> It's even easier than that.<eos> All you need to do is sit, close your eyes, and when you open them, you'll be back.
I think it's "who."<eos> "Afraid of who."<eos> Afraid not.<eos> Hey... What've we got here?<eos> This is one of the last rooms in this section.<eos> I'm guessing more ancient containers.<eos> I want to see them rescued as much as anyone, but we have to consider the possibility that they may already be dead.<eos> We swept the area.<eos> If they were dead, why didn't we find the bodies?<eos> Maybe the creature dragged them away, took them somewhere it wouldn't be disturbed.
She says, "and you, you look exactly the same, maybe a little fatter."<eos> This is my life now.<eos> And believe me, I'm not complaining.<eos> I'm happily married to the most wonderful woman.<eos> We've got two delicious kids, friends. Ah, I say "friends,"<eos> but at a certain point in life, men don't actually pick their friends, you know?<eos> They're either the husbands of my wife's friends, or their kids go to school with my kids, so suddenly we're friends.<eos> Look at these guys...<eos> Nice guys.<eos> Didn't necessarily want them, but I got them.
Done!<eos> Take a look at that.<eos> Who's your hoosier now, baby?<eos> Yeah, anybody can do Indiana.<eos> This is fantastic!<eos> Thank you!<eos> It's my pleasure.<eos> Just keep it away from open flames, uh...<eos> And birds.<eos> The fumes make them crazy.
To be near the Tree Spirits.<eos> That is their city.<eos> We protect them from the pirates.<eos> How do you get down to the sea from here?<eos> The same way you were brought in.<eos> Through a secret passage, through those mountains.<eos> Will you show me?<eos> If you try to rescue your friends, the pirates will capture and torture you, until you show them the mountain passage.<eos> But I can't just sit on my hands.<eos> I'm the one that got them into this mess. I've got to find a way to get them home safe.
Who'll it be?<eos> How about you, Starkey?<eos> You could take me... If you had the guts.<eos> Just because it didn't turn out how we wanted doesn't mean we have to give up.<eos> I could get more men here in days heavily armed with gatling guns and grenades and fire in their hearts!<eos> 50, a hundred, perhaps a thousand!<eos> We can overrun the Indians and force the tree spirits to give up the secret of the mineral dust.<eos> And where will you get these men from?<eos> I'll go back to London.<eos> Recruit them from the streets.
No, I love your get-up.<eos> That's great. You should dress as a pirate more often, huh?<eos> - Hey, hey, cuddle me, shipmate.<eos> - Rory, stop.<eos> Everything is totally brilliant, isn't it?<eos> Huh? Look at these brilliant pirates. Look at their brilliant beards.<eos> I'd like a beard.<eos> - I'm going to grow a beard.<eos> You're not!<eos> The music turns them into fools.
It's teleporting everyone on board.<eos> The crew are dead and so the sick bay has had nothing to do. It's been looking after humanity whilst it's been idle.<eos> Look at her.<eos> A virtual doctor! Able to sterilise a whole room.<eos> - Able to burn your face off.<eos> - She's just an interface.<eos> Seeped through thejoin between the planes. Broadcast in our world.<eos> Protean circuitry means she can change her form. And become a human doctorfor humans.<eos> Oh, sister, you are good!<eos> She won't let us take them.

Right. We are in deep space.<eos> Very, very deep.<eos> And somebody's knocking.<eos> Oh, come here.<eos> Come here, you scrumptious little beauty.<eos> - A box?<eos> - Doctor, what is it?<eos> I've got mail.<eos> Time Lord emergency messaging system.<eos> In an emergency, we wrap up our thoughts in psychic containers and send them through time and space.
So let's clear the air and we can move on, yes?<eos> Uncle Paul...<eos> It's okay, kid.<eos> Just say it.<eos> Paul, he needs a doctor.<eos> Tell me it's all gonna be good.<eos> The heroin, I'm sorry!<eos> I don't care about the heroin.<eos> Just tell me about the cops.<eos> You met again with them this morning, didn't you?
There's gotta be a way... To get people around here more involved in what's going on out there.<eos> So, if something like this immigrant deportation shit happens... In our community, we're like one collective voice.<eos> Do you know her?<eos> She's the head of human resources.<eos> She's awful.<eos> We gotta get around people like that.<eos> It's the gate-keepers, Tyler.<eos> We gotta get around the gate-keepers.<eos> They want to keep us in our little boxes, so we don't connect.<eos> And, if we get around them, that's when we're gonna start to affect change...
I think that our kids need you more than the orphans do.<eos> They're not fucking orphans!<eos> They are fucking African children with no fucking legs and no fucking water!<eos> How many fucking times do I have to tell you this?<eos> You know what?<eos> You cannot just walk in here whenever you want to come home.<eos> - What are we doing here?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I mean how long do you want to keep going on like this?<eos> It is devastating them.
You sure that's the right place for her?<eos> Sounds a little snobby.<eos> I've done my research, we've visited.<eos> It's a perfect fit.<eos> You feel pressure, we need you to tell us when the urge to void becomes unbearable.<eos> Sorry, can't make you feel better till we make you feel worse.<eos> I get it.<eos> Goes for what I do, too.<eos> We cause pain when it's the only option.<eos> The kids I work with at the camp are there because a judge sent them.

That's not gonna happen unless I push them.<eos> I don't see why metaphorical pushing has to involve actual pushing.<eos> I may work these kids hard, but I never hit them.

I'm thinking pizza.<eos> How about we grab a couple pies after I pick you and Jack up from the airport?<eos> That sounds great, Rick.<eos> I had this sick idea for Sunday's barbecue.<eos> Jack's going to be bored out of his skull-<eos> - What's the holdup?<eos> - Give me a minute!<eos> so I'm gonna get one of those Bounce-A-Rama things-<eos> You said that 20 minutes ago!<eos> throw him in there with other kids. Let them bounce the crap out of each other while the "grown-ups"get wasted.
Now moms and dads have to fight.<eos> After that, they blew up all the capitals.<eos> New York, Washington, D. C., Paris.<eos> To all the major cities.<eos> Then they came.<eos> There were millions of them.<eos> We call them Skitters and Mechs.<eos> They killed grown-ups, and they catch kids.<eos> They put on harness things.<eos> They put it on kids and control them.
- Oh, man... It had to have been within the last few hours.<eos> We weren't gone that long.<eos> Ugh, if I give that bellman any more money, he's gonna have to claim me on his tax return.<eos> That's the envelope.<eos> That guy is dropping it off at the desk.<eos> Okay, well, so we've got a who.<eos> We need a why.<eos> Create a panic in the financial markets, take advantage?<eos> We gotta get the Wall Street guys to cancel their back-patting ceremony tonight.<eos> By telling them what, that Shakespeare's Lost Folio is gonna kill them?
- Thanks.<eos> - What about you?<eos> - I'll improvise.<eos> - Let us out.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> - Can you show me the way?<eos> - Come on.<eos> Well, this is great, innit?<eos> Creatures outside where we can't see 'em, creature inside where we've got no lights and no exit.<eos> Got to be honest, I prefer hunting dinosaurs on dry land, at least you can see them coming.
That's right... my boy, Rick.<eos> Okay, look, everybody, I know what you're going through.<eos> We all just want to get our kids back.<eos> And I promise that we're gonna do everything possible to make sure that that happens.<eos> Wait, look.<eos> There's a... there's a school-announcement board here.<eos> Why don't you guys take your pictures and post your missing kids up here?<eos> Great idea.<eos> - Yeah, and write their name, hair color, weight, height...<eos> Last time that you saw them.
I'm just glad you came back.<eos> I'm just glad that you're alive.<eos> Dad... They killed those kids.<eos> Wait a minute. What kids?<eos> Ben?<eos> ! No, no, not Ben.<eos> What kids?<eos> Not Ben. The other crew.<eos> The ones with Mike's son.<eos> Yeah. I don't know why, but... The skitter made the mech kill them, and they let me go.
Come on, come on!<eos> - You okay?<eos> - I've been better.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I know it's horrible...<eos> And I hate it, but -- No!<eos> Look, man, we got to defend ourselves.<eos> We're not shooting kids!<eos> Look for the Skitter controlling them.
We want to move.<eos> Show me what you got.<eos> Okay.<eos> We rip out this window, eight go in.<eos> We assume that the noise wakes up the Skitters and draws the Mech.<eos> The Mech comes around. It gets blown up right here.<eos> Inside, we've got two men on this door facing the hallway -- continuous fire once the Skitters show up.<eos> That leaves six men in the room to kill the Skitters.<eos> Hard to time that.<eos> Grab the kids, get them back out that window, and we disappear into the woods.
Sophie ran away from here six months ago.<eos> I haven't seen her since.<eos> Do you have any leads?<eos> Any, um, addresses?<eos> Friends?<eos> Uh, phone numbers? She got caught up with some older kids.<eos> They weren't the best influence.<eos> I tried to talk to her, but...<eos> You misstep and you misstep, and...<eos> You realize you're losing them, but...
I know. It's amazing.<eos> Aren't you gonna congratulate me?<eos> Whenever you're ready.<eos> Does no one see a conflict of interest here?<eos> I'm trained to be unbiased.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> Of course not.<eos> The bio-cortex recorder is completely non-invasive.<eos> It simply records memories from the events of your past, and downloads them to this little drive here.
Min, how are you?<eos> Great to see you.<eos> I don't want to interrupt.<eos> Dick, great timing.<eos> We seem to be in sync on the broad strokes of the deal.<eos> Shall we get back to the letter of intent?<eos> Min, I have to tell you, I think you're making a big mistake here.<eos> There's great value in the real estate assets.<eos> How about we walk through the portfolio and I'll show you?<eos> We have looked at them.
They don't want this deal.<eos> The deal is hanging by a thread because the closer they get to Lehman the more it looks like a toxic waste dump.<eos> Which is why at the end of the day we may have to help them, which would be a lot easier if we didn't publicly state that...<eos> We can't, Tim.<eos> Legally we can't.<eos> Legally we haven't figured out how yet.<eos> I am concerned we are limiting our options at a time when we have very few, if any, available.<eos> I want all the C.E.O.s in a room.<eos> We've got the weekend.<eos> We lock them in a room at the Fed and we don't let them out until they have a solution on Lehman.
No, he's getting funnier, okay?<eos> The other day he made sort of a joke.<eos> It was actually kind of sweet.<eos> He said my name, Mel, and that it was probably short for melody.<eos> That is hilarious.<eos> So seriously, what the heck is going on here?<eos> What do you mean, what the heck's going on here?<eos> I know you hate when I say things about your personal life--<eos> Yeah, but you say them anyway.<eos> Because they're valuable and at the end of the day - you appreciate them.
You gotta go pick it up in san miguel.<eos> I was gonna go there Friday And see some patients at the hospital out there. But we'll go today.<eos> Oh, I can just take the bus.<eos> Well, there's no bus to san miguel, brenner.<eos> It's a 4-hour drive through the jungle.<eos> Oh, and bring the kid. You're gonna need a translator.<eos> Hey, can I ask you something?<eos> Me?<eos> What do we do with terminal cases?<eos> Well, if they're truly terminal, We usually just send them home with pain meds
"Well how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant Hollywood movies?"<eos> And the movie is called The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.<eos> So now how specifically will we see Ban in the film?<eos> See anytime I'm getting ready to go, anytime I open my medicine cabinet, you will see Ban Deodorant-<eos> While anytime I do an interview with someone, I can say, "Are you fresh enough for this interview? "Are you ready?<eos> You look a little nervous.<eos> "I want to help you calm down, so maybe you should... "Maybe you should put some on before the interview."<eos> So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents,<eos> Whether it's a Floral Fusion or Paradise Winds, they'll have their chance.<eos> We'll have them geared for both male or female, solid roll-on or stick, or whatever it may be.
But don't be fooled, because if you go into a retail store and you think you're safe, that's the point where you're most volatile, or you're the most vulnerable in the whole process.<eos> Where should I be able to go where I don't see one bit of advertising?<eos> To sleep.<eos> That's what it's coming down to.<eos> It affords no limits.<eos> And that's the nature of the commercial instinct.<eos> It doesn't know boundaries. It doesn't know limits.<eos> It goes into areas that should be taboo like commercializing childhood.<eos> Corporations are raising our children...<eos> McDonalds feeds them.

I had female bone, ash and concrete, and I couldn't put it all together.<eos> Until EDNA came to your rescue.<eos> Don't be jealous.<eos> I was thinking we were looking at the remains of a burned body, another one of Renton's victims, but the degree of thermal destruction was so great that it would take a significant amount of heat.<eos> High heat, bone, ash...<eos> cremation.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> I thought you said there were traces of concrete.<eos> There used to be a crematorium that offers a burial at sea, okay?<eos> They mix your remains with concrete and lower them into the ocean to promote coral reef growth.
But he's gone, and you're still here.<eos> Now, this is an opportunity for you to be the brother, the uncle, that she thinks you're capable of being.<eos> It's time to forgive that young boy.<eos> Kit!<eos> Hey Donovan.<eos> Are you looking for a meeting tonight?<eos> There's one tomorrow.<eos> You know Kit?<eos> Enough to see that he's got some demons.<eos> There's not a lot of alcoholics who don't have them.
Surprise double date!<eos> Waiter, round of sambucs.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Can you believe penny surprise double dated me?<eos> I mean, I feel like I was on a upn reality show.<eos> Crazy.<eos> Okay, Max, I hired you to help me paint the store, okay, not lay around.<eos> Well, then why'd you bring all these newspapers?<eos> They're four months old, okay?<eos> We're using them as a drop cloth, dumbass.
- I don't know what I saw.<eos> Evil's just another kind of life, and like all life, it doesn't come into this world fully formed.<eos> It's uh... It's like a seed, floating in the wind.<eos> That's where the Bible got it wrong.<eos> I'm gonna skip, for the moment, what you did to my husband or why.<eos> But, believe me, I'll come back to it and it won't be pretty.<eos> Why do you keep your little boy locked up in that shed?<eos> Look, I know you're afraid of your husband, but whatever it is you think that he can do to you, is nothing compared with 25 years to life in a prison full of homicidal mothers who would love to carve you up like a Christmas goose for what you're doing to your own child.<eos> You saw the signs.<eos> Maybe if you hadn't been looking for them, you wouldn't have noticed them.
Here we go.<eos> Come on.<eos> There she is.<eos> Little worse for the wear, but she's still pretty as a peach.<eos> I don't know how you do it.<eos> Each one of them's sweeter than the last.<eos> Whoever receives the child...<eos> Do not despise the little ones, for they are...<eos> Blessed children do not follow the rules of their fathers...<eos> And a child shall lead them.
This case is about the six people that Hayes killed.<eos> How could you let them make it about me?<eos> - Lieutenant, if I have to subpoena you subpoena nothing.<eos> She made that speech six months ago.<eos> It has zero probative value to your case.<eos> If you push this, I can assure you, on behalf of the union, we're gonna push back hard.<eos> - Look, lieutenant, I don't want to fight with you.<eos> But Mr. Hayes' attorney is claiming that you planted evidence. - What evidence?<eos> - The shredded loans papers.<eos> They're claiming that you tampered with them while under your control at rhd.
I got cigarette butts- five of them and three chewing-gum wrappers, spicy peppermint.<eos> He was here a while.<eos> - Brains of the operation- he was stressing out.<eos> - You would be too if you had two trigger-happy idiots working for you.<eos> - I left our kids at my parents' house. I don't know how I'm gonna tell them.<eos> - I can put you in touch with our victims assistance program.<eos> They can help you.<eos> Mrs. libergal, we need you to look at the photographs of these two men.<eos> - Are these the men that killed Nick?<eos> - Yes. Have you seen them before?
- I want you to testify about the kidnapping- the truth this time.<eos> - All your secrets are out.<eos> You have nothing more to protect.<eos> - Not only did these men terrorize your wife, they also destroyed another family- a young family with two small kids.<eos> We can't put them in jail without you.<eos> - If we help him... What will you do for us?<eos> These men were brutes.<eos> I'll testify.<eos> - The Ackroyds told us they were college sweethearts when they were recruited.<eos> They were sent here to befriend academics, policy makers- gather information on politics, technology, trade, information that was hard to come by 20 years ago, when the Russians sent them, but is now freely available
- And do you see these two men here today?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's those guys at the table.<eos> - The witness is pointing at my clients.<eos> And what were your parents doing?<eos> - They were talking in Russian with those guys.<eos> And my mom told me to go to my room and do homework.<eos> - And what else did you tell me?<eos> - A week after, my parents had this big argument. Something bad happened- some man named libergal. And my-my dad said that those guys had screwed up their big plan.<eos> And my mom said that they should have never gone into, like, business with them. And she called them killers.
Mila is the only real thing in our life!<eos> - She's not a child anymore.<eos> And you chose your life.<eos> Let mila choose hers.<eos> - I'm sorry I said all those things about my parents knowing those men.<eos> It wasn't true.<eos> - And the argument you said you overheard was that true?<eos> - No.<eos> No...<eos> I never heard them say anything like that.
The innocent have no place to hide.<eos> - The cartels are out of control, but we can't open the floodgates and give asylum to every frightened Mexican national.<eos> I have amicus briefs from senators and governors who oppose granting asylum to Mexican citizens.<eos> - There's no time for that, your honor.<eos> The defendant in this criminal case will be freed unless we can place our key witness on the stand on Tuesday.<eos> - Mr. morales, I'm concerned about setting a dangerous precedent here.<eos> - The danger here, your honor, is refusing this request.<eos> An 11-year-old Mexican boy is ready to stand up to a brutal narco-trafficker in open court and do this community a service.<eos> He's willing to testify despite the clear and imminent threat, both to himself and his family.<eos> And if we're too timid to match this young boy's courage, the Mexican drug lords will know that we are a nation of straw men, and here is a land of opportunity waiting for them.
Yes.<eos> I need some supplies.<eos> Now, before you get all Alpha-dog on me, hear me out.<eos> Yes, I've seen wounds like this before.<eos> One of our operatives got quilled on a mission last year.<eos> Now, I've cobbled together a counter-toxin from memory, but I'm missing a few key ingredients.<eos> "Radon firebrats.<eos> Savoy leech extract?" These elements are what we call "red list".<eos> It means they're only available on the local black market.<eos> There's a list of suppliers who sell them there, too.
I could disengage the locking mechanism with a magnetic pulse.<eos> And you're confident of that?<eos> Remember this moment, Helen.<eos> We're about to make history.<eos> Again.<eos> Oh, my God, look at this.<eos> It's the ancient script of the sanguine vampiris.<eos> Vampires?<eos> According to the map, this was a Praxian stronghold. Not anymore.<eos> It says here that my ancestors drove them from this place and made it a fortress of their own.
I never said 35.<eos> Not for the paper I wrote you last month. Not for the paper I wrote you last semester. Not for this.<eos> All right?<eos> It's 50.<eos> Can you do 36?<eos> - No. - Thirty-eight?<eos> Oh, Warren, once again proving that Koreans are the Asian Jews.<eos> That's racist.<eos> No, facts cannot be racist.<eos> Many Irish are drunks, many French smell, most Chinese hate children. That's why they sell them to Americans.
Well, they're out of town.<eos> - It's important that...<eos> - I need a parent, not a sister.<eos> I've had what seems to be 15 of you goddamn Gallaghers at this school and I have never once met a parent. Not once.<eos> Who in the hell is raising this degenerate?<eos> Come back tonight with a parent or a call will be placed to a place you don't want me to call.<eos> Please?<eos> I just want someone to be there for her. To bear witness to her achievements.<eos> If this was about Karen, I would. But these nights are not about kids.<eos> They're about teachers giving themselves a platform to worship them.
I think Dougie can communicate better than his son thinks.<eos> Or it's the fantasies of a lonely woman.<eos> I'd better pay him a visit.<eos> Well done, Joe.<eos> What have you got in your bait?<eos> She's put bugger all in my butty!<eos> Not even a scrap of butter.<eos> She's got a lot on her mind.<eos> My sister, when she had the twins, was a right basket case.<eos> She left them outside the post office.
Julianne Simms, I hereby deputize you as a deputy U.S. Marshal to supervise this inmate currently under provisional release.<eos> Uh...<eos> I do?<eos> We didn't just get married, Julianne. Uh, yeah.<eos> Uh, uh, yes.<eos> All right.<eos> Don't cause any problem, dumbass.<eos> Children are so symbolic.<eos> Especially when they're expressing a trauma...<eos> it protects them from having to say what actually happened.
- Once out of that gloomy castle, my health seems to improve.<eos> - We did doubly well to flee, then, and your father needs us both at this perilous juncture.<eos> Now, you tell me about this Paolo.<eos> You mean Narcissus?<eos> What would you know?<eos> - Everything.<eos> - Where are they heading?<eos> - The horses were gone, my lord, at dawn.<eos> I know not where.<eos> - You mean they saddled them without you stirring?
- Yes, Captain!<eos> - En allez!<eos> On the way!<eos> - What is cannon for, Holy Father?<eos> - For destroying fortification, surely.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> The French cannon may be useful to batter the gates of Rome, or to blow the walls of Lucca to the heavens, but meet them in the open field, and what use are their cannon there?<eos> - My son.<eos> - And I propose our armies do precisely that.<eos> Meet them far from Rome in the open field, where the advantage of their cannon is like blowing thistles in the wind.
And as much as you think this is overkill, it will stand up to everything but a DNA test.<eos> What happens if they run one?<eos> With rech's connections and lab time, you're looking at 18-24 hours. Tops.<eos> Now, rech may know where Seamus O'Neil went after he left the camp, but he is not going to give up the intel that easily.<eos> Well then we'll have to motivate him.<eos> I think I might have a lead on something.<eos> Rech was a mercenary himself.<eos> He went freelance after special forces, a couple of his buddies double-crossed him killed his wife and daughter in the process.<eos> What happened to the killers?<eos> Nobody knows, rech nevercaught up with them.
Hello, David Wozniak.<eos> My name is Antoine.<eos> I'm your biological son.<eos> I don't like being lied to. Are you going to out me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can't this be our little secret?<eos> - What do you do?<eos> - I work in a butcher shop. I'm a vegetarian.<eos> So, you murder animals.<eos> No, no! I'm just a delivery guy. I don't kill them.
Twisted bone sticking out.<eos> Too fragmented to just re-set.<eos> She would slow us down and die of infection in a week.<eos> Maybe they could heal her.<eos> But she was one of our own.<eos> They strolled her up.<eos> Severed her throat.<eos> They drank and bottled her blood as it pour out of her.<eos> They cooked and eat her major organs that night.<eos> Three nights later I stabbed them all to death in their sleep.
No light reflects off of it and the red whirls resulted it absorbing most of the color spectrum.<eos> Yeah, but sometimes if it's the right size, you can see a naked singularity around the... You're right, forget it.<eos> The point is black holes in Eureka, bad. See?<eos> That I get.<eos> But a collapsing black hole, that might explain the photon burst that sliced the limo.<eos> And the spaghettification of Taggart's truck.<eos> Real term.<eos> But black holes don't just pop up out of nowhere.<eos> Well no actually they pop up all the time.<eos> It's just they're either to small, or dissipate too quickly for anyone to notice them.
Well no actually they pop up all the time.<eos> It's just they're either to small, or dissipate too quickly for anyone to notice them.<eos> Okay.<eos> So first my PDA has a camera and now black holes are everywhere.<eos> People need to know these things!<eos> But something is causing the black holes to stabilize long enough to do major damage.<eos> Well it can't be Plotkin's rods.<eos> I mean we turned them off before the Cafe was hit.<eos> Yeah but they're forming randomly now.<eos> There some other energy source feeding them.
Shut down any combustion-related projects.<eos> Well, that's great, but if we can't figure this out, a broken sprinkler system's gonna be the least of our problems.<eos> Taggart?<eos> Blast!<eos> Nearly caught up with the wiley little buggers. Uh, were the bats in the walls?<eos> - Uh-uh.<eos> Passing through back home on their way to the roost. Judging from their spoor.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> Wait.<eos> Did you track them back to Welke's farm, or to the FTL service passage?
I'll take the...<eos> I think we put the wrong kid on the stand.<eos> Okay, Pindar, you're starting to scare me.<eos> Will you stop watching that?<eos> I can't look away.<eos> It's just so beautiful.<eos> How did Kelly McDowell find you guys?<eos> We're friends with Kesha's choreographers.<eos> They referred us.<eos> Yeah, Ms. McDowell bailed on them at the last minute.
-Carmen needs us.<eos> -And don't forget Lily. I mean, I got to get out of here, or else I will go insane.<eos> Those policemen have no respect for personal property.<eos> Okay, Marla, stop cleaning!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't have to clean every single little room in the -- did you clean the storage cabinet in the back?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What about the paint cans?<eos> I was gonna drop them at my neighborhood toxic-materials pick-up on Saturday.
He's got family stuff he has to take care of every once in a while, okay?<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Stay in your bra, kid.<eos> What's she for?<eos> She's my excuse.<eos> In case you're a dog.<eos> She doesn't say much.<eos> No.<eos> No, Eura has communication issues.<eos> We get around them, though.
They're the ones in charge, sixers.<eos> Yeah, he could tie all the knots perfectly.<eos> Him and my dad would practice.<eos> Loved it.<eos> Anyway, he stands up, sixer. And, um... They all liked him.<eos> And, uh, takes my hand.<eos> And he took me to the bathroom.<eos> And then he had me take my shorts off.<eos> He cleaned me up.<eos> And then he took off his shorts and put them on me.
That's what we're all about, isn't it.<eos> Oh and do me one favour.<eos> Let's just keep this between the two of us.<eos> Jones: They're asking questions about a man named Jonathan Flay and his son, Ryan.<eos> I think XIII may have found out his real name.<eos> Find out how the Flay family fits into the picture<eos> I'll have my people run their names back here.<eos> There's something else.<eos> There was an altercation at a pool hall today.<eos> Witnesses say three men came at XIII and he took them down.
- One victim?<eos> We are a red cell.<eos> There's no mandatory minimum on victims.<eos> Yeah, but there's got to be something special, right?<eos> Otherwise, we ain't getting invited to the party.<eos> If by special you mean the victim's eyes were removed, then, yes.<eos> Enucleators are very rare.<eos> Not to mention demented.<eos> They haven't found the eyes yet.<eos> So the unsub's taking them as souvenirs, trophies.
He had a bad knee.<eos> He'd been limping for a while.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Well, a, um...<eos> Physical limitation could be what attracted the offender to him.<eos> It would have made him seem more vulnerable.<eos> But why would they want to kill him...<eos> Take his eyes?<eos> What am I gonna tell my kids?<eos> You should tell them that their father loved them.
- If his disposal site was close to his hunting ground, we would've found graves in these parks.<eos> Could've buried them in his home, like an animal in his den.<eos> So it's highly probable that he's not in a residential area.<eos> It has to be this industrial one.<eos> Garcia, check out that area right there, see if there are any sexual offenders who are working in that area.<eos> She's also running licenses and plates for all business personnel in the area.<eos> I mean, those vice cops-- they could've scooped him up in the raid without even realizing it.<eos> What about here?<eos> It's a salvage yard.<eos> When I was inside, these wise guys, they said that's how they used to get rid of bodies all the time-- just stuff them in a trunk, crush it, melt it down, and ship it overseas.
Why can't you just overlook the hats?<eos> I mean, I once dated a guy with no arms and no legs.<eos> I had to take him to dinner in a backpack.<eos> What?<eos> If I stay with her, what's our life gonna look like?<eos> You can do it, baby. Just push.<eos> Push.<eos> Okay, here it comes.<eos> One time I was dating this drummer, Spider, and he always wore these leather pants. I hated them.<eos> So, I set them on fire, and his garage burned down.
- Well, that's easy. I look like a Ben.<eos> So in the spirit of that, what do you say today, I call you all "Steve"?<eos> My name actually is Steve.<eos> Well, what a win-win for you, Steve.<eos> Can we get the air conditioning fixed... Steves?<eos> Crystal, do not worry. I'm on the air conditioning thing.<eos> And we'll apologize to the women basketball players and fill their lockers with extra lady razors.<eos> They must go through those things like candy.<eos> Oh, I don't care about that, other than how it's completely murdering my hairdo.<eos> The maintenance workers are all in a tizzy because you apparently insisted on calling them all "Steve"?
Ifyou'd played your cards right, years from now, you'd be a rich doctor having dinner parties on the Vineyard with your wife and kids.<eos> Right?<eos> You'd be living the dream.<eos> Instead of rotting in here.<eos> Help me out, Phil.<eos> I need it to make sense for me.<eos> Why would you do this?<eos> Why would you hurt those people?<eos> Why would you throw it all away?<eos> We've been talking about Philip Markoff and allegations about other killers leading double lives, and frequently, the women who love them, or at least who always seem surprised
A monster.<eos> Bo, you're not a monster.<eos> I know that.<eos> And whatever happened back then, it wasn't your fault!<eos> I killed a boy!<eos> And then what?<eos> Then I ran away--<eos> I ran away!<eos> I didn't take responsibility for what I did..<eos> And his poor family-- I never gave them closure--
I don't want Jason killed.<eos> And why should I believe you?<eos> I could never see Jason killed because-- I seem to have fallen in love with him.<eos> I'd say don't take the job if I thought you had any intention of taking my advice, but since you don't--<eos> Thank you.<eos> There's a few things you should know about our tender-hearted friend The Morrigan.<eos> She's a Leanan Sidhe.<eos> The Country singer?<eos> A Fae seductress.<eos> She inspires artists and makes them great and feeds off their genius.
And I know that when you're gone... None of this will matter.<eos> Katie, you all right?<eos> Who are you?<eos> This is all your fault.<eos> My fault?<eos> I saved you.<eos> I wouldn't need saving if you weren't running around, ignoring department protocol.<eos> Protocol?<eos> I was protecting the hostages.<eos> No, you were endangering them by agitating the hostage takers.
Arghh! He is a Magistrate!<eos> One can never know who is plotting violence, can one.<eos> Or when they may commit the act.<eos> Your wife, she moves ever closer, even as we speak.<eos> My word is kept.<eos> They're reunited.<eos> You will become the greatest Lanistain the republic.<eos> And as such a title we will climb beyond our station, beyond Capua, perhaps to the very steps of the Senate itself.<eos> The fights are particularly entertaining today.<eos> You'd enjoy them more viewed from the pulvinus.
Fine. You're the Mother Teresa of ugly people. Congrats.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. You two need to squash the beef.<eos> We need to what?<eos> You are having a beef, and you need to squash it.<eos> It's a saying, man. Like "Bury the hatchet."<eos> Okay, okay. Riley, I accept your apology.<eos> Jackass.<eos> Squash the beef.<eos> Yeah. I definitely need to work that into the rotation.<eos> No, you don't, man. You are terrible with sayings. You always mess them up.
That seems like plenty.<eos> They're quintuplets, doctor. There's two more.<eos> Are you (Bleep) Kidding me?<eos> This has seen better days.<eos> Hey, sexy.<eos> We got to talk.<eos> Things are getting out of hand at work.<eos> I delivered quintuplets.<eos> I hope.<eos> I mean, I didn't really actually count them at the end.
I love you, too.<eos> This is the Batcave?<eos> How did you find this place?<eos> We drove through a chicken farm, literally...<eos> Chickens jumping out of the way, feathers flying.<eos> Lily, you shouldn't have come.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> It doesn't make any sense at all.<eos> We can't even figure out date number two, But...<eos> I like picnics, And they're private, And the police don't usually bust them,
It was good.<eos> But she said I should spend more time with my friends... I'm so happy to hear that.<eos> Listen, Cadie, I'm meeting with a couple of tv producers tomorrow.<eos> Oh. It's a reunion show.<eos> "Pageant rematch." "Are they still stacked?" Cute huh?<eos> It's catchy.<eos> Obviously there's a lot of interest in me, since I actually won every pageant I entered.<eos> But, all the gals will be there. Except for the girl from Bluewater.<eos> Shame about that speedboat.<eos> Anyway, the executives are coming, and I'd like you to meet them.
- He's a mercenary.<eos> He'll do as we ask.<eos> - Do we need a human?<eos> He won't stand out like a soldier or a tracker.<eos> Nothing will trace back to us, and all the blood spilled will be by the hands of the humans.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> - What?<eos> - Those snipers... they're locking onto targets they couldn't possibly see. My men are hidden.<eos> How does the FBI know where they are?<eos> Anna must be helping them somehow.
That Manchester United would never make a success, couldn't win the League playing kids, couldn't match the best teams in Europe, and we proved them wrong.<eos> So, with respect, sir, it can be done. It will be done.<eos> You're letting your grief dictate your actions.<eos> What else have we got?<eos> There's no virtue...<eos> Grief's our fuel now.<eos> It's not practical.<eos> Let me speak. I know those lads better than anyone.<eos> I found them.<eos> I nurtured them.
There's no virtue...<eos> Grief's our fuel now.<eos> It's not practical.<eos> Let me speak. I know those lads better than anyone.<eos> I found them.<eos> I nurtured them.<eos> I stood with them, morning, noon and night, through pissing rain, and gales and snow.<eos> They let me mould their lives from the ground up, and they repaid me.<eos> They repaid this club with their skill and their passion, and now their lives.<eos> I'll not reward them by buckling.
His real name.<eos> He must have told you what it was.<eos> Ryan.<eos> My husband was a special man.<eos> About me, about our country.<eos> He became the voice of our rebellion.<eos> He became the voice of freedom.<eos> Seamus was El Cascador.<eos> Those watches had nothing to do with who my husband was.<eos> He wanted them as gifts.
An outspoken supporter of Nasser.<eos> Hafiz. I went to school with his son.<eos> Hafiz drinks at the Layali club.<eos> - Sorry, not a member.<eos> - I'll get us in.<eos> Is there anything you can't do, Hector?<eos> Um... Not really.<eos> Egyptian forces are swarming the entire canal.<eos> They're taking over the Suez offices.<eos> They're lining up workers and making them stand outside.
How could you let me call her?<eos> # Our love is volatile #<eos> # Anything but typical #<eos> # I want you badly #<eos> # I love you madly #<eos> - Hey, Connie.<eos> - Hey. Your mama's here!<eos> You know how you said if I ever needed a favor, - I should just ask?<eos> - That doesn't sound like me.<eos> A client of Bernie's needs some help with their two kids on Tuesday, and I told her we would love to watch them.
'If it's something you truly care about, believe in, 'then you have to keep kicking back.<eos> 'Let the rest of them give up if they must, 'but if that is being a grown-up...' I'd rather stay 21 forever.<eos> Ruthie?<eos> OPERATOR: 'Sir, could you please hang up?<eos> ' Could you tell me where this call is being made from, please?<eos> 'The Claringdon Hotel, sir.'<eos> Bel and I are leaving in five minutes.<eos> Stop being such a coward.<eos> When I was in France, there were these men. I'd...<eos> I'd loosely call them journalists, but they were never at the front.
Just the most startling logical legerdemain that he gets away with here but it fits the interests of capital owners.<eos> Then Adam Smith comes along and what he adds is the religion to this...<eos> Locke started with God made it all this way this is God's right and now we get also with Smith saying 'it's not only God's...' well, he's not actually saying this but this is what's happening philosophically, in principle<eos> he's saying that 'it is not only a question of private property...'<eos> That's all now 'presupposed'<eos> - It's Given!<eos> And that there's 'money investors that buy labor' – Given!<eos> There's no limit to how much they can buy of other men's labor how much they can accumulate, how much 'inequality'- that's all given now.<eos> And so he comes along and what his big idea is and again it's just introduced in parentheses, in passing...<eos> You know, when people put out goods for sale - the supply and other people buy them - the demand and so forth how do we have supply equaling demand or demand equaling supply?
Hence, increased necessity means increased inefficiency.<eos> [Value System Disorder]<eos> The American dream is based on the rampant consumerism.<eos> It is based upon the fact that mainstream media and especially commercial advertising<eos> - all corporations who need this infinite growth - have convinced us or brainwashed most people in America and the world that we have to have X number of material possessions and the possibility of gaining infinitely more material possessions, in order to be happy.<eos> That's just not true.<eos> So why do people continue to buy in this way which is ultimately eco-genocidal in its systemic effects cumulatively?<eos> And it just is classical operant conditioning.<eos> You simply put inputs of conditioning into the organism and you have outputs of desired behaviors or goals or objectives.<eos> And it has all the resources of technology and they boast about how they get into the minds of infants what they hear is already making them conditioned to the brand.
All right.<eos> Abstinence allows us to fully devote ourselves to spiritual transcendence.<eos> I went on a tear before I met Janie.<eos> I-I wasn't a sex addict.<eos> Well... At least, i didn't think I was, but...<eos> One morning, when I woke up with three members of the Tiger Lily Valet Service, I decided it was time to slow down.<eos> This is fantastic.<eos> It takes a lot of discipline, but I feel like the reward is ultimately --<eos> The circumstances surrounding Emily Claire's liaison with Chris Briggs deserve special consideration.<eos> This was merely a chance meeting between two adult strangers on a beach over the summer that ended with them becoming intimate.
I warn you!<eos> So, will this man stand up in church on Sunday and read the Gospel?<eos> You hypocrite!<eos> Is not marriage and union with a woman at the very heart of the Christian community? Rupert?<eos> Rupert?<eos> So, even if you cannot do your duty by me as a man, you should come to me hard and ready as a disciple of Jesus.<eos> And if you cannot do that, what are you doing in the Church?<eos> Oh, lovely, ta. Good.<eos> Where are the children?<eos> Billy took them out.
I want reactivity and presence.<eos> Work at it. Tackle any trouble head on.<eos> We'll back you up.<eos> We're drafting a bill on mobility, balanced pay and European grants.<eos> Your sole obsession will be to defuse, defuse, defuse.<eos> You're aware of it?<eos> You're shifting gears.<eos> I watch the road ahead, I try to stay honest.<eos> That's not what I mean... I mean the gifts the gods send us.<eos> If we don't use them, the gods can take revenge.
- You shouldn't have to run into the woods every time that you turn.<eos> - Pretty sure the gang down at the Econolodge wouldn't take too kindly to me doing it there.<eos> So...<eos> - So what about what I said? What about the apartment?<eos> - Yeah, it's perfect.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Let's do that.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> We'll have full moon parties.<eos> We'll invite the neighbours over and eat them.
Have you released a statement to the press?<eos> No, but it's already hit the air.<eos> Where's the car they dumped? It's over there.<eos> Agents are searching it now.<eos> One of the vics said the shooters were a male and a female.<eos> How many people were murdered here?<eos> 8. If you add the Miles City killings, we're up to 14.<eos> Male-female teams are usually committed to pleasing each other, both mentally and physically.<eos> These guys are thrill killers. They're aroused by the adrenaline rush.<eos> So they're not gonna stop until we catch them.
We looked into your background.<eos> You have a long history with narcotics, correct?<eos> Mm... I have taken... Some drugs.<eos> But now I... Mainly just smoke weed.<eos> Is it also true that you always carry a knife with you?<eos> I've collected knives since I was...14?<eos> It's a hobby.<eos> What, like lying?<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> These records show that both you and Amanda turned off your mobile phones at 8:00 P.M. on the night of the murder and turned them on again at 6:00 the next morning.
Chris Boyle and Abigail West.<eos> Add Neal Cooper to that list.<eos> He said he got his invite in the mail,as well.<eos> Hawkes checked with the families of the two male DOAs.<eos> They said both had plans for the evening but changed them to go check out some truck party.<eos> If they heard about it last minute,let's eliminate them for now.<eos> All right,so that leaves us with four VIPs.<eos> The killer used formal invitations to ensure his targets would be in attendance.<eos> If we can find a connection between them...<eos> We'll know who wanted them dead.
They didn't say anything.<eos> They just laughed.<eos> Anything else out of the ordinary?<eos> The garbage cans.<eos> What about them?<eos> They had been rifled through,tipped over,every day for a week.<eos> Could have been an animal.<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> But my husband,he tied down the covers,and it kept happening.<eos> We finally had to put them in the garage.
I don't need to tell you people what's at stake.<eos> We all been living on the edge since these alien things came.<eos> Tomorrow's assault on the structure in Boston was meant to be a first strike -- a coordinated attack with the support of two other Massachusetts regiments.<eos> However... Colonel Porter lost contact with these regiments several days ago.<eos> And now it looks as if the Colonel himself might have been lost.<eos> Dai brought back the Colonel's last order -- abort the mission unless we can confirm the existence of these other units.<eos> We still don't know if these other units exist... Or if they intend to carry out the attack as planned.<eos> But I know... That if there's a breath left...<eos> In any of those men, they will do their damnedest to carry out this attack.<eos> And if that happens, despite Porter's order... The 2nd Mass has to be there to back them up.
Uh, do you go to All Saints Church on Vance Avenue?<eos> All Saints.<eos> Not a lot of people there that look like me.<eos> Bald, right?<eos> That is exactly what I meant. Yes.<eos> Anyway, I'm bad with faces.<eos> Huh. So you like these guys?<eos> Werewolf vs. Unicorn? Yeah.<eos> They're pretty cool.<eos> I saw them open last year for Chromeo.
Hello?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> So, your own naked fun run is part of the bucket list?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> You should try it sometime. Used to.<eos> Had to give it up -- bad knees.<eos> And how does getting arrested on a nude jog help the shareholders?<eos> It's not all about money.<eos> I want them to feel satisfied.<eos> I have a feeling a humiliating shot of me in the newspapers ought to make them smile.
You're not using the lance?<eos> No we're close to the box.<eos> He's worried about the heat.<eos> Yeah, the rock's too soft here.<eos> This thing heats up like a million degrees.<eos> You hear that?<eos> That's a happy sound.<eos> Hey, Dillon--<eos> Go.<eos> I've isolated the com wires and stripped them.
You know, there was, like, this kind of military look, And the kind of the-- The outdoorsmen look,<eos> And there was a preppy look,<eos> And there was already this, like, kind of western look,<eos> And a leather look. It was already starting to happen.<eos> People quickly identifying as certain male images,<eos> And i, you know, i just didn't, like, fit in.<eos> There wasn't, like, a long-Haired, High-Voiced basketball look, or something, you know?<eos> I was just kind of me.<eos> I mean, i tried.<eos> I would go and pick up guys and bring them home, And, like, they would want to go From zero to 60 so fast.
Costa Verde finally off its knees.<eos> Free of the corruption.<eos> Maria's leadership promises a lot.<eos> She's the next person I'm going to visit.<eos> And I will bring her pain that will makes yours seem like nothing.<eos> Stop!<eos> Plans stolen from Renelco were divided.<eos> In 3 wrist watches.<eos> Each has a microchip inside.<eos> The man you call XIII-- He gave them to 2 other men.
- Listen, y'all got some shit brewing down there. I don't want any part of it.<eos> Hey, you've got access to everything I need:<eos> Interviews, witness statements, the whole case file.<eos> I need you to show it to me.<eos> I can't do that!<eos> If I get caught I'm g...<eos> You weren't so worried about getting caught back in the old days when you were shoving Vinnie's envelopes in your pocket.<eos> - Keep your goddamn voice down.<eos> - Have you seen the reports?<eos> Yeah, I've seen them.
Thanks, Jules.<eos> What do you got?<eos> The needle.<eos> You ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Terry Miller.<eos> Damn it, I hate dogs.<eos> You're scared of dogs?<eos> I didn't say I was scared.<eos> I said I hate them.
People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster.<eos> Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.<eos> What made me the way I am left a hollow place inside.<eos> So I became an expert at blending in. Camouflaging myself.<eos> They make it look so easy... Connecting with another human being.<eos> I love you.<eos> But if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb.
Your guy just fainted.<eos> That's not a good sign for a crime scene investigator.<eos> Goodbye, big guy.<eos> - Hello, runner-up, little miss hottie.<eos> - Can we get back to this, please?<eos> Snakes, I mean, what the fuck!<eos> How does that happen?<eos> What, did the snakes crawl inside of him?<eos> No, they're freshwater snakes.<eos> Somebody put them there.
I might even be on the telly.<eos> What shall we drink to, then?<eos> I know. To crime.<eos> Crime? Yeah, crime.<eos> Without it, I wouldn't have a job, would I?<eos> It should be fairly straightforward.<eos> The last time the magistrates refused bail because they accepted the prosecution argument that you might abscond.<eos> It's the industry that's the problem.<eos> Private planes, private ships, a lot of travel.<eos> We'll persuade them otherwise.
I found something for you amongst Goran's things.<eos> Records.<eos> It's easier to explain if you take a look.<eos> - I'll be right over.<eos> - Good.<eos> Charlotte Soringer found something interesting.<eos> - Records.<eos> I'll go there now.<eos> - Good.<eos> He called them his black files.
You can totally come if you want.<eos> You just have to pay your dues.<eos> My dues?<eos> I... don't understand.<eos> Come on.<eos> Do I have to do all of your thinking for you?<eos> I guess... I was just so... desperate to fit in, to get her "stamp of approval," that... I didn't care.<eos> So this was a set-up.<eos> Three guys from the football team came up to me at the party.<eos> Said that... Blaire had sent them to collect.
Pop back for Christmas, maybe Easter.<eos> Amy, you always said cooking Christmas dinner, you wished there were two of you.<eos> Can't we just teleport in?<eos> It's not a teleport, it's a time-jump.<eos> We can't jump within the same time-stream.<eos> Yes.<eos> The Tardis is in the gallery.<eos> Gallery closed.<eos> The controls are stuck.<eos> They've locked them from the outside.
Be patient.<eos> First, find your room.<eos> My room?<eos> There's a room here for everyone, Doctor.<eos> Even you.<eos> - You said you'd seen the light now.<eos> - Nothing else matters any more.<eos> Only him.<eos> It's like these things.<eos> I used to hate them.
Just let him riff and move anything expensive out of his way.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> - Oh, no, no...<eos> - Doctor, what is wrong?<eos> It's not fear.<eos> It's faith.<eos> Not just religious faith. Faith in something.<eos> Howard believed in conspiracies, that external forces controlled the world.<eos> Joe had dice cufflinks and a chain with a horseshoe. He was a gambler.<eos> Gamblers believe in luck, an intangible force that helps them win or lose.
Just hold on.<eos> I used to dream about you.<eos> All those stories Amy used to tell me. What stories?<eos> Tell me what stories?<eos> Vampires in Venice?<eos> When I was little, I was going to marry you.<eos> Good idea, let's get married.<eos> You stay alive and I'll marry you. Deal?<eos> Shouldn't you ask my parents' permission?<eos> As soon as you're well, I'll get them on the phone.
Well, how do you feel?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't feel any different.<eos> Well, why don't you try insulting me?<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Um, sometimes you chase helicopters.<eos> - That's kind of lame.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Um... Besides, I do that to protect the house.<eos> Helicopters are going to hurt us, and I make them stay away.
Peter, for God sakes, no.<eos> Tell him to turn the plane around.<eos> Oh, hey, listen, Quagmire, turn the plane around and bring it back here.<eos> Peter, I can't do that.<eos> The FAA would be all over my ass.<eos> Um, hey Quagmire, you know that stray cat we got in our neighborhood?<eos> The pregnant one? Yep, she's having her kittens right now.<eos> Oh, no way.<eos> Yeah, making all those high-pitched "mew mew" noises and everything.<eos> I love them already.

What?
Cock-a-mouse.<eos> Part cockroach, part mouse.<eos> It used to live in our apartment.<eos> It must have settled here, and... Oh!<eos> Look, it had babies! Good for it.<eos> Ew....<eos> I give up. You win.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Be well, my friends!<eos> Aw, just how we left them.
Morning.<eos> Who wants breakfast?<eos> You have some coffee?<eos> So I can throw it in this traitor's face?<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Do you guys have some pancakes, because I... would really like some pancakes.<eos> They're fantastic.<eos> Let's be honest, I love them.
Which means I can see exactly three hours into my future, and it... doesn't...<eos> look... good. I tried to be supportive.<eos> Oh, baby, can you just hold me, please?<eos> Of course, baby.<eos> But it doesn't help it that when Lily gets going; she sounds like a velociraptor from Jurassic Park.<eos> But then I realized a man can do a lot of living in three hours.<eos> So, I'm out experiencing this beautiful, crazy dance called life.<eos> Ah, my last meal.<eos> MacClaren's famous jalapeño poppers.<eos> My doctor says I need to eat healthier, so I figured the round-trip flight these babies are about to take will land them permanently on the no-fry list.
It doesn't exonerate me from leading Payson to believe I had romantic feelings for her.<eos> Is there anything that happens around here that you don't blame yourself for?<eos> I don't blame myself for you running back to Steve Tanner because you found you'd almost betrayed your vow of chastity.<eos> Or maybe you were just angry with me... ..because I respected your values?<eos> Why would I be angry about that?<eos> You felt rejected?<eos> I can't have this conversation.<eos> Why not?<eos> You've always got all the right answers.<eos> I ran away from you because you may respect my values but you don't share them and you are not going to change.
The whole world smiles with you<eos> -I'm happy with you.<eos> - Yes. me too.<eos> We'll get married next year, but we do the opposite :<eos> it'll be at night... in downtown with finger-food and I would love to have a live band because the DJ has to disappear.<eos> And we'll invite less people. I don't want any extras.<eos> Alright. We'll think about it.<eos> Are you ready to begin our honeymoon?<eos> Yes... do you have the passports?<eos> - You had them.
- Yes. me too.<eos> We'll get married next year, but we do the opposite :<eos> it'll be at night... in downtown with finger-food and I would love to have a live band because the DJ has to disappear.<eos> And we'll invite less people.

We'll think about it.<eos> Are you ready to begin our honeymoon?<eos> Yes... do you have the passports?<eos> - You had them.<eos> - No, you.<eos> We said that you'd put them together with the money.
So?<eos> Does "best friend" need permission to speak?<eos> Very well, it's this.<eos> Has anyone actually read this thing?<eos> I don't mean cast your eye over it, I mean read it.<eos> - Jill?<eos> - Yes, I believe I've read it.<eos> Home Secretary, you say you didn't know the Americans had these prisoners.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> And you had no proof they'd been torturing them.
Any hostages hurt? No, we're good.<eos> Keep them safe.<eos> We'll provide all the cover we can.<eos> Rescue copter's on the way.<eos> You're in charge of the hostages.<eos> Before I do what I'm required to do, I feel compelled to offer you a chance to redeem yourself, Mr. Martinez, if only in my eyes.<eos> Do you have anything to tell me?<eos> You mean about the ODS?<eos> What I can tell you is this... The men of the ODS prioritize results over risks.<eos> In my opinion, that's what makes them so awesome.
Well...<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> Well...<eos> Chunhua...<eos> I've been giving a lot of thought to the... progress of our relationship.<eos> Where it seems to be, where it... is headed, and...<eos> I think I know what you're about to say.<eos> You do?<eos> Adam... I'm a very conservative person by nature.<eos> Chinese women aren't very open with their feelings, but that doesn't mean I don't have them, because I do.
We're getting distress calls from all over.<eos> Sir, what are your orders?<eos> So one get me the Avengers.<eos> Avengers assemble!<eos> So much destruction.<eos> Why would someone do this? Why?<eos> I'm still working on "What?"<eos> What are these things?<eos> Aliens?<eos> Unlikely, given the Egyptian styling to them.
The Negative Zone?<eos> It's a universe comprised completely of anti-matter.<eos> By placing the super-villain prison in the Negative Zone, even if there is another mysterious breakout. There's no where to break out to.<eos> And what of these metal, uh, things?<eos> They are the jailers?<eos> Yes.<eos> Ultron is a robot that iron man and I designed together.<eos> I've been mass producing them since the breakout to act as wardens to 42.<eos> How are you feeling today, Jerome?<eos> Ultron can't be hurt, he can't be corrupted, and I've programmed them to help rehabilitate the prisoners.
Tony, you can't possibly...<eos> We know the Kree are coming.<eos> We already met them.<eos> Kang's got technology more advanced than anything I ever dreamed of.<eos> He could be the world's only hope.<eos> But he's being a real jerk about it.<eos> Avengers, take him.<eos> I hope you enjoy the rest of your days on this dead earth for this is where I'm leaving you.<eos> Okay, I'm impressed.<eos> I sensed them the second we got here.
Really?<eos> I meant to sugar-coat it.<eos> Life isn't that bad.<eos> It's a long, lonely road to a cold, unwelcoming grave.<eos> And then there's the bad days.<eos> Wow. Look, I know you're a terrible person but maybe you should talk to someone.<eos> Not me.<eos> - Find some friends.<eos> - Friends?<eos> I left them behind when Beelzebub's handmaiden banished me here!
- Do you remember that day?<eos> - No.<eos> It's like a dream, you know.<eos> Underwood drugged me.<eos> He always did before we made a movie.<eos> - Can you tell me anything specific about that location? - No.<eos> I just remember the jars. - The jars.<eos> What jars?<eos> - The peanut butter.<eos> That's like all underwood fed us, and... When they were empty, daniel would... Would bury them in the backyard,
Daniel, what happened?<eos> How could you grow up to be like them?<eos> You were my savior.<eos> - You never came back for me.<eos> - I tried.<eos> - Not hard enough.<eos> - So now you wanna hurt more children...<eos> For payback?<eos> - No. I love all my kids.<eos> - Daniel, you're forcing them to make movies.
- Richmond, Philadelphia, New York, utica?<eos> - All cities with sex addiction rehab centers.<eos> - So our perp checks in, goes into group therapy and listens to addicts talk about the women they victimize.<eos> - And then he redeems them by raping them again.<eos> - But for a guy who's out to save women, he sure beat the hell out of Ann.<eos> - He's a narcissist.<eos> - Well, yeah.<eos> He thinks he's a God. - Narcissists are prone to sudden bursts of violence when things don't go according to their plan.<eos> - Well, the patient records at these rehabs will tell us who was there and which one's our narcissist.<eos> - But we'll never get them because of privilege.
- Well, there's an overlap in computer systems.<eos> Those three rehabs use that service.<eos> - "Secure-file. The future of medicine."<eos> What's that?<eos> - The therapists dictate their notes and that company stores them electronically.<eos> But it's supposed to be secure.<eos> - But a perp hacks into that system, he'd know as much as anyone in the room.<eos> - Except here.<eos> They offered their services.<eos> We turned them down.
We were no longer an ordinary family.<eos> And we soon realized we weren't alone.<eos> You're not just reading thoughts.<eos> You're creating them, placing them in people's minds.
Well, they're adopted.<eos> Also, they're pigs.<eos> Bessy had her litter this morning.<eos> Great. You know how Muslims love pigs.<eos> Cigars for everybody.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> I'd better go and check on mama and papa and the 12 little miracles.<eos> 12?<eos> Wow.<eos> I named them after the disciples.
Not great.<eos> You didn't apologize?<eos> I did.<eos> And I told her the truth.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Yes, I told her that we thought she was bad at bridge and a burden on the group.<eos> - Not great.<eos> - Yeah, she slammed the door on my face like I was a Girl Guide.<eos> You slam the door on Girl Guides?<eos> Well, hey, if their cookies were any good they'd sell them in stores.
My third.<eos> Aggravating circumstances of the habitual offender!<eos> Why this desire to be a Carabiniere?<eos> It's been a passion of mine since I was 10. My Uncle Giuseppe was a Carabiniere.<eos> So, he was the one who got you in to this feeling, this feeling of patriotism...<eos> He got me in to the game whenever I wanted.<eos> And loads of things...<eos> Christmas!<eos> Christmas was fantastic!<eos> He'd seize fireworks, bring them home and let us shoot them off all night.
I know what I'm worth, damn it.<eos> I know what I'm worth.<eos> How much do you think I'm worth?<eos> You're worth everything.<eos> Will you talk to the kids?<eos> Sure, honey.<eos> I'll talk to them, okay?<eos> But I can't take the job.<eos> It's a scam.<eos> I can see them coming.
Maybe she's dirty too.<eos> It's time we talked to the rest of the unit about it.<eos> Did you trace the disposable cell They used to lure page out?<eos> Serial number was shipped To an electronic store in midtown.<eos> I called them and told them to pull the security tapes.<eos> Detective tutuola, I called you about those surveillance tapes.<eos> Don't you people talk to each other?<eos> I'm watching you.<eos> Just give me the tapes and I'm outta your hair.<eos> I gave them to the other cop.
You're not a clown fish, are you? Yeah.<eos> I'm a clown fish, Kate.<eos> Come on, you're gonna have to do better than that.<eos> - Are you a sea horse? - Damn it.<eos> Yes!<eos> Ha ha ha ha ha!<eos> You know, a guy spent time painting these lines on the road.<eos> The least you can do is acknowledge them.<eos> I can't see at night without my driving glasses.<eos> Can you get them for me?
- Are you a sea horse? - Damn it.<eos> Yes!<eos> Ha ha ha ha ha!<eos> You know, a guy spent time painting these lines on the road.<eos> The least you can do is acknowledge them.<eos> I can't see at night without my driving glasses.<eos> Can you get them for me?<eos> They're in my suitcase. Glasses?<eos> You mean you can look even weirder?<eos> I'll go get them for you.
I mean, honestly, truly, between you and me, I had no idea what was in these things.<eos> He's not like the other two.<eos> Not for the diamonds.<eos> He's a good man... he-he...<eos> You and Foley, you're in love.<eos> They threatened me.<eos> "Get us all out, or-or we'll kill Foley."<eos> So, nobody knows that Foley was in on this diamond job?<eos> He couldn't tell the Haynes brothers where the diamonds were if he wanted to stay alive.<eos> And-and now, as soon as they get their hands on them...
Yeah.<eos> What's it going to take to let them walk?<eos> Markovich, is it?<eos> You related somehow?<eos> They're from my neighborhood.<eos> Good kids.<eos> Lip's bright as hell, doing great at school.<eos> Ian's in ROTC, wants to join the Marines.<eos> They wouldn't have been in that car if they knew it was stolen.<eos> So, uh, you just know them from around the neighborhood, is that it?
Oh, no. Okay.<eos> What do you got there, V?<eos> What's in here?<eos> I, um, I made some pasta sauce.<eos> Oh. Good, good.<eos> Well, you know, with teenage boys in the house, you can never have enough.<eos> You figured out what you're going to do to them yet?<eos> Huh?<eos> Punishment.<eos> Ground them for a year?
You do look different.<eos> I can see it now.<eos> It's in your eyes.<eos> They're... deeper.<eos> Older.<eos> I wanted to see who Simone marries.<eos> That's my daughter.<eos> Hmm. If she gets married.<eos> I wanna see her kids, if they have her black hair...<eos> But if I see them... I'll see them grow old and sick and die, and Simone, too.
Yeah. There's my desk.<eos> A lot of cool stuff on it.<eos> You can check it out.<eos> Oh, I won't touch anything.<eos> That's good, because a lot of it is irreplaceable...<eos> No, no, honey, you can touch whatever you want.<eos> Nothing breaks, either, so just have fun.<eos> Go at it.<eos> Where are the Sabbatino brothers?<eos> Um, I sent them to the cleaners.
Claudia Evans on the phone for me, please.<eos> Courthouse records called.<eos> The David Smith case file is in a basement, they think.<eos> They think? It's 30 years old.<eos> I mean, hopefully, it's on paper and not papyrus.<eos> People vs. David Smith is there.<eos> It's ringing.<eos> Leonardo, do you know why I hold you in such high esteem?<eos> My sense of personal style?<eos> It's because you anticipate my needs without me actually having to say them.
Leo.<eos> You're here.<eos> Yes.<eos> So, then, you have the David Smith file. No.<eos> Ugh.<eos> That personal style thing will only get you so far.<eos> I'm looking for it as we speak.<eos> I sub-contracted the job to a specialist.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> You want results. You'll get them.
But how will she change if I do not criticize?<eos> Faisal, everyone has their faults.<eos> The secret is learning to accept them.<eos> So, you see her faults too. Good.<eos> I will tell her.<eos> Look, marriage is about accepting your partner for who they really are.<eos> Hm, that is easy for you to say.<eos> You are so blinded by love, you can not even see Rayyan's faults.<eos> And they are obvious.<eos> Rayyan is not perfect. But I wouldn't call them faults.
I never went home, and I never looked back. Start over, Frank.<eos> Come on.<eos> Where the hell am I gonna get a Cessna?<eos> Take matters into your own hands.<eos> - You get me?<eos> - Yeah...<eos> No.<eos> Make those guys who are after you think you're dead.<eos> They don't live here.<eos> You're never gonna see them again.
Look, I was 18, I was pissed off.<eos> I wanted to blow something up...<eos> So I stole bleach and drain crystals.<eos> Sodium hypochlorite and aluminum.<eos> Used to do it all the time.<eos> See?<eos> Bleach stains.<eos> So why throw away your clothes?<eos> Lab tests would have detected that there was no blood on them.<eos> I didn't throw them away.

Eric, can you access that computer?<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> It looks like they're looking for something specific.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - Night vision goggles.<eos> Nell, you said this was a depot.<eos> What else is inside there?<eos> Uh, everything from office furniture to classified documents to sophisticated laser-tracking systems.<eos> We gotta figure out what these guys were really after.<eos> Someone gave them access to this warehouse.
Donnie chose what section to steer the ball away with his sheriff's badge.<eos> My great-grandfather was a bright man.<eos> He worked out what was going on.<eos> - Everything OK there, soldier?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> 32 red.<eos> Watch him.<eos> I think he's on to us.<eos> 25 across the orphans.<eos> When the Wendell brothers realised he was on to them, they set him up.
[Jake] Hey, Don Rickles, focus.<eos> Why was Leah Jordan going through your trash?<eos> [J.J.] Well, how should I know?<eos> [Stan] I'm telling ya, she's your stalker.<eos> Why wait for a story, when you could create it yourself?<eos> It's her way of making news.<eos> [Jake] Yeah?<eos> What about Kent and Rhonda?<eos> [J.J.] Oh, those two comic hacks.<eos> I carried them for 5 years, and they have a beef with me?
Party confetti are little circles, but these are squares...<eos> Actually rhombi.<eos> Looks like shredded paper.<eos> Yes.<eos> Highly, highly confidential legal documents about Huxley World Hotels.<eos> Hugo, think back, if your brain permits-- how were Linda's boxes arranged here in the vault?<eos> Don't ask me, Gurjit put 'em in.<eos> Yes, one by one, but in the morning, they were all stacked and attached to the-- what is that, um... The two-wheeled apparatus? The...<eos> Dolly. Really? "Dolly?"<eos> So did Linda put them on the Dolly, or is that how you found them?
It's not a physical thing. It's, you know. It's-it's an emotional exchange.<eos> Drop it, Grimes.<eos> - We're having company? - Hey, what the...<eos> Who... who are those guys?<eos> They're making some... additions to Castle.<eos> Maybe they got my comment card about the eucalyptus steam room.<eos> They're covert ops, Bartowski.<eos> And they have nothing to do with your mission.<eos> Tonight, there was supposed to be a joint CIA/NSA/INTERPOL bust; Alexei Volkoff's three most trusted lieutenants.<eos> We tracked them down through his Hydra Network, but by the time we located them, they were already dead. And we believe
No offense, please, but these, um, they're not toys.<eos> They're collectibles.<eos> They're not for playing. Oh.<eos> Chuck and I had to pool all our money together to get these guys.<eos> Original 1977 Kenner line.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> They're really fun... to look at.<eos> The trick is Chewie always goes on Han's right side.<eos> Anyway, I've been arranging them this way since I was about 13, if you can believe that.
He was going to tell A.C. about our affair.<eos> I went there to convince him otherwise.<eos> And?<eos> And...<eos> It was a confusing conversation.<eos> He refused to admit any of it, and so we scuffled--<eos> Let me guess, you broke his glasses.<eos> Yes.<eos> At-at some point...<eos> I snatched them off his face, I crushed them.
Well, we'll just have to figure out a way.<eos> Oh, okay. Good.<eos> Good plan.<eos> When you see signs for a place that might have Internet, pull over.<eos> Until then, I want to know more about Dempsey.<eos> How much do you know about the girls he's abducted?<eos> Like the fact that they're not human?<eos> Then you know about the aliens.<eos> It's the reason why he tried assassinating Martinez in the first place.<eos> He didn't want the President releasing them.
No, hang on. I heard somebody refer to the module today.<eos> Exactly, and that's what I've been wanting to show you.<eos> The module's been masked.<eos> That's what they do with military instillations.<eos> Right, so I went into NORAD and I got the undoctored photographs.<eos> The buildings exist. Half of these are old army camps just being converted.<eos> And now anything labeled the module is hidden from view so the public can't see what's going on.<eos> It's the same for all the sites I've checked.<eos> - The same thing in Wales too, Gwen. - Mm-hmm.<eos> So they've taken buildings and sealed them off out of sight.
I'm not doing this.<eos> I'm not giving final speeches.<eos> Just tell me, anywhere in the Universe.<eos> I saw a firebird once- a tiny little thing, even smaller than a hummingbird.<eos> Oh yeah?<eos> Literally made of fire.<eos> It only lives for a minute.<eos> It blazes different colors and sings.<eos> It gets so bright you have to close your eyes.<eos> And when you open them, it's gone.
But it's got to be more than that.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's like there's some sort of energy behind this- a will, a drive, a consciousness.<eos> 'Cause this miracle, it's more than people just surviving.<eos> They are so alive.<eos> You saw Lyn, that woman at the airport.<eos> She should have been paralyzed but she just kept on going.<eos> And I've seen bodies at the morgue, burnt and broken, still alive, staring right at me.<eos> They weren't even allowed to be unconscious.<eos> It's as if something is willing them to go on, each and every individual forced into life.
They weren't even allowed to be unconscious.<eos> It's as if something is willing them to go on, each and every individual forced into life.<eos> That was me... All the way through my accident- wide awake.<eos> And you could feel everything that happened? It still hurt?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So what did the search say?<eos> That's the problem.<eos> Everybody's had the same idea.<eos> Morphic field... Gets 10 million results.<eos> Then I'll go through them, all 10 million.
At the club.<eos> He just hauled it out in the middle of a club?<eos> No.<eos> No, I followed him into the loo.<eos> This is a very unsettling story.<eos> That's pretty much all there is to it. I would hope so.<eos> Oh, you have to see all this free stuff I got.<eos> Before the club, we met this designer who just gave us all these clothes.<eos> Why?<eos> So Matt would wear them.
Yeah?<eos> Contact the U.S. Attorney, okay?<eos> Find out everything you can about this defendant Aaron Brenner.<eos> Then check with the DEA.<eos> I want to know who the Baja Cartel contracts its hits through.<eos> We need to know what we're up against out there. All right. You got it.<eos> Guys, come on in.<eos> We need you guys to lock down the crime scene in case the witness or the killers double back.<eos> The witness comes back, you get her straight to the courthouse.<eos> The shooters come back, you put them down, and you make sure they stay down.
Yeah.<eos> Oh, that could be half the island, brah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, that was Kamekona.<eos> He's got a lead... guy named Big Lono. He owns a pawn shop in Kalihi.<eos> Uh, place is being used to move the pirate" stolen merch, so if anybody knows where to find these guys, it's going to be Big Lono.<eos> I don't know where you got your information from, but you're wrong.<eos> Okay.<eos> Lono... understand, please. It's not about you. This is about 12 missing kids and finding the men that kidnapped them.
Secure. Clear.<eos> Put your hands up! Hey, brah, you can't go in there!<eos> Hey, you, shut up.<eos> Hey, place is clear. There's no sign of hostages.<eos> Then where the hell are they?<eos> Make sure you get a close-up on the eyes, Scotty.<eos> I need it for a biometric comparison test.<eos> Saloni, you kidnapped a couple of kids off Waikiki yesterday. Where are they?<eos> Don't know what you're talking about, brah.<eos> Where are you holding them?
That mystery, Miss Pearl, is what hangs over the man like a like... a mystery.<eos> I do hope the rector will be recovered in time for the church bazaar.<eos> He must!<eos> I mean... he... we, we must pray that he will.<eos> These books, I understand you paid a penny for them.<eos> I should give them back to you. Oh.<eos> I found them lying in the kitchen.<eos> Oh, I wondered what had become of them.<eos> How did you get along with Scott's poetry?<eos> I've seen you with your books, Laura, how you devour them instantly.
The slight smell of wood.<eos> It's a classic.<eos> Very popular.<eos> And this is my personal favourite.<eos> Sporty, slightly lemony, fresh, young ...<eos> For the active man.<eos> It's hard to choose, eh.<eos> I know what we're going to do.<eos> I'll give you some samples, all right.<eos> You try them at home at ease.
He made me keep quiet.<eos> And then himself.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> - Me too.<eos> An appointment with your primary suspect.<eos> Diederik, give us that one thing.<eos> Do it for yourself.<eos> And for us.<eos> The zoo had to close because of GAIA ... and I as a veterinarian had to kill those animals.<eos> Instead of bringing them to the meat plant, I sold them.
(BRUNO) Oh, I'm talking to you!<eos> Eh...<eos> Tell me again the Enea features.<eos> Enea is a modern character Fights because when the soaking bad, But however sometimes it is thoughtful and sad , which has doubts...<eos> Get up and tries to express yourself as a human being, please.<eos> The new concept is to...<eos> piety, no?<eos> What does it mean?<eos> In practice it means that he is good.<eos> In fact with the enemy, even if beats them, not sneaking.
My God.<eos> You don't believe me.<eos> I don't know, mom.<eos> I know that you're capable of lying to protect the people you love.<eos> What color are his eyes?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Why don't you go find out for yourself?<eos> No, better yet, why don't you go have a d.N.A. Test?<eos> Then you can find out all the facts.<eos> And when you know them and you know the truth, you come back here and you apologize to me, because I'll deserve it.
All I'm getting is rain.<eos> It's like court shoes on parquet.<eos> Can we try inside?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, you always click your heel harder on the third step.<eos> - No, I don't. - Yes, you do.<eos> We need to work on your links today.<eos> Say more. Smile less.<eos> Yes, I hear the newspapers don't like the smile?<eos> Do you really not read them?
They in turn had discovered that she was...in trouble.<eos> So, you introduced the idea of Adam Le Ray.<eos> She talked to the press.<eos> No, sorry.<eos> She talked to Mr Lyon.<eos> Whatever lengths had been gone to to protect her, she had now made her own bed. Oh.<eos> Miss Elms had been singled out by Darrall, by the Soviets.<eos> The KGB have a list circulating, which M16 managed to intercept.<eos> On this list are the names of young men and women, bright, intelligent, often connected, who might be susceptible, open to betraying their country.<eos> Apparently they call them their Brightstones.
Oh great, the book room?<eos> Can't we find somewhere else to hide?<eos> This is my least favorite room on campus.<eos> This is the safest place on campus during a riot.<eos> No one parties in here.<eos> I can't stop thinking about the drugs and the booze, you guys.<eos> The hardest part is not knowing.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I remember the first time I did shrooms. I was 10.<eos> My uncle Dennis sold them to me at my mom's birthday party.
Well, he isn't.<eos> So before we start flinging accusations, Let's make sure the girl's story checks out.<eos> Dominique said Jordan brought 'em over in his private jet?<eos> Let's confirm that with customs.<eos> Do you have a record of her entering the country?<eos> Yeah, Dominique Moreau was on Mr. Hayes's jet From Paris to New York.<eos> You see hundreds of people coming through customs.<eos> Why do you remember her?<eos> Hayes's passengers get the full v. I.P. Treatment.<eos> I went on the plane and processed them personally.
Unfortunately not.<eos> As I told you before, I was expecting a massage from a friend.<eos> I saw no reason to record that one. - Mr. Hayes? Ah.<eos> It's time for my appointment.<eos> Let me show you out.<eos> We need a warrant for those tapes. What tapes?<eos> All they saw was a closed-circuit television.<eos> Hayes told them that he recorded all his massages.<eos> I'm betting we find more under aged girls. With all the heat on him,<eos> Don't you think he's erased them by now?
Way over the line, Pierce!<eos> I'll tell you why. Because I was there.<eos> Where are the bathrooms? Oh, they're down there by Fat Neil.<eos> That's right, Neil. Your new best friend, Jeff Winger, coined the name "Fat Neil."<eos> Jeffrey!<eos> Look, before you respond, I can make it up to you.<eos> I'll find a fatter Neil.<eos> Huzzah.<eos> You made up "Fat Neil"?<eos> Someone asked me where the restrooms were, and you were standing by them, but you were also standing kind of near, uh, other Neil.
What for?<eos> - It's not an eye patch.<eos> - It's an eye drive, sir.<eos> It communicates directly with the memory centres of the brain.<eos> Acts as external storage.<eos> Only thing that works on them.<eos> Because no living mind can remember these things.<eos> The Silence, we've captured over a hundred of them now.<eos> All held in this pyramid.<eos> Yeah, I've encountered them before.
If you laugh, laugh, Lewis.<eos> Let it out. I will never speak to you again.<eos> I'm allergic to cat dander and my brother was afraid of dogs, so tarantulas were the furriest pet I could have.<eos> He was afraid of dogs but rock solid with ugly, hairy spiders.<eos> Says something about the family.<eos> None of us ever got pregnant out of wedlock.<eos> Take that back.<eos> Back to the spiders, ok?<eos> Now, why'd you kill them?<eos> She brought them over one day because she had to leave them somewhere, and I was supposed to feed them live crickets, but I couldn't bring myself to do that, so...
Oh, God, I really want this to work.<eos> Do you know that I talked on the phone with Dave last night for three hours?<eos> You both talked?<eos> Yes.<eos> Wow, this is really serious.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, I actually think I like this guy.<eos> I mean, I've been in love before, and in lust...<eos> But I realized I have never really liked a man.<eos> Aw. Well, his kids are obviously his soft spot, so you just gotta win them over.

Well, his kids are obviously his soft spot, so you just gotta win them over.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> Okay, I'll take them out to dinner, my treat.
Oh, they'll be a little big for Max, but they'll do.<eos> What's that stuff?<eos> It's mock macaroni and cheese.<eos> And the beauty of it, there's no macaroni and no cheese.<eos> Yes, nothing ruins macaroni and cheese like macaroni and cheese.<eos> Now you're getting with the program, putting some elbow grease into it.<eos> Elbow grease.<eos> Yes.<eos> Hey, how'd it go with the kids?<eos> Oh, I underestimated them.
The world's largest garlic bread? Jiffy pop for giants?<eos> I've been saving them up.<eos> I'm flattered you've put so much thought into my work.<eos> Gustavo, you know, I think Toledo would be very lucky to have your next installation.<eos> I think it would be very stimulating. - Oh?<eos> - For the city, not just me.<eos> Do you have to take that? No, it's just my nanny.<eos> He can leave a message.<eos> - What if it's about your kids?<eos> - Nah, I left them home alone.
Yeah!<eos> All right! Yeah.<eos> Is this gonna be... Fun or weird?<eos> Fun!<eos> Really fun.<eos> So fun.<eos> Is your wife even coming?<eos> I didn't pay you to ask questions, Feinstein.<eos> What would've taken hunter five minutes took me two hours, but the servers are back up.<eos> I recovered all the cards that came in, and I sent them off, and after I said I would help hunter meet girls, he agreed to come back.
It's all the little details that criminals never pay attention to.<eos> Just one little something they forget, and we nail them.<eos> I love this job.<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, how you feeling?<eos> Fine. You all right?<eos> Yeah, fine.<eos> So, where are we?<eos> Well, as far as we can tell, Tessa photographed half the men in Manhattan.<eos> Adam I.D.'d them through the DMV. None of them were on the guest list.
Who's this guy?<eos> Are you gonna talk through the whole thing?<eos> Sorry. I wanted to know who that guy is.<eos> You're not supposed to know yet.<eos> Fine. I'll wait.<eos> I gave her freedom, but I taught her never to dishonor her family.<eos> Did you remember to order the cake for Victoria's birthday?<eos> I wanted to ask you, do you think we should do cake or just cupcakes?<eos> Oh, cupcakes are a smart idea.<eos> You don't waste as much, people can take them home if they want.
Give the man back his game.<eos> You're a go!<eos> I'm here!<eos> I'm here, I'm here.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> You're a much better company than the FBI and our friends were starting to worry, weren't you?<eos> They don't want to die.<eos> No, they don't want to die,<eos> I don't want them to die.<eos> You're the only one who wants them to die.
Yeah, you're a real humanitarian then, huh?<eos> Do you recognize these men?<eos> I-I brought them here six, eight weeks ago.<eos> From the islands, you know?<eos> But they looked different, though.<eos> They-They were skinnier.<eos> How about the name Henri Guiton?<eos> I don't know names.<eos> I know faces.<eos> Who did you sell them to?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!<eos> Okay, okay!<eos> Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.<eos> This guy... he's been coming here for-for the last couple months.<eos> Um, he's very specific.<eos> He only takes the-the strongest.<eos> What's his name?<eos> What's his name?<eos> His name is Wesley Habeck.<eos> He shows up, he pays me for the men, then hauls them away.
Gang violence continues to go on in the United States.<eos> Should one, then, assume the American people are for it?<eos> We certainly prosecute gang violence with more vigilance.<eos> You cannot keep all of your citizens safe.<eos> Neither can we.<eos> We don't need - to flee our country in order...<eos> - Neither do Tanzanians.<eos> That is precisely the point.<eos> There are havens.<eos> Your clients did not seek them.
That little "Punch bowl" Remark.<eos> I may not have been picked on by the pretties, but I did spend a lot of time at high school dances waiting for some boy to... That hurt, Jenna.<eos> I'm sure to you I may seem big enough to rise above it... and I am;<eos> I've spent a lifetime rising above it... but that doesn't mean the remarks don't hurt.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Harry, really, I...<eos> I had no idea that you were so... full of crap.<eos> This devaluing of me has been going on for a long time, way before I made that "Punch bowl" Remark.<eos> So don't try to use that as an excuse to justify all the abuse that you've heaped on me.<eos> And if you are a person who seems to know that remarks cut deep, then why the hell do you constantly make them?
- The children?<eos> As in twins?<eos> - Yes.<eos> There are two of each.<eos> Two children, two stones.<eos> - What do we do about the stones?<eos> - It might be enough to drink a lot.<eos> They'll pass out with the urine.<eos> We can't crush them now.<eos> If necessary we'll remove them through a small pipe.
Talked to you at the warehouse earlier today, right?<eos> Sean?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, when I saw you at the warehouse, you told me this kid was here.<eos> I wanted to see it for myself.<eos> What Mrs. Holland's drugs was doing to these kids.<eos> I mean, they're killing them, right?<eos> Yeah, they are.<eos> Which basically means I killed them.
And where is she now?<eos> In another place, with another man.<eos> - Your Grace?<eos> - Yes, my dear?<eos> They call you the Last Dragon...<eos> They do.<eos> You have dragon's blood in your veins?<eos> It's entirely possible.<eos> What happened to the dragons?<eos> I was told that brave men killed them all.
- Your Grace?<eos> - Yes, my dear?<eos> They call you the Last Dragon...<eos> They do.<eos> You have dragon's blood in your veins?<eos> It's entirely possible.<eos> What happened to the dragons?<eos> I was told that brave men killed them all.<eos> The brave men didn't kill dragons.<eos> The brave men rode them.

And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk.<eos> So... Have you seen one?<eos> - A pirate ship?<eos> - A dragon.<eos> No.<eos> No, the last one died many years before I was born.<eos> I'll tell you what I have seen: Their skulls.<eos> They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep.<eos> When I was very young, just three or four, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him.<eos> When I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet.
Immaterial.<eos> It is not immaterial.<eos> I need to know the history.<eos> She is a talented, albeit unlicensed, masseuse who helps me with my back pain.<eos> Rem tene, verba sequentur.<eos> Stay with the facts.<eos> I am staying with the facts!<eos> No, you're not... you're fishing for irrelevant personal information.<eos> Aw, for crying out loud!<eos> If I am gonna run a defense, I need to know the facts when I ask them...
In my defense, I was simply streamlining the process and took the initiative-<eos> Cut the crap.<eos> You went behind my back to spite me.<eos> - Well, you gave me no choice.<eos> - Okay, look, enough.<eos> You obviously have axes to grind, and I'm not gonna stand here while you sort it out.<eos> In the meantime, this patient needs surgery.<eos> He's more comfortable with Yang doing it.<eos> She should be suspended for insubordination, but you're gonna reward her instead?<eos> I'll decide disciplinary actions, Dr. Altman, and I will take them out on Dr. Yang, not on the patient.
Okay, fine.<eos> You tell me when life begins.<eos> You know, I can't-I can't wait to hear this one.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Does it... does it have hands?<eos> I cannot believe you are doing this.<eos> I'm just asking a question.<eos> I don't want one.<eos> I don't hate children. I respect children.<eos> I think they should have parents who want them.

You're gonna have to come with us.<eos> First we need to look in that case.<eos> Don't touch that!<eos> Okay. - What's in the suitcase?<eos> - Cesium-137.<eos> The suitcase is lead-lined, but if you open it unprotected, The material will get into your marrow and mutate your cells.<eos> That's what she was using Newton's all-access badge for.<eos> Those pellets sell for a small fortune on the black market.<eos> And that explains all the radiology visits. And why, when I first met you, you knew so much about it.<eos> Did Newton find out you stole them?
Drop the needle!<eos> No, no, you... you... you don't understand.<eos> I, uh, I need this.<eos> I'm going through withdrawal.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> But the coffee...<eos> Jane didn't put anything in the coffee.<eos> He needed to lure out the real killer, and here you are.<eos> Okay, okay. I-I-I admit it.<eos> I-I-I stole drugs and I returned them watered down, but...
Still, it's cool, you know, having you as our designated drunk driver?<eos> That supposed to be funny?<eos> I didn't mean it like that, I just meant, you know...<eos> Well, it's great. That you've... You're not drinking.<eos> Just... driving.<eos> You could probably have one though, couldn't you?<eos> I mean, you are on holiday.<eos> See your kids much?<eos> They're at that age when having any kind of conversation with me is sort of just awkward.<eos> There's nothing I can do or say that doesn't make them look like they're annoyed or embarrassed.
I'm sorry<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> This is the reason why I was against the baseball team being formed<eos> These children are disabled If they get hurt...<eos> Who will be responsible for their lives?<eos> We should prepare them so they can adjust to society<eos> It is our role to educate them, not teach them to play baseball<eos> Do our students even adjust to society?<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> I'm asking if you have ever seen them treated like ordinary people

I don't think it's necessary
I have to go to the bathroom<eos> Come on... Pick up the phone<eos> I don't see a single body out there<eos> You can't keep this up any longer<eos> You said you wanted them to enter a national tournament<eos> You don't understand<eos> The boys have never been taught about co-operation and making sacrifices<eos> It's hard enough for them to look after themselves<eos> Telling them to scan the field, come in for back-up<eos> No matter how much you scold them, they won't understand you
- Lets just end it. - I accepted, but...<eos> - There's no need for...<eos> Sure, I just wanted to say something in the presence of my daughter and his wife.<eos> Why isn't she coming?<eos> Thank you, Ma'am.<eos> Could you call my daughter too, please.<eos> Little girl, your father needs you.<eos> Termeh, come sit here.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Look... I wrote the checks and I'll give them to you. No problem.
You don't always need a weapon to commit murder.<eos> Maybe you'd better tell me what happened.<eos> Peggy had early Alzheimer's.<eos> Right before Thanksgiving, I was t-thinking she was asleep.<eos> I went out to the store. That's when she got online... And started shopping at my leather fantasy.<eos> That old broad bought five grand worth of merchandise.<eos> When her husband called, I told him no refunds, no returns.<eos> Pissed him off.<eos> He started yelling, said he was gonna sue me.<eos> Well, your phone records show that you called them dozens of times, usually in the middle of the night.
We-we were even willing to give her part of our share of the buyout!<eos> He said that he would talk to her. He said he could get through to her.<eos> We never thought that he would kill her!<eos> I didn't kill her!<eos> She was already dead!<eos> But you still knew that somebody might find that flash drive, so you broke back in.<eos> That was David.<eos> And he couldn't find the tapes.<eos> It was too late anyway.<eos> Ellen had already sent them to the tv station.
Oh, my god.<eos> Three months ago, she appealed to the public For the whereabouts of the kid who found vanessa's clothes. Why?<eos> For an interview on the 25th anniversary<eos> Of her sister's death.<eos> So the cops must have interviewed him.<eos> His name's not in the file?<eos> There were hundreds of volunteers In countless search parties combing the area.<eos> Including a very eager and excited killer.<eos> We'll pull the names on the volunteer sign-in sheet.<eos> And compare them to the witness statements.
I love the desert.<eos> It's one of my favorite ecosystems.<eos> Here's the great thing about the southwest.<eos> There is so much more than desert.<eos> Along the north rim of the grand canyon is a forest as lush as you've ever seen.<eos> Burned.<eos> It's lush, dummy.<eos> Hey, uh, D'Angelo.<eos> What do you think about bald people?<eos> I hate them.
We kind of do...<eos> God!<eos> We sort of do more of like pow-wows or whatevs.<eos> - Okay, well, pow-wows then, fine.<eos> That's...<eos> Hey, D'Angelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece.<eos> It is so adorable.<eos> - All right, wait, but a little bit of back-story.<eos> She loves dogs.<eos> She calls them "da-das."
Just quit it.<eos> I want to hear from the rank and file.<eos> How can I be the best manager for you all?<eos> You know, what can I do better?<eos> Okay, you know what, everybody?<eos> There's... you have to be honest here.<eos> You... you can't say that everything is perfect, right?<eos> So, you know, come up with something.<eos> Well, D'Angelo, I'd say communication could be improved.<eos> People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them "urgent."
I don't see any signs of estrangement.<eos> Those men knew the girl's routine.<eos> Somebody tell me what's going on?<eos> ! Must be the father.<eos> John Fuller?<eos> Where are they?<eos> What's going on?<eos> The officers said there was an Amber Alert, no one's telling me anything.<eos> We're gonna tell ya everything we know.<eos> They made the unmarked car tailing them. These guys aren't amateurs.
Let's move!<eos> Inspector.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Greg.<eos> Last witnesses out confirm the shooter's on the 11th floor.<eos> Paradigm offices?<eos> Three floors above and below have been evacuated, but we gotta do a head count on the Paradigm staff, to know if anyone's been left behind.<eos> What are you hearing?<eos> Is this spree behaviour or a targeted operation?<eos> Two individuals said he walked right by them, so, I'd say it's targeted.
Well, Ma'am, he's gone over to Lark Rise.<eos> So early?<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> I packed him three sausages.<eos> He has important work there, Ma'am.<eos> Work?<eos> Mr Cochrane, sir?<eos> I've seen you here so many times. Now my curiosity has the better of me and I must ask you what it is you're after.<eos> I'm interested in how the men work the fields.<eos> I watch them and I see how taxing it is.
Oh, that ain't a dream.<eos> That was a nightmare.<eos> Thank heavens, it ain't true.<eos> But it is coming, Emma.<eos> Change has a way of forcing itself upon us.<eos> What I saw was the future.<eos> Our future!<eos> EMMA: Oh, Lordy!<eos> GABRIEL: The plough digs up on the land, cuts the furrows.<eos> The cups take the seeds and drops them into the hopper there.
Ma'am, what is capacity?<eos> Mrs Arless is as fearsome as a bear.<eos> If I wanted Alfie to marry me, I might let go of self-pity and try to seek a little courage.<eos> Mrs Arless.<eos> I ain't never seen such a three-legged girl.<eos> (STAMMERING) I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> Ma'am, Mrs Arless, it was... The bike was going faster than my feet was, then it weren't.<eos> Can't you even talk in a straight line?<eos> I know I have my faults and failings. Plenty of 'em.<eos> I can find them better than you can.
With the wind, the fire's gonna jump over the break.<eos> - We can't let you up there.<eos> It's firefighters only.<eos> - We want to save our homes!<eos> - Please!<eos> I don't have insurance!<eos> - Look, ma'am, I'm sorry. You're gonna have to move back.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - All of you! - Finally some good news for southland residents.<eos> After five days of battling one of the most difficult wildfires in recent memory, firefighters got a hand from mother nature, with intermittent heavy rain showers helping them put this blaze under control.
- This is the starter from the first fire.<eos> And this is a photo of a similar device that we found in a manual in your apartment.<eos> You studied that design.<eos> - And then there's Duane's statement.<eos> - Duane is a liar and an idiot.<eos> - Well, that part's true.<eos> We couldn't figure why a clever guy like you needed him at all, and then we realized, it's no fun doing something clever if no one knows.<eos> And that fire on Sunday was clever.<eos> - But what the fire department's really buzzing about is the second arson, the one on Tuesday.<eos> Now, that one caused them a lot of grief.
I couldn't even keep up with the insurance premiums.<eos> - You hosed off the roof with water from your pool.<eos> That's a big job. - Yeah.<eos> Joe and Patrick helped me.<eos> And then we left before we saw any homeless.<eos> And when we got back, Patrick's house--<eos> The screen on the side door was ripped open.<eos> There must've been people up here trying to loot. - Right.<eos> The looters who broke in and didn't steal anything.<eos> Those scratches on your arm, Mrs. Burt, how'd you get them?
Peter, every time my little sister's gotten a new life path or--or boyfriend or job, it ends in disaster.<eos> Or a word that sounds less harsh but means the same thing.<eos> - Pete, we got a problem.<eos> - I'll be there in a minute.<eos> This can't wait.<eos> Six cars were stolen off the back lot.<eos> What?<eos> This is me being respectfully silent.<eos> Since 1970, the federal Witness Protection program has relocated thousands of witnesses, some criminal, some not, to neighborhoods all across the country.<eos> Every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.

They are few, but the most grave.<eos> Tell me.<eos> My husband, Your Holiness, has long been distasteful to me.<eos> I fear you are not the first woman to share that fate.<eos> His person I find repellent.<eos> His advances sicken me.<eos> His hand upon my body makes me retch with disgust.<eos> Have you denied him your duties as a wife?<eos> No, Your Holiness.<eos> I performed them as the Church says I must.
"A Borgia," they said. "Is that how little I am valued?" I said.<eos> "The pope's daughter," they said.<eos> "For shame," I said.<eos> Your dowry was worthy of a princessa.<eos> Lucrezia Borgia Sforza.<eos> Do you hunt?<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> Then we need hardly see each other.<eos> Except when marital duties call.<eos> And then I'll keep them brief and business-like.
You are concerned for your husband's safety? For yours.<eos> He is a brute, a condotiorre, the veteran of many battles.<eos> Your calling is the Church, not the sword.<eos> If you were harmed, I could not forgive myself.<eos> I could not, perhaps, live.<eos> You care so much for one you hardly know?<eos> Yes.<eos> It is a puzzle.<eos> Or a mystery.<eos> Your visage is before my eyes when I'm asleep, when I wake, when I close them.
Giovanni Sforza.<eos> Lucrezia did not marry Ludovico Sforza, Brother.<eos> And they don't call him Il Moro for nothing.<eos> I hear he keeps his own cousin caged beneath his castle floors.<eos> He would betray us in a moment if he thought his dukedom was in peril.<eos> What he fears is that his nephew will wear his crown.<eos> Well, perhaps we should threaten him with just that possibility.<eos> And you should go to Florence tease out their intentions.<eos> Those Medici bankers have a preacher,<eos> Savonarola, who accuses them of usury.
Well, that's the plan, anyway.<eos> - Where will you go?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - I always wanted to see somewhere hot.<eos> I've never seen the desert.<eos> Perhaps see some sharks.<eos> Oh, I'm a great fan of sharks.<eos> Daddy took me snorkelling once for my birthday, to see them in their natural habitat.<eos> Did you see many?<eos> Enough to realise I prefer them in aquariums.
I'm guessing you've read my personal file?<eos> So... you know how hard I have worked to get here.<eos> Now, my point is, and please don't take this the wrong way...<eos> Promise to try.<eos> ...but today you asked me to confiscate people's mobile phones when there was no actual...<eos> - Gray, Gray.<eos> - ...no real legal grounds.<eos> - Gray, it was a figure of speech.<eos> - Yeah, I know, I get that... really.<eos> It's just... well, if I had just confiscated them, would you have minded?
It's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the king.<eos> The king is hunting.<eos> Fish.<eos> The sigil of House Tully.<eos> Isn't that your wife's House - Tully - my Lord Hand?<eos> These men, were they flying a sigil?<eos> - A banner?<eos> - None, your...<eos> Hand.<eos> The one who was leading them... Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith in two, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.
Stay.<eos> Hello?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Lord Commander?<eos> Snow?<eos> Commander!<eos> Move!<eos> What did they do?<eos> Lamb men make good slaves.<eos> Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold and silk, and steel.
The great shepherd sent me to earth to heal his...<eos> Too many words.<eos> A witch's words poison the ears.<eos> Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.<eos> Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars it makes me hurt to see you bleed.<eos> For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.<eos> I'm the man you want leading the vanguard.<eos> Galbart Glover will lead the van.<eos> The bloody wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.<eos> I will lead the van or I will take my men and march them home.
shit! {\cHFFFFFF} What?<eos> !<eos> {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Sorry!<eos> Sorry!<eos> {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} a rat or something.{\cHFFFFFF} Jesus!<eos> {\cHFFFFFF} {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Where is it?<eos> {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Don't worry.<eos> {\cHFFFFFF}Is that smell what I think it is?<eos> {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Defrosting.<eos> {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} You know the Native Americans {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} believe that the spirits of the dead {\cHFFFFFF} {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} protect them and watch over them.
I might just marry this woman.<eos> I think she's already married.<eos> So was I, once.<eos> No, you weren't.<eos> But I tell women that sometimes.<eos> Makes them think I can commit.<eos> And another piece of the puzzle.<eos> I've got a whole corner now.<eos> That is a whole pile of judgment coming from the guy who lost his pants at the pizza place.<eos> I didn't lose them at the pizza place.
I know I would have.<eos> I stuck her head in the pan and flushed it.<eos> - I'm sorry I did it now.<eos> - You have a temper, then?<eos> Are you working on the Brian Wilcox case?<eos> Our Division is - why?<eos> Have you ever heard of a wee boy called Thomas Dempsie?<eos> We're not here to talk about that.<eos> Has anyone ever noticed the similarities between the two cases?<eos> If you knew more about them, you'd know they're different.
You're telling me to remain with our arms folded?<eos> Yes.<eos> Captain, you must come a moment.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Get off me!<eos> - Stop or I'll break your face.<eos> - No.<eos> I have to go out.<eos> The dummies didn't scare them, because they are immobile.
- Enough, Burbuja.<eos> Stop.<eos> Sailor, stop.<eos> That's an order.<eos> It 's my fault, sir, but I can fix it.<eos> - It is not your fault.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> I am the fool of the ship, right?<eos> It the idiot of the ship is stupid to call... the parents of a sparrow to come and get him.<eos> For this reason we have all those birds out there, because that idiot Burbuja called them.
No difference.<eos> No difference at all.<eos> What about fatalities? Fatalities, there were none with the cameras on and none with the cameras off.<eos> Really? What's interesting about this is that you'd think this made no difference and saved the council a fortune by getting rid of the speed cameras.<eos> They're now saying the police are going to take over running them and turn them back on again in April.<eos> I thought they said - they couldn't afford to run them?<eos> No, the police are doing it.<eos> But this is very good news because that must mean they've solved all the other crimes.<eos> What, the police?<eos> Actually, they haven't solved them all but they have caught that bloke - who nicked the lead off my roof.
What to do want to do in terms - of their relationship?<eos> - Kill them.<eos> Please, you couldn't handle it.<eos> Hook sees an element of himself in Emma.<eos> She's lost and she was a thief and, you know, but he has a real connection with her.<eos> Captain Hook to lay his cards out on the table emotionally.<eos> Emma is a strong, smart survivor.<eos> Hook's a strong, smart survivor.<eos> We're pairing men and women that are a match in that sense and seeing the chemistry and the excitement.<eos> - the writers have done this. - We take these characters, we bring them in here.
I tried to stop her from freaking out.<eos> Cowboy.<eos> Badass.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Okay, the airlift is on its way to take you to San Miguel, get you a real pacemaker.<eos> And then after that...<eos> What's that?<eos> It's my lucky subway card.<eos> You know, the trains in New York are pretty much rolling urinals.<eos> I hate them.
The Honorable, the Chief Justice, and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States...<eos> Oyez!<eos> Oyez!<eos> Oyez!<eos> All persons having business before the Honorable, the Supreme Court of the United States, are invited to draw near and give their attention, for the court is now sitting.<eos> God save the United States and this honorable court.<eos> May it please the court?<eos> I speak on behalf of Harry Briggs, J r., and the negro school children of Clarendon County, who have raised their attack on the validity of the South Carolina code, that says,<eos> "It shall be unlawful for pupils of one race "to attend the schools provided for persons of another race."<eos> In the lower courts, we produced unchallenged experts who testified that segregation destroys the self-respect of negro children and stamps them with a badge of inferiority.
John W. Davis let everyone know, that this was his swan song, his final argument.<eos> You could see the great esteem for him on the faces of the nine Justices.<eos> "May it please the court?<eos> "Your Honors, the old horn doesn't honk as loud as it used to, "but I hope you can hear me.<eos> "In Clarendon School District, Number One, in South Carolina, the state "has now provided the negro children with schools that are "equal in every respect.<eos> "In fact, because of their being newer, "they may be even better than the schools for the white children.<eos> "Who would want to disturb this situation?<eos> "There are 2,790 "registered negro children of school age in Clarendon County.<eos> "There are 290 whites.<eos> "If you took the negro children, "and co-mingled them with the white children, "you would have, in each classroom,
Uh, you know, during the, uh, Reagan years, a lot of people wanted me off the court.<eos> Said I was, uh, well, said I was too old.<eos> Uh, too liberal, too tipsy.<eos> Well, I'd tell them that I had accepted a lifetime appointment. I'm staying for life.<eos> I expect to die at the age of 110, shot by a jealous husband.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, you should know, that from time to time, Cissy would get after me, about my being too soft on our boys.<eos> And I would get defensive. I say, "No, no,<eos> "I'm not going to punish those boys for anything I did."<eos> She said, "Well, you'll never punish them for anything, 'cause you did everything."
Now get your keys and let's go.<eos> The neighborhood's very concerned.<eos> Detective, did your people process the crime scene?<eos> We wanted you to take a look at it.<eos> Maybe you'll see something we missed.<eos> The me's report says she died after the second stab wound because they hit an artery.<eos> The other wounds didn't bleed.<eos> So why inflict 38 more?<eos> We see it sometimes with groups.<eos> The fact that others are involved helps each of them rationalize their own violent behavior.
It'll be no different if we start now.<eos> And you've always got Lang.<eos> We wish you every good fortune.<eos> Don't we, darling?<eos> We certainly do.<eos> Good luck, William.<eos> Thank you, milord.<eos> So, both my footmen have gone to the war, while I cut ribbons and make speeches.<eos> And keep people's spirits up, which is very important.<eos> By God, I envy them, though.
I forbid it!<eos> To have strange men prodding and prying around the house, to say nothing of pocketing the spoons!<eos> It's out of the question.<eos> I hesitate to remind you, but this is my house now, Robert's and mine. And we will make the decision.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> So, now I'm an outsider who need not be consulted?<eos> Since you put it like that, yes.<eos> What was it like at the hospital today?<eos> At the front, the men pray to be spared, of course.<eos> But if that's not to be, they pray for a bullet that kills them cleanly.
With that kind of enthusiasm, you might even get some flowers out of me.<eos> Hey, you.<eos> What's wrong? You got something you wanna tell me?<eos> Malcolm, fishing for compliments is not your style, but if you need to hear it, yeah... you do look good.<eos> Hmm. "me and Keisha Greene...<eos> were the hottest new girls in" the business.<eos> Everybody wanted us in their videos, everybody wanted to party with us.<eos> We used to tag team.<eos> I'd get the boys in bed...<eos> and she would just get them...
Hello, mate.<eos> I've just finished work.<eos> Do you wanna come out?<eos> I haven't been getting much kip lately.<eos> Maybe tomorrow, yeah?<eos> Yeah, no worries.<eos> Oh. You didn't move those flight tickets<eos> No.<eos> They were on my worktop last night.<eos> You sure you didn't pick them up?
"You don't have to apologize for my jacket, but your parakeet better start explaining."<eos> Hello, Barry.<eos> A word?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> Waltzing in here and talking to me out in the open like that?<eos> Yeah, unfortunately, the stealthier option has been removed from the table, Barry.<eos> We're looking for a terrorist here.<eos> French intelligence has been following us since we got to Paris.<eos> Oh, and you led them here.
She thought I made her look bad.<eos> That she couldn't save herself.<eos> She's always had it in for me. She was just biding her time.<eos> It makes sense that someone with her psychological makeup would resent you for your help.<eos> You must have wounded her pride more than I imagined.<eos> Are we finished?<eos> Yes.<eos> Alex, one more thing.<eos> Are you familiar with our new cochlear implants?<eos> Division's been developing them for some time.
I mean, I'm sure you'll be great.<eos> Yes, he will be.<eos> Just calm down and repeat your mantra.<eos> Oh, what's your mantra?<eos> I'm weak.<eos> I'm harmless.<eos> They love me.<eos> Where are my yogurt-covered pretzels?<eos> They're in the bag, sweetie.<eos> Oh no, I just panicked all over them.
I have.<eos> We all have.<eos> It hurts, but it happens.<eos> You must know something.<eos> People like you always do!<eos> Ooh, I think you've bust a rib.<eos> Have you got a wife?<eos> What?<eos> Kids?<eos> Are you threatening them?
Look, maybe he could use your help planning the party.<eos> Of course, yes, you wouldn't want a man Who's lost three toes to frostbite limping around with a cheese tray.<eos> - That's a downer.<eos> All right, Amaar, for you, yes,<eos> I will even help old seven toes.<eos> Well, long story short, It took a lot of chewing But I made my own slippers.<eos> Wow, that is impressive.<eos> Yeah, you know, I actually chewed these loafers.<eos> Really?<eos> No, I bought them like people do.
For many years it had a 50-mile-an-hour speed limit, which is too low, but they've decided this week to lower it to 30.<eos> 30 miles an hour!<eos> I tried driving down there earlier this week at 30 miles an hour, I damn nearly caused 27 accidents.<eos> A little girl on a scooter, she was like, "What are you doing, you idiot? !"<eos> Isn't it a temporary speed limit while they do some works underneath the bridge bit or something?<eos> But when they introduced the 70-mile-an-hour limit on all British motorways in 1965, they said then that was temporary.<eos> Here we are 46 years later, we've still got it.<eos> Speed limits are like herpes.<eos> Are they?<eos> Yeah, you get them, you never get rid of them.
I've been assigned to a special covert unit, conceived to go where others can't, and to do what others won't, whether the mission's authorized or not.<eos> We each have our own special skill, Martinez.<eos> I lead, Billy charms people,<eos> Casey hurts people, and you translate.<eos> We are the ODS, last of the old-school spies.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I made this for you.<eos> Oh, uh, that's okay, Blanke, I've already had my morning coffee.<eos> The beans are Kopi Luwak.<eos> Buddy from Indonesia sent them.
This is good, right?<eos> This guy's a monster? No, he's a son of a bitch.<eos> This guy is a monster.<eos> Mehrak's son- - Sadegh.<eos> He's the designated heir.<eos> Sadegh commands the secret police.<eos> He tortures for fun, and will make his father look like a humanitarian if he ever makes it into power.<eos> Which brings us to our other problem.<eos> Two weeks ago four American hikers were arrested as spies for accidentally crossing over into Miristan.<eos> And once Sadegh is in charge, he'll roast them for sheer pleasure.
That's one and eight, altogether.<eos> There you go. Might I have a glass of cider?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't know if I've dreaded this moment or longed for it.<eos> Well, either way, it's happened.<eos> I'm glad I'm in time for tomorrow's state visit.<eos> I gather Lavinia will be there.<eos> We must seize the opportunity to challenge her.<eos> I don't really see on what basis.<eos> She stole secrets from her uncle, Jonathan Swire, and gave them to Carlisle to publish.
It's like living in a second-rate hotel where the guests keep arriving and no-one seems to leave!<eos> I see.<eos> Thank you for letting me know.<eos> Are you all right, Papa?<eos> That was the War Office.<eos> Matthew and William went out on a patrol a few days ago and they haven't been seen since.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Let's not fall to pieces quite yet.<eos> It happens all the time, apparently, and the men turn up in one field hospital or another.<eos> But they are treating them as missing in action?
I thought you'd be angry.<eos> Because that's the first time you've ever spoken about "us".<eos> If you didn't care, you would have told them months ago.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Because I don't want you to lose your job, it must mean I'm madly in love with you.<eos> Well, doesn't it?<eos> You say I'm a free spirit, and I hope I am, but you're asking me to give up my whole world and everyone in it.<eos> And that's too high a price to pay?<eos> It IS a high price!<eos> I love my parents - you don't know them... and I love my sisters, my friends...
Everything's in short supply now.<eos> Short supply?<eos> No supply, more like!<eos> Ooh, talk about making a silk purse out of a sow's ear.<eos> I wish we had a sow's ear!<eos> It'd be better than this brisket.<eos> That's just it.<eos> Thomas has come by some groceries and such and he's prepared to let them go for the right price.<eos> Oh, he's prepared to let them go, is he?<eos> And how did he come by them? That's what I'd like to know.
Hey, this is the CIA you are dealing with here, okay?<eos> They wrote the book on advanced interrogation techniques, which I am absolutely positive you have sitting on your bedside table right now, okay?<eos> Just so you know, I understand, okay?<eos> I would not mind a little one-on-one session with Jenna Kaye.<eos> The thought does stimulate my imagination, too.<eos> Legally, the CIA can only interrogate foreign nationals.<eos> Why do you do that?<eos> I had a little fantasy worked out.<eos> I mean, you're, like, a devourer of dreams.<eos> You know what I mean, like, you eat them.
Drink some...<eos> What is it, this time?<eos> Ah.. it's yam juice.<eos> You said that the decoction smelled bad... So I cut this yam into 8-10 centimeters, and mixed it with some fresh fruits, yogurt and milk.<eos> Please, drink it when it's cool.<eos> Yam is very good for your health.<eos> It helps a lot to refresh your body.<eos> And also it is easily digested, therefore it's excellent for indigestion and stomach disorder.<eos> But that's not all.<eos> Yam is good for students as well, because it can help them concentrate.
I must save Susu!<eos> There's only a single sprout.<eos> Fire can't even burn it!<eos> They found us!<eos> - Did you get the spirit herb?<eos> - I did. Then let's get out of here!<eos> It's going to be disaster if they catch you!<eos> You take the spirit herb, I'll distract them.<eos> Demons have been confined in Lei Feng Pagoda for aeons!<eos> The spirit herb kept them trapped.
Glue-on.<eos> Take calcium and vitamin B by the handful, and nothing helps.<eos> You should, uh, put on moisturizer before bed and then sleep in light cotton gloves.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Uh, can I ask you a question?<eos> I make 10 times more here than I did at the 7-Eleven and work half as many hours.<eos> We make choices to provide for our kids, I guess.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Terrence King,<eos> I dragged my so-called bony ass out of bed and left my kids home with a tattooed man named Xeno who is probably scaring the crap out of them right about now!
-Or a license.<eos> You can go inside.<eos> Here's the info on the court date.<eos> Now, ma, think twice before doing anything crazy.<eos> Judges frown on parents killing their kids.<eos> And you. What are you, the town crier?<eos> You blabbing my business to everybody?<eos> !<eos> Well, teenagers feel a loss of support as a result of divorce and turn outwards to fill that gap.<eos> Please stop reading my psychology books, okay, because you definitely don't understand them!
Very nice.<eos> - Don't you have a closer one?<eos> - Unfortunately no.<eos> - A captain.<eos> - A captain of the merchant navy.<eos> These are sub-lieutenant's badges.<eos> The photo is old.<eos> I couldn't find a more recent one.<eos> He used to wear glasses.<eos> I couldn't find them.
Guys, you were supposed to be there at 1:00. Move your asses.<eos> Yeah, we're going.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> Bye.<eos> Who are those new guys?<eos> Uh, just - - Just some guys we bring in from time to time.<eos> Why?<eos> I just never seen them before.
Is that us?<eos> Yeah, it's us.<eos> We have a limit of how many people can be over there.<eos> You have to be three feet away from the statue.<eos> So, camera comes here.<eos> Over here, maybe.<eos> Start to come up.<eos> MAN: Excellent.<eos> One of Darren's big interests in filmmaking, I think, is subjectivity, and making sure that you're always telling the story from the point of view of your main character.<eos> The film is a fable, and in a lot of ways, it's a ballet, but the way that influenced us is that we took a lot of elements from Swan Lake that aren't necessarily explicit and sprinkled them throughout.
Let's not get too chummy.<eos> I'm just the messenger here.<eos> Jake Doyle wants Tinny and Des' location, and then you can have your money.<eos> All right, look.<eos> You tell Jake Doyle that if he wants to see his niece alive, he has about one option, break me outta here.<eos> Did you get that? Tell him he's got a deal.<eos> Hey, you guys, look!<eos> Check this out.<eos> It's Crocker! Yeah.<eos> So, he grabbed the kids from our house, and then he stopped here to get a coffee before he went to the battery, so he's got them somewhere here.
He actually asked me if it was my time of the month.<eos> I don't want to discuss your womanly, uh...<eos> Well, I guess now would be a good time for you to lecture me about the kind of guys that I date.<eos> No, no, no, no, you're a big girl... although, come on, that guy didn't pass the smell test.<eos> He actually smelled kind of great.<eos> Not what I'm talking about.<eos> I've seen the type a million times.<eos> Let me guess. No steady job... badmouths his parents, super controlling, never has money, always wants you to pay. Mm-hmm.<eos> I was supposed to buy him a guitar on Saturday.<eos> I hate them.
I got an idea.<eos> SuperShuttle?<eos> Hi. Yes, I'd like to organize a pickup.<eos> Yes, I do have a AAA card.<eos> Okay, I managed to shut off Castle's satellite feed.<eos> You have five minutes to get Daphne off that shuttle.<eos> Beckman's already got Casey in the field with a SWAT team.<eos> General, do we have a location on the target?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Our satellites are still dark, but we're getting them back up now.
Come on, give your old man a chance.<eos> I do know a thing or two about criminals.<eos> Maybe I can help.<eos> Okay, well, there are these three brothers called the Klügs. They are never in the same place, but they're going to be in L. A... for their sister's wedding. They carry around this device with them, called the Zephyr... but they rotate it amongst themselves and, um...<eos> - You know, never mind, this is... - No, I'm listening.<eos> Your mark are the Klügs and the Zephyr's the package.<eos> Right.<eos> But the problem is the wedding reception... that they're supposed to be at is one of Daphne's cons.<eos> Any way that we could... make that wedding reception happen?<eos> - Daphne's records did say... that she never met the Gerlichs in person, but even if I convinced them... it's still on, how could I throw a $100,000 wedding... in 24 hours with no CIA resources?
Whoa, whoa, Dana I thought you were the one who set this up.<eos> No, no, we have nothing to do with this.<eos> No I'm his attorney, there is a mob out there.<eos> Whoa, whoa wait a minute guys wait a minute, wait...<eos> Chief Voyt, Chief Voyt!<eos> Orwell, what do you got for me?<eos> Whoever posted a bail wants to stay anonymous.<eos> This feels like a setup.<eos> Get to Marty's house, get the kids out.<eos> Anything happens, I want them safe.
I don't remember anything.<eos> You're dicking with me.<eos> - Nothing?<eos> - I'm telling you, blank slate.<eos> Well, you got a wallet, ID?<eos> I wish I did.<eos> Okay, what's the last thing you remember?<eos> Um, I woke up on a park bench... cops shoving a flashlight in my face, trying to take me in.<eos> - So you ran. - No, I, um...<eos> I knocked them out cold, both of them.
There was an accumulation of blood drops...<eos> Let's go!<eos> On the floor right here, where, apparently, the shooter bumped into a shelf, and then knocked some stuff to the ground.<eos> Was this all our shooter's blood?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do me a favor. Uh, before you head downtown, go by the property clerk and pick up the evidence and bring it by the lab.<eos> No problem.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.<eos> Know what I'm thinking?<eos> I want you to go into the bathroom, take these two bricks of cocaine, and I want you to strap them to your body.
She went to get you some aspirin.<eos> And when I woke up a couple hours later, she was gone.<eos> I went through the entire building, knocked on every door.<eos> Went through the streets screaming her name.<eos> I haven't had a drink since that night.<eos> That's what it took to open my eyes.<eos> But it was too late.<eos> It's never too late.<eos> You've been looking for these men for nine years.<eos> What makes you think you're going to find them now?
- Then you know perfection isn't easily attained.<eos> - And your current husband?<eos> Did he demand perfection from June, too?<eos> - Grant?<eos> He's not current. He died last year.<eos> And was just as weak and useless as Roger.<eos> - So you had to be the disciplinarian.<eos> - I was always fair.<eos> But firm.<eos> - But when your kids act up, nothing fixes them faster than the handle of a spoon, huh?
I just see an empty robe.<eos> Do you honestly not see me, or are you being rude?<eos> - I am being rude. - That's it.<eos> Twelve weeks of community service.<eos> You'll spend your whole summer picking up trash.<eos> Gavel, gavel, gavel!<eos> Freedom!<eos> Probably not you guys.<eos> Mr. Donaghy, where are my clothes?<eos> Sherry must've put them in the wash while you were showering.
Bye!<eos> And good luck, Angela.<eos> And you too, Sherry.<eos> Eat it!<eos> Rude.<eos> A little sportsmanship, if you please.<eos> Sportsmanship is for losers and wanna-bes.<eos> I'll be in the arcade.<eos> Kid was raised by wolves.<eos> Till she killed and ate them all.
Let's try breathing, okay?<eos> Four short breaths.<eos> Oh, God, shut up!<eos> You sound like a quacking duck!<eos> Oh, God, okay.<eos> Come on, Buck.<eos> Come on.<eos> Go.<eos> We are doomed!<eos> We only needed two pins to win, and you left them both standing.
Siamese twins?<eos> No way. Are you sure?<eos> Oh, I'm sure.<eos> My siamese twins-dar has never let me down.<eos> Victoria, I had no idea.<eos> I met Timothy at a benefit at the art museum, and it was super crowded.<eos> We were packed in like sardines.<eos> I mean, it could have been a convention of siamese twins for all I knew.<eos> At least you got a shot at one of your dates being interesting.<eos> Maybe my date could part them.
A simile would be something like, um...<eos> Your tie is a crime against humanity.<eos> What's wrong with my tie?<eos> Uh, no, nothing's wrong with your tie --<eos> I was just telling you the difference between a -- my wife gave this to me.<eos> - Yeah, it's a great tie.<eos> Sorry, Dwight.<eos> Uh, so, uh, what, you think these guys came out of retirement to do this?<eos> I don't care if it's the fox meadows gang or the resurrection of Jesse James.<eos> We're gonna get them this time.
Here, move away. I'm gonna bust it down.<eos> So much for being smarter.<eos> Freeze! Or I'll blow your heads off.<eos> All right son, just take it easy.<eos> I-I promised your mom I'd get you back safe.<eos> Whoa, whoa. When I heard people walking up towards the house,<eos> I-I thought it was...<eos> Who's got you more scared than the police?<eos> Look, I did the first break-in two weeks ago.<eos> It was a "screw you" to my rich friends for turning their back on me, after I embarrassed them with my problem.
And rabbits?<eos> We're not really coming back,are we?<eos> Shit no.<eos> Oh no.<eos> Do not worry about the fish.<eos> They're dead. Yes.<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> I killed them.<eos> I overfed them or underfed them, or--<eos> No, I killed them.
From the moment I knew that we would spend our lives together,<eos> I wanted to tell you, but... The words just never came.<eos> I thought they would destroy us.<eos> So every year, I just buried it deeper and deeper, until I thought it was gone and I was safe and we were safe.<eos> Christina.<eos> My parents are not from Cuba.<eos> Where are they from?<eos> The Dominican.<eos> They're here illegally.<eos> America would have turned them away.
- I'll think about it.<eos> - I need to know soon.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> Nothing further, Your Honor.<eos> Mrs. Joyce, first of all, let me just say how sorry I am for your loss.<eos> I mean, my wife means everything to me. And I... I can't imagine how you feel.<eos> Unfortunately, this is a trial, so I have to ask you some tough questions.<eos> Ask away.<eos> Were you and your husband having marital difficulties?<eos> We'd had some issues, on and off, but we were working through them.
Why would you wanna do anything... Play cards, go sailing, go fishing, whatever. - with just one person?<eos> Because it would hurt them not to.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. But that's not about love. That's about fear.<eos> That's about jealousy.<eos> If you love someone, don't you set them free?<eos> No.<eos> You like to tie them down?<eos> Yes, basically.<eos> Aren't there men you look at, and you just watch them? In a Starbucks line, opening a door, tying their shoes. And you just wanna grab their hand and slide it up the small of your back?
I didn't do it on purpose.<eos> I took the jar in stock, where there is shampoo.<eos> - I still feel something here. - Snitch.<eos> - Snitch, snitch...<eos> - Look at this, please.<eos> I'm checking hair by hair.<eos> There is nothing.<eos> So what?<eos> I know how to use the transmitter.<eos> It's like a very powerful walkie... it not only sends signals at a great distance... but receives them too.
They look like welding goggles.<eos> I know.<eos> Pretty high-tech, huh?<eos> Put them on now, it will give your eyes more time to adjust to the dark.<eos> I can't see anything. You will.<eos> You'll see everything soon enough.<eos> What theater are we going to?<eos> Uh, AMC.<eos> I'm telling you, Ryan, these 3D glasses are not working.<eos> Don't take them off.
Okay, Raymond, let's say you have a lemonade stand.<eos> Knowing there's gonna be a really bad lemon crop that year, you make it look like you really need lemons.<eos> Everybody thinks you're vulnerable-- like Charlie just said-- when actually you don't need lemons, because, shazam, you've got powder mix.<eos> You call that English? Oh, my God!<eos> Barnes wants us to think that we have him.<eos> Because we have his lemons?<eos> I have got this.<eos> Because we have his lemons.<eos> But they are cannon fodder, okay?<eos> He wanted us to chase them, he wanted us to catch them, he wanted us to think his plan was falling apart, because that was his plan.
There's nothing to clean up.<eos> You're wrong about Luke.<eos> The man's a giver.<eos> Luke Ronson's given selflessly to our mission.<eos> His money and his time.<eos> What's he do? Serve food?<eos> Cuts hair.<eos> - Hairdo's for the homeless.<eos> - Checks for lice, too.<eos> And treats them when they have it.

I used good old-fashioned persuasion.<eos> Exchange of goods and services.<eos> By the way, if he thanks you for a couple of Kings of Leon tickets, just go with it.<eos> - How'd you get those?<eos> - They're just the tickets your Aunt Mel and Lennox couldn't use.<eos> But they did use them!<eos> They're at the concert right now.<eos> Can't you see the trail of glitter?<eos> How?<eos> I took them right off the printer.
Scorgy!<eos> So I was thinking we would just sneak off tonight after the coach calls lights out and find the place we both pictured.<eos> Oh, R.J., I can't.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> No, I totally understand if you wouldn't want to do it.<eos> R.J., not that.<eos> I do want to, I really, really want to.<eos> It's just... My parents won't let me go.<eos> But it's a school event.<eos> I know, somebody called them and said how it's basically a school sponsored orgy.
How's your new boyfriend?<eos> He's been really sweet since his mother died.<eos> Nice earrings.<eos> Where'd you get them?<eos> He gave them to me.
Mistakes happen.<eos> It's like the time I went hunting with my friend.<eos> We'll call him Dick.<eos> He got super wasted and shot a guy in the face.<eos> Now ol' Dickie wanted to cap him again and bury him in the woods, but we did the right thing.<eos> We let the CIA take the rap.<eos> Understand what I'm trying to say?<eos> Uh... yeah. You were with Dick Cheney when he shot that guy?<eos> No.<eos> My point is this... We all make mistakes. It's how we handle them that matters.
No reason to be curious unless you're interested in wielding it yourself.<eos> You want her to intern here.<eos> And you're considering this?<eos> Before I make my decision, I still have one more LP<eos> I need to get.<eos> So I'd like to go to the E.R.<eos> Thirteen, why don't you take Masters to do the blood draws.<eos> You can remind her about all the perks of working for me.<eos> Behind the deck. Port side.<eos> If her adrenal hormone levels are consistently low, we'll replace them.
I thought you were going to turn that in.<eos> Um, I, um, been busy with my patient.<eos> You're not busy now.<eos> Masters.<eos> Still haven't turned in your log?<eos> Still haven't gotten my tenth LP.<eos> I was thinking maybe you should take House's internship.<eos> First you act like it's the equivalent of volunteering to be waterboarded and now you're supporting it?<eos> You're weird.<eos> You make paper airplanes for fun and hang them from the ceiling.
Oh, my God.<eos> You scared me.<eos> Why aren't you at the gallery?<eos> I gotta come here and get some clothes.<eos> Wh... what have you done with my studio?<eos> I spruced it up.<eos> Guess what.<eos> Our realtor has a very motivated buyer who's interested in this house.<eos> Where are my brushes?<eos> Oh, I washed them all and put them in there...
- No!<eos> Calm down. - I just want to make you happy!<eos> - That's enough.<eos> - Maestro, take five.<eos> - Okay. Break, everyone.<eos> Eleanor was nothing compared to Ariel.<eos> She didn't have the technique.<eos> So after rehearsal that night, I followed Eleanor to her performance.<eos> Why'd you take the flowers?<eos> He didn't think Eleanor deserved them. Isn't that right?
Then we sat together in the living room and did crossword puzzles.<eos> Or we just said nothing.<eos> See those bums?<eos> Bunch of idiots.<eos> Keep you ass down...<eos> Low!<eos> I don't wanna be like my mother.<eos> She's a ghost.<eos> She has no life.<eos> If I have children, I'll raise them very differently.
The USA continued to help Iraq to cancel old debts.<eos> But nobody in Washington ever wanted to hear again the expression "odious debt".<eos> Iraq managed to write off a big part of its debt with the support of an empire.<eos> But another country resolved to stand on its own two feet and stand up against the IMF and its other big lenders.<eos> They managed to prove that their debt was not only odious, but also illegitimate and unconstitutional.<eos> Welcome to Ecuador.<eos> Rafael Correa<eos> - President of Ecuador - We have urgent national commitments.<eos> We'll fulfill our national commitments before the international commitments.<eos> In due time, we will fulfill them.
- Yeah. I mean, he's...<eos> He's kind of intense.<eos> Babe, I don't know what he's like at work, but once you've seen him reading Everybody Poops to Harrison, you realise he's a big softie.<eos> Just talk to him.<eos> Lieutenant?<eos> I have the personal effects of Jessica Morris.<eos> - You asked for them.<eos> - Oh, right, fuck.<eos> The dead call girl.<eos> Just put them in my office.
That's my little gentleman.<eos> Now, I know the Locos are the supplier for this neighbourhood.<eos> And I'm guessing that you, being a savvy consumer, have kept abreast on who's running their operation now.<eos> - I don't know shit.<eos> - I just don't believe you.<eos> I'm afraid you leave me no choice but to flamingo your ass.<eos> - Ass... What?<eos> - It's a Chicago thing.<eos> It's ironic, because we don't actually have flamingos in Chicago.<eos> You actually have them here in Miami, and yet you don't flamingo people.
- You don't like him?<eos> - I don't really know him.<eos> You know what?<eos> - You should come to dinner with us.<eos> - I don't know...<eos> If you're going to judge him, then maybe you should have some idea who you're talking about first.<eos> OK, sure. Why not?<eos> - It'll be fun.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Children trust that when we put them to bed at night, they'll live to see another day.
- Yeah. I guess.<eos> You have quite the collection of collections.<eos> Yeah, I don't...<eos> I don't let a lot of people in here.<eos> It's kind of obvious I'm overcompensating for something.<eos> I've been known to collect.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I went through an '80s phase in high school.<eos> I had a zillion of those black rubber bracelets.<eos> Wore them like body armour.
Whoa. Daddy told you he didn't want you driving no more.<eos> Oh, don't you give me the stink eye.<eos> All right, I'm taking you home right now. Come on. Yeah.<eos> - I'll wait in the lobby.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> I have to.<eos> Okay? Mama's not here.<eos> Daddy's gone half the time.<eos> Children need parameters.<eos> It's what makes them feel loved and cared for.
You?<eos> You'll be fine. You always land on your feet.<eos> You're like a cat, or a man made entirely of feet.<eos> Well, thanks, Cleveland.<eos> You know, you're going to be all right, too.<eos> You got a certain limited appeal.<eos> You mean that? Yeah.<eos> Rallo, change my expression to one of determination.<eos> Now, you see these charts behind me?<eos> Well, someone left them here after the insurance conference, so don't let them distract you.
I know. I'm busy, too.<eos> Teri wants to do the lesson here, but I told her that you'd... love it?<eos> Of course.<eos> Can't wait.<eos> Is Jane in her office?<eos> Go on in, twinkle toes.<eos> Hey. How you doing?<eos> You heard about the rings?<eos> I heard you got robbed.<eos> I am so sorry. I will get them back as soon...
That will mean I can't pay you a lot initially.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Mum just wants me out the house.<eos> I can live rent-free if I don't come home till six at night. Right.<eos> What are your interests?<eos> You know, tell me a bit about Cheryl.<eos> Do you have a pet?<eos> I've got two pets that are related to each other.<eos> They're dogs.<eos> Ah! But we sort of call them different things, like, they've got names.
It's my hunch, dummy.<eos> Two people can't go off one hunch, all right? One person, one hunch.<eos> I know we've been... be quiet.<eos> I'm trying to tell you that I'm nervous, okay?<eos> I just got a bad feeling about this whole thing. Okay.<eos> Okay, well, you know what?<eos> Maybe the vamps are nervous too.<eos> What?<eos> I'm just saying, I know...<eos> I know we think of them as...
What if her body used up all the clotting factors dealing with the stab wound? Explains the bloody mass.<eos> But if you're right, she could start bleeding anywhere.<eos> Wait, one of those things could start growing in my brain?<eos> It's time to get you to the hospital.<eos> No.<eos> Remy, you promised.<eos> All we'll do at the hospital is stick her in a patient bed and give her IV clotting factor.<eos> We can do that right here.<eos> We could also embalm her right here.<eos> I'll call the drugs and you go pick them up.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.<eos> Is that glitter on you?<eos> Just hear me out.<eos> Back when I still had my practice, this patient came in, 50-year-old guy wanting a tummy tuck, but when we do some prelim work, we discover that his stomach is filled with cancer.<eos> So instead of telling him that he's gonna look great at the beach, I gotta tell him that he's dying.<eos> Were you at a strip club?<eos> Please.<eos> The weird part was I was more upset about the whole thing than he was.<eos> He actually had to calm me down.<eos> He said he had great kids, raised them right, knew that, because of them, he was leaving the world a better place.
She wanted me to ask you if and you and Sara want to play doubles next weekend.<eos> Yeah, Caffrey, when you gonna cook me dinner?<eos> I like risotto.<eos> Look at the two of you, trying to be funny.<eos> Don't we have a case to work?<eos> We do.<eos> Turns out the numbers the source gave Helen match serial numbers of the sample packs of Zybax in the hospital database.<eos> But here's the thing.<eos> None of the samples are stocked in the pharmacies.<eos> PV reps came in and swapped them out.
This book is a forgery.<eos> Brahe lived on an island.<eos> He ran his own paper mill, primarily from tulip-tree stock, which has a very low acetic content.<eos> Look, the real manuscript could be left in a turkish bathhouse without risk of harm.<eos> The one from the planetarium turned into a shrinky dink the second it hit the air.<eos> So Roland intended for you to destroy this book.<eos> Yes.<eos> Whew.<eos> - What? - These symbols.<eos> I've seen them before -- on Savannah's anklet...
I hear you've been taking some unnecessary risks.<eos> I knew I could make that jump.<eos> I meant this afternoon with your friend.<eos> That could have ended very differently.<eos> - It was important to me.<eos> - I understand. Your human friends are important to you.<eos> And I'd do it again.<eos> You keep telling me to follow my instincts.<eos> That's what I did.<eos> I might not always understand them, but I have to learn to trust them.
Quiet.<eos> I got tired of driving up to that dog park.<eos> Found a place here in Burbank.<eos> My dogs don't know the difference.<eos> I wouldn't be so sure.<eos> Scotties are very intelligent.<eos> The victim had dog hairs on her.<eos> Could we take some hair samples from your dogs? Just for elimination purposes.<eos> My dogs wouldn't like that.<eos> Oh, we can take them off the carpet.
Wh-what if--what if it triggers the bomb?<eos> We'll never know.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello, agent Lisbon.<eos> You must do exactly as I say if you want to live.<eos> Who is this?<eos> You will go to the CBI now.<eos> Why?<eos> No questions, please.<eos> You will obtain the two ca$h in motion disks from the CBI evidence storage and bring them to me.
If it was, I wouldn't be complaining.<eos> Your dad's scared.<eos> He just wants you safe.<eos> And these fears normally resolve themselves faster than you think. Normal?<eos> Okay, home security system, fine, that's normal.<eos> But this?<eos> There's a bold choice for a window dressing.<eos> I think we found the danger room.<eos> Since 1970, the federal Witness Protection Program has relocated thousands of witnesses, some criminal, some not, to neighborhoods all across the country.<eos> Every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.

If I said I wanted you to be reborn would you laugh?<eos> (If you get 100 points: 1.<eos> Have your memories erased and be set free 2.<eos> Get the chance to revive someone you love)<eos> But you see that is my answer<eos> Kurono-kun's answer<eos> Kato!<eos> Get revenge<eos> All of you... Your comrades as well<eos> I will kill them all
We pray that she's still alive and that she makes it home to us.<eos> Roxanne, we miss you. And we love you.<eos> Anyone with any information--<eos> God fucking damn it!<eos> You fuck.<eos> Frank, is that you?<eos> What happened?<eos> - Your parents.<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah, I just saw them on the TV.
Well, I'll check on that, of course.<eos> Okay. But I didn't kill him.<eos> Okay. I'm still gonna check.<eos> As a naval officer, did he carry a service revolver?<eos> He did.<eos> Know where he kept it?<eos> He usually kept it with him.<eos> If it's enemies you're looking for, you might want to start with his job.<eos> He had problems at work?<eos> Military recruiters don't have fan clubs so much as they have families who hate them.
I'm not having a fling.<eos> Then, what?<eos> Don't tell me you've been in love with her since high school or something.<eos> Since I was nine, actually.<eos> You guys want to go after Winnie?<eos> Find another linchpin.<eos> Feisty little water bug, huh?<eos> Have fun.<eos> Since 1970, the federal Witness Protection Program has relocated thousands of witnesses, some criminal, some not, to neighborhoods all across the country.<eos> Every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.

Come on, Moz. Give it to him.<eos> And then my people could go after you, and your people could come after mine. You see where this is going?<eos> What the hell is Mozzie doing?<eos> Fighting his own war.<eos> We can end this.<eos> You could just walk away, and the suits can't touch you.<eos> What do you mean -- the suits?<eos> You talking about the feds?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Only you know them as my lip man and his boss.
- Okay.<eos> - What's up?<eos> Just got a call from Fred Zeitlin. Zeitlin?<eos> Oh, man, can't get rid of that guy, he's like herpes or a cell phone contract.<eos> Looks like Saken's been keeping tabs on Ben Kulpak's family.<eos> - What?<eos> - FBI got a hit.<eos> Nothing actionable, but the Miami field office has got an eye out for Saken's men.<eos> I'll call Ben, ought to be fun.<eos> Eight weeks until trial and he tracks them down.
I'm sorry, Louis, but give the man his due.<eos> - No no. - Easy darling, easy.<eos> It's time for your medicine.<eos> - Langston.<eos> - God damn it.<eos> Tough old bird, that one.<eos> I thought he was talking about you, ma.<eos> I'm glad you're keeping your chin up through all this.<eos> I've been through bigger scrapes.<eos> But you were taking orders then, not giving them.
I'll ask you one more time, Boychik-- you're certain it was Chayem with Waxey?<eos> The fella from your shop, yes.<eos> Let me ring you back.<eos> Mrs. Thompson, good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> What happened there?<eos> I spilled some cornflakes.<eos> Is Katy not here?<eos> She took the children to the market.<eos> Selling them, are you?
How did it go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was okay, I guess, for five minutes.<eos> How old are they?<eos> 17, twins.<eos> That's a tough age, huh?<eos> Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> You got kids?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, I wanted them.
Put... no.<eos> Put down the rocks and sit down on the dock!<eos> I'm counting to three!<eos> Ahem, what's this?<eos> It's a wedding invitation.<eos> Wha... but Frances and Mike - are getting married?<eos> - That's what it looks like, Tanya.<eos> That's why they sent out the invitations.<eos> Why didn't I get one?<eos> You don't know them as well as I do.
He told me the containers were leak-proof. I knew Enid's schedule, when she was in and out of town, and my buddy brought in his trucks one night when she was gone.<eos> Because no one would think twice about kids being born in Gibtown with webbed feet and six digits.<eos> You think I wanted this to happen?<eos> I don't think you hated the money.<eos> I think you killed Enid Granier to stop the development that would expose your little scam.<eos> I didn't kill Enid.<eos> Look, she could be prickly at times, sure, but I liked her, okay?<eos> She was a self-made millionaire. I respected that.<eos> Oh, you got a funny way of showing it, man.<eos> If -- if all I cared about was the money -- if all I cared about was the money, I could've sued the museum for my family's heirlooms and -- and sold them a long time ago.
I just wanted to talk.<eos> We're a small community who share a common bond.<eos> Why did she have to ruin it to make a profit?<eos> So you argued, and then that ended with you swinging this at her head.<eos> You can't even stand to look at yourself in the mirror.<eos> All you feel is shame -- shame of who you are, where you're from.<eos> Shame for your own grandmother. You have no idea what it's like to take care of someone like my grandmother.<eos> We go out.<eos> Everybody laughs, stares.<eos> At least the people in town try to look away, but the tourists -- They think $15 entitles them to point their cameras and make jokes.
And that's just the way it's going to be, because the only way I'd be comfortable is if I feel like I have complete control over when we have sex.<eos> I don't think I'm ever just gonna do it with you because you wanna do it.<eos> Not even if we're living together or-- or even if we're married.<eos> I want our relationship to be more than sex.<eos> I thought it was.<eos> It's only 5:30. Why are you going out at 5:30?<eos> Because that's what time Grant said his dad likes to go out. At 5:30?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And Grant's parents really want to meet you, so they're gonna come over here first, and then Grant and I are gonna go out.<eos> And leave them here with me?
Ma'am, the crack baby athletic association is a storied franchise.<eos> It was founded over 12 days ago with a firm ethical code that strictly states benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well being.<eos> I cannot offer you or your child any cash.<eos> I can, however, offer you a little bit of crack.<eos> Butters?<eos> Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.<eos> Wew, yeah, it's pretty cool, dude.<eos> Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know, or be able to do anything.<eos> Just because we are making money, doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting!<eos> It isn't exploiting them!

And he had Fruit Loops, Skittles, and bacon rinds for breakfast. Okay.<eos> We were talking about me.<eos> Lindsay, you're playing this all wrong. You're locked in mortal combat here.<eos> In order to broker the peace, you have to make concessions.<eos> Speak English, Ray Jay.<eos> - Let her meet Trent.<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> I've been sneaking some of mom's books from her office.<eos> Basic emotional negotiating strategy.<eos> Giving concessions to children makes them feel "heard."
That was the longest shower in the history of time.<eos> What do you do in there?<eos> I can't find my briefcase.<eos> What are these--what are these paintings doing here?<eos> Oh, I had to put them here 'cause this is now my office for my--
If you haven't met me first, but if you met her first, sure you will fall for her at first sight.<eos> No way, this guy will kill me for sure.<eos> Of course not.<eos> A rare kind like Linglong, sure other men will also fall for her.<eos> If more people appreciate her beauty and her goodness,<eos> I will be more than happy.<eos> You sound like a pimp.<eos> Let's go for a walk.<eos> Don't leave the fire, there will be many wolves at night.<eos> If you meet them, you will be bitten to death.
Pope's got a brother. It's in his case file.<eos> Got it.<eos> - Did he see the real killers?<eos> - You should leave this alone, lady.<eos> I can do the time.<eos> These people are evil. Killing when they want, and they're protected from on high.<eos> You keep asking questions, they'll kill me and my brother, and probably you too.<eos> Whoever these people are, you can trust me.<eos> We'll take care of you and your brother.<eos> If the killers are out there, I'm gonna find them, whether you help me or not.
Well, if I can advise you, sir, I do think you need to be careful.<eos> Of course.<eos> Have you had any contact with this man?<eos> No.<eos> Who is he? His name is Daniel Connolly.<eos> We believe he may be allied with a terrorist called Latif.<eos> He's the one who attacked the hotel in India.<eos> His stated aim is to attack the West with a weapon of mass destruction.<eos> Well, he's looking in the wrong place.<eos> We design weapon systems here but we don't house them.
Well, of course.<eos> What would a mom like you do if you found condoms in her drawer?<eos> What kind of condoms?<eos> Uh, latex.<eos> Opened or unopened?<eos> - Oh, unopened.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Unopened box of condoms that she said belonged to a friend of hers.<eos> I think I would have to trust her.<eos> After all, they were just in the drawer. She wasn't trying very hard to hide them, which makes me think she must trust me, so I would trust her.
But you would try to clamber up onto my lap and cuddle, and I know I should have cuddled you, and I blame myself for not cuddling.<eos> Well...<eos> But it's not really your fault if you weren't appealing.<eos> And you were always eating something, you know, sticky and gooey.<eos> And I just wish that I had those days back. I would so treasure them.<eos> Oh, well, that's a darling thought.<eos> I just want to sweep away this dysfunctional debris that exists between us.<eos> That's how I feel.<eos> And I think little children are sticky and gooey and unappealing.<eos> But I do think that children, even little children realize when their mothers are rejecting them.
I didn't know you were home.<eos> I-I don't like those federal agents around the house without supervision.<eos> Sure.<eos> You and Mozzie don't care much for authority.<eos> Let's just say it's an acquired distaste.<eos> Well, this place is incredible. It's like Franklin Castle. Who built it?<eos> My late husband, Byron.<eos> The police arrested him when they found some fake casino chips under the cushion.<eos> But after he came back from prison...<eos> Probably still had a lot of secrets -- Just hid them better?
- Yes.<eos> Yes. Yes. Yes.<eos> No. No. No, Shawn.<eos> Ah, excuse me?<eos> Another round of drinks for my boy Izzy there and some shots.<eos> Uh, keep it coming all night long. Big night for him. Thank you.<eos> Whizzy.<eos> Not again.<eos> Stealing the pants off a drunk guy for a urine sample-- really, Shawn?<eos> Hey, hey, hey, look, for the record, he removed them himself, okay?
Yes. Yes. Yes.<eos> No. No. No, Shawn.<eos> Ah, excuse me?<eos> Another round of drinks for my boy Izzy there and some shots.<eos> Uh, keep it coming all night long. Big night for him. Thank you.<eos> Whizzy.<eos> Not again.<eos> Stealing the pants off a drunk guy for a urine sample-- really, Shawn?<eos> Hey, hey, hey, look, for the record, he removed them himself, okay?<eos> I just hooked them with a stick and then ran off as he tried to set Gus on fire.
Just start pointing a camera, people give way and police open up, borders stop, meld,<eos> Sorry, we're filming,<eos> Hey, man, how are you?<eos> Your nephew,<eos> - You're my nephew?<eos> - Yes,<eos> I don't even known you,<eos> What the...<eos> I am Locutus of Borg,<eos> The five captains are so distinctive because of the five actors that play them, obviously,
Oh, his giant teeth is coming towards me, that sort of thing, awe and wonder,<eos> I figured Kirk would look at the moment of death and go,<eos> "Oh, my,"<eos> It was... fun,<eos> Oh, my,<eos> I'm frightened of death, I'm scared,<eos> - Are you?<eos> - Yeah,<eos> I thrust it out of my mind and probably by the dint of work 'cause I know death is over my shoulder, by the dint of work that I'm doing, I'm alive,<eos> By the passion I feel for my wife, I'm alive, by my family affairs, I hold them so close,
But, uh, you know, after law school, I just... I needed, uh... change.<eos> You know, so I decided to move to New York, and<eos> I loved it in the city.<eos> But I woke up dreaming about the sunset, and, uh, having sand beneath my feet, and I realized that BlueBell, and, uh, Lemon... they're who I am.<eos> You know, can't really be my best self without them.<eos> You're a lucky guy.<eos> A girl you feel the same way about as a town.<eos> The papers?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Uh, I'll mail them when I get back to New York.
I don't know who my characters are anymore.<eos> I don't know who I am anymore.<eos> No, Lennox, you cannot let Skimpole win.<eos> I already told all my friends you're taking him down.<eos> All of my street cred is riding on this.<eos> Yeah well, how can I call myself a writer if I can't even organize a simple 200-page novel?<eos> You know, when I'm editing my digital films I use index cards.<eos> All the great filmmakers use them--<eos> Quentin Tarantino, Tyler Perry.<eos> What you do is you take the scenes or plot points and you write them on a card and then put them on a bulletin board and move them around.
- Now go upstairs and get some sleep.<eos> - No no, I can't.<eos> I gotta proofread this.<eos> Otherwise Skimpole will win.<eos> You see?<eos> I told you those kids need you, whether you know it or not.<eos> I mean you really are an important influence in their lives...<eos> - As chilling as that may be.<eos> - I guess I am.<eos> I mean, so what if you don't pack any of their lunches or take them to school or show up at their sporting events or volunteer to chaperone any of their school trips like the one coming up to Washington D.C.?
It's hard being married to a cop.<eos> Dan just kept doing deep-cover drug assignments, disappearing on us.<eos> The job was more important to him than we were.<eos> That is not true, Nicole.<eos> It sucks you in.<eos> And it's who he is. Ah.<eos> I know.<eos> I just feel so alone all the time.<eos> I mean, even-- Even before we split up, I felt like a single mother, raising our kids without him.<eos> And I know that he loves them.
Let me tell you something, Cathy, you go before you hit 20 weeks, you are shit out of luck. You can't get a birth or a death certificate.<eos> It's like you've, um-- it's like you've been wiped off the books.<eos> You never existed.<eos> Thankfully, the folks at The Twin Cities Leader took pity on my plight, and they also took my 20 bucks.<eos> I know this is an incredibly hard time.<eos> You want to know hard?<eos> You try going to the preemie ward.<eos> They have babies in there the size of a fucking acorn.<eos> But they get to live.<eos> They even have volunteers to hold them so they--they-- they grow faster.
I'm looking for evidence of a payoff around the time the plans were approved.<eos> No luck.<eos> But I did find a paypal payment of $100,000 from Franklin Turner to an unidentified recipient, but that was only three weeks ago.<eos> - I'll follow up on that.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> In the meantime... I know what you'll be arguing in court.<eos> - You found something?<eos> - I did.<eos> Franklin Turner lives in the Calabasas high school district, and his kids were assigned to the new campus.<eos> But last week, he pulled them out of that school system and enrolled them in a school in Encino, 20 minutes from his house.
- Of course.<eos> - Mr. Gibson... You saw the lead report on your boss' laptop?<eos> - Is that correct?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Approach the bench, Mr. Gibson.<eos> Ms. Bingum, you too.<eos> Will you hand me your glasses?<eos> How long have you had this prescription?<eos> Since I was 5.<eos> Geez, when was the last time you cleaned them?
Okay, we don't have a lot of time, so I'm just gonna lay it out.<eos> The Skitters know where we are, and there's a good chance they're gonna attack.<eos> We all hoped we could hang on until the strike team made it back.<eos> That's too risky now, so I've decided to evacuate the civilians.<eos> We're gonna walk them out through the tunnel behind the auditorium.<eos> Once through, they'll move west, away from the city.<eos> If the Skitters have the scent, they'll be crawling all over this area.<eos> It's not gonna be easy to get around them.<eos> That's why I'm gonna stay behind with a small group of volunteers.<eos> If the aliens attack, we'll draw their fire, keep them focused on us, maybe open up a window for the civilians to escape.
- By themselves?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's suicide.<eos> Weaver's got to know that.<eos> I think that's why they sent me back.<eos> I guess they just can't live with themselves if they didn't at least try.<eos> You just rode all the way in from Boston and you didn't run into any trouble?<eos> No, the roads were clear.<eos> Why? Scott's jamming idea worked.<eos> It could be the aliens are withdrawing their forces, trying to figure out what just hit them.
Okay.<eos> What about Weaver?<eos> Last time I saw him, he was heading towards party central there.<eos> Figured on account I didn't hear anything that sounded like a boom, I'm guessing he didn't make it.<eos> The only thing I can't figure out is why the spidery -- easy, easy, easy.<eos> I got him.<eos> The spidery bastards didn't finish us off.<eos> This the old man's radio rig?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It seems to have kept them off of us for a while.
You think you can build me some makeup tables?<eos> For you, I won't sleep until it's done.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> You obviously have no control over the situation.<eos> Then what the hell is Jason doing back here?<eos> Hey, champ.<eos> - Just get home? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Hey, do we have any pretzels?<eos> Um, Melissa took them with her on the trip.
It's the four of you that are keeping her memory alive.<eos> Please say yes.<eos> I won't.<eos> I can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because it's freaky!<eos> And weird!<eos> We can't just march around in her clothes.<eos> It feels like we just buried her.<eos> Alison never wore them.
- I hope you don't mind.<eos> We used your first name.<eos> We like the alliteration.<eos> Cupcakes...<eos> Cathy.<eos> And cancer!<eos> We didn't think about that.<eos> On the house.<eos> Seriously, Washington had wooden false teeth.<eos> He didn't even have to brush them.
No, but I did figure out which poison didn't.<eos> Strychnine. See, the thing with poison is you almost have to know what you're looking for to run the tests.<eos> Or what you're looking at.<eos> I know what I'm looking at.<eos> Intense cyanosis of the mucus membrane.<eos> Irritation of the mouth, esophagus, and stomach, which indicates it was something he ingested, not inhaled or injected.<eos> And, since it was something he ingested, there's a good chance that the substance was colorless and probably odorless.<eos> That all you got?<eos> I'm telling you, I'm running tests.<eos> It fee like you're walking them.
Two please.<eos> OK.<eos> My father was Binky's nephew.<eos> They weren't particularly close, but he asked that I drop in on her, make sure there was nothing she wanted.<eos> Nothing a cleaning company couldn't sort out.<eos> I was surprised to find a private detective on my great aunt's payroll.<eos> The woman can hardly pay her gas bill.<eos> You think I'm ripping Binky off?<eos> Personally, I think cats are the spawn of Satan.<eos> - But that woman loves them.
Almost anywhere.<eos> The Met?<eos> I thought you'd be an Assistant Commissioner by now.<eos> He's happy here, George.<eos> He's really happy.<eos> I don't think London's the right place for Danny.<eos> Here you are, Danny. Mm.<eos> What you got there, Danny?<eos> He loves his aeroplanes.<eos> He's not going to touch them, Danny, are you, George?
And do you know who the arresting officers were?<eos> Aye.<eos> Sergeant Molloy? Aye.<eos> Do you know him well?<eos> He's up here that often he should have a season ticket.<eos> Well, if either of your lads turn up, would you call me at my office on this number, please?<eos> So.<eos> On the 19th of March, China dies of head injuries, delivered to... Are you listening?<eos> Delivered to hospital by Sergeant Molloy.<eos> The very next day, Sergeant Molloy arrests the Blackburn lads and their father hasn't seen them since.
And they have a record as long as my arm as vandals and all round public nuisances. Correct?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> No. Not correct.<eos> There are no records of any inquiries into any offences in the last three years by either of these boys.<eos> So, once again, why are you lying?<eos> Why are you interested in the Blackburns?<eos> Here's how it works, Sergeant,<eos> I ask the questions, you give the answers.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, sir.<eos> Why didn't you charge them with the wrecking of the kitchen?
We call it the confinement block, but actually it's what was the punishment block.<eos> It's not used these days, thank God. Well, not by us anyway.<eos> But by somebody else?<eos> Look, I just want you to know that I think using violence against kids is barbaric.<eos> My dad belted me when I was a kid.<eos> Didn't do me any harm.<eos> That's a matter of opinion.<eos> Your wife says you're upping sticks and moving south. Why's that?<eos> Because I came into this to set children free.<eos> And instead I lock them up and teach them how to play murderball.
And no-one knows.<eos> Because they don't want to.<eos> Mate, have you seen this girl?<eos> No, mate.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks anyway.<eos> We can find her, can't we?<eos> We've got Mr Smith.<eos> We find aliens.<eos> We help them get home, right across the universe.
Whoo! Go, Hammet!<eos> Mm... yeah, sure.<eos> That's the cheer that kicks off every football game.<eos> That's right.<eos> Is it possible that the school just didn't want the evidence to "bear out" because Vince is on the football team, the football team that we all bow down to?<eos> Objection.<eos> Withdrawn.<eos> No more questions.<eos> All right, uh, I've re-cataloged the assets.<eos> I organized them by value and color-coded everything Jenna requested the first go-around.
Uh, you know, I didn't tell you this, but after that toga party almost burned the house down, the National Board demanded Deb's membership.<eos> What? !<eos> That's horrible.<eos> Wait, why didn't you say anything? Well, getting kicked out would have just crushed her, so I made a deal with the board.<eos> They'd allow Deb to stay if you confiscated her pin.<eos> Look at this.<eos> - Not now, Fred.<eos> - No, but this is odd.<eos> The... the files from the postcard mailhouse are arranged by zip code.<eos> Right. They cluster them by region.
I don't understand.<eos> He wants me to spend tomorrow with him and his family at the tennis club.<eos> We're gonna play tennis and have lunch and then play some more tennis and then go over to his house and go swimming in their indoor pool and then have a cookout.<eos> And he wants my parents to the cookout.<eos> My parents.<eos> So, rather than have him and his family spend time with you and your family, you'd rather just break up with him?<eos> I have to.<eos> I don't know how else to get out of it.<eos> And what's the point of putting myself through my parents meeting anyone's parents when I doubt this is the guy I'm gonna marry?<eos> It's bad enough I had to let Frank meet them.

Let's go!<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> Stop! She's already gone.<eos> It's a trap.<eos> (Charlie) I'm very impressed, angels.<eos> Oswald didn't get away with a single counterfeit dollar.<eos> But she did get away.<eos> - Only for now. - We'll get her some day.<eos> Well, the best part is, Bosley's fake criminal record has been expunged.<eos> Oswald's bogus warrants look convincing until you cross-reference them.
- Aye, indeed.<eos> Good.<eos> The fragrant Mrs. Moore.<eos> Now, where's the chap that was grabbing you?<eos> Hello, old boy.<eos> Dougal.<eos> Morgan Freeman.<eos> No, you're Morgan Freeman. I'm Kevin Costner.<eos> How did you get my address, Mr. Costner?<eos> I found this postcard in your old clothes when I was throwing them away.
Now, there must be some reason why you would want to be involved with a man with limitations.<eos> Limitations.<eos> I see.<eos> You know, Tom's heart doesn't have any limitations.<eos> I know he really cares about me and my children, and I know I can trust him.<eos> And he's funny and he's sweet.<eos> Ugh, okay, look, I might as well tell you. Surprised Tom didn't and eventually someone's going to.<eos> Hmm. I divorced my husband because he beat me up.<eos> Really beat me up. In front of the children.<eos> He completely humiliated me, and he terrified them. And then he took them and he put them in a car and drove away.
It's good that we're getting on with things.<eos> I don't regret what happened, Rachael.<eos> You know what?<eos> You don't tell me what to do.<eos> Did they have an argument?<eos> You've obviously heard that I've split up with Jake.<eos> You split with Jake? !<eos> There's two guys.<eos> If everything was simple and you just had to pick one, could you?<eos> D'you at least know where you left them? I remember... trees.
You're serious.<eos> Where did you say you were?<eos> Home.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> My wife has a yoga class on Friday nights.<eos> I look after our two kids.<eos> How old are they?<eos> Three and five.<eos> Not really going to swear you an alibi, are they?<eos> No. So probably I took them with me while I went to Pinnock Woods and murdered a schoolgirl I was rather fond of. Do you think?
So when can I leave?<eos> Your C.T. confirmed a small pulmonary embolism.<eos> But after the warfarin stabilizes you, we can stop the heparin and get you out of here.<eos> And that's it?<eos> We'll monitor your platelet function, but other than that and a ban on contact sports, yeah.<eos> More flowers.<eos> Are you going for the hospital record here?<eos> They're from my friends.<eos> Sent out of obligation and pity.<eos> Maybe I underestimated them.
I did find one odd thing, though.<eos> This black van, license plate number Q70-413.<eos> Okay. What about it?<eos> Well, it was totaled and junked by an insurance company two years ago.<eos> That van has no current registration.<eos> - So it shouldn't be on the road.<eos> - Right.<eos> You said Clay had a lot of cash businesses?<eos> Anything to turn a buck.<eos> Well, he sold auto parts at the flea market. I wonder where he got them from.
The guy's been there for you your whole life. You could be kind of a dick not to, wouldn't you?<eos> Well, this is your chance to be there for Blake, Shane.<eos> Tell me where the gun is so I can use it to nail the guy that killed him.<eos> Hey, Ed. I've got another gun for you to log in.<eos> from the junkyard, too?<eos> No, but it is the gun that set everything into motion.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's the gun that killed Coach Ryan.<eos> The serial numbers have been filed off just like all the others, but you know the one thing that the person that filed off those numbers didn't know?<eos> Hydrochloric acid can make them reappear.
- What is she, Estonian?<eos> - Canadian.<eos> Well, I knew she was something.<eos> God, I've missed this town.<eos> - It's a city.<eos> - Albuquerque?<eos> Keep telling yourself that.<eos> Just get in the car.<eos> Since 1970, the Federal Witness Protection Program has relocated thousands of witnesses, some criminal, some not, to neighborhoods all across the country.<eos> Every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, distinguishing them from the rest of the general population, and that is, somebody wants them dead.
Or maybe it didn't happen at all.<eos> Your husband withdrew that cash to pay off his blackmailer and now you're covering for him, isn't that right? No.<eos> I bought the Eames- Yes, with cash that had nothing to do with the money that was taken out of your husband's account.<eos> That's not true.<eos> You withdraw cash all the time. You said so yourself.<eos> Yes, but<eos> - So you thought that you could pass off his cash withdrawal as one of your own.<eos> - And by trying to link these two entirely separate things, you'd hope that it would explain everything away. Only the sums don't quite add up, do they, Mrs Williams?<eos> None of it quite adds up, does it?<eos> Honestly! You prep them, you coach them on their answers, hours and hours getting them ready so they won't freeze in the box and what happens?
They pick up johns down by the underpass.<eos> Look, you're putting off the punters.<eos> I'm rattling, as it is.<eos> We could go somewhere warm and cosy.<eos> Like the station.<eos> Look, all I saw on the landing last night was a couple of kids.<eos> 12, 13 tops.<eos> One of them asked me for business.<eos> Right little cocky wanker, he was.<eos> Can you describe them?
Everyone on the estate knows who he is and what he does.<eos> I didn't wanna be in his gang no more.<eos> You were in his gang?<eos> Does this gang have a name?<eos> TKC.<eos> But I never hurt no-one.<eos> All I did was move the food.<eos> OK.<eos> Go on.<eos> He got us to collect packages and run them out to the shottas.
That would certainly seem to reduce the margin for error.<eos> Ms Rumsfield, your application is refused.<eos> My client will be relying on a defence of non-insane automatism.<eos> I don't understand!<eos> We know he killed them!<eos> He's not even denying it.<eos> So why isn't he pleading guilty?<eos> It all comes down to intention.<eos> To get a verdict of murder, we have to show that Lucas Boyd meant to kill your parents.<eos> He stabbed them over a dozen times.

So we have a week to corroborate Nancy's story.<eos> Listen, I couldn't have done it without you.<eos> You wouldn't even know where to look without me.<eos> You know what nobody likes? Hmm?<eos> Nobody likes a show-off.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yeah, he's here.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> The files are in conference room C.<eos> Why wouldn't they bring them to my cubicle?
And then, a day later, word of their FDA approval got out and the stock shot up to $30 million?<eos> She purchased that stock for your clients, Bert Kimble and Dean Morello, based on a tip sheet handed out by your clients.<eos> An allegation that tainted their reputation, yet the DOJ looked into it and found nothing.<eos> That doesn't mean it didn't happen.<eos> I'll turn your client over in person. No handcuffs.<eos> It will be a country club prison.<eos> And I'll make sure that she's processed as gently as possible. As long as she admits that she made this trade of her own accord.<eos> It's a crappy deal wrapped in pretty paper.<eos> Why aren't we dealing with the Department of Justice?<eos> Because the DOJ wanted to put you behind bars for seven years, and I got them down to 11 months.
But that doesn't always mean that he's going to be on top.<eos> Because another truth is, is that I can't always count on Harvey to listen to me.<eos> But I can count on you. Yeah.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> So you keep doing what you're doing, Louis, and you're going to be just fine.<eos> And if he doesn't know it already, I promise, Harvey is going to understand just how valuable you are to me.<eos> You know, next week, there's a revival of Cats. No.<eos> Nice touch.<eos> Tickets to the Yankee game.<eos> Found them on my desk. Can't wait.
Yeah.<eos> You sleeping enough?<eos> Only the hours you keep with that job.<eos> It is a bit weird with the sleeping patterns. But I'm good at sleeping.<eos> You're happy?<eos> I'm happy. Life's...<eos> Let me see.<eos> I don't know that I can believe you.<eos> I'm dead happy.<eos> OK I love my work and I love my mates, well maybe not love them...
Hey.<eos> Where you headed?<eos> Your dad gave me the afternoon off.<eos> I'm going to meet chandra at the airport.<eos> I didn't know she was flying in.<eos> It's a last-minute thing.<eos> She's bringing my kids.<eos> You must be excited.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> I'm bringing them here to the fair, and to meet you, too.
Well, I've got rounds. You?<eos> Oh, um, I think I'll just stick around and finish charting Mrs. Whitlock's angina.<eos> All right.<eos> No acute angina.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is that a fashion statement? Is it?<eos> Well, that's a fair question.<eos> You know, my great-grandfather was a moonshiner.<eos> My grandfather was a tax man.<eos> You know, he'd find the stills, break them up.
Pick a card.<eos> Any card.<eos> What does this have to do with our property-fraud scam?<eos> You'll have the whole thing cracked before I can say "ta-da."<eos> Pick a deed.<eos> Now what?<eos> Now I take these 51 deeds and figure out which one you took.<eos> It's not magic. It's math.<eos> We go through the title company's records, match them with the realtor's, and figure out which one is missing.
We got something from the legal papers Selena gave Elizabeth.<eos> The lawyer's name was a bogus I.D. We tracked to this guy. Look familiar?<eos> It's the emcee from the auction.<eos> Gerald Jameson.<eos> Yeah, he hosts dating events worldwide.<eos> Never stays in one place for more than a year.<eos> Always changes the name and charity of his latest auction.<eos> That's a great setup.<eos> He puts on these auctions, lines up the suitors...<eos> She knocks them down.
So nice.<eos> So how did you know that he was depressed and not just sad?<eos> What Jono was experiencing... lingering malaise for no reason...<eos> - that's depression. - Okay.<eos> Sadness is temporary.<eos> It has a direct cause. A, uh, setback, or a disappointment.<eos> Got it.<eos> So which one are you feeling about your parents?<eos> That's sadness.<eos> I'm sad about losing them.
You're right.<eos> Hey, can I ask you something?<eos> What's your engine design philosophy?<eos> Perfectly balanced power and durability. Okay.<eos> Why don't you favor power like Bronson does?<eos> Because drivers are limited to eight engines a season, and Bronson's don't last.<eos> Well, so you would stack your engines up against Bronson's, then?<eos> Uh, I have stacked my engines up against Bronson and everyone else's in the world, and mine win. Why?<eos> Because I make sure they're designed better than anyone else's in the world from the day that they're conceived to the day they're born.<eos> And that's why people buy them.
Start with the man part, just be a man first.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Keep going, thief, this is fun.<eos> Well, the fun's about to end, Jean Claude, because while we've been standing around chatting, our other master spy has been effortlessly breaching your compound's security. ♪ ♪<eos> I'm good, I'm good.<eos> He's heartless, cruel...<eos> I'm so sorry, fishies, about your pond.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. You think your security men are the best, top-notch?<eos> I admit I do.<eos> Well, our spy is currently slicing through them like a hot knife through butter.
But how are we going to do this?<eos> I mean, we got to start over. It's okay.<eos> We'll get new clients and new missions.<eos> And we haven't lost everything.<eos> We still have Castle and the store.<eos> The Buy More.<eos> The Buy More.<eos> The Buy More.<eos> We use the store to support the spy team.<eos> We take Buy Mores' profits, put them into Carmichael Industries until both companies can make money.
Plaintiff number two in our case, Eleanor Baker.<eos> She also happens to be plaintiff number seven in Jones versus Norco.<eos> He's recycling plaintiffs.<eos> That's very green of you.<eos> Mr. Church?<eos> Mr. Specter has his documents, I have mine showing that prior to FDA approval of his drug, Quentin Sainz's company was on the verge of bankruptcy.<eos> Three months after that drug hit the market, sales rocketed to $38 million a quarter, which is clear financial motive for falsifying clinical trials.<eos> Now, Your Honor, does that sound like a groundless claim to you?<eos> I told you to go over those financials.<eos> I asked him five times, he never gave them to me.
What's going on?<eos> I don't think I can go.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It'll be great.<eos> I even got us onion-flavored snacks for the road.<eos> And these things.<eos> What changed?<eos> Remember what you said.<eos> This isn't giving up on our dreams.<eos> It's just making them happen in a different place.
How quaint.<eos> I mean, why do you even hold on to that phone if you're not gonna answer it?<eos> Because I don't have to explain how I got it.<eos> But I am too intrigued by our mysterious "Ivy"<eos> to just toss it away. Well, we could always lie, say we found it on the street.<eos> How are we gonna find her?<eos> Look. There are no names in the phone, only numbers.<eos> And there was no tag for her at the party.<eos> Well, maybe she was just a crasher. You know, a nobody. Mm.<eos> Nobodies don't hide their friends. They advertise them.
Blair, darling, I have to confess that, um, I may have been the one to put the idea of a contract into Beatrice's head.<eos> I was just bragging about you, and it didn't matter where you lived. No one could keep you from being your own person.<eos> And that is part of why you will be... A wonderful mother.<eos> Thank you for saying that.<eos> I know this isn't what you wanted for me. Hmm.<eos> At least not yet.<eos> These things happen when they happen.<eos> It's the first lesson of being a parent.<eos> Children don't do... What you want them to do all the time when you want them to do it.<eos> But you love them... Anyway.
There's no other way.<eos> It was bad luck if you had leprosy.<eos> Later on, Some western missionaries Had mercy on those miserable people.<eos> They took the risk of getting infection and came to took care of them on those islands.<eos> They helped them till their final days Because They felt they were abandoned by the world.<eos> I want to ask What are those things<eos> They are golden pagodas.<eos> Those lepers hoped to be buried at home.<eos> So they would be incinerated after their death.<eos> They hoped they family would take them home someday and bury their ashes near home.
Two-Buck Chuck and three rolls of toilet paper.<eos> Romance lives. - She's more secretive about this one.<eos> Yes.<eos> It hurts your feelings that she's not confiding in you.<eos> - I'm sorry, sweetheart.<eos> - I don't care. I don't need to know every detail of her personal life, right?<eos> But she usually tells you.<eos> - He seems charming. But, you know, those are the ones you have to worry about.<eos> I got a really weird vibe from him.<eos> He was unpacking boxes. When he saw me, he just closed them all up.
All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle.<eos> I don't see anything.<eos> Give it a second to load.<eos> Whenever you're ready, ATT!<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> This is us here.<eos> To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department.<eos> According to their twitter feed, they're out of sunblock, which means they'll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma.<eos> That's our edge.<eos> All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won't know what hit them!
You know, you should also know that-- that Kamal here works for kip's law firm.<eos> Oh, God. I don't care.<eos> So-- seems everyone at the law firm is sleeping with each other anyway.<eos> Well...<eos> All right.<eos> But I don't want Gina to get into any trouble, of course, 'cause this is sort of a breach of confidentiality.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm just adjusting the flowers.<eos> Oh, for the shot? Do they need to look better?<eos> Yeah, they were out of position, so I just wanted to put them in the frame.
- I do, if I want a good flutter board.<eos> - Look, I feel bad I started all this with a birth certificate.<eos> Oh, no, you gave me the gift of perspective, a second chance at life.<eos> Yeah, but it's kind of affecting your work around here, and I'm not just talking about getting marshmallow goop on your confession records.<eos> I agree.<eos> - That's why I'll stop working.<eos> - Good.<eos> What?<eos> You said to grab life by the privates.<eos> I'm grabbing them, Burt, and I'm not letting go.
Ugh, the boss wants to see me. I'm worried.<eos> Even though I've been there almost a year, I'm still the new chick.<eos> That's good. New chick's always hot.<eos> Look, I could use some help.<eos> How long are you home for this time?<eos> Oh, probably seven days, then we're off to Costa Rica shooting our spring catalog. What do you need?<eos> Can you drive Eve to soccer? Soccer.<eos> That's just Europe's covert war for the hearts and minds of America's kids.<eos> We're scrimmaging the boys to make us tougher.<eos> Well, the boys aren't that tough. I've seen them play.
Everything you've done in the past few days has been pretty stupid.<eos> You almost burned down your apartment.<eos> And, Penny, oh, my God.<eos> Is your breakdown sponsored by Dreyer's?<eos> Look, you're not gonna turn into an old spinster just because you bought a condo, which, by the way, is not cursed.<eos> Okay, yeah, Jane?<eos> Then you want to explain about all the cats?<eos> Wait.<eos> You found my cats?<eos> I live next door. I've trained them to crawl into vents and open windows.
They all conspired so Judge Gunner could get you on his own and offer you favours for sex.<eos> You actually expect us to believe this?<eos> Men don't always think with their heads.<eos> So they'd do anything, right?<eos> Like Tom Hartson cheating on his fiancee? Yeah.<eos> Or DS Casey, breaking his oath and sleeping with a victim?<eos> Exactly.<eos> And the other men that gave you money. Men are all after one thing, right?<eos> You said it.<eos> And that makes them fair game?
But don't you threaten me.<eos> I followed procedure to the letter and you have no basis for a lawsuit.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Not about this.<eos> But if you don't think I have a basis for all the shit you've pulled over the years I've been here,<eos> think again.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay?<eos> How'd it go?<eos> I don't know if you had plans tonight, but you're going to cancel them and help me put my office back together.
So you still have an open use-of-force complaint?<eos> And Chief Pope cannot shut me down.<eos> Well, then Maria Flores may be an excellent witness for you.<eos> If I can find her.<eos> Hello, everyone.<eos> Hey, Gavin.<eos> Oh, Gavin, um, I'm so sorry.<eos> I forgot you were coming.<eos> We've just been hit with a possible murder-for-hire case, and we're just going to have to reschedule.<eos> Well, dear, what's the point in confirming our appointments if you're not going to keep them?
And he-- the most wonderful thing,<eos> I've been on the phone with him.<eos> But is that Chinese?<eos> What is that name?<eos> Wonderful, wonderful-- It's Vietnamese.<eos> Vietnamese.<eos> So you have a Vietnamese child?<eos> Well, you know how I love things oriental.<eos> I love them.<eos> I have oriental rugs in my home. And I've always had them.
What do you mean by that?<eos> Well, it's--I'll put my therapist cap on for a moment.<eos> It just seems clear to me that you've been beaten down by I don't know what.<eos> Maybe your culture or your parents don't value what you do or you're misunderstood or no doubt, the child of people from another culture entirely who don't respect the "artist" in you, who are very oppressive,<eos> And it seems like it would be a very diffic--<eos> Are you all right?<eos> - I'm okay.<eos> - Do you need a tissue? No, no, no.<eos> I'm gonna be--I'm gonna be--<eos> Doesn't she have tissue on her desk or did she take them with her?

No, no, no.<eos> I'm gonna be--I'm gonna be--<eos> Doesn't she have tissue on her desk or did she take them with her?<eos> I guess she took them with her.
I know you're gonna find this hard to believe but this is the first time I've ever been in a restaurant by myself.<eos> - Get outta here.<eos> - It's true.<eos> It turns out, I'm afraid to be alone.<eos> I was afraid to go to camp,<eos> I never went to Europe... well, epcot.<eos> I never lived alone.<eos> I went from living with my parents, to living with my girlfriend, to being married for 18 years... until my husband came out.<eos> Wait, wait, you were married 18 years and you didn't know he was gay?<eos> I'm sure there must've been signs, but I didn't see them.
Very well.<eos> Sentencing will be in two weeks.<eos> He kills three people, and gets manslaughter?<eos> Well, gotta say, guys, you prosecuted the hell out of that one.<eos> Three?<eos> I only know of two murders he was involved in.<eos> Gordon McKenzie at the scene and Michael Coombes.<eos> He killed James Harper as well.<eos> And you can prove that, can you?<eos> Got any witnesses who put them together the day Harper died?
I couldn't imagine keeping a secret like that for so long--<eos> From us, from my dad.<eos> And to know that she has another child out there, especially after Leo...<eos> She was pretty traumatized by it.<eos> I know.<eos> I mean, of course she was.<eos> Who wouldn't be?<eos> And listen, about earlier... I'm sorry for coming down on you so hard.<eos> Erica, I'm not saying I don't wanna have kids.<eos> I'm saying I want them when we're ready.
Thank you.<eos> I'll be waiting in my car, just 'round the corner.<eos> Ohh, cousin Fred!<eos> Look at you!<eos> Look at you!<eos> You are the picture of health.<eos> And, cousin Tanya, you know you are not supposed to be here!<eos> I know!<eos> And that security guard was so nice to tell you that I was here.<eos> Your mama sent you some pecan sandies, and you better get in this car before I eat them all up.
I'm not gonna get in any trouble, am I?<eos> You gonna go out of your way to piss me off?<eos> - No!<eos> - Then no.<eos> Well, I was delivering a truckload full of totally legit alcohol to a warehouse down by the river.<eos> And at Granville, I had to stop at the intersection 'cause it was blocked.<eos> And before I could turn the truck around, these guys, they pulled me out of the cab.<eos> Well, your face looks like it got more than pulled from a truck.<eos> Look, I didn't give them any trouble whatsoever, and for no reason at all, they started wailing on me.<eos> I'd be dead if their buddy hadn't pulled up and stopped them.
Do you know where Church Street is?<eos> Uh, you're on Church Street.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> See...you're standing right here.<eos> Just walk. Shh, shh.<eos> Just walk.<eos> Come on.<eos> This way.<eos> Reid and JJ went to the local thrift shop and found Abby's clothes.<eos> So he sold them.
He won't he to suffer through years of ALS.<eos> Or put a huge financial burden on his entire family.<eos> Talk about God's perfect plan. This is brilliant.<eos> Look, I-I know I'm a doctor, okay?<eos> We're supposed to save lives, but...<eos> You won't get an argument from me.<eos> You might get one from me.<eos> Our kids are in the hall.<eos> Which one do you want to see first?<eos> - You wouldn't drag them in here.
- Nothing's so important than to make his life worthwhile.<eos> Look...<eos> I got this from him, this fantastic, fantastic... what is that, a rubber band ball?<eos> No, this is a paperweight, - but you see, it says...<eos> - It's a rubber band ball.<eos> It's as light as gossamer, and that's the irony of it.<eos> It's a paperweight that absolutely has no weight whatsoever.<eos> Well, maybe you could switch it out for the chelini he just made off with.<eos> - That's meant for me.<eos> - And you see it... Little orange stickers, I've put them on the bottom of all the things that are going to be mine.
Bars.<eos> Yeah? And rub horns with them.<eos> Well... Anyway, it just doesn't make any sense.<eos> It's ridiculous. Right, right.<eos> No. Well, of course it's nonsense.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Just like all dreams are.<eos> Just an assembly of nonsense.<eos> Well, the dream went on and on, and, you know, it went back to when she was a child, and everyone was mean to her.<eos> Well, children are--are mean.<eos> Anyway, you know, and I don't really trust them as a judge of character as it is, so...
Let's have it back.<eos> The jewelry.<eos> Let's have it back.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I--there were some jewels that I received anonymously in a package, but I've since sold them and put that money into gold.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> That jewelry... Has history on it.<eos> Every bauble, every bangle, every bead belches history!<eos> Back to where the Lachmans were pursued by Cossacks into the shtetl in the pogrom.<eos> They had these jewels with them, and they transported them back to me to give to you which you've now sold, and now that I want them back!
- Ah, summer's fierce here, isn't it?<eos> Wouldn't wish it on a hottentot.<eos> No one much seems to mind.<eos> Always something to keep you busy in New York,<eos> I expect.<eos> Yes.<eos> Very lively.<eos> All right then.<eos> Where are the children?<eos> The girls took them down to the beach.
Believe me, when you see this place, you're gonna know what I'm taking about.<eos> I wanna do this.<eos> And I don't wanna do it without you.<eos> The parents of the kid that you hit intend to press charges.<eos> It's not my first offense.<eos> It's gonna be so great.<eos> Now Max, if you feel like you wanna make a comment in class, you got to remember to raise your hand and wait for the teacher to call on you, okay? - She will.<eos> - Yeah, absolutely.<eos> And if you wanna introduce yourself and say, "Hi, I'm Max Braverman," you know, to meet the kids, I'm sure there's so many nice kids here.<eos> Yeah, and if you smile a little bit, that'll help them know that you wanna be their friend.
I've got a house, I've got kids.<eos> - I can't risk this. - Yeah, I have that too.<eos> Listen, I think this is a really interesting idea.<eos> I hope you do it, and I hope it works out for you, but I can't do it with you.<eos> I won't ask anyone to stand on their desk.<eos> And then we're going into the romantics.<eos> Rest assured, I will not make it too romantic.<eos> They don't need any help in that department.<eos> I expect a lot from your kids, and I want them to work hard, but I also want them to have fun.<eos> I get them for nine months, and I want them to look back on it with fun.
I was his backup, Pete.<eos> Now it's important you not make any sudden moves.<eos> If the hat gets knocked off, the receiver could pull in a massive amount of static.<eos> The downside.<eos> Yes.<eos> One night an audience member pulled off Coco's fez and Raymond Fraser was never the same.<eos> Mr. Mental went mental?<eos> Just keep the hat on the dog's head.<eos> Claudia, you're gonna write down the license plate numbers.<eos> As soon as you bark them out.
The thing is... Back then, I just... I just wanted so much.<eos> I wanted to do so much. And I couldn't let anything get in my way, including you.<eos> Maybe if I hadn't been so headstrong...<eos> Who knows?<eos> Yeah. But hey. Look at you now, Major.<eos> Um, got your Cinderella dress.<eos> I've never seen you look happier.<eos> I-I think-- I think things worked out exactly the way they were supposed to.<eos> Amanda, have you seen my parents?<eos> I can't find them anywhere.
You think that guy looks like me, with the hair and the square jaw and the Captain America attitude?<eos> Please.<eos> I'm so much cooler than that.<eos> It's the weirdest thing.<eos> My folks, they just disappeared.<eos> We'll find them, Michael, all right?<eos> Nobody gets in or out of here until we do.<eos> I'm gonna go look for them.<eos> You just stay here and do whatever it is that brides do, okay?<eos> And when we find them, at exactly 1500 hours, come hell or high water or in-laws or exes, we are getting married.
We haven't gotten that far.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Rebekah doesn't know the real story.<eos> I thought I told you to leave twice.<eos> How do you know that Mikael killed your mother?<eos> Nik was there. He told me.<eos> He lied to you.<eos> And how do you know that?<eos> The cave where you carved your family's names is covered in symbols, the story of your family...<eos> How your parents arrived, how they made peace, the spell that turned them into vampires, and this.
George, it's Zoe.<eos> Can you meet me at my office later?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Magnolia!<eos> Magnolia!<eos> You see, Lemon darling, I never had a doubt that you would win that pageant!<eos> I don't know why I was so scared!<eos> Of course I won!<eos> Just like you!<eos> And I'm gonna go on, and I'm gonna be head cheerleader like you, and I'm gonna find a handsome husband, maybe a doctor or a lawyer, and we're gonna have two children and raise them here in bluebell.
The door locks automatically, Austin.<eos> Hello?<eos> ! Can someone please let us in?<eos> Hello!<eos> You know, maybe you shouldn't have such loud parties.<eos> Be quiet, and help me get back into my house!<eos> (grunting)<eos> Okay, uh, listen, Leila, if you get bored, we could totally go home.<eos> Why? I thought these guys were big friends of this girl, Bree.<eos> Well, they are, but I don't really know them that well.
Everyone except Melissa.<eos> Her mom's been worried about her since Nick died.<eos> Took her out of town for a while.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Who invited Jake?<eos> Well, he's a part of the circle.<eos> Jake was attacked just like the rest of us.<eos> I keep feeling like the witch hunters are going to come after us again.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> At the shipyard, I heard them say they were leaving town.
Hold up.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> This is all sorts of wrong.<eos> Those are nice wheels.<eos> Tell you what, when this is over,<eos> I'm stealing those rims.<eos> Tell the kids I said hi.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Bobby, we got eyes on them.
Which was an engine.<eos> But not any engine.<eos> This was an engine...<eos> There's an interesting story behind it.<eos> When BMW bought the rights to the Rolls-Royce name in the late 20th century, they had the opportunity to create the ultimate luxury car for the 21st century.<eos> And they thought, "Maybe we ought to give it the ultimate engine."<eos> So let's give it something like a nine-litre V16 engine.<eos> And, unbelievably, they made three or four of these engines and they tested them. They got them up to speed and they had unbelievable power and torque figures.<eos> And then, at the last minute, they thought, "Hmm, might be a bit over the top."<eos> But they had developed these engines and they'd stuck them in the warehouse somewhere.
He takes me to the living room and ties me up.<eos> What does he say?<eos> Where are my real parents?<eos> He asks where his real parents are.<eos> How the hell should I know?<eos> I don't even know you.<eos> Don't play dumb.<eos> You replaced them.<eos> Does he think your husband did something to them?<eos> He says, "you replaced them."
Oh, there's a strut that needs replacing before she'll fly again.<eos> Was there any indication that the abnormals had anything to do with what happened here?<eos> Doubtful.<eos> The door to the cargo hold was locked from the outside.<eos> All 31 of them were in there when they died.<eos> Well, that accounts for the Hollow Earth abnormals, but wasn't there some rumor of something more on board?<eos> They might have been running guns as well.<eos> We found a few crates of military-grade weapons down below.<eos> Didn't these guys have access to some of the priority Red List Abnormals before the Hollow Earthers came along?<eos> Yeah, that's what put them on our radar in the first place.
We've learned a few things since our initial encounter on the mountain.<eos> The Migoi react very badly when they feel threatened.<eos> That's when they try to defend themselves.<eos> And by "badly," you mean by making us try to kill each other.<eos> So we don't threaten them, and they leave us alone?<eos> That's hard to do in close quarters.<eos> Well, until this storm subsides or we're completely overwhelmed with water, we need to keep moving the Migoi up onto the deck.<eos> I'll take Declan down to the stern hold.<eos> Will, Alistair, you take the keel.<eos> Henry, Terry, move the blocks of ice as we cut them topside.
Will, Alistair, you take the keel.<eos> Henry, Terry, move the blocks of ice as we cut them topside.<eos> Remember, it's the little things that will give them away.<eos> How do you think these Migoi got here? I don't know.<eos> The Russians must have either bought them or captured them.<eos> No, I mean in here, frozen, like.<eos> These ice blocks look really uniform.<eos> Aw, cripes, it's cold.<eos> I can't imagine it's a trick of their physiology to be able to flash freeze themselves into ice cubes, and with fresh water, no less.<eos> The smugglers must have put them on ice somewhere else, and this is how they were transporting them.
Hey, look at this.<eos> It has my name written on it.<eos> Aigoo, are you that happy?<eos> Of course!<eos> This is my first clothes.<eos> Is it true that the factory is making my clothes now?<eos> Of course.<eos> My clothes will actually be displayed in the store.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Someone will want to wear my clothes and then they will buy them...
The boys, they're all gone.<eos> They've been kidnapped.<eos> I found some tire tracks from a truck down by the cove.<eos> Whoever took the boys must have gone out that way.<eos> Driscoll has them.<eos> He probably plans to cure them.<eos> He hasn't had much success with that lately.<eos> No.<eos> By tomorrow the boys won't be able to breathe air.<eos> If we don't get them back, they will all die!
This is about taking those Glendower boys from the compound.<eos> Glendowers?<eos> I haven't been anywhere near the Glendowers.<eos> I've been right here all morning.<eos> Actually he has, the boat was late.<eos> Yeah, thanks for telling me.<eos> Thanks for checking your messages.<eos> Oh... oh, right.<eos> See, my really good friends, they call me Evi Crocker.<eos> Then Mary has them.
I heard you go over.<eos> If not you, then wh--<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> Fisticuffs?<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> What do you want, 50/50?<eos> 60/40? I wasn't lying when I said I was after your records.<eos> I'll never give them up.
The first one.<eos> You think that's what Henry saw?<eos> Maybe.<eos> You believe me, don't you?<eos> Why would we believe you?<eos> You lied to us earlier at the house.<eos> What was I supposed to tell you?<eos> Oh, it's not me.<eos> It's a guy that looks like me, that keeps coming back to life, wearing my clothes. Okay.<eos> Fair point, but why did you bring them here?
My husband's a pilot.<eos> It drives the platform.<eos> I don't understand!<eos> How did I get here?<eos> You tell us, ma'am.<eos> I'm looking for my children.<eos> There can't be anyone else in this forest.<eos> Well, she found her way in.<eos> Maybe her kids did, too.<eos> Then God help them.
I gotta pick up this call.<eos> They're either gonna cut him or worse.<eos> Okay, just keep him on the line, all right?<eos> You know how to do that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Terran.<eos> This is your last chance to get Hamilton back unharmed.<eos> Martin: Yeah, thank you.<eos> Look, we obviously wanna cooperate.<eos> Joaquin: You have to make the police understand. If I see them... he dies.
Wait.<eos> Y-you said the plane wasn't coming in until next week.<eos> It isn't.<eos> This is your MILF shit.<eos> What?<eos> You said you wanted to teach Silas a lesson.<eos> You didn't.<eos> My boys did.<eos> Told you they were getting bored up on that base.<eos> They hacked into Silas' cellphone, found out when the delivery was, stopped Heylia's drivers, and relieved them of the pot.
And what's with this tiny...<eos> What is this Naruto? What is the Box of Extreme Bliss doing here! ?<eos> You know about it, boss?<eos> Of course I do!<eos> That was an ultimate weapon during the era of the Rikudo Sennin!<eos> Isn't that Satori?<eos> Satori?<eos> That's his name?<eos> ( Satori : enlightenment )<eos> That guy is a puppet of that box that captures enemies and throws them into the box.
Our pill nicker pays Waldman off, which is the money he uses for Sara's tuition fees.<eos> That's a bit of a stretch...<eos> Waldman as a blackmailer.<eos> Something's made him leave.<eos> You really think it's the rats?<eos> All right. So when Waldman comes under suspicion, he keeps schtum, takes the fall, only now he says it's gonna cost a bit more money, that really pisses our guy off, next thing... Boom.<eos> Post that comes in for staff who've left gets put in that bin before being forwarded.<eos> Is it dealt with immediately?<eos> My target is within 24 hours.<eos> I have targets too. Doesn't mean I always hit them.
Well, maybe if you had dressed like a slut, he wouldn't have left!<eos> Ever considered that?<eos> You've got two choices.<eos> You can scream and you'll get the whole house in here or you can realise I've probably got some information you need to hear.<eos> OK, close your eyes.<eos> You just concentrate on my voice.<eos> Empty your head of everything other than my voice.<eos> And now open your eyes.<eos> They like height.<eos> When organic matter passes through them, they burn, so we see them on rooftops and bus shelters, walking down the middle of the road.
I'm just trying to make it easier for you.<eos> If you'd like, you can make a list for me also.<eos> Well, like the song says, "All I want for Christmas is you."<eos> Aw. All I want for Christmas is you, too. And five things on that list.<eos> I love you.<eos> Holy crap, I'm dating Kim Kardashian.<eos> Wheels, Porcelain, Other Gay, the Yuletide is upon us, and everyone knows that Cistmas is a time for forgiveness, so I have decided to forgive you for having no talent and ruining the American songbook one mash-up at a time.<eos> I've also forgiven you for forcing me to run in and promptly lose an humiliating statewide election.<eos> We... accept your forgiveness?<eos> Now, Christmas isn't just a time when Jewish kids get slightly uncomfortable and dwarves get jobs as Santa's helpers in demeaning nonunion commercials that make them quietly die inside.
Ms. Swan.<eos> For the sake of the boy, be careful how you handle his belief system.<eos> Destroying his imagination would be... be devastating.<eos> You were right. She was just here.<eos> Did she take the file?<eos> Yes.<eos> How... how did you know she was gonna come here?<eos> Because I'm the one who gave her the idea.<eos> Hey there.<eos> If you're concerned about the "Do not disturb" signs, don't worry. I've left them alone.
Yes.<eos> How... how did you know she was gonna come here?<eos> Because I'm the one who gave her the idea.<eos> Hey there.<eos> If you're concerned about the "Do not disturb" signs, don't worry. I've left them alone.<eos> Actually, I'm here about Dr. Archibald Hopper.<eos> He mentioned you got into a bit of a row with him earlier?<eos> No.<eos> I was shocked, too, given your shy, delicate sensibilities.<eos> He says you demanded to see Henry's files and when he refused, you came back and stole them.

Oh, it's okay.<eos> From what I can tell, this is a copy of the report. Before the official version went out,<eos> Hence the redactions.<eos> I know it's been a long time.<eos> People are still getting sick.<eos> Dr. Reyes, I can't imagine what sort of burden you've been carrying around with you all these years,<eos> But if you've ever wanted to lay it down, now is the time.<eos> Mayor Gregg's administration confirmed today that Bensenville has received a large quantity of bottled water donated from mayor Tom Kane...<eos> Male reporter: ... Have been overwhelmed with patients concerned about exposure to trichloroethylene...<eos> Male reporter #2: Parents of students at nearby McGuire elementary are concerned that the location of the school puts them in great danger.
Shop for a Homecoming dress-- who wants to join?<eos> very regal, very Kate Middleton.<eos> Sutton's not running.<eos> Right. So, like I was saying, something totally royal, with just a hint of the unexpected.<eos> Char, no, really, I'm sitting this one out.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> We've been planning your campaign since eighth grade.<eos> I'm the Pippa to your Kate, remember?<eos> I've got four campaign posters in the works.<eos> My mom saw them and said, why don't I run?
Here are a few things that you might need to know.<eos> Let's dance.<eos> Hello, Chuck.<eos> Decker froze Bale's accounts.<eos> Castle and the Buy More are the only things that aren't frozen.<eos> All of our money?<eos> We have nothing?<eos> Payback's a bitch.<eos> The Buy More.<eos> We take Buy More's profits, put them into Carmichael Industries until both companies can make money.
something is wrong... Can't.<eos> Suicide.<eos> But we have to do something.<eos> We're not gonna get in there now.<eos> Place is a fortress.<eos> The boys are on their own.<eos> Well, that is not good enough.<eos> I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get us in there.<eos> Who are you gonna call?<eos> I cannot believe that you called them.
Dee, we'll be taking this card.<eos> Cheese and crow.<eos> All right, it's our turn.<eos> Let's go get the cards. Let's do it.<eos> No, puzzles, no, puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles...<eos> Chance. All right, okay.<eos> Okay, could be good, could be bad.<eos> "Go to jail. Do not pass Go.<eos> Do not collect $200." Sam of a bush.<eos> Okay, we take our pieces, we put them in jail.
I don't care who he is if he pays me 500 bucks to rub my feet.<eos> Did you say 500 bucks?<eos> Mm-hmm. To rub your feet? Mm-hmm.<eos> You don't have sex with him?<eos> Mm-mm-mmm. I'm into foot shit.<eos> Interesting...<eos> What shoe size are you, by the way?<eos> Hey, your feet are bizarrely huge.<eos> Man will go crazy for that.<eos> I don't care for how you describe them, but what are we talking here?
Hey, guys, why are the urinals filled with rocks?<eos> Oh, 'cause I put a bunch of rocks in 'em.<eos> Oh, okay, why?<eos> Well, you know how they were broken, so I was, like, filling them with ice.
Hey, guys, why are the urinals filled with rocks?<eos> Oh, 'cause I put a bunch of rocks in 'em.<eos> Oh, okay, why?<eos> Well, you know how they were broken, so I was, like, filling them with ice.<eos> Now the ice machine's broken, so I'm just filling them up with rocks.
I'm... Uh, sorry, extraction team.<eos> We were having a leather conversation.<eos> We're-We're... Doesn't really... Hey, um, what's the status on the vase?<eos> Do not take off on us!<eos> I repeat, do not take off on us.<eos> Leather shop in Arizona?<eos> Are you serious? There are far too many leather shops in Arizona as it is.<eos> You would be out of business in a week's time.<eos> What did you expect us to do, okay?<eos> You got us all freaked out in here, sitting here waiting for the Southerners to tie us up to horses and then have them run in opposite directions, ripping us apart.
Artoo, Artoo, don't you dare...<eos> A good pilot you are.<eos> Sorry for how I treated you, I am.<eos> -Respect you now, I do.<eos> -I know.<eos> Say the same to me, you could.<eos> You're all right, I guess. For a little green dinosaur.<eos> Master Yoda, the younglings are on Tatooine.<eos> They are in danger.<eos> Jabba the Hutt is holding them hostage.
Just an arm?<eos> Not even a finger.<eos> It's a cracked fitting.<eos> - I swapped it out.<eos> It's no charge.<eos> - Really?<eos> The first guy I called said I had to re-pipe the whole house.<eos> It's a scam.<eos> These pipes are top-of-the-line copper.<eos> The guy that put them in did a great job.
Hello, Nathan.<eos> Chief.<eos> You all right?<eos> Oh, you get blown to a thousand pieces and tell me how you feel.<eos> I guess I'm mostly one piece here.<eos> So what was the story?<eos> How did you explain my death and everything?<eos> I told people you were lost at sea.<eos> Well, I-I picked up your pieces.<eos> Put them in a cooler. Buried you on Goose Hill.
The reason these fugitives have been able to stay a step ahead is the same thing that makes their army so formidable.<eos> There's a hidden leader among them, someone with the ability to communicate instantly over any distance, psychically.<eos> And yet you kept this information to yourself.<eos> Until I had confirmation.<eos> I've had Kate Freelander looking into things down in Hollow Earth, and a network of informants here on the surface.<eos> Which is why we were in Jakarta in the first place.<eos> We knew the Crixorum could pass for human.<eos> The only other solid lead we had was that he needs a daily dose of vibrio phosphorae bacteria to survive.<eos> Found in high concentration in the local lanternfish.<eos> We were put in touch with a local who then led us to the man who'd been buying them up.
Hey. Incoming call.<eos> We're gonna need the parabolic.<eos> No, I got it. You -- unless you can read lips, we're gonna need the parabolic, all right?<eos> They're speaking Arabic.<eos> You'd be surprised what people can do when they're properly motivated.<eos> He said the government won't wait.<eos> No matter the risk, gonna make the exchange today.<eos> All right, we got to stall, give Parker enough time to get in the vault.<eos> Gonna bring the money in through the service tunnels under the sky spire and move upstairs after the tournament to meet Livingston.<eos> All right, we'll intercept them at the tunnels.
Nobody radioed, right?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Are you sure it's not broken?<eos> Where'd you get those boots?<eos> What's your unit?<eos> Get this asshole!<eos> 1 and 2, 11 o'clock.<eos> 3 and 4, 12 o'clock.<eos> Man-seok?<eos> Got them.
Knew she was a whore.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Everybody okay?<eos> Yeah. I'm good.<eos> Lieutenant? You?<eos> Uh, well, I feel terrible about the fish, but, uh, I'll cry later.<eos> Right now, we've got to...<eos> We've got to find their needles before patrol drags us out of here.<eos> Needles or something that ties them to Sedona's death.
You're doing well!<eos> We don't have many single rooms<eos> This is the comfiest one<eos> Sit down<eos> Slowly<eos> Don't stare at me<eos> Unpack all your belongings We'll put nametags on everything<eos> Including your clothes, shoes and socks That way, your things won't get lost<eos> These are the nametags<eos> If you have any valuables take good care of them Or you can ask us to keep them for you
No remorse.<eos> None.<eos> So basically, you just go around doing whatever the hell you want. Damn the consequences.<eos> I told you. Anna is my friend.<eos> And there's no rule against talking to your friends.<eos> It's sign that I'm improving my social interactions.<eos> Your friend is a Red Flag terrorist.<eos> Yeah, I know that.<eos> You're hiding your signals.<eos> I know you are, 'cause I can feel them, but I--I can't reach them.
He can't do that.<eos> Do I even want to know?<eos> Building seven, it's... Where they send the worst of the worst.<eos> And once an Alpha goes in...<eos> They never come out.<eos> We'll get out of this, okay?<eos> What do you think they do in building seven?<eos> Seriously, Nina, when I dream about it, I'm on some sort of a metal table.<eos> And there are these shadowy figures with sharp objects, but I can't see them.<eos> Even with my ability, I can't see them.
That's not Dr. Rosen.<eos> Oh, God, he's got Gary.<eos> About time.<eos> You know what they call it when you die in your sleep?<eos> Millionaire's death.<eos> Creighton wanted you alive to take the fall.<eos> Looks like that's changed.<eos> I love to improvise.<eos> Dr. Rosen, we should go back and help our friends.<eos> Gary, I've told you we are helping them.
We find the weight, we find our murderer.<eos> So if you could all sit tight, be patient, the killer will soon be revealed.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Oh. - Even if you do find blood on one of those weights there's no way to connect it to anyone in this room.<eos> - Ah. Fingerprints, my friend.<eos> - Fingerprints?<eos> My fingerprints are on lots of those weights.<eos> That doesn't mean I used them to kill anybody.
With Sullivan's murder and the death of Agent Ranson in the commission of a crime, he and his brother are both looking at death row.<eos> Which is why we do exactly as they say from now on to help them escape.<eos> Escape?<eos> Jim, you --<eos> Something out there is making it worth them taking this risk, Colleen.<eos> So the one way to get what we want is by giving them exactly what they want.<eos> Daniel. - Did you find me junior?<eos> - I did, from Greg Wheeler's unsealed family court file.<eos> The brothers were in and out of juvie for years.<eos> Apparently, junior is William Merrill, the Uncle who finally took them in.
I'm out.<eos> Ever get volunteered for a job you don't want?<eos> So, as you can see from your board there, this kill list is weirdly similar to high school.<eos> Group one is like the popular kids-- prom court, football team, Dean's list.<eos> The Heathers, if you will.<eos> Kids in Slade's social circle.<eos> What about number two?<eos> Uh, mm-hmm, that would be the kids from the other side of the tracks, 180-degree difference, kids this close to getting kicked out-- stoners, burnouts, mental cases.<eos> Chelsea Grant is on this list.<eos> Maybe Slade targeted them because they disgusted him?
What causes asymbolia?<eos> S-s-severe trauma produces lesions in the insular cortex, usually after a stroke.<eos> But this unsub's so young, it's most likely caused by an external factor.<eos> Like a bomb going off next to him?<eos> Yeah, a bomb going off next to him.<eos> I will crush you.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> It's so weird seeing yearbooks again.<eos> A friend of mine who teaches said that Facebook is making them obsolete.
Yeah, street kids.<eos> Hey, why don't you just ask him what's going on?<eos> Any other ideas?<eos> Okay, well... if he's using that house as his mailing address, chances are he's staying someplace nearby.<eos> There you are, right where I left you.<eos> Indian food.<eos> Oh, and I even splurged and went to the place without all the health code violations.<eos> How's progress going on those packing slips? Hmm?<eos> You were going to check out those addresses. Yeah.<eos> Uh, I didn't exactly, uh, get to them.
No, it's me.<eos> It's just me.<eos> I just know someone that that happened to.<eos> Is that why those two are upset?<eos> He got nosy with her phone?<eos> No, the other way around.<eos> Oh, geez.<eos> Oh, let me guess.<eos> Messages from Adrian?<eos> Yeah. And Amy got caught listening to them.
My kid came back from summer camp with second-degree burns...<eos> Gaston, please!<eos> ...because his counselor wasn't allowed to put sunscreen on him.<eos> Today, you work with kids like with radioactive waste.<eos> Hands off or you'll get burned!<eos> - You're exaggerating!<eos> - Yeah? Try teaching kids on a pommel horse without touching them.<eos> - Impossible!<eos> - Ok, thank you, Gaston.<eos> So I take my whistle and have them run laps like a jerk, and they take me for a jerk.
In boxing, fighters need a selective memory.<eos> They have to embrace their success remember that one loss doesn't define them one knockout won't end their career.
Yeah, this is what I'm talking about.<eos> My boys. My family. Right?<eos> We're like the Huxtables, and I'm Bill Cosby.<eos> Here, get a picture, man.<eos> Me hanging with my boys.<eos> How'd you know this place existed?<eos> Been here before with my kids.<eos> When you said the gazebo, a bell went off.<eos> But I don't remember.<eos> We repress some memories to protect ourselves -- shut them away for as long as we can.
Don't give me the goatee of intimidation, okay?<eos> I know you won't hurt me.<eos> No, but I might.<eos> Those are mine, man.<eos> You're kind of small. You'd dissolve quick.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Just remember, you're on your own with this one.<eos> Okay.<eos> I was gonna kill him.<eos> I mean, I-I don't even kill spiders when I find them at home.
Don't you have anything to warm me up?<eos> Come here, touch this.<eos> Chilean raw material.<eos> Mrs, why so wrapped-up?<eos> I told you not to call me Mrs.<eos> My life, I who love, who loved you, my love untrue,<eos> My life, I who love, who loved you, my love untrue.<eos> What are all these pictures for?<eos> We're going to squashed to death.<eos> Don't worry, we'll sell them all.
That's why what?<eos> That's why you like tents.<eos> I love them!<eos> Gently steers us from grudges and violence.<eos> For only love and its curious art returns innocence to a heart.<eos> All in a tangle like the ivy on the wall, sprawling and spreading like the moss on a stone.<eos> Like the moss on a stone.<eos> Oh, ay ay ay,<eos> We need a box for the money.<eos> There'll be good musicians playing so we'll have to pay them properly.
You've achieved that.<eos> By helping you purge Red Flag of everyone not in lockstep with your plans?<eos> You're upset about that.<eos> Now, be honest.<eos> Secrecy serves us all.<eos> You want to protect your team.<eos> Government wouldn't know what to do if this went public. And for now... I operate best in the dark.<eos> Obviously not everyone in Red Flag agrees with you.<eos> Hmm, troublemakers.<eos> You and I-- we put an end to them.
Yo.<eos> Don't scuff it, all right, Cabbage Patch?<eos> What's up, bro? You want to talk to me?<eos> Morgan, did you dye your hair? No.<eos> I Frosted my tips.<eos> I think it makes my eyes pop.<eos> Are you wearing lifts? Oh, boy.<eos> They're orthotics, okay?<eos> They're for my posture.<eos> And it's cool because Cruise wears them. What is...
Well, because it's a different program.<eos> Somebody modified Dad's original.<eos> Look, if you think that there's something wrong, you should have the CIA remove it.<eos> Yeah, I just don't think he's going to go for that.<eos> Like I said, Morgan is not acting like Morgan at all.<eos> Well, you need to try to get through to him.<eos> How?<eos> Well, you could try to appeal to his memory.<eos> You know, I've had temporal lobe patients who've responded to stories about who they were before the injury.<eos> It doesn't return them to normal, but it sort of helps them cut through the fog-- in this case, the Intersect.
Mr. Weathers, I am sure you're right, but we need to be thorough.<eos> Did your son ever smoke marijuana?<eos> He was an athlete.<eos> Took real good care of himself.<eos> Hey, take it easy.<eos> Steve loved all that-- Sorry.<eos> But we're on a clock.<eos> Nope.<eos> His son is dead.<eos> The only way that has any meaning is if we fix the lungs and transplant them.
I tracked down another bag of plasma from the batch they used on the donor.<eos> Negative for all our other exposures.<eos> Sarcoidosis could be inflamed by the treatment.<eos> I am a cripple in need of assistance.<eos> Transplant team ran an A.C.E.<eos> Negative. It's mine.<eos> And it's your job.<eos> My job is to assist you in curing the lungs.<eos> This chair will help me do that.<eos> What if the scrapings from the bridge chelation for lead wouldn't have made them worse.
We're on the list.<eos> How are you? Eric, what's the club's layout?<eos> Main entrance is on your street, service entrance around the back, several other businesses next door.<eos> It's a big club.<eos> Lot of places to plant a bomb.<eos> Or four.<eos> Deeks, Callen and Kensi are about to join you.<eos> Backup for the backup, that's fantastic.<eos> Do we have a plan here?<eos> Hold until Sam has located all four devices and disabled them.
It kills me that you think of me that way.<eos> I don't.<eos> I know you're a good person.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's up with those socks?<eos> - Clown college. - Uh-huh.<eos> I go at night.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I put them on this morning for good luck, and now I am convinced they're cursed.
He even reviewed the security video of the Fist, going back two weeks, to when we first put it on display.<eos> I thought he was being paranoid, but...<eos> $50 million?<eos> That's why Hayes was AWOLl from the gala.<eos> He came to check on the Fist. But the thief was already on his way out with it...<eos> Through this gallery, which put him on a collision course with Hayes.<eos> So Hayes confronts him, they struggle, - and Hayes get pushed into the spikes.<eos> - And at that moment, our thief becomes a killer.<eos> A killer who gains access to the museum through the gala.<eos> All arriving guests were screened at two security checkpoints and then greeted by board members who knew them personally.
Wesa need to be leaving now.<eos> I don't think we've been followed.<eos> Commander Monnk, post a lookout.<eos> We have no army, and we don't know if reinforcements are coming.<eos> What are our options?<eos> We sit tight.<eos> There's not much we can do.<eos> Sir, you'd better come see this.<eos> So many prisoners.<eos> Where are they taking them?
Tried to get away.<eos> The last thing a prince needs is some hotel maid crying rape.<eos> She tried to take off, and he just grabs the nearest weapon, and bam.<eos> And then he just leaves her here, goes to the casino?<eos> Maybe in his kingdom, he gets away with whatever he wants to, including murder.<eos> Got a problem?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Found the bullet that shattered the mayor's martini glass.<eos> But I haven't been able to find any other bullets.<eos> Probably find them in the mayor, right?
Mom!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Clear!<eos> It's clear.<eos> The door's open and the lights are on.<eos> The unsub beat us here.<eos> What have you got?<eos> Nothing.<eos> The place is empty.<eos> If the unsub's keeping the kids, he's holding them someplace else.
Drop it!<eos> On your knees!<eos> Get down!<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> That's quite a swing set.<eos> Yeah, the, uh, the boys just left.<eos> They went back up north with their mom.<eos> I promised I'd have it finished when they got back.<eos> If she ever lets them come back.
So, do you have big plans for the weekend?<eos> There have been three bodies similar to this one found in the surrounding area over the past two weeks.<eos> And why is this the first we're hearing of it?<eos> Before they ran the medical records, the police just assumed that all the victims were suffering from Albinism.<eos> It's more common than people think.<eos> I guess. Any luck?<eos> Well, so far, I've checked law enforcement databases, including Interpol, but it's possible that this person's DNA is not in any criminal database.<eos> What about hospitals?<eos> That's my next move.<eos> We call them albinos, but the Kishwahili tribe from Tanzania called them "Zeru."
Yeah? We'll take a break.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Listen, Anna, I just want to let you know that you're not in any trouble with us.<eos> Okay.<eos> I just need you to tell me what happened.<eos> Did you consent to sex with these lads?<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> How did you meet them?
No.<eos> He tried to help me.<eos> He left the scene! He walked away!<eos> I liked him.<eos> I thought he liked me too.<eos> Listen, Anna... is is not your job to protect him.<eos> He's a witness.<eos> We'll make sure he's safe.<eos> So what happens now... to the boys I picked out?<eos> Well, we bring them back in, and we charge them with rape.
Harry, that's... that's one of the nicest things that you've ever said to me.<eos> When?<eos> Just now. You said it just now.<eos> When would you be leaving?<eos> Oh, um... soon.<eos> Just do me a favor and say good-bye before you walk out the door, okay?<eos> Why wouldn't I?<eos> 'Cause it's what you do.<eos> You told me.<eos> You get all weepy with good-byes, and so you just avoid them.
I stand here, my wickedness washed away by the blood of the Lamb.<eos> The hell you know about wickedness?<eos> You ever hear of Bleeding Kansas?<eos> You know, I rode with martyr John Brown.<eos> John Brown was a cold-blooded killer.<eos> You in a position to throw stones on that account, Mr. Bohannon?<eos> That's right.<eos> 'Cause, you know, one night, you authored the deaths of five men.<eos> Slave owners.<eos> We pulled them from their homes and butchered them with broadswords.
So... So how many slaves did you own?<eos> Five in all.<eos> I had me a small tobacco farm.<eos> Any women?<eos> Two.<eos> You ever sample the goods?<eos> It wasn't like that.<eos> Call.<eos> You bitter that you had to give up your slaves?<eos> I gave them their freedom a year before the war started.
After a set like that, you gotta hang out and get laid.<eos> I haven't done that since I was, like, 20.<eos> I got kids.<eos> I gotta go home and pick 'em up in the morning.<eos> That's a complete waste.<eos> Is that what you do?<eos> You hang out after shows and pick up girls?<eos> Heck no.<eos> I have a family.<eos> I have a wife and two kids and I'm taking them to Six Flags in the morning.
I don't have facial hair.<eos> Whatever you say, Pancho.<eos> Whoever stole Charlene better hope LAPD catches them before I do.<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Stage two.<eos> What? Anger.<eos> It's the second stage of grief.<eos> I'm not grieving, I just want my car back.<eos> Hopefully it was just a couple joy riders and LAPD will pick them up.
But I have another unauthorized message.<eos> You volunteered for this. They will let you out.<eos> The thrill of it... The good that you hope you are doing is not worth losing everything, Kate.<eos> But I don't want out.<eos> Does that mean I'm crazy?<eos> No.<eos> It means I was right to recommend you.<eos> You'd think I would have practiced what to say next.<eos> Where are the flowers?<eos> Oh, I gave them to an old lady in the lobby.
Why--? Who are--?<eos> Ow.<eos> Why?<eos> Why is this--?<eos> Old school right there, baby.<eos> You guys should've seen her.<eos> My mom shoveling hash at some greasy spoon.<eos> Was she nice?<eos> Yes. Poor people are always nice, Patrick.<eos> They have to be, otherwise we put them in jail.
You look terrible in them.<eos> Remember, I told you not to wear short...<eos> I see my beauty has caused you to be quiet mid-sentence.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> How is that even possible?<eos> !<eos> I don't know! I mean, watch.<eos> But much like the appeal of the Ugg boot, I'm not questioning it, just accepting it.<eos> Now I need to think of a perfect venue to debut my new shorts.<eos> What if you wear them up in the club?
That's so funny...<eos> Oh, you farted, too.<eos> You guys are so much fun.<eos> Okay, guys, here we are.<eos> And here's a memento for you at no extra charge.<eos> So, will you be paying your $20 in cash or...<eos> Hey!<eos> Can't catch me! Thanks for the ride, sucker!<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> I treated them with nothing but respect and civility, and they want to stiff me?
Come here!<eos> You fat, ugly bitch!<eos> If today wasn't your birthday...<eos> Jeff! Please, you're being...<eos> What? ! What am I being?<eos> !<eos> Crazy? ! Unemployed?<eos> ! Why don't you call the cops like you did on Christmas?<eos> !<eos> I-I-I didn't call them!
And you can entertain yourself on your patio by drawing with chalk!<eos> Yes, Pratt and Millwood eight-color pastel chalk will turn your patio into a tropical art studio.<eos> But you'll have to pack your chalk because you're going to be staying six days and seven nights at your parents' house in Wilmington, Delaware!<eos> I moved my abortion for this.<eos> Um, hey, thanks for taking me out to dinner, Ryan, but I got to say, this food looks a little weird.<eos> Aw, Peter, Moroccan food is the jizz. I don't know.<eos> Looks like it might give me the kind of farts I get from eating Mexican food.<eos> Con cuidado es el stinko!<eos> Hey, do these pants look all right?<eos> Sometimes I put them on, and I'm thinking I look all balls.
No, no.<eos> No, no. You know what? It is a real thing.<eos> You make a board, and you put images of what you visualize for your life, and then the universe makes it happen.<eos> It worked for me.<eos> That's how I got Mr. b-r-a-d.<eos> ♪ Fly girls ♪<eos> If a vision board is good enough for Oprah and Jenny McCarthy, it's good enough for me.<eos> I'm doing it.<eos> That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard, and I have heard Dave try to explain the housing crash.<eos> All right, I-it was-- they took loans, and they repackaged them, subprime.
Maybe she should have gotten her cans done.<eos> Who is that hot guy she's sitting next to?<eos> Looks like Gita got her groove back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh!<eos> Give me a kiss. Mm.<eos> Wow, I'm impressed.<eos> You actually finished all the coupons.<eos> It wasn't an empty gesture after all.<eos> If I'm gonna be honest, I didn't mind that people didn't cash them in. I knew it.
My brothers.<eos> Five men who were given a choice.<eos> To run.<eos> To flee for safe ground.<eos> To seek clean, fresh air.<eos> Or to move deeper.<eos> Knowing the danger.<eos> Knowing that two young people, innocent kids, were crying out for help. For my men to save them.<eos> We all know which choice they made.<eos> These men, these five extraordinary human beings will forever live in my heart and in the memory of all who knew them and in the public records of this great city as heroes.

What you said to her and what she said to you.<eos> Baby, I love you so much. And I am so happy that we are still together with this baby.<eos> But if you stick around here much longer, I'm gonna kill you.<eos> Got it.<eos> You are staring at the names of 343 heroes.<eos> Three hundred forty-three American heroes.<eos> Three hundred forty-three men who ran in while the entire world stood watching and waiting.<eos> First responders on the front line of a war that may never end.<eos> I want you to stare at these names.<eos> I want you to memorize them.
Look at these tags-- these are all U.S. Department of Defense weapons.<eos> Traitor.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Educate us.<eos> I work for the United States Government.<eos> Yeah, right, the government. Selling guns to gangbangers?<eos> Oh, guns with sensors.<eos> We're tracking low-level Mala Noche gun buyers so they can lead us up the food chain.<eos> And what was the result?<eos> The Mala Noche found the sensors and pulled them.
Walter, you just found the boyfriend.<eos> So, you go to the school, but you're also in the Navy?<eos> Not yet, ma'am.<eos> I'm on an ROTC scholarship.<eos> I don't get my commission until after I graduate.<eos> Travis, let me ask you a question.<eos> Why would Ellie go home in the middle of the night?<eos> She said she was homesick.<eos> Ellie was really close to her parents.<eos> Is that why was she kept the relationship from them?
I watched that man beat her, and I didn't do anything.<eos> I'm a coward.<eos> You still want to help Ellie, son?<eos> Can you identify these men?<eos> That's all I need.<eos> Eric, listen.<eos> Can you tell us if these were the men that you saw in the trailer?<eos> Yes.<eos> These were the guys.<eos> These two-- they were robbing the place when Ellie walked in on them.
- Thief!<eos> Say you're sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Come on, children... back to class!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> Go inside, we'll take care of him.<eos> Give him what he deserves.<eos> God be with you.<eos> We'll make a list of thieves, faggots and tramps who hang around school.<eos> We'll hang them all, like this asshole.

We torture them, then sell them to whoever wants them.

Ransom us.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Compared to rape, which seems like a thing pirates would do.<eos> Those numskulls who picked us up were so drunk-<eos> That did seem piratey.<eos> They forgot to search me.<eos> Unless you've got Navy SEALs stuffed in your pants-<eos> No. I've got the signal beacon.<eos> So?<eos> We stall the pirates until the ISIS rescue team shows up boards the ship, takes them all out. Bing, bang, boom.
Does it hurt?<eos> Ray, seriously, I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, now you're giving me the silent treatment? !<eos> What're you, six?<eos> !<eos> No... Just professional.<eos> - Hey, pirates...<eos> - Okay, then how 'bout this?<eos> We set Noah on fire-- What?<eos> -- and when they come to put him out, we overpower them.
But the damage to her legs could be extensive.<eos> Will she be crippled?<eos> At this stage it's impossible to say.<eos> I've seen children worse than her make a complete recovery.<eos> Mr. Thompson is a man of means.<eos> If there's anything to be done-- wish it were as simple as money.<eos> The are things that are out of our control, much as I want to tell you otherwise.<eos> Little girl? She's nine.<eos> She says a prayer for these kids every night.<eos> She doesn't know them.
Borin.<eos> Yeah, I'll be right down, Dr. Mallard.<eos> Gotta go sign for the body.<eos> We've, uh, searched the entire ship.<eos> Found nothing to help ID our missing crew.<eos> Lifeboat?<eos> They're still searching, boss.<eos> Coast Guard's got air and surface craft scouring the entire seaboard north of Back Bay.<eos> All coastal law enforcement agencies have been put on alert.<eos> If these guys made it ashore, we'll find them.
I rule Ms. Barrett has the right to withdraw her plea and go to trial on the break-in.<eos> - Yeah! - Thank you.<eos> Okay, since we're reopening the old case, the state amends the trespass charge to include felony burglary.<eos> That's two to six years.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> When my office got notice of your motion, we contacted Deidre Hall, who informed us that, on the night of the break-in, a pair of custom-made leather boots were stolen.<eos> What? Your Honor, she didn't report...<eos> She didn't report the theft at the time because she feared the tabloids would embarrass her, as she had just donated a large sum of money to a bird sanctuary.<eos> And the boots were Ostrich leather.<eos> I saw them in "Vogue".
When they have been really mean and braggy and they've said some pretty horrible things just because they're on a TV show.<eos> Maybe I would have apologized if you hadn't gotten everyone to turn against me.<eos> We were trying to bring you back down to earth, but you weren't listening!<eos> Well, I'm listening now.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> I was so mean to you, and I was so mean to Fred.<eos> And now I've ruined everything!<eos> It's okay.<eos> Come here.<eos> And I'm sorry I accused you of stealing Deidre Hall's boots when she probably just lost them.
I mean, if they're breaking ground for the first time, why would it be full of arsenic?<eos> They've run out of real estate.<eos> That's sure how it looks.<eos> According to this report I just got from the State Division of Cemeteries, Marymount reported being at 99% capacity.<eos> And that was five years ago.<eos> So what do you do when you run out of room for new paying bodies to be buried?<eos> You dig up some old ones.<eos> No surviving next of kin to complain.<eos> It would certainly explain the hundred-year-old trace we keep finding.<eos> But where do you put the bodies once you've dug them up?
It's gonna be okay.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Kid makes the lacrosse team today.<eos> He can't wait to come home and tell his pop.<eos> Danny, we're gonna find the people who did this.<eos> All right, these other two home invasions-- what do we got?<eos> Well, both took place within the last five days in the same upscale neighborhoods, both with the same M.O.<eos> Four masked gunmen were waiting for the families inside their homes.<eos> No signs of forced entry.<eos> These guys duct-taped the men to chairs and beat them in front of their wives and children until they gave up the location of their valuables-- unreal.
Dalia is the one who made it about pores.<eos> Yes, but Dalia's talents are better served elsewhere.<eos> She's more of a... muse, but you... you're the worker bee, gettin' your hands all filthy dirty, hauling' things with your filthy, dirty hands.<eos> We need you.<eos> The people of Florida need you.<eos> Now... I brought these deli platters for the volunteers.<eos> How do they look?<eos> Like a lot of thin meat.<eos> You're right.<eos> I did get them prepackaged and on sale.
Peter got us a new bank, yeah.<eos> You confirm Forrest did this?<eos> That the money's there? Man, what do you think?<eos> Yes, I know what the agreement says. Have Mike follow the money.<eos> Make sure this bank transfer happened the way they say.<eos> I'll bring her to you Sunday. You know, if this was a dead end, I'm sorry.<eos> If it's a dead end, you're fired.<eos> Come on, she's perfectly safe with me.<eos> So it checks out. The Homies' funds are accounted for.<eos> Peter Forrest just moved them to another bank.
Oh, God, I'm gonna come.<eos> I'm so close to coming, Andre!<eos> And he would just go on with it until you hung up.<eos> Well, no one went on as long as the crawdad man.<eos> True.<eos> Is that your guy? Oh, the crawdad man!<eos> Every day is a hard day down by the river.<eos> I got to go get my buckets and fill them buckets up with them crawdads.<eos> I got to keep them separated.<eos> If you don't keep them separated, they're gonna eat themselves. They're gonna eat themselves!
It's how we're gonna double growth.<eos> Now, you're probably all asking yourselves,<eos> "well, how does this work?"<eos> Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points and then we redeem those points for prizes.<eos> You're exactly right, and you get a point. - Oh!<eos> - Is that a vibrator?<eos> - 20 points.<eos> - How does one get a point?<eos> I've outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders. But basically... You do your job better, you get points.<eos> So... Collect 15 points, and redeem them for this polar bear.
I hope our new neighboors are cool.<eos> Yeah, we don't need another whammy like Doris, with her mean grandson Daniel with his crossbow.<eos> Ah, we get to see what they look like...<eos> Here they come.<eos> No way they'll be as cool as that car.<eos> - I'll tell you that much.<eos> Oh, my God, even their dog is cool.<eos> Aww.<eos> That dog makes every other dog in this neighborhood look like garbage.<eos> Do you think they can see us staring at them?
Wait, do you know that?<eos> Do you know how many years l`ve been cleaning you up?<eos> If you don`t get help, you can`t see these children anymore.<eos> If I have to get a restraining order, then that`s what I will do...<eos> No, I will not calm down! Your life is a mess! Please?<eos> Look at yourself.<eos> Your life is a mess, and l`m done picking up after you!<eos> Why don`t you see what I see?<eos> You`re bleeding, and you wanna take your children to breakfast?<eos> You have to go to rehab or you`re not seeing them again.
I don't usually do quotes, It's not really my style, but, this one really seems to fit the moment, so there you have it.<eos> I'm sorry, but you're a doctor, right?<eos> I am a therapist.<eos> I don't need a therapist.<eos> Really?<eos> Because it looks like you need something.<eos> No offense, but you don't know me.<eos> Your parents are Tom and Marjorie Wexlar. Professional, high standards, type-a personalities, unhappy marriage.<eos> You cracked under the pressure and you ran away from home, And you got hooked on heroine.<eos> You came back, you robbed them blind, and you ended up in jail. - How did you...
Copy that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay. So, I have to tell you something.<eos> I told agent Dean that Paddy is back in town.<eos> Well, you have to do what you have to do.<eos> Okay, but he's not gonna do anything until I tell him to, because... I told Gabriel instead of agent Dean.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Arson squad sent over the fire incident reports.<eos> This isn't even all of them, Jane.<eos> All right. We'll divide them up.
All right, I got to go to work. I'll walk down with you.<eos> Wait. Which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theater or The Cheesecake Factory?<eos> Neither of them are close.<eos> Oh, well, then I guess it doesn't matter which one of you drives me.<eos> Let's play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me.<eos> All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer's type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.<eos> Okay, I'm not driving him.<eos> Penny, don't give up, you can get this.<eos> Aren't you going with Sheldon?<eos> No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.
Good morning, handsome.<eos> It's me.<eos> Yes, it is, and you're so pretty in the morning.<eos> Your mom and I made you breakfast.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> So you guys are getting along?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> We're very different people, Howard, so communication's a little tricky.<eos> Does he like the pancakes?<eos> ! He didn't try them yet!
No! Not there!<eos> Stop it...<eos> No, don't...<eos> It's inside!<eos> And now let's go deeper!<eos> You're already completely infested with parasites.<eos> I'm jealous.<eos> No!<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> I'll pull them all out.
Ciao, stefano.<eos> Reagan, have you heard of the Zac Posen?<eos> Well, he is my favorite designer, and, yes, I have heard of him.<eos> Well, I am giving a speech at monsieur Zac Posen's charity gala at the soho house, and I'm gonna need some help writing my speech, and the speech writer gets to come with me.<eos> I am so excited.<eos> All right, I'm actually gonna start right now.<eos> Ooh, I was thinking we'd let missy take a crack at it.<eos> Say what?<eos> - I-I always write your speeches. - Yes.<eos> Reagan writes them because she's talented and knows words.
But I didn't know.<eos> Joseph handles all of the writers.<eos> And he did mention that she was the most talented of the bunch.<eos> Why would I kill someone who makes my life so easy?<eos> - Why don't you tell us?<eos> - Your ghostwriters work off your ideas.<eos> - And the book never mentions who the killer is or what he did with the blood.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> An author that doesn't recall the content of her own work.<eos> Okay, so not only do you not write your own books, you also don't read them?
'My name is Friedrich Hirsch.<eos> I was born in Berlin in 1935.<eos> 'When the Jews were sent to the ghettoes, 'I was given false papers and adopted by a German family.<eos> 'Shortly afterwards, my parents were sent to the labour camps.<eos> 'I was never to see them again.
You see what I mean, Sweets?<eos> You're too busy talking.<eos> I didn't see him. I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, got a minute?<eos> Remember me, FBI?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Let's say you open up your trunk.<eos> You got a warrant? Nope.<eos> Okay, then good-bye.<eos> You have been stealing vintage toys from Dillio and auctioning them online.
I'm sorry, you were about to get ridiculous?<eos> Look! One of the tests came back with 70 out of 75 red flags for an extreme personality disorder.<eos> Extreme, Jeff!<eos> Like a dorito?<eos> A sociopathic dorito.<eos> A cool ranch lunatic.<eos> Only instead of Zest, Jeff, one member of our study group has... Homicidal tendencies.<eos> I think one member of our study group is an overzealous psych major.<eos> You probably just Britta'd the test results somehow.<eos> No. I double-checked them.
And now everybody's talking about it.<eos> And if they find out it was me, I'm gonna lose my title and probably my job.<eos> And no one in town is ever gonna speak to me again.<eos> I made a mistake, and now it's gonna end up ruining my life.<eos> Denise never wants to see me again.<eos> What did you think was gonna happen?<eos> I was sick of living a lie.<eos> Everybody loved me. Everybody looked up to me. But...<eos> Everybody makes mistakes.<eos> They just don't usually broadcast all of them at the same time.
Uh, will lick...<eos> le four... must be the guy's name.<eos> No, no.<eos> Wwl... ww... w-w- will... kill for p...<eos> Will kill for pay!<eos> - We should probably track that guy down. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh, I thought you'd catch that.<eos> - I thought you'd wait for me to look up.<eos> Angela Watson.<eos> We think she's stealing blueprints and selling them to the Chinese.
Boy and a girl.<eos> I love boys and girls.<eos> That's very domestic.<eos> What ages?<eos> 16 and 14.<eos> Oh, that's a very good age.<eos> Isn't that a very good age, Will?<eos> Me, I don't get kids.<eos> I mean, I get why they're important, but...<eos> You get them if you got them.
Me, I don't get kids.<eos> I mean, I get why they're important, but...<eos> You get them if you got them.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm too selfish.<eos> Have you ever met his kids?<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> Really?<eos> Alicia never brought them to work?
Side effects may include nausea, dry mouth and constipation. Increases in white blood cells, which can be serious ... Sexual side effects, diarrhea, nausea and sleepiness.<eos> Can lead to coma or death. How far will these forces go, to make a profit?<eos> Would they actually suppress cures for diseases, the way they suppressed free energy technology?<eos> Sadly my research has shown me, the answer is yes. One well documented example is the case of Dr. Royal Rife.<eos> In the 1920s Dr. Rife invented one of the most advanced microscopes of his time. He also developed a new technique he called coordinated resonance. which was apparently able to destroy cancerous tumors, as well as viruses.<eos> Rife's treatment was tested on 16 terminally ill cancer patients. Within three months, they were all sucessfully cured. Soon after, a lab testing Rife's technology was burned down and a fatuous lawsuit was filed.<eos> Rife was essentially shut down and ruined, his brilliant and promising work all but forgotten. It was really hard for me to consider, that someone might actually be supressing cures. and cancer has run through my family like a raging river.<eos> I found out that it's all about patents. If a pharmaceutical company can patent and make money from treatment, especially one, that we have to keep on using, then that's what we get. Otherwise we don't even hear about it.<eos> Rene Caisse had an old indian ojibwa formula, that was effective.<eos> Harry Hoxsey and Max Gerson had natural remedies, that worked. But you know and you look them out, the AMA makes them sound like complete crooks. And that's for following the money has been so helpful, because the same powers, who control the AMA and their research and funding, control the pharmaceuticals.
- Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah. Maybe change out of the sweaty gym clothes every once in a while- But you were talking about running for office.<eos> Go on.<eos> I'd be lying if I said I'd never thought about it.<eos> I know it's a ridiculous little local thing, but it might be fun to get out there and contribute.<eos> Plus I think I'd be good at it.<eos> You'd be great.<eos> Mmm. How would this work?<eos> Who would be here for the kids after school?<eos> Who would take them to practice and recitals... and keep them from burning the house down?
There is a rebellion in our midst, and it must be squashed out.<eos> We have to put an end to Cartman Burgers.<eos> - Yes! - Let's go!<eos> At KFC, we've seen a 50% drop in sales.<eos> It's worst at Pizza Hut, Cartman Burgers choked out the market.<eos> What makes them so good?<eos> Whatever reason is, Cartman Burgers satisfied taste craving for all of our restaurants.<eos> Realize the secret, it's a chemical compound of all our flavors.<eos> Pizza Hut, Burger King, KFC all somehow infused into one burger.<eos> It's as if he's somehow taking all the ingredient of our food. Breaking them down in to some kind of gas, and then somehow infusing that gas into his hamburger.
Thanks for the rescue, master Plo.<eos> General grievous has fled.<eos> Very good.<eos> Finish off the remaining droids.<eos> We are republic.<eos> We belong to senator amidala.<eos> Don't shoot. Don't shoot!<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> You know these droids, commander Wolffe?<eos> Yes, sir. We transported them to master Gallia's ship after we left the planet Aleen.
- And then I...<eos> I just walked away.<eos> Oh, my God. I've been played.<eos> That kid's a genius.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe we can get him to take Axl's SATS.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe the birds have it right.<eos> Maybe we should just kick 'em out of the nest and hope for the best.<eos> 'Cause you worry and worry, but the truth is, maybe our kids don't need our help.<eos> Maybe if we just let them out in the world, things will go their way.
Any time I got sick as a kid, my mom cleaned my room and brought me flowers.<eos> I didn't realize that Gammy had done the same for her.<eos> It's a pretty amazing thing she's gonna do for you.<eos> You think I'm crazy. No.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> But this is...<eos> It's dangerous. It is an experimental procedure.<eos> You're risking hemorrhaging, organ rejection, and this is before you even get to implantation.<eos> I know the risks.<eos> Dr. Reilly laid them all out for me, twice.
Get in the house. Get in the house!<eos> I think we just found out what killed those men.<eos> Well, it certainly looks like the same bite mark.<eos> These birds were about yea high...<eos> They're not birds, Mr. Shannon. Reptiles.<eos> Whatever.<eos> They were jet black with white markings. Beaks about this long.<eos> Mean little bastards.<eos> Doesn't sound like any species of Pterosaur I've ever come across.<eos> Yeah, well... three of my men came across them. I had to bury them this morning.
We had a sloppy bass player, but... Shame to break up the band.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wow.<eos> Those birds are exactly like the ones that attacked me and my dad last night.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Skye!<eos> They were just like the ones from last night, Dad, but there were hundreds of them, and they just kept on swooping down at us.<eos> Even after the guards turned the sonics on them.<eos> I-I don't know what finally drove them off.
That's ridiculous.<eos> Yeah, you thought you'd get her here, act like it was all a big coincidence, and then... and have another shot with her.<eos> Listen, I recruited her because she was the best person for the job.<eos> Hope I'm wrong about you, Malcolm.<eos> I really do.<eos> Ready to roll, Shannon.<eos> Should be exciting.<eos> You sure you don't want to come along?<eos> Yeah, I didn't think so.<eos> We brought back two specimens and took them to the research lab.
Moreover, with such clear-cut evidence, Even if the defendant has "Jeon Gwan Ye U", it would also be useless.<eos> The final trial is just a few days away.<eos> Will there still be a retrial?<eos> Even if there is a retrial, we cannot show this evidence in court.<eos> Then what should we do?<eos> Do not worry.<eos> I will go and find the judge personally, and present this evidence.<eos> The 3 defendants. Despite being teachers of the deaf school, they sexually abused the young students.<eos> It's an unpardonable criminal behavior.<eos> Making these victims the targets of their sexual pleasure, sexually harassed them, or violated them.
But we're one man short. That man is Andre.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, the problem with Andre is, he won't trade with us unless we go to his apartment.<eos> Where we shot a porno film. Oh.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I was in the room.<eos> There was so much semen.<eos> I don't want to go.<eos> Oh, but I need a running back!<eos> Okay. I will go, but I'm going to go change my clothes and then throw them in the trash afterwards.
But not just the cookies{\*, though}.<eos> That was just a "for instance".<eos> Who else agrees with Kevin, that we're wasting facilities, manpower, on our underselling products, when we should be pushing our top-performers?<eos> There you go.<eos> Consensus.<eos> We are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.<eos> I just don't understand.<eos> It's 1865, victory is ours, I've saved the very soul of our nation, and yet, happiness eludes me.<eos> Perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits.<eos> So another thing about oatmeal cookies... Who even wants them?
Shaw broke out of prison, where are you?<eos> Sarah?<eos> Hello, nerd.<eos> Do me a favor?<eos> Turn on the monitor.<eos> Merry Christmas!<eos> Hey, can I tell you a story?<eos> You untie Sarah right now.<eos> There's this tradition in Germany where Santa Claus-- or Krampus, as they call him-- visits all the naughty children on Christmas Eve.<eos> But instead of giving them coal, he wakes them up, and the naughtiest of children never see Christmas Day.
I mean, he's an attractive man.<eos> But not my grandbaby.<eos> A blond and a brunette-- just like me and Pat.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> No. We definitely need both.<eos> God, you're vile.<eos> You're not suited to raise children.<eos> Raise them?<eos> Oh, honey, no, no, no.<eos> We're going to wait until they reach that perfect, adorable age-- around a year, year and a half or so-- and then we're going to smother them with hypoallergenic pillows.
- I want to take that C.V.S. test.<eos> - You've already had the amnio.<eos> - It may not make you feel any better.<eos> - It'll make me feel better.<eos> I'd like to. Let's schedule it for this week.<eos> - That'd be great.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Got your flowers.<eos> They smelled of the gas station where you bought them.
LA 3x10 ♪ Greed Original air date on November 08, 2011<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman ==<eos> ("Blue Danube Waltz" playing) The waltz was revolutionary in the late 18th century because it was the first time couples faced each other when they danced.<eos> It was a scandalous display of public intimacy.<eos> Public intimacy-- I like it.<eos> Count!<eos> One, two, three.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> He's stepping on me.<eos> - That's not true. - You just keep putting your feet underneath mine when I lift them.
Sells to al-Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah.<eos> Motorcycle tracks come from the south. Looks like they lead north to the U.S. border.<eos> We're looking for a wooden box roughly foot-and-a-half long, a foot wide, about six inches high.<eos> No.<eos> Box is long gone.<eos> Drag marks. Something heavy.<eos> Case of handguns isn't worth dragging across the desert.<eos> Got a shell casing.<eos> Choke marks.<eos> Green's got them, too.
Sorry.<eos> Uh, according to LAPD, um, the shop is owned and operated by members of the La Masa Mexican drug cartel. Address is on your phones.<eos> Thanks, Eric.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> Not my birthday.<eos> I actually knew that.<eos> Uh, so the flowers are for...?<eos> No occasion.<eos> So somebody sent you flowers just because.<eos> So somebody did send them.
Did you have a surgical procedure in the last hour? Uh, no.<eos> And I am not dead, in case you were wondering.<eos> See, 'cause that's funny that we both got flowers on the same day.<eos> It's odd, isn't it?<eos> It's a real coincidence. It's weird.<eos> It's very weird.<eos> You might say.<eos> Okay, I sent the flowers to myself.<eos> Oh.<eos> I really like flowers, and no one has sent them to me in a long time, so I sent them to myself.
That's not good. Yeah.<eos> Oh, I almost forgot.<eos> I'm gonna be late for work tomorrow.<eos> Honey, tomorrow's Saturday.<eos> I'm gonna be late for work Monday.<eos> Sandy.<eos> Hey, h-how'd you find out where I lived?<eos> Stuart told me.<eos> Guilty.<eos> Yeah, I was in your room, folding your socks... well, uh, rolling them.
I have another roommate.<eos> A new one.<eos> I'll go get him.<eos> Well, what's he like?<eos> I wanna have a good time.<eos> Is he fun?<eos> Is he fun?<eos> Is he fun?<eos> He's so fun, he knocks my socks off!<eos> And then he folds them and puts them in my drawer.
I give you 24 hours to find something definitive.<eos> How do you wanna do this?<eos> We're gonna split up.<eos> I'm gonna see if I can track down the adoptive pants and see if anybody, maybe a family member, could have taken holly into those woods.<eos> And you?<eos> I'm going back out to the crime scene. See if I can find any other evidence of holly.<eos> Taking anyone with you?<eos> Not if we wanna keep this low profile.<eos> What about other drug dealers in the area?<eos> Well, if there were, DEA sent them all running when they mopped up the area.
Do we want to pick on that person?"<eos> Or, "that person is already mad at us because of"...<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> There's all political reasons.<eos> Get in there and see if you can disarm the snuke in Ms. Clinton's snatch.<eos> All right, I'm nearing her snizz now.<eos> What they want to do in being funny is just, like, that's it, you know.<eos> Like, that's the priority. That's like... They don't worry about anything else.<eos> Ah, my nipples, they hurt!<eos> They hurt when I twist them.
Just get it over with.<eos> Arms out, please.<eos> All righty, thank you.<eos> You have a safe and pleasant flight, sir.<eos> We'd like to welcome all passengers to our private terminal.<eos> Please feel free to enjoy the fresh baked cookies and beverages in our lounge.<eos> Maeko!<eos> I'm in.<eos> Eric, I still need those schematics.<eos> All right, I'm sending them to your phone.
The director's a graduate of Somerville Academy, isn't he?<eos> Yes. And he's been fighting for the government funding.<eos> These boys killed themselves for a reason.<eos> No one should write that off.<eos> I'm not asking you to.<eos> Somerville Military Academy in Oceanside, Florida.<eos> Five boys were found hanging this morning.<eos> The bodies are at the medical examiner's now.<eos> There's no photos?<eos> School personnel thought they may still be alive, so they cut them out of the trees.
Jerry Bowden, Jack Briggs, Tucker Calhoun.<eos> So we're walking into a contaminated crime scene.<eos> They don't have anything solid?<eos> "We're sorry" was carved in a tree branch nearby. PRENTISS:<eos> This happened on campus?<eos> No, in the woods about an hour away.<eos> - How long were they out there?<eos> - Six days.<eos> Without supervision? It was an outward bound mission for the upperclassmen.<eos> What drove them to suicide?
Josh stayed with the first-years?<eos> He's the brigade commander.<eos> Bailey's suicide hit him hard.<eos> Were all the victims friends of Bailey's?<eos> "Brotherhood is the very price and condition of man's survival. "<eos> Carlos Romulo.<eos> All of my boys are brothers.<eos> There's Tucker Calhoun's parents.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> If the boys were so vulnerable, why did he send them into the woods?
The body was still warm. Probably died just a few hours ago.<eos> So Josh couldn't be far away.<eos> Tawes already took off.<eos> Thinks he can find him.<eos> A little help.<eos> Well, why would Josh want Bailey's father dead? The duffel's from Somerville.<eos> It's got Bailey's stuff in it.<eos> - And these. - Bed sheets.<eos> He's the one who hung those boys.<eos> Okay, so he blamed them for bullying his son and Josh escaped.
It cleaned itself. It's all just digital gibberish now. There's nothing on it at all?<eos> All the data has been replaced by some kind of symbol.<eos> What do you mean, symbol?<eos> There are thousands of micro-images in there.<eos> What is this?<eos> I enlarged one.<eos> Here.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> That symbol... has Steven Rae ever used it on the show?<eos> No, I don't recognize it.
When something cuts too deep, he reaches for a comforting cliché.<eos> Anna.<eos> Please.<eos> Begging?<eos> Do you know why she chooses married men, Michael?<eos> 'Cause she doesn't have to care.<eos> They can't hurt her.<eos> And she can leave whenever she wants.<eos> Look at that face.<eos> He needs love so badly until he has it.
Your pimp?<eos> What is he?<eos> That's why they're here?<eos> To arrest me?<eos> Policeman, this man needs you to arrest me.<eos> Do they look like they understand English?<eos> - Play your own games.<eos> - Miss. Miss.<eos> You left your bag.<eos> You don't want it?
Lisa.<eos> Lisa Johnson.<eos> Lisa! Me and Edgar found the pirate treasure.<eos> Meet us down in the secret cave.<eos> We're gonna spend all Sunday morning...<eos> Hey, watch out for blinky, okay?<eos> He always traps you on your left.<eos> Lisa, you messed up my game!<eos> Here's your walkie. Stop waking me up with it, brat.<eos> Edgar left it, not me.
My point is we need a team.<eos> You and I aren't enough.<eos> We're fine.<eos> Besides, with a little bit more practice, you'll be almost as good as me.<eos> And you always change the topic when you're uncomfortable with the conversation.<eos> I do not.<eos> Animal behaviorist.<eos> And you can't keep putting yourself at risk because you're afraid of someone else getting hurt.<eos> Well, that's why I'm trying to perfect these rifles.<eos> A tranq rifle is useless without someone to carry it.
So whatever attacked the car could still be here.<eos> I'll clear everyone out.<eos> So now what?<eos> Now we find it, send it back home. Want to help?<eos> Not a chance.<eos> How the hell do I report this thing?<eos> Without using the phrase, "time-travel dinosaur?"<eos> I'm pretty sure you could convince him that he was attacked by a giant ostrich.<eos> I'll do what I can to bury this.<eos> Good, 'cause the longer we keep it off the books, the better.
I have an idea.<eos> Cheese Puffs?<eos> Seriously?<eos> It's what those guys in the grow-op were feeding him. You really think that'll draw it out?<eos> The thing's barely mobile.<eos> Food is a powerful lure.<eos> Hard-wired.<eos> Hey, put your rifle down.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> He recognizes it as danger.
The danger is contained.<eos> Really?<eos> What tranquilizer did they use? What was the dosage?<eos> Five milligrams of etorphine hydrochloride.<eos> No, that's not going to be nearly enough by itself.<eos> You're going to have to combine it with acepromazine to bring that thing down.<eos> It's under control, colonel. It's not under control.<eos> It's anything but under control.<eos> Look, you can't just take these creatures out of their time and do whatever you want with them.<eos> That Albertosaurus is a thread, and now you've pulled it.
Say thanks to me.<eos> Say thank you very much. Thank you very much dear.<eos> Because you live for mom.<eos> What should mom buy for you?<eos> I ... want a cat.<eos> Mother had already said, the one thing you can't have is a cat.<eos> Cannot keep a cat.<eos> The cat's leg is injured.<eos> It cannot be adopted.<eos> No one wants it.
I'll, um, check in with you later?<eos> Skye?<eos> Later, definitely.<eos> Right.<eos> Jeff, hey, I was just gonna call you.<eos> I got something.<eos> And I've got something.<eos> That symbol, the one with the three blades?<eos> Yeah, the one we saw on the wall of the trailer.<eos> Steven Rae is introducing it into the show.
How's Marshall's eyesight?<eos> Does he have any reason to lie?<eos> And do we think that the money and the drugs found at the house are connected?<eos> Is that cash for the supply of cocaine?<eos> You know you do this incessant list question thing?<eos> Bam-bam-bam-bam, so no-one's got a chance to reply.<eos> It's like you really enjoy it. Do I?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can I eat my dinner, please?<eos> First murder. How you finding it?
Can I take a couple?<eos> Sure.<eos> For my friends.<eos> Well, my friend, and my girlfriend.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> Like a window to the world.<eos> What do you think it's like in space?<eos> It's... beyond understanding.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who has a baby, and then just throws it away like it's nothing?
They say they didn't leave the house until school next morning.<eos> Dad was out on an emergency call-out. He's a plumber.<eos> He got in around three.<eos> Neither parent thought to check on Danny. Gran lives nearby.<eos> She was in all evening. The other gran lives in Wales.<eos> Until we're ready all of this remains confidential.<eos> No gossip.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> All right.<eos> Given the nature of this case it makes sense to hand it on to another lead officer.
Well I wouldn't cry about it.<eos> So what you're saying is we have a problem?<eos> Nobody move!<eos> Put your guns down!<eos> Put the guns down...<eos> This stinks.<eos> So the ballistics on this rifle should match the round that took out the mayor, and the prints on this shell casing are... They're yours, Mr. Wolford.<eos> You boys are really reaching?<eos> I've never seen this rifle in my life.<eos> That's weird, because we found it in your gun safe in your office in your nightclub.
We're very glad you're all here to celebrate this day with us.<eos> 75 years ago, Benschop Holding began as a simple family business.<eos> A lot has changed since then.<eos> We can now say that Benschop, partly thanks to my husband's efforts... has changed from an insolvent firm into a multi-billion euro company.<eos> The name of Benschop has acquired a reputation.<eos> It's a name that guarantees quality.<eos> A name you can trust, and that commands respect.<eos> Iris, Toine has a case for you.<eos> - Yes. It's just a little sensitive.<eos> You will handle it quickly, efficiently, and quietly.
I'll bet he is.<eos> He has a suitably deranged look about him.<eos> I feel a demonstration coming on.<eos> It is perverse of me, Freddie, I know, but I have no desire to "pole down to the sty to watch Bottles massacring rats".<eos> But he's a killer, Aunt C.<eos> It's cos he eats Donaldson's Dog Joy, he's so full of beans.<eos> Freddie? Will you sit?<eos> No-one wishes to see you disgorging kippers like Donaldson's Dog Joy.<eos> You remember the name.<eos> And if I hear it again, I shall peel off your face with a spoon.
Let's go and nail the bastard.<eos> Welcome to Old St Louis.<eos> It's about time I got my clutter out of here, give you a chance to put your stamp on this office.<eos> And now that I'm retired, I'm thinking of taking up golf.<eos> Oh, I once had a three handicap and no one can say I didn't because there's no one around except me who remembers the damn rules.<eos> Poor bastard.<eos> He's been up there for three hours, hasn't he?<eos> I hate this, Nicky.<eos> I really do.<eos> We have a town charter and we haven't followed it for years.
Why would you not sweep me off my feet?<eos> I know plenty of guys would.<eos> Pick one.<eos> I have.<eos> He's sweet, but a fool.<eos> I throw myself. He never catches.<eos> He sounds like a sap.<eos> What are you afraid of?<eos> That you'd break my heart?<eos> I'd crush it.
A few words?<eos> I echo the sentiments expressed here today by Mayor Bowron.<eos> My department is a proud and honorable one, and I will not stand by while the malcontent press dwells on a few bad apples and drags our good name down.<eos> Don't forget where you found it.<eos> Don't make me come looking for you.<eos> I won't.<eos> I'm sitting in his office right now.<eos> Yeah, he just walked in.<eos> Yes, Jimmy. It's in his hands.<eos> I will make sure he brings it back.
Yes. And you know why those men were killed?<eos> Please, my daughter.<eos> She... tell me, Dr. Hunt.<eos> The... the men, they... they were... they were Guinea pigs to perfect implanting the bomb.<eos> Does anyone else know?<eos> No. No, it... it... it didn't turn up on the X-rays.<eos> Th-that's the point, isn't it?<eos> You're gonna remove the device from the body.<eos> I'm sending a signal to deactivate it now.<eos> Now you're gonna bring it to me.
Ok, what's the difference then?<eos> There's a huge difference.<eos> Okay, what's the difference?<eos> Ok, you've got your tomato -based filling and you've got your pastry based outer shell.<eos> Hold on, have you ever even had a calzone?<eos> I got a pizza and I flipped it over and I called it calzone.<eos> You know what we're going to do?<eos> I'm going to make you a calzone.<eos> Okay.<eos> And you're going to eat it and then I'm going to prove you wrong and you're gonna owe me.
What do you mean? I, I went.<eos> You did?<eos> Did you like it?<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> Thank you. And how, how are you?<eos> Been better.<eos> And um, with the um, ecstasy, is that?<eos> Please don't start in. No, I<eos> I have never taken it.<eos> But, you had, had it in your purse.
- What do you mean?<eos> "If you don't cut your hair you can't be in the band."<eos> "If you keep this nerdy haircut you can't be our friend."<eos> - That's not how it was.<eos> - Sorry, it was dumb.<eos> - Is she really sad?<eos> - She didn't say no.<eos> There's a lot of ways to say no.<eos> The food is so damn gross.<eos> I don't want it.
Your turn.<eos> Could you move my piece for me?<eos> Can you see this whole game, from beginning to end, before we even start playing?<eos> I'm gonna win.<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> No!<eos> No, no! No, let me go!<eos> Some water, Ms. Cane?<eos> I don't know who you think I am, but... I swear to you, I am only here on business.<eos> If there is a problem, we'll sort it out.
Unfortunately he never checked in.<eos> The family would obviously prefer that the manner of his death not become public knowledge.<eos> I found Knut's gas cylinder.<eos> It's up to each one of us to help protect a colleague's reputation.<eos> Let's observe a moment of silence in memory of our friend, Leif Lindberg.<eos> I hope he's found some peace.<eos> You want me to test it?<eos> It's empty.<eos> I have to know what's in that goddamn gas.<eos> If I go on the next dive, bring back a gas sample, will you test it when I get back?
Go to avenge us.<eos> Shed no tear.<eos> All that you are, and all that I am. Draw us the blood, of one man...<eos> Sam.<eos> Sam?<eos> And Kenzi.<eos> We agreed to take down that price-gouging misogynist at the mechanic shop. Who gives a rat's ass about Sam?<eos> I don't think I'm ready for this after all...<eos> I don't think you get how this works.<eos> The circle can't be broken unless we all agree to unbind it and now that you've contributed your power? Lisa's gonna be unstoppable.
Have you determined how this angel maker is choosing his victims?<eos> He doesn't see people how everyone else sees them. He can tell if you're naughty or nice, or he thinks he can.<eos> So God has given this person insight into the souls of men.<eos> God didn't give him insight, God gave him a tumour.<eos> He's just a man whose brain is playing tricks on him.<eos> - You're not unlike this killer.<eos> - My brain is playing tricks on me?<eos> You want to feel such sweet and easy peace.<eos> The angel maker wants that same peace.<eos> He hopes to feel his way cautiously inside it and find it's endless, all around him.

You scared me.<eos> Um...<eos> last night was crazy, huh?<eos> I mean, with those guys showing up?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Looking for Nick.<eos> Um, the door was open, so I just let myself in.<eos> Did you find him?<eos> In my, uh, computer?<eos> Nick would never give me your number, so I was looking for it.
They appoint 12 new apostles and entrust them with the ultimate secret.<eos> And it's hidden in these clocks.<eos> The ultimate secret.<eos> He acted like it had something to do with the end of the world.<eos> He didn't act like it. He said it had started.<eos> Because these clocks had surfaced, it had started.<eos> People always think the end of the world is starting.<eos> It's all about interpretation.<eos> Revelation 16 says the first sign comes when an angel pours out his bowl and painful sores break out on the people.<eos> You interpret it one way, that's A.I.D.S.
Hey, Emily, Emily.<eos> Study Modigliani, El Greco. - It's good.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - Swint?<eos> - Miss?<eos> Do you think a cartoon cliché will get you through my art honors?<eos> It won't.<eos> Go back to work.<eos> Come on.<eos> All right, Miss, I'll change it, but... calling this a cliché is kind of ironic, because Mr. Marc said that you teach cliches.
And you know where you can put your stuffy, drab, pictureless magazine.<eos> And the round goes to Delsanto!<eos> - Delsanto? - Ding, ding, ding.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> She left the ring.<eos> She quit.<eos> It was hit and run.<eos> All right, all right, I have a challenge for you.<eos> Forget the poem.<eos> You pick a subject, paint a picture, we print it in the issue.
I'm going to charge you for stealing.<eos> Confiscation, four syllables, from the Latin confiscare-- to appropriate for the treasury.<eos> We now have evidence that Dale Swint drew the Emily picture.<eos> You were right, I was wrong.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> It's from Swint's sketch book.<eos> Jack confiscated it.<eos> - You did?<eos> - I did.<eos> And, well, it's of you, so I'm not sure if you want to see it.
It's a hobby.<eos> You know, some people collect wooden ducks.<eos> Call somebody.<eos> Get a ride home.<eos> You all right?<eos> - Okay, good night. - Hey, what are you doing?<eos> Come in for Christ sakes.<eos> You don't have to just turn right around and go back.<eos> You want some coffee?<eos> You want me to make it or... No, I got it.
Don't say anything stupid, okay?<eos> Tell her I want to buy that painting.<eos> Whatever her price would have been, I want to buy it.<eos> The painting is not for sale.<eos> And she said to tell that arrogant, self-absorbed asshole that my medical leave has nothing to do with him.<eos> She had a knee operation.<eos> - Tell her...<eos> - Oh, make this good.<eos> She's shutting down, and it scares me, so step up.<eos> Tell her I want to tear out my heart, I want to hand it to her, and I want to watch her eat it.
I'm not in the same league as Miss Delsanto, because Delsanto in her art takes us from here<eos> to somewhere else.<eos> She takes what we look at every day, and she elevates it out of the ordinary.<eos> As when John Updike looked at birds sitting randomly on a wire and called them "punctuation for an invisible sentence."<eos> Or Jeanette Winterson describes<eos> "tripping over slabs of sunshine the size of towns."<eos> And Joyce Cary speaks of a cold morning with<eos> "frost on the grass like condensed moonlight."<eos> And James Agee speaks of men removing their stiff collars in the evening and their "newly bared necks seeming tall and shy."<eos> Each artist makes the world his or her own, and in doing so elevates it.
Shudder.<eos> Perish the thought.<eos> Where's Roman?<eos> Look at you.<eos> You took the bus.<eos> Miss Independent, I like it, but, um...<eos> something tells me you're not just here for my sunny personality, are you?<eos> Here we go.<eos> I set them aside for you.<eos> Believe it or not, good taste is very rare here at the general store on both sides of the counter, so when we find it, we have to defend it.
Do you think if two men were to walk down a train looking for women, do you think anybody would have raised an eyebrow, or if a man had led the life you had?<eos> And the story about Mrs. H. would've been extremely banal if you'd been a man. And your conquest would have been a woman.<eos> When a man leaves his children because of desire, we accept it with a shrug, but you as a woman, you had to take on a guilt, a burden of guilt that could never be alleviated.<eos> Your abortion was legal, but more than anything else, it was a punishment you inflicted upon yourself.<eos> And all in all, all the blame and guilt that piled up over the years became too much for you, and you reacted aggressively, almost like a man, I have to say, and you fought back.<eos> You fought back against the gender that had been oppressing and mutilating and killing you and billions of women in the name of religion or ethics, or God knows what.<eos> But I wanted to kill a human being.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> Because of a chance event.<eos> You call it a chance event,
Or something like that.<eos> Henry.<eos> In here, Joe!<eos> Hey, Joe.<eos> How you been doing?<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Henry's just making a damn mess here.<eos> - What are you trying to do, Henry?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't think I'd cut it into a roast.
It smells good to me.<eos> Yeah, but this thing...<eos> I spend as much time working on it as I do driving it.<eos> 'Course there ain't nothing major wrong with it.<eos> Just little shit. You know, it needs some brakes.<eos> It needs a new...<eos> Joe, come on.<eos> I'll buy it from you.<eos> I'll work my butt off. I love the truck.<eos> You have to give it to me now.
- Yeah, a researcher.<eos> Is there any reason for me to believe that my brother's disappearance is related to this show?<eos> Nate said he wanted out.<eos> I mean, is he one of them?<eos> We find these true believers, we find Nate.<eos> We both know he's come into contact with these true believer fans of the show...<eos> - "Fans"?<eos> Fans who killed a man and nearly killed us.<eos> That symbol, the one with the three blades,<eos> Steven Rae is introducing it into the show.
He doesn't like catchy music!<eos> He wouldn't do gigs at weddings with us, his Highness!<eos> My music's not right for weddings.<eos> Who wrote the seal song?<eos> You did!<eos> Before turning to that twisted music.<eos> OK then let's all be circus seals!<eos> Better than cuckolded.<eos> Drop this music conversation, we've had it a million times.<eos> Let's drop it once and for all... and talk about being cheated on.
It would be great!<eos> Just a minute.<eos> So, mother, a few words for our friends.<eos> So... this is a place I know very well.<eos> I lived here 20 years with my late husband.<eos> I brought up Costantino and Rosamaria from whom lately I've grown apart, to put it this way.<eos> Then the lighthouse shone a light on me and I grew to know my children well plus other people I'd have kicked in the ass.<eos> Forgive the euphemism.<eos> Thanks to them the lighthouse has become a beautiful hotel.<eos> I hand it over to Rosamaria and to the person she loves, may they have much luck
And he was at the Faulkners' dinner party.<eos> And you work at Miller's?<eos> What's that got to do with Dr Whitby's death?<eos> Probably nothing.<eos> Can you tell us why you went to the surgery?<eos> It's private.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Any objection if we take a look at your room?<eos> GREY: I ran a check on Dr Whitby's mobile, sir.<eos> He didn't seem to use it much.
I feel something inside of me, moving.<eos> We need to get out of here.<eos> Have you noticed that they've been shorthanded the last couple weeks?<eos> It's the only reason you and I are in here together.<eos> They wait until we fall asleep.<eos> They send the short, limping one in here to collect our bandages.<eos> He's very weak.<eos> He's deteriorating.<eos> He stinks.<eos> We take two cloths, we're going to wet them, lay down as if we are going to sleep, and when they come in here to gas us, I want you to take that cloth and put it over your mouth.
A dying breed, died of flatulence.<eos> Good thing we're not staying in tents, then.<eos> Oh, that's really funny.<eos> He was supposed to bring back my pilot and mechanic, not bugger off!<eos> I think he just got swept away in the whole gold rush thing.<eos> I'm gonna sweep him into his next life if he doesn't get his butt back here pronto.<eos> I'm sure he'll be back in a couple of days.<eos> At the latest.<eos> What about tomorrow's flight to Fort Smith he was so keen on?<eos> I'll find somebody to cover it. No. You'll do it.
If you want to find true love--<eos> Well, I've stopped.<eos> This analyzes your precise frequency.<eos> I developed a way to directly read the waveform-- much more efficient than the old school test.<eos> - You have the patent for that?<eos> - Of course.<eos> It's now cross-referencing men and women with compatible resonance.<eos> Only a small sample-- Just the teachers that would let me take their reading this morning.<eos> That's how you define true love?<eos> That's how nature defines it.
Oh, I'm sorry, Jimmy, I just...<eos> Wow, that was really good.<eos> Jimmy Goodwin, if you can hear me...<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't care if you can hear me.<eos> You are not my problem.<eos> Besides, how much trouble could you possibly get into in Granby, New Hampshire on a Tuesday afternoon at...?<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> He stole Mom's watch, he stole Mom's watch right off my wrist.<eos> He's probably out pawning it as we speak.
These administrative fascists are just stamping out creativity.<eos> Booger Tom could be our next Picasso.<eos> Natalie is wonderfully inventive, just like you were.<eos> You'd spend hours going through my prop trunk.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, then where'd you get that suit?<eos> Ow! Uhh!<eos> I used that cane on and off for two years, and you never said anything.<eos> We thought it was so cute.<eos> We also knew you were doing it for the attention.
Miss Shepard, what I know, what to do in the past, does not mean that I There is no normal life.<eos> Well, what do you do?<eos> I'm learning.<eos> Medicine.<eos> But this semester, it seems to have disappeared.<eos> Well?<eos> What do you do when not to try to poison the guy spices?<eos> Certainly not play the violin and do not dance the gavotte.<eos> Violin - it's not so bad.<eos> Women love it.
Alongside some super-important people.<eos> Slipped the surly bonds of Earth to touch the face of God.<eos> Focus now turns to the cause of the tragedy, as the Presidential Commission...<eos> They gotta get back up there.<eos> Something went really wrong.<eos> Keep that. Thank you.<eos> Sir...<eos> Can I trouble you for an autograph?<eos> Sure.<eos> Who would I make it out to?
When Evan tells us where to go, we'll just walk it back, nice and slow.<eos> There's no need for all that excitement. For once.<eos> My God...<eos> My God...<eos> Look at...<eos> Howard, don't get too close.<eos> Look at the shard layer.<eos> It's the edge of space and time just blown apart.<eos> I think it's from the impact of colliding four-dimensional surfaces.<eos> I think it might just be the way the human eye perceives it, but... It is beautiful. Yeah...
He promised to make it disappear, and she agreed.<eos> And he never promised to make it reappear.<eos> Returning the bracelet feels like an implied part of the contract.<eos> Which is why the case belongs in civil court so she can sue for the return of the bracelet.<eos> There's no crime here.<eos> We have a contract, too...<eos> A written one between the defendant and Taylor industries, the company that hired Mr. West to work that night. Objection...<eos> We haven't been provided with a copy of this document.<eos> Because they already have one.<eos> Or should. Their client signed it.
God, what a stupid thing to do!<eos> How deep are her cuts?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm really sorry,<eos> I can't come now, I' m busy.<eos> The doctors can take care of it.<eos> I have to do my things, please!<eos> What happened?<eos> My ex-wife has had an accident.<eos> One of my daughters called me.<eos> Susana went through a window, the glass was really clean, she didn't see it, and... she smashed through it.
And no letter.<eos> Can it really be he who.?<eos> They looked exactly like this.<eos> May I see it?<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> Yes, he would send the sandal to the Forensic Department.<eos> There could be traces of it.<eos> But on the other hand, he said, it was a fairly common model.<eos> Pax.<eos> - Who sent it?
What the hell could I have done know, Gerlof?<eos> Not a damn thing.<eos> And then I buried them Here at lime plain?<eos> No, we waited until the next day.<eos> For night.<eos> We buried them at the Western Wall on Marnas cemetery.<eos> It was horrible.<eos> It took us all night. It may not be visible the next day.<eos> And the sandal?<eos> I do not know why Martin kept it.
Find her one morning in the kitchen, y'know?<eos> Phone in her hand, drooling on the floor, eyes rolled back.<eos> I'd be sad, 'cause I love her.<eos> But she wouldn't end up in a home.<eos> And I'd sell.<eos> I made apple pie.<eos> What?<eos> I made... apple pie.<eos> She had a nice calf.<eos> We're calling it Bitch Ass.
So what am I gonna do?<eos> Buy a laser-guided milking machine.<eos> He's got a standard milking machine; I'll buy him a laser-guided one.<eos> It's gonna be amazing.<eos> They're like family, Sarah.<eos> They were strangers three weeks ago.<eos> I-I-I... I can't explain it.<eos> Look around. This place, it's... It's real.<eos> It's all so real.<eos> A cow gives birth, there's blood in the hay. A dog barks, you hear it!
They assumed I was going to recommend his conditional release.<eos> - Are you?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> I'm not going to give my assessment to the review board.<eos> Not after this.<eos> Somebody wanted to scare me off.<eos> It worked.<eos> I'm withdrawing.<eos> Eleven years ago, Mandar Kush attacked Peter Fong, a perfect stranger, on a populated downtown street.<eos> Kush stabbed the 23-year-old 111 times, cutting out his heart and eating it.
Where's the fire? Oh!<eos> Hi, mom.<eos> Um, we just got this really tough math assignment, so... Oh.<eos> Math.<eos> It's gonna be, like, a really tough nut to bust.<eos> T-T-Y-L!<eos> Later, Mrs. Van camp.<eos> Be safe!<eos> W-With your math.<eos> Your mom totally knows and also thinks we're doing it. Why don't you just tell her?
Four jurors, John.<eos> Maybe we should take a closer look.<eos> Our subject-- a 45-year-old woman from lake Charles, Louisiana-- had noticed a strange glare in photographs that she had taken inside the home, as you can see here.<eos> That strange shape kept appearing in photo after photo after photo, but only in photographs that she had taken inside of her home.<eos> After she e-mailed me these,<eos> I decided to apply levels of spectral imaging to see if I could discern anything from the images.<eos> In each photo, the phenomenon was indicating a particular point in the house.<eos> Turns out that the subject's husband had died two months prior.<eos> And when she took a closer look, she found this.<eos> Unable to properly communicate his farewell to her in person, he'd written her a message and left it here for her to find.
She was a good girl.<eos> No one heard her go.<eos> Get over it. It's a freezer.<eos> See, what happened here was a breach in the main coolant line.<eos> Big, nasty breach.<eos> Ugly breach.<eos> Bad, bad breach.<eos> What's that smell?<eos> That's the Freon.<eos> Some people use it for huffing.
The evidence in this case has lead to one dead end after another.<eos> Something killed that girl.<eos> Why can't I see it?<eos> Maybe science can't explain everything.<eos> Tommy, enough with the spooky talk.<eos> The devil is the excuse, not the cause.<eos> At the very least, Caleb is guilty of bad parenting, if not murder.<eos> I'm not saying the devil did it.<eos> I've just been doing this job long enough to know that evil can be baked into people.<eos> And just because you can't see it under a microscope doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
Then there's Postpartum Depression.<eos> Hormonal changes, no sleep, no help...<eos> Every day is a living hell.<eos> You say that like you've been through it.<eos> Postpartum Psychosis is totally different.<eos> It's rare, but it could happen to any woman.<eos> Good mothers. Birth just messes with their brain chemistry until they can't tell what's real and what's not.<eos> So you carry a baby for 9 months.<eos> You give birth to it.<eos> You dress it in little bunny ear hats and then you take it to the park and leave it as an offering to bad men with candy?
You're normally so fastidious.<eos> In case you haven't noticed, I've had a lot on my mind.<eos> I did notice.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> The hammer?<eos> I borrowed it from the forge.<eos> The gloves, you left up here the other day.<eos> Explains why there weren't any fingerprints on the hammer.<eos> - I think there's something dangerous about being on high places, even to pray, don't you?<eos> Looking down on the world and all the people in it.
Come on, Adams.<eos> I've seen you before your coffee.<eos> Who found him?<eos> Ah, well, a jogger did.<eos> Looks like he was strangled.<eos> Did you do a work-up?<eos> Uh, no work-up. But I spoke to some of the other transients around here.<eos> No one's seen anything.<eos> How about I.D.? No wallet, but found this card lying right next to him.<eos> He was probably holding it in his hand.
You got to -- hey.<eos> You got to cut my hair, man.<eos> I need to cut my hair or they're gonna recognize me.<eos> Oh, they're looking for us, man.<eos> They're looking.<eos> I got to cut your hair, too.<eos> Come on.<eos> But I don't bother ♪ Pipsqueak just put his phone down.<eos> Pipsqueak just put his phone down.<eos> When we see a chance, we'll grab it. They'll never know.
He leaves behind his loving wife of 16 years, Adina, his daughter, Felicia, 13, and his 8-year-old son, Rudy.<eos> He will be sadly missed by both his family and his L.A.P.D. family.<eos> Officer Lucero, thank you for your commitment and your service to the citizens of Los Angeles.<eos> And, Hank, you are now end of watch.<eos> Hey.<eos> Yo.<eos> Do you know a Cody?<eos> Or Jody or...<eos> Cody.<eos> All the sulfur -- they use it, making matches, bombs.
Well, danke, but honestly, everything's fine.<eos> Obviously, everything is not fine.<eos> You moved out of her house.<eos> And I appreciate you letting me stay here, really. But you know what?<eos> I gotta jump in the shower.<eos> Don't wanna be late to the mines.<eos> Realtor reflex.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> Just hear me out.<eos> Now you know I love the lamb, but people just aren't ordering it right now.
I don't want your bloody..<eos> What the..<eos> "The herb is the solution of every problem."<eos> "It gives strength when you are frustrated." Baba's herb."<eos> Baba's herb."<eos> Now we just need a party.<eos> And some action for you.<eos> Remember.<eos> When one girl breaks your heart.<eos> Yeah. Yeah. Another one mends it.
We can close that right away.<eos> - We can?<eos> - Read the report.<eos> She committed suicide.<eos> Jumped off the ferry.<eos> End of story.<eos> - Thanks for your input.<eos> - Was it your case?<eos> No.<eos> I tried to get it, but they gave it to Børge Bak.
It's closed.<eos> She committed suicide.<eos> If I'm ever murdered, promise me not to take my case.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> EGELY NURSING HOME<eos> Uffe was eight at the time ofthe car accident.<eos> The incurred brain trauma is the primary cause of his state.<eos> He lost both his parents that day and that kind of experience can provoke a dissociative disorder.<eos> - Dissociative meaning...<eos> - He repressed it.
No.<eos> But he was very excited, and he said that he was finally going to be able to publish something of real scientific merit.<eos> So he knew that his previous books were sensationalistic nonsense.<eos> Bones.<eos> We preferred to view them as an accessible way for the public to get introduced to archaeology.<eos> But an entire book on fossilized dinosaur eggs?<eos> It was quite successful in the youth market.<eos> The profits from these books, did they pay for his expeditions?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> What he would do is feature an artifact in the book and then sell it.
I'll buy you one of your own, if you'd like.<eos> No.<eos> I want this one.<eos> She came into my bedroom.<eos> She should know I came into hers.<eos> Is your bed always so perfectly made?<eos> It's a habit I formed at military school.<eos> What side of the bed does she sleep on?<eos> That side.<eos> She can keep it.
Until night fell and cold stiffened their fingers.<eos> Still my father insisted that I go to school... learn all the things he hadn't.<eos> "There's no hope for me" he would say....<eos> "Ah, but there is for you".<eos> "Make a better person of yourself Senna... study".<eos> He made sure I saw what became of... many girls who did not go to school.<eos> It was impossible not to.<eos> Beside every gold buyers stall was a loud, raucous cantina.<eos> Above every cantina was a busy brothel.<eos> Miners squandered their gold as fast as they could find it.
I don't understand why we're just letting him go.<eos> He wanted to create a messiah.<eos> Now he has to go back to selling rocks.<eos> That's the worst punishment an ordinary life.<eos> Sorry I had to cuff you, Ambassador. Appearances, you know?<eos> I want everything headquarters has on Amanda Rosewater.<eos> I want to know where she was born, who her friends and family are, every man she's ever slept with, and what she's having for dinner tomorrow night. And I want it on my desk by the time we get to New York.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Sukar said I have a gift.<eos> Daigo believes it too, only... Only he believes it's a gift for destruction.
Cοme οn, please!<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'νe been waiting mοnths fοr yουr call.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Of cουrse, silly.<eos> I lονe yου.<eos> Hey, snap ουt οf it!<eos> What are yου dοing? Eating the egg with the shell?<eos> We υsυally take it οff, dοn't we?
Man, can't anyone in a Bishop novel be trusted?<eos> Pete!<eos> Don't do this!<eos> I loved Oliver, until he found this stupid elephant and dumped me for some dopey dame with a voice.<eos> What about Barnabas?<eos> Did he deserve to die too?<eos> Yes, Barnabas was loaded with dough.<eos> He promised to pay for the elephant, then decided he could just take it.<eos> So you killed Carson because he had it.<eos> You killed Barnabas because he wanted it.
-I know how to make him go away.<eos> -Just focus on me.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Oh!<eos> Holy shit.<eos> No, don't look at him. Look at me.<eos> Oh shit.<eos> All right, you scientist assholes,<eos> I want a copy of that footage.<eos> Like, I want you to put it on a disc or something, but don't watch it.
You can suck my dick.<eos> I don't want to!<eos> Put it down, Zack.<eos> Put it back.<eos> This is it.<eos> I fucking got you now, you piece of shit.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - What is it?<eos> What's he doing?<eos> - Oh fuck! -He's fucking spanking' it.
And staring right at me, was John Barrymore.<eos> His eyes were cold.<eos> His expression was...<eos> He was bloodless, gray, bloated.<eos> I let out a gasp.<eos> I ran out the door.<eos> I was about to climb into my car and tear down the hill, when I heard voices.<eos> There on the porch was Raoul and his cronies, just as pleased as punch.<eos> What happened to the body, Errol?<eos> Oh, they took it back to the mortuary and no one was the wiser.
Is everything okay?<eos> I know that you're in there.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Come on, open up the door.<eos> You're not the only one that could use a little team "Sparia."<eos> Ezra's back.<eos> Spencer...<eos> I know that you don't want a friend right now, but that doesn't mean that your friends don't need you.<eos> I still don't understand why you care about this costume.<eos> Some girl wore it on the train.
To see somebody in here.<eos> Somebody that he couldn't just visit because... He was doing things for her.<eos> Out in the world.<eos> She?<eos> Yeah, the patient's name was Mona Vanderwaal. Do you remember her?<eos> She's hard to forget.<eos> And the boy.<eos> His real name was Toby.<eos> You haven't touched your pudding.<eos> Saving it for later.
Then, perhaps you could do a follow-up, check on his pain management.<eos> How're you feeling?<eos> Spencer, if there's anything I said or did that...<eos> No, you're not the reason that I'm here.<eos> Who chose this game?<eos> You or Eddie?<eos> Eddie.<eos> Why?<eos> He played it with Mona, when she first arrived.<eos> Yeah, she was a bit obsessed with it, until she eventually traded it for cards.
Okay, forget it. I'll do this alone.<eos> Hannah: How are we gonna know which one is John Doe?<eos> Emily: We have to go through those racks.<eos> Um, no. You are going through those racks.<eos> This isn't a clearance sale, Emily, and I'm freaking out.<eos> All we've done is walk through those doors.<eos> It doesn't matter!<eos> I smell dead people.<eos> Fine, just get your phone ready, okay?<eos> I'll hold it, but you have to aim it.
I will.<eos> We don't want to run this by Boyd first, do we?<eos> Um, no.<eos> So what do we know about Hank Cousineau's life?<eos> What do we know about Monika Harper's life?<eos> Where do they cross over? He starts stalking her because he sees a photo in the paper.<eos> He's building a dossier.<eos> And why do you build a dossier?<eos> To present a complete picture on someone.<eos> Right. So who was he building it for?
Well, Ian Price... You owe me a new set of tires.<eos> - Irrigation?<eos> - Yes, doctor.<eos> Ah, can't see anything.<eos> There... the inferior turbinate.<eos> All right.<eos> Rotating 180 degrees.<eos> - Anyone see the medial turbinate?<eos> - Negative.<eos> I don't see it.
We did a ten-panel urine screen...<eos> Cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines.<eos> He's clean.<eos> Good. This is very good.<eos> The samples were collected here?<eos> No, he brought it in.<eos> I want you to bring him back.<eos> You want him to do the test again?<eos> No, this time I want a blood draw.<eos> And be sure you do it yourself.
And it might be time for you to share a little more of yourself with them, which can be scary.<eos> Artie said you were good.<eos> None of these equations seem to be solving anything.<eos> "For all 'T' not equal to 'S'"... what the hell?<eos> I hate having only one clue.<eos> Is he always like this?<eos> Usually grumpier. He's just distracted.<eos> So what is this place anyway?<eos> Uh, it looks like it might have been an old NSA safe house.<eos> Now they obviously use it to shoot porn.
And the bank's employees are called quants.<eos> They're quantitative analysts.<eos> You know what their work looks like?<eos> - What? - Exactly like this-o-rama.<eos> Nice.<eos> So it's no coinkydink we're near wall street, but what... what would Nick have to do with any of it?<eos> Yeah, Nick...<eos> Oh, Artie, he's having another vision... Which means he's gonna have another seizure, so we should be ready.<eos> Nick says that he feels as if he's being transported to another space, right?<eos> If there's an artifact and if a quant is somehow using it, we have to get Nick to give us more details about where he is, - so we can track the artifact.
Yeah, but why would a quant want to be tied - to a boy who barely knows math?<eos> - Wait.<eos> Wait. You said that quants analyze a vast amount of data and apply them to numerical models, right?<eos> Yeah, they're... all firms use them.<eos> Well, that would take a huge amount of mental capacity. You see, young brains are still developing, and so they're more flexible, and they have the ability to make more connections than adult brains.<eos> So you're saying that someone is using Nick's young brainpower to help them do their work.<eos> Like a hacker borrowing a server.<eos> Not that I've ever done that.<eos> Okay, what about Sir Isaac Newton's cravat?<eos> It gives the wearer insight if you wipe it across your forehead.
Yeah, yeah, pretty much what I'm thinking.<eos> I just got a tip.<eos> Joe Lucas is meeting a guy.<eos> We're gonna go listen in.<eos> If it doesn't sound worth the trouble, I will drop Terry, and you can go back to not stalking me, 'K?<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You've had a rough couple of years.<eos> I read your file.<eos> All that baggage, right now you're carrying it here and here.
Oh, my God. She's having a baby shower.<eos> The evil one is about to spawn.<eos> Well, she deserves every stretch mark she gets. She's an awful person, Charlie.<eos> I do not like her.<eos> I still get pissed when I think about what she said to you at our baby shower.<eos> "Are you sure you're emotionally stable enough to be a mom?"<eos> "You could still put the option in adoption." Stupid bitch.<eos> I know. Like we weren't ready to have a baby.<eos> We planned that baby, right?<eos> Yeah, we planned it.
It was worth it.<eos> Your mother loves that ring.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Of course he's right.<eos> A nice diamond ring gives you something pretty to focus on when your fat, sweaty husband's wheezing on top of you like a dying walrus.<eos> Whoo!<eos> That never gets old.<eos> I was telling Jimmy how hard I worked for your...<eos> Hey, where's your engagement ring?<eos> Oh, I always take it off when I wash the dishes.
A nice diamond ring gives you something pretty to focus on when your fat, sweaty husband's wheezing on top of you like a dying walrus.<eos> Whoo!<eos> That never gets old.<eos> I was telling Jimmy how hard I worked for your...<eos> Hey, where's your engagement ring?<eos> Oh, I always take it off when I wash the dishes.<eos> It's probably by the sink.<eos> You're gonna go get it, right?<eos> I'll grab it in the morning.<eos> I never wear it at night.
You're gonna go get it, right?<eos> I'll grab it in the morning.<eos> I never wear it at night.<eos> But it'd be safer in your jewelry box.<eos> I'll go get it. No, I'll get it.<eos> It's not there.<eos> But I just remembered that we're about to clean a really nasty house last week, so I left it in Rosa's car.<eos> Big Judy.<eos> I need my ring back.<eos> Burt saw I wasn't wearing it.
Bathroom doesn't even have a flat iron.<eos> About time. I'm starving.<eos> All right, first of all, cross your legs.<eos> Okay, second of all, I don't know how Excuse me, brotha.<eos> you managed this, but I am not signing for this food.<eos> You tell 'em, sister.<eos> Bruddah, you call these jumbo shrimp?<eos> They're small, they're rubbery, and they got no flavor.<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am. I can't take the food back now.<eos> Okay, if it's that bad, why are you still eating it?
So, we hiring the fellas?<eos> Not sure yet.<eos> Oh, come on they seem like swell guys.<eos> You bed down in here.<eos> Breakfast is at 5, dinner is at 8, and in between you're mine.<eos> Questions?<eos> I miss my room.<eos> We're good.<eos> Okay.<eos> Job is yours if you want it. But I gotta warn you, it's crap work.
No, I'm not.<eos> I couldn't stand being near you!<eos> Could we have some calm, please?<eos> Good.<eos> Now, Miss Masterson, I'm going to teach you how to give your father some lymphatic massage.<eos> It will help with the build-up of fluid, and take the pressure off his heart.<eos> So, if I'm not here, you can help relieve him. And lift...<eos> No, I don't think I should.<eos> It will really help.<eos> I'd prefer if you did it, Nurse.
I foresaw this when I cast my horoscope.<eos> No. We agreed to differ on matters astrological.<eos> Well, I am proved the victor.<eos> I knew my heart would buckle.<eos> I have Aries rising and Mars in my fourth house.<eos> You have angina, which can be eased by rest.<eos> It was rest that undid me!<eos> Rest, and standing at the bus stop with more idleness in view!<eos> That sponge pudding looks awfully good.<eos> If I eat it, they will consider me cured.
Well, look. I'm not proud of this, but I was dancing... and not for the Cowboys --<eos> I mean, not for the Dallas Cowboys.<eos> Well, tuition's expensive.<eos> Nothing to be ashamed of. Education's very important.<eos> It's everything to me.<eos> Anyways, so I got my massage license so that I wouldn't have to take off my clothes at lunch for these horny guys that give crappy tips.<eos> I shouldn't have brought up that stripping thing.<eos> Look, I just want you to know I really want this job.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, if you really want it, there's just one more thing you're gonna have to do.
Who's watching that?<eos> Remember it used to be just music videos and 120 Minutes and, like, VJs and everything?<eos> Remember MTV music news, with the satellite-- [Imitates pounding].<eos> The day Kurt Cobain died, and Kurt Loder got on MTV, and he teared up?<eos> I mean, that was a huge moment.<eos> It was the town square.<eos> Do people even know about rocking the vote anymore?<eos> Rock the vote.<eos> Ch-ch. People used to just really rock the shit out of the vote.<eos> Yeah, they'd take that vote, and they would rock it.
Steve!<eos> The handset's not on the charger.<eos> Right. Where's that phone?<eos> How would I know?<eos> You had it last night.<eos> Think Dad had it last.<eos> I always put it back, Sue.<eos> You say that, Steve, but the number of times I come down and find it stuffed down the side of the sofa.<eos> That's got nothing to do with me.<eos> Ah, great, now we're never going to find it.
He'll never tell.<eos> DALE: I can't believe it.<eos> I mean, you warned me...<eos> Oh, no. That's my dad.<eos> I'd know that low rumble anywhere. Uh, guys, don't freak out, but we're going to make an unplanned detour now into the bathroom, right in there--<eos> (stutters) exits both ways-- where I need total pin-drop silence, okay?<eos> Shh, shh.<eos> I could not believe it. I mean, he pulled aside the Secretary of the Interior and told him the Carmine wrestling story.<eos> Should we be hearing this?<eos> No, probably not. Somehow he connected it to the allocation of Indian lands.
A lover.<eos> My father has a lover.<eos> AnnaBeth, do you not hear a word that I say?<eos> Yes. And I told you I think it's great.<eos> And that I'm sure there's a reason he doesn't want you to know.<eos> AnnaBeth, I have an obligation to know.<eos> After Emily, he's vulnerable, and he could fall prey to any number of gold-digging trollops.<eos> Lemon!<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> I accidentally ordered an extra puff pastry, and I wanted you to have it. Mm.
They hurried off, exhorting me to find them and do what I could.<eos> Their account of the deprivation they saw startled me.<eos> I knew those Saints had no food left... so I asked for a desire that had been planted in my heart.<eos> Dear Father... You've told us to ask for what we stand in need of.<eos> I ask you now... that a buffalo be put before me.<eos> Mercy, Lord!<eos> What took you so long?<eos> It was a rare thing to find buffalo around that place at this late season.<eos> I knew the hand of the Lord was in it for that animal had stayed behind when the rest of its kind left for their winter quarters.<eos> I skinned and dressed it, then loaded up my horses with it.
I'll need the number to verify.<eos> I'd also like to check out the sharp objects that you carry around for work.<eos> Take your pick.<eos> You've got a lot of sharp tools here, Denny.<eos> My job involves a fair amount of cutting.<eos> Wire, cable, carpet, tape.<eos> Each requires a different blade.<eos> I'm gonna need to take a swab of your hands.<eos> What does a swab do?<eos> We use it to find blood.
If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog.<eos> Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, "good morning, gladys," She'd be like, "good,"<eos> The dog just keeps bumping on the drain.<eos> "" she gives up.<eos> Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p!<eos> You ever flush a pet down the toilet?<eos> I had to flush my daughter's fish down the toilet.<eos> I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn't home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish,<eos> And that's a weird moment, too, 'cause fish live in water.<eos> So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, "yeah, he's dead,"
A colleague of mine e-mailed that to me this morning. labeled as "Litchfield Poonanny."<eos> I would like to solve this problem before the warden finds out about it, Joe.
Are you kidding?<eos> Look at yourselves.<eos> (Chuckles) I think you got all the germs, guys.<eos> And I got Jack Johnson one and Jack Johnson two over here.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Appreciate it.<eos> I don't know how to make this any clearer to you guys, but I would never date anyone even remotely like you two.<eos> You wanted me to be happy?<eos> I almost was, and then you ruined it. So if you'll excuse me,<eos> I'm gonna go home, hard-boil an egg, and eat it on the toilet. (Rustles jacket)
Tyler's friends are here.<eos> (Whistles) White power.<eos> I should go and say hello. Excuse me.<eos> - Be strong, girl. - Yeah.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> We gotta come clean now. Please, can we come clean?<eos> - I am so scared.<eos> - Shush!<eos> She will never know anything if she never reads the autopsy report.<eos> That's why you are gonna find it and destroy it.
I've smashed it.<eos> Liam's nearly clocked it in about five minutes.<eos> Has anybody got a hammer?<eos> Where are you making the fire?<eos> Here.<eos> Oh, thanks, lads.<eos> Yeah. Cheers.<eos> You're not doing a tepee fire?<eos> Listen, forget what they taught you in Scouts.<eos> We're doing it the Tommo way.
I imagine you've been busy, this recent spate of thefts.<eos> Busy building a case.<eos> I left it in here for safekeeping.<eos> Do hurry up, Brown, the suspense is killing me.<eos> The brazen impertinence of the thefts, the modus operandi, points to a certain criminal.<eos> Flambeau.<eos> Wanted across Europe for the purloining of priceless artefacts.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> It was left in the church yesterday evening.<eos> I assume he intended me to find it.
You don't believe me?<eos> I believe there is normally a rational explanation for the phenomenal.<eos> So how do you explain your bible?<eos> Didn't Jesus walk on water?<eos> Feed thousands with a single loaf of bread?<eos> I also believe the world becomes a very dangerous place when we interpret holy scripture too literally.<eos> But there are so many things that happen which we cannot explain.<eos> If you'll excuse me, please.<eos> So you're telling me you have the gift of second sight?<eos> I wouldn't call it a gift, no.
I hear you like to get sauced at biochemistry conventions and brag about how you're gonna win the Nobel Prize for the work you're doing here, research that has been entirely funded by my late husbands money.<eos> I have made you rich soon to be famous.<eos> I want that medicine.<eos> I paid for it, and I want it.<eos> You can't smoke in here.<eos> Fiona you are a very beautiful woman.<eos> But if you're just looking for something cosmetic I can recommend a plastic surgeon.<eos> What I need is an infusion of vitality.<eos> Of youth.<eos> I want that drug, David, and I want it now.
-No, Joe, I am.<eos> I'm saying that you were locking yourself in the cellar, because why else would your fingerprints be on both bolts?<eos> How could you have been doing anything other than locking yourself in the cellar?<eos> Joe?<eos> We also found, as I've explained to you before, in the cellar, a mattress, a double-sized mattress.<eos> I've shown you a picture of this mattress before.<eos> I'm going to show it to you again now.<eos> You said that you didn't recognise it.<eos> Do you still not recognise it, now you've had time to think about it?<eos> Joe, can you explain to me, if you don't recognise it... ..why it's got traces of your semen all over it?
No, he didn't.<eos> You told me earlier that he did.<eos> No, he said, with the ones with dementia, they get in a state when they get muddled.<eos> He said if you slap them when they get like that, it snaps them out of it.<eos> It's OK, cos they don't remember.<eos> Do you think that's OK?<eos> Craig said it was.<eos> Do you think he's gone off me?<eos> If you think that's OK, why did you get upset when I showed you the film?<eos> Just... ..wh-when I saw it. Just... looks bad when you see it.
Honestly, the pair of you. Beggars belief.<eos> -Why didn't you follow it up?<eos> -Why didn't you?<eos> -Because I went home.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Pete, it's obvious you've got a black eye.<eos> -There's no point beating about the bush.<eos> -No. -Are you OK?<eos> -Yes, ma'am.<eos> How did you come by it?
God, you've really thought this through.<eos> And I want your phone and your computer.<eos> Oh, you're joking!<eos> No distractions, I don't want you wasting your time messing about on the internet.<eos> You have got to buckle down.<eos> For God's sake, Mum, that's just stupid.<eos> How am I supposed to revise without a computer?<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Why have you not touched your lunch?<eos> Don't want it.
Marion!<eos> Hello?<eos> It's got to be 20 below zero in here.<eos> How did, um, Audrey talk Marion down the first time?<eos> She showed Marion that her friend, Conrad, secretly loved her, that they could be happy together.<eos> Damn it.<eos> You guys should get out of here before you freeze to death.<eos> Audrey's the immune one.<eos> This cold is affecting you just as much as it us.<eos> Yeah, but I can't feel it.
Hey!<eos> I want this truck over.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> - We need to dig in.<eos> - It's not worth it.<eos> - That was a slaughter.<eos> - You bunch of pussies.<eos> I told you we should have handled this shit ourselves.<eos> We're done fighting for a hole with a half dozen psychopaths living in it.<eos> - They can keep it.
So...<eos> Lilly has Wilson's, then?<eos> So you do know there was never any chance of Storms operating on that surgery today, don't you?<eos> No, I didn't, but I just heard he'd been suspended by the board. - That was low.<eos> - You impressed?<eos> It's something Charlie Harris would pull, so yes.<eos> We were good in there today, Dana.<eos> - A good team. - Mm-hmm.<eos> So, you know, with Storms gone, your old job's open again.<eos> It's yours if you want it, and I know you want it. - Oh, do you?
Charlie, welcome back.<eos> All right, let's do a little housekeeping and close her up.<eos> Heart's beating on its own?<eos> Gave it a little jolt.<eos> That must have been it.<eos> Wow. Looks like someone forgot to sing the clean-up song.<eos> It's pretty great.<eos> Not if you're the janitor.<eos> No, I mean it just shows how full of life this place was today, how hard we worked to keep it together.<eos> Is it kind of weird that I just want to leave it like this?
Everybody's talking about us 'cause the cops don't have a damn clue.<eos> - Tell him, Cole.<eos> - Everybody's watching. They're just waiting to see what we're gonna do next, wishing they had the balls to climb out of their repressed little holes.<eos> You serious?<eos> We gotta show them it can be done.<eos> This was supposed to just be a couple of easy scores.<eos> Oh, it's just the beginning.<eos> You see, what you're feeling is power, gussy.<eos> Tell him the part where we show the world what we are.<eos> That's why we're gonna go out there and do it again tomorrow.
And you'll be happy to know that he'll return to his roles in a few days.<eos> - How many?<eos> - I do not know for sure. Doctors talk of a few days, you know, with the usual caution in these cases.<eos> Then why doesn't he give interviews?<eos> If he doesn't, he will induce the suspicion for something serious.<eos> Firstly, for understandable privacy reasons.<eos> And there is an extremely lucid political assessment, that is, images of his hospitalization may suggest a party in bad health.<eos> Things move differently from the way you intellectuals see them, Bottini<eos> For me this illness is an unexpected gift.<eos> Then I ask you, why don't we use it?
- An awkward silence.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Which spares us the everlasting chatter.<eos> Alright then.<eos> We 'll see you later, looking forward to it, bye.<eos> And whate exactly do you do in the operating room?<eos> In the OR we cut the inflamed tissue around the skin lesion out in a wedge-shape.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Good.<eos> Can you draw it for me?
What?<eos> They didn't give me her bracelet.<eos> When they buried her, they gave me her wedding ring but no bracelet.<eos> She was wearing it the day she died.<eos> She always wore it.<eos> The police have already searched the compound.<eos> They didn't know what they were looking for!<eos> Whoever killed Meg, took that bracelet.<eos> Are you sure it's not at home?<eos> She was wearing it the last time I saw her.
"Sure."<eos> Well, I used to work a crime desk down in Philly. You're so casual about it.<eos> I mean, I think the closest I've come to being shot at is paintball.<eos> Until last night.<eos> Until last night.<eos> Thank you for reminding me.<eos> Have they moved?<eos> No, let me see what's at that location.<eos> It's an old juvenile detention center. Shut down about ten years ago.<eos> Oh, Reynolds could be using it for a cover.
I'll always love you.<eos> But what I can't do right now is trust you. I was just doing my job.<eos> I thought you'd understand at least that.<eos> That part I do understand.<eos> But lying to me, using me... It's going to take longer.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> What would you think if I said I didn't know?<eos> That you were being honest.<eos> My father has the phone now.<eos> And I don't think he'll be giving it back any time soon.
Jessica told me that you agreed to let me be lead on Ava Hessington.<eos> I wanted to thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - There's just one problem.<eos> You didn't agree to anything.<eos> You demanded it.<eos> And you let Jessica play good cop because you didn't wanna undermine the chain of command.<eos> That's quite the conspiracy theory.<eos> Well, here's the good news.<eos> My plate's a little full right now. And since you didn't want me on this case in the first place, why don't you let somebody else handle it?
Putting up with all my insane, neurotic crap.<eos> I told you I could take anything... As long as you're honest with me.<eos> In 11 of these samples, there are no abnormalities.<eos> All 100% human.<eos> It's nothing short of miraculous.<eos> I'd love the opportunity to examine that de-harnessing machine. Of course.<eos> Anytime.<eos> Sample number five is an anomaly.<eos> It's strands of something -- alien DNA or who knows what -- intertwined with the human DNA.<eos> It's like a parasitic jungle vine wrapped around a tree and slowly strangling it.
Oh! Well, I can't unbreak his leg, but I can unbreak this feud with Noah Werner.<eos> Wait.<eos> You can unbreak it?<eos> That means the feud's back on.<eos> You wanna break it, not unbreak it.<eos> - Right?<eos> Sometimes doing the right thing still feels wrong.<eos> There's nothing a 2-day old gingersnap can't fix.<eos> How about adultery?<eos> "Ask Tessa" knew it all along.
This will only take a moment.<eos> Don't push me over.<eos> If I cross the line, I'll lose my memory.<eos> It's a cruel fate.<eos> A fate you were more than willing to bestow upon Belle.<eos> You've had this rag since the day we met.<eos> Why is it so important to you?<eos> My grandmother made it for me when I was a boy.
Norman.<eos> I don't think you're a nice girl.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> I'm really sorry. I wish it was different.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I didn't mean to startle you.<eos> It's so quiet here.<eos> When do you open exactly?<eos> In a few days.<eos> Well, I like the place a lot better than when Keith Summers ran it.
What are you waiting for?<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Everything is just how he left it.<eos> I didn't think it would hit me like this.<eos> You want a minute?<eos> I like having you here.<eos> He had this old, beautiful, gold pocket watch.<eos> And when I was little, we would wind it up together and...
I'm sorry, my hands are tied.<eos> Is there.. anything else I can do?<eos> No, I guess.<eos> I hope I bet on the right horse.<eos> - I think it's a private matter.<eos> - Private?<eos> Some years ago I bought a thoroughbred for twenty million dollars.<eos> It was the fastest and most expensive animal in all of Asia.<eos> A few weeks later, it was found dead in a field.<eos> They discovered that my jockey had been running it in illegal races.
Buttocks.<eos> Mind forked.<eos> I was flustered.<eos> If Mark really did have a crush on me... which, by the way, is a big "if"... I couldn't think about that right then. I had to focus on Daniel and the next challenge.<eos> We were meeting Daniel's great aunt.<eos> We had to get her to say which girl she thought was best for Daniel.<eos> But I was just happy to split a potpie with Chloe.<eos> What do you mean, we can't split it?<eos> Ma'am.<eos> It's a pot pie. All the stuff inside it will spill out.
He's all yours.<eos> I made you some food.<eos> It's important to keep up your strength.<eos> You should eat.<eos> Jake... where did you...?<eos> You took this from Guillermo...<eos> The man who tried to kill you.<eos> Jacob, my boy, this amulet... is a very important object.<eos> This symbol, the Tree of Life, represents how the universe came into being.<eos> The sacred and secret story of this amulet is that whosoever possesses it shall become the protector, the guardian of the Lamed Vav Zaddikim, the 36 righteous ones.
She makes you miserable.<eos> Look, I gotta know that she's okay.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Do come on in, doll.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Two men broke into my apartment today and stole the journal.<eos> I want it back.<eos> What, you think I put them up to it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Come now, Jane. Why would I give you the code to the journal if I didn't want you to have it?

Why would I give you the code to the journal if I didn't want you to have it?<eos> Because you knew you were gonna steal it already.
Peace on earth, goodwill towards men.<eos> You know, all that jazz.<eos> Supposedly they have spies everywhere.<eos> One of them could even be spying on you.<eos> What...<eos> You mean they still exist?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But if I were wondering who stole the journal, I'd ask myself the obvious question.<eos> Well, other than me, who else knew you had it?
You entered to clear the house...<eos> What do we have on this man?<eos> His name is David Inman.<eos> He's a former Force Recon Marine.<eos> Holds a master's degree in Philosophy.<eos> He began submitting bids for TRP contract work five years ago, and he's the group leader.<eos> Anomalies in his service record?<eos> Nothing so far.<eos> Well, keep looking. Everybody's got a weak spot.<eos> You just have to keep cutting away until you find it.
Yes. Please do.<eos> I'll be right back with that list.<eos> Um, Grace, do you mind if I use your phone?<eos> Mine's out of battery.<eos> Sure. Just dial 9 to get out.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> - Helen.<eos> - Hello, Daniel.<eos> Do you have the Stonehaven prospectus in front of you?<eos> Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.
There were significant resources allocated between 2004 and 2006 to a project that's vanished from the books.<eos> Something called Carrion.<eos> Look, Daniel, not all our RD yields viable products.<eos> Well, whatever it did yield could be sold off to recoup our losses.<eos> Unless you're hiding something from me.<eos> I'm not hiding anything from you.<eos> But it has always been my rule to keep failed development in house.<eos> Well, everything we do incorporates bits and pieces...<eos> Well, there are new rules now, Nolan, full disclosure being one of them.<eos> Now I want a report detailing all of your abandoned development, and I want it by the end of the week.
I know how much you hate being out of the loop.<eos> Speaking of, the little guy tried to pull one over on me.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He swapped the real key with the fake one.<eos> Sneaky son of a gun thought I didn't see it, But I caught the trigger thumb this time.<eos> Ended up badging Zimmer.<eos> He was so fascinated with the real key, He made a mold of it.<eos> I had him make me a copy.<eos> You think Neal told Mozzie to make the swap? Yes.<eos> I'm sure Caffrey knows about it.
But you're the best damn son of a bitch I've ever seen. Thanks.<eos> I could say the same for you, Reese.<eos> Take care of Peter.<eos> I will.<eos> Hughes is gone? Thanks to Pratt.<eos> We took out his biggest donor, he retaliated.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> Going after Pratt, for me, it's personal.<eos> For you -- it's personal, too.<eos> I believe in this system, and if someone's polluting it, It's our job to set things right.
Flynn: It's the best money can buy.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> Furnaces should have character, like the pieces that are born from them.<eos> Are you saying you can't do the job?<eos> Of course I can do the job.<eos> These will do fine.<eos> I'll also need newspaper.<eos> I prefer The New York Times.<eos> Planning your restroom breaks already?<eos> You dampen the paper and char it, then use it to shape the piece.
Really, it's nothing.<eos> Frankenstein isn't in here.<eos> It's not even a fairy tale.<eos> That means it comes from another land with different stories.<eos> Eat.<eos> I really wanna go to bed.<eos> If the curse went to places with other stories, then who knows who else is in this town?<eos> Gold. We've all had a long night.<eos> You remember that favor you owe me, Miss Swan? Yeah.<eos> I'm cashing it in.
Uh, Peter?<eos> Perhaps if he... had met someone like you sooner, he wouldn't be where he is now.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> We had sex over there.<eos> Don't look so proud of yourself.<eos> Children.<eos> They're all just children.<eos> The alchemists believed a creative work has a sort of life all its own, independent of the creator, comma, straddling the worlds of matter and psyche, of both and neither.<eos> Full stop.<eos> A subtle body, they called it.
I'll wait as long as it takes.<eos> What's this?<eos> This is the most powerful piece of coding I've ever seen.<eos> Wait.<eos> Carrion?<eos> I found some reference docs while I was cleaning up the system files today...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> This program is cyber-plutonium.<eos> I abandoned that project for a reason.<eos> Maybe it's time you revisit it.
You are the best.<eos> Thanks so much for letting me and Wade go to the foxx trap the other night.<eos> The foxx trap? Isn't that a strip club?<eos> I can explain.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Cyrus lavinius Jeremiah Jones will now expound on the nature of life, wedlock and love.<eos> Give it up for the joneses!<eos> Relationships are hard.<eos> Especially when you are married to a man who doesn't shower and hangs out in horse stalls.<eos> A man who lets a raccoon eat your very, very, very expensive wooden shoes just to prove a point.<eos> A man who borrows things, like your... buggy, and then loses it after drinking too much... Spirits.
I think that was you.<eos> You went straight to the nuclear option.<eos> We could've gotten her a cheap place to live.<eos> She's my mother.<eos> She's not some problem you throw money at.<eos> You know what?<eos> This is my house.<eos> I wanna be able to come home from work and walk around in my underwear without bumping into her in the hallway and feeling awkward.<eos> This is my space, okay?<eos> She's invading it.
Not yet.<eos> Tell me...<eos> Have you heard of The Shepherds?<eos> Yes. I've... I've heard stories.<eos> They protect the holiest secrets of the church.<eos> We...<eos> Do much more than that.<eos> Shepherds defend the dominion of God on earth, and we must sometimes... sin to do it.<eos> You understand this path.<eos> We'd like you to walk it with us.
He's crossed socioeconomic, race, and gender lines.<eos> One white males in his 40s, a wealthy hedge fund manager.<eos> And an African American female, just started college at San Francisco State, worked several jobs just to get by.<eos> Yeah, but why drain the blood?<eos> Is he doing it to torture the victims?<eos> Or is it about the blood?<eos> Might be a form of psychological torture.<eos> While not necessarily painful, exsanguination does take time.<eos> It could be a fetish for the blood and the bloodletting.<eos> What about... drinking it?
So this guy wants them to see what he's doing.<eos> Hey, Reid.<eos> How are you?<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Not a problem. Cause of death would definitely be exsanguination.<eos> But the tox screen showed high levels of-- say this 5 times fast-- ethylene diamine tetra acetic.<eos> It's an anti-coagulant.<eos> Used mostly to treat heart conditions.<eos> So the unsub probably used it to thin the blood.
Wonderful.<eos> We'd love to increase the exposure of the campaign.<eos> How much more would you like to buy?<eos> There's no increase.<eos> Just adjust the proportions.<eos> I think we should spend 60% of the money on local dealership ads instead of national.<eos> Herb, that would really take a bite out of the national campaign.<eos> Well, if you say so.<eos> Unfortunately, it's not up to me, so I am suggesting that you recommend this plan to all of us.<eos> Why don't you recommend it?
What's your date of birth?<eos> April 28, 1982.<eos> Any allergies?<eos> Other than this hot potato right here?<eos> An "in case of an emergency" contact?<eos> Melinda St. Claire, 2-1-2...<eos> Melinda St. Claire? Who's that?<eos> Oh, she's the number one girl in my cycle.<eos> That's so funny.<eos> In Canada, we call it a loop.
Hello, Connor.<eos> That's far enough, son.<eos> Ambassador Tennety. Connor Lang.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.<eos> Wish we could be meeting under less stressful circumstances.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Now turn around and go back to Defiance.<eos> You're under quarantine.<eos> We got a load of antivirals two klicks over that ridge, payload direct from San Francisco.<eos> Well, how about we'll pick it up and we'll bring it to you?
- Your line was tapped.<eos> How else would they have been able to find me?<eos> They?<eos> Who's they?<eos> Old friends.<eos> Well, because of your old friends, I have a brand-new mess on my hands.<eos> My laptop is going to the D.E.A.<eos> Where?<eos> What do you mean, "where"?<eos> Where would they store it?
Okay, look... I'm gonna come inside.<eos> All right!<eos> I'm here!<eos> Go ahead and let them in.<eos> Don't mind, I'm gonna just hang on to that.<eos> Sorry if we're interrupting something.<eos> I didn't have no goddamn sex with Teddy.<eos> No, I'm sure you and Rapes-With-A-Smile here were just talking.<eos> What, did you come here to stab me in the foot again?<eos> Well, at least I ain't gonna chop it off.
All this work and promise has led to this...<eos> The blast should be several square miles.<eos> Sorry, Herr Kommandant.<eos> It appears the trigger malfunctioned.<eos> The trigger malfunctioned?<eos> "Sorry" is a weak word.<eos> There is no room for weakness.<eos> The fuhrer expects success.<eos> The question is, can you fix the trigger?<eos> Then fix it.
The bomb in the village was massive.<eos> Took every man we had to drag it to the test site.<eos> I escaped the explosion and I heard it was failure.<eos> If that was a failure, I'd hate to see what success looks like.<eos> The plan is simple.<eos> We ride the train into Stuttgart.<eos> We meet up with somebody called Kestrel at the opera house.<eos> Give him the message, retrieve our objective.<eos> The schematics for the bomb.<eos> We get it by any means necessary.
In my experience, a 14-year-old girl can be a very unreliable narrator.<eos> If I may, I would like to speak to Dr. Evans.<eos> Ruth Bennett is lying in some hole, some ditch, somewhere in Kembleford!<eos> She's probably dead, but she might just be alive!<eos> I'm going to break Evans. But every minute counts, including the one I'm wasting on you!<eos> Alice, you look like you could do with a hand.<eos> Thank you, Father.<eos> You're an observant woman.<eos> Ruth's diary...<eos> I happened to see the young lady hide it a few months back.
As of tomorrow.<eos> Why she couldn't just dress up as a princess like other girls her age.<eos> You know I can't award you first prize.<eos> I have to give it to an orphan, or some other unfortunate.<eos> Will you make enquiries?<eos> How was your holiday?<eos> Yes, good, thank you, yes.<eos> Margate.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Aren't you going to open it?
All right. I'm gonna eat your food.<eos> A little late to be getting started.<eos> Never had to fire your weapon in the evening?<eos> Yeah, but they're nowhere near that lesson yet.<eos> Today I teach the lessons.<eos> Bring him out.<eos> They say power is a matter of perception.<eos> I've always disagreed with that.<eos> We don't perceive power.<eos> We remember it.
What do you want in return?<eos> It's your mother's birthday on Sunday.<eos> I have nothing to say to her.<eos> How come uniting this family is so important to you?<eos> What about your own?<eos> Why is everything with you is a horse trade?<eos> 'Cause I am the block you're chipped from, Gladdy.<eos> Don Metz gets clearance...<eos> Detroit fails to get a shot, the puck rolls out to centre.<eos> Drillon gets it and shoots ahead
They said all the right things about how I was special because they chose me, but... sometimes I couldn't help but wonder what the rest of my family was like.<eos> Are you anything like I thought you'd be?<eos> Definitely not, but... I did think about you.<eos> I'm sorry I ruined your restaurant opening.<eos> Hey, we got through it, right?<eos> Yeah, not before you went all Gordon Ramsay on me. "I need my avocados now!"<eos> And you were like, "Help me, I can't breathe!"<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I think we got that family memory you were going for.<eos> Wait, if you're allergic to argan oil, why do you use it in your cooking?
Same old Drew.<eos> I am not.<eos> I screwed up, yes.<eos> But I'm not back there, not by a long shot.<eos> Then why did you do it?<eos> Really?<eos> I was trying to earn money to buy my father's land back from your father.<eos> I didn't tell my sister because I knew that it would upset her.<eos> But I won't give up on my father's dream.<eos> He didn't die for nothing, and I'm gonna prove it.
Excuse me!<eos> You're never gonna get away with this... not on my watch.<eos> That's the problem, isn't it?<eos> We're not on your watch.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> What the hell?<eos> You're supposed to be in jail.<eos> Did you think you could get away with turning me in to the authorities and painting me as the one with dishonor?<eos> You see, in my country, when a man makes a deal...<eos> He honors it.
I was being treated to a tour of your little outpost.<eos> I'll grant you this, you've got quite the spectacular view...<eos> Though truth be told, my favorite spot was inside Ms. Paulsen's cubicle.<eos> How could you? - How could I what?<eos> - Don't.<eos> You let that man inside your cubicle.<eos> Inside my what?<eos> Nigel Nesbitt-- I mean, you let him...<eos> I have never crossed the boundary of your cubicle.<eos> And should that honor ever be bestowed on me, at least I'd be gentleman enough to keep it between us.
Honor it or don't.<eos> I say we honor it.<eos> Oh, by the by, Downton Abbey-- got it in my briefcase.<eos> Plan to watch it on the plane. Oh, my God.<eos> You are going to--<eos> Please, please.<eos> I abhor spoilers.<eos> Episode three-- that's all I'll say.<eos> Oh.<eos> Why don't you two watch it together over a game of Tiddlywinks?
I'm confident that, after tomorrow, you'll either settle or lose.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because I've prepared a motion based on a file dated September 14th.<eos> Darby didn't tell me about that.<eos> He didn't know about it.<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> What does it say?<eos> It says you're going to lose.<eos> Then that's too bad...<eos> Because you're going to throw it away.
Damn it. I'll call him.<eos> I'll work it out.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> He doesn't even want to give us 90 days.<eos> There's nothing better than being known for your loyalty.<eos> You hear that, Ted?<eos> Vinegars, sauces, and beans is available.<eos> Help yourself. It's a gold mine.<eos> They'd love that.<eos> There's a pie and they slice it into pieces and they throw the tiniest piece into the yard and let all the small agencies fight over it.
I inherited it from my father when he passed.<eos> It's been in our family for four generations.<eos> Do you know why Harlan's name is still on the deed?<eos> No.<eos> Have you ever seen, uh, this symbol?<eos> No.<eos> I-I've been doing some research Into the history of the drake,<eos> The building in the city where your great-grandfather used to live. And I-I came across this book.<eos> Now some of it's in a code.<eos> The man who wrote it was a member Of the order of the dragon, like your great-grandfather.
But when we're called, it's up to us to answer.<eos> I feel a calling to public service.<eos> You know, I have since I was pretty young.<eos> Now you have someone like Gavin Doran opening doors for you.<eos> What do you mean, someone like Gavin?<eos> He's... he's been a good friend to me.<eos> Be careful of him, Henry.<eos> The path you've been called to is rife with temptation.<eos> Your soul will be tested.<eos> Stand fast against evil wherever you find it.
All right.<eos> When you picture us living in a beautiful palapa by the sea...<eos> Yeah, surfing rules, babe. I know.<eos> Do you imagine us with children?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Like, native children deboning fish for us?<eos> (Laughing):<eos> No. I mean, if you could say the perfect number of kids for us to have, it would be... Oh.<eos> Wait.<eos> Think of the number, and then we'll say it at the same time. Ready?
The only family planning they have to do is a bottle of cab, a French toast-scented candle and a Netflix stream of y tu mamá también.<eos> Okay, well, let's talk about it.<eos> Um, we know we want more than one.<eos> Nothing wrong with an only, but I'd like to have my option of having a favorite.<eos> Two is great, but so many wonderful things come in threes.<eos> Little pigs, Jonas brothers, celebrity deaths.<eos> Maybe we want to field our own basketball team.<eos> That's five, by the way. Really?<eos> Okay, if you had to say the ideal number of kids for us to have, what would it be?<eos> Just think of the number, and then we'll both say it at the same time. Okay.
She didn't even open her eyes.<eos> We should do this more often.<eos> I can't tell you the last time that Madi fell asleep in the car.<eos> Thank you for today...<eos> And for the unsolicited advice.<eos> - I'm sorry. I know I should just...<eos> - No. I think you're right.<eos> - I'm gonna tell Lucy.<eos> - See, now I'm scared.<eos> I gave you advice, and you're gonna follow it, it's gonna be disastrous.
Dr. Cole, glucometer test?<eos> You know, I don't think we need it today.<eos> I feel fantastic.<eos> We can't proceed without it, Dr. Cole.<eos> There you go, green.<eos> I've never seen it do that before.<eos> Dr. Cole, could you please take the test again?<eos> Well, let me think about it... no.<eos> It's protocol, Dr. Cole. Your protocol.<eos> Well, I'm overriding it.
Taylor Hollis had drywall dust on his clothes.<eos> You guys were under renovation.<eos> Sunita said the contractor was here that night.<eos> He was checking the wiring.<eos> We're going to want to talk to him. What's his name?<eos> What's his name?<eos> Uh, Charles Stanwyck.<eos> Do you have his number?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I'll... I'll get it for you.
They don't even notice the weird-looking face.<eos> Well, it looks like it's working.<eos> I do all right.<eos> Although not being weird looking would be cool, too.<eos> Again, no pressure.<eos> Let's see what we can do about that.<eos> Whatever happened to just regular old sex, without poles or vaginas dressed up in rhinestone?<eos> When did just plain old "get naked" become boring?<eos> Antibiotic lavage.<eos> And I suppose men do it, too, bedazzle their penis?
Your boy here has been messing with my wife!<eos> Is that true?<eos> Fred... you're not a bad man.<eos> I want you to take a breath, and I want you to lower that gun barrel just a little bit, all right?<eos> There you go. Now, Dixon and I we're gonna have a long, long talk about all this, but right now, I want you to just simmer down and go home.<eos> She broke my heart, Ralph.<eos> Fred, Margie's your wife, , and she loves you...<eos> Mm-hmm. She just happens to love a lot of other folks, too.<eos> Why don't you give me that gun?<eos> I'll give it back to you, and I'll just keep it for about a week, until you have time to think about it, all right?
I'm going into surgery.<eos> Those two things are opposite.<eos> You need evidence to hold Batuhan.<eos> These two things aren't even connected.<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> The projectile pierced my abdomen and struck the eighth posterior rib. It left antigens.<eos> So, what- Why do you need surgery?<eos> To retrieve the antigens.<eos> So, you're saying that Batuhan's blood is in you?<eos> We're going to do a biopsy and test it to see.
I'm sorry. You misunderstood.<eos> No amount of budget cutting or shuffling is gonna save your E.R. or your hospital, for that matter.<eos> You're getting us ready to sell.<eos> What?<eos> A buyer is going to save your hospital.<eos> I just need to make it presentable.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Wh-what?<eos> It's...<eos> You're staging it, like a house.
He's Rip Taylor in a diaper.<eos> I have a feeling at this point, Rip Taylor is Rip Taylor in a diaper.<eos> And with that image, dinner is done.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> - Well, well, well. - Hey. Here comes the bride.<eos> Now the annoying part, right?<eos> Planning the wedding?<eos> So not fun, right?<eos> I don't know- - I'm kind of looking forward to it.<eos> Fine, I'll do it for you.
That's before the alarm went off.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you go by Jack's office and ask around.<eos> See if he had any female "friends" there.<eos> So if the killer didn't come through the window, this might be them entering and exiting the house?<eos> Which means...<eos> The killer knew the alarm code.<eos> Right.<eos> According to Lila Bergin, you were the only other person who had their alarm code.<eos> Did you ever share it with anybody? Uh, nope.
Blaylock.<eos> Eric Blaylock.<eos> Eric, Eric, Eric.<eos> Eric Blaylock.<eos> Got 'im.<eos> So you decide to... rob... Bright-Star as a way of paying Eric back.<eos> I told him... that me and Roland could do the job.<eos> He says he's got to come with to make sure I don't skim any money from the top before he gets paid what he's owed.<eos> But Eric's crazy.<eos> I told him... I wasn't gonna do it unless there was no guns.
- Quite enormous.<eos> He's a real catch, and you should take him back.<eos> Okay. Thank you.<eos> Is that all? No.<eos> No, that is not all.<eos> Let me tell you what real life is like.<eos> The men dry up, and the nights get lonely.<eos> The only calls on your machine are from collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you've never even worn.<eos> You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene.<eos> You buy a diamond ring for yourself wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself you're all you need.
So if you look at our catalog here...<eos> Well, thanks for coming down, Darryl.<eos> It was nice meeting you, Darryl.<eos> I think you'd fit in great here.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, me too.<eos> I think it'd be like... you know what?<eos> I think it'd be like a Kevin Durant jump shot-- perfecto!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> They are the ones put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop.<eos> It's like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don't blame Cece.
Come on, Pam.<eos> Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.<eos> Yeah, okay, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it. Oh, great.<eos> So we'll see somebody else's kid with Cece in the background?<eos> I mean, it's really not that hard to film a video.<eos> Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?<eos> Look, Pam, I don't know what to tell you.<eos> I mean, what do I do? It's gone.<eos> That moment's just gone. I missed it.
How dare you?<eos> I'm still the boss.<eos> - The answer is yes.<eos> - I have some messages for you.<eos> Are they from you?<eos> Well, no, they're from clients.<eos> Well, then I don't want them.<eos> You can keep 'em.<eos> In fact you can keep that big, blue nautica sweater.<eos> - I know how much you love it.
That's a devil name.<eos> Anyway, I just wanted to say I'm doing it.<eos> I'm going.<eos> He's doing it.<eos> The fact that you've been able to cover-- - Hey.<eos> - Hey, how'd the interview go?<eos> - Oh, my gosh. Wait until I tell you.<eos> This guy was unbelievable.<eos> - Okay, so--<eos> - I can't wait to hear about it later.
- So?<eos> - Aren't you here?<eos> - Really?<eos> - What?<eos> So you had to call?<eos> You were gonna see me - in three seconds.<eos> - I wanted to invite you to my housewarming party.<eos> But you already sent me an invitation.<eos> Yes, but you never check your mail, so who knows if you'd find it.<eos> You're calling to tell me to check my mail to find it, so chances are I'll find it.
Hey, this is the plug to your life support machine.<eos> You want me to kill you?<eos> If it's not too much trouble.<eos> I'm sorry. I can't do that.<eos> Never mind, but could you help me with my medication before you go?<eos> Turn it up to 10.<eos> It's on one now.<eos> Wait.<eos> That'll kill you, too.<eos> How 'bout I turn it up to three and just get you really high?
Yet here I am.<eos> I'm sorry I'm hurting you.<eos> It's the hurt to yourself that worries me, when word of this gets out.<eos> I will be Mrs Gino Poletti.<eos> I won't care.<eos> And what if you're not?<eos> What will you be then?<eos> There's only so much I can do to contain this.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> I don't want it.
You're so bitter.<eos> You're going to end up old and alone.<eos> Yeah, I am old.<eos> And I am alone.<eos> And all I ever wanted was to hold this family together.<eos> Ash Park, to you, will never be closed, but if you do this, my heart will be.<eos> Is that what you said to... to Aunt Carolyn... when you turned your back on her?<eos> Very similar.<eos> If I could do it to her, I can certainly do it to you.<eos> Electroconvulsive therapy, or "shock treatment" as it's sometimes referred to, is a medical procedure in which brief electrical stimulus is used to induce a cerebral seizure - a layman might call it a "brain seizure" -
Well, classically, they're not even supposed to speak.<eos> We do know that he took on an entire camp full of heavily armed German soldiers and Thule necromancers and won.<eos> One badass hummel figurine.<eos> That we have no idea how to put back in the box.<eos> Great.<eos> So, that's your plan -- taking out my Golem?<eos> It's not a plan.<eos> We would just feel a lot better if we knew how. That's all.<eos> What makes you think you have any right to make that decision?<eos> Believe me, if we need the right, we will take it.
Deb, I'm your brother.<eos> You can hate me if you want, but it doesn't change the fact that I care about you.<eos> I didn't want to hate you.<eos> I wanted the opposite.<eos> But it didn't work out that way.<eos> I can't change the way I feel, so... Will you go, please?<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter, get the fuck out.<eos> Go.<eos> Deb doesn't want my help, and Vogel is demanding it.
I'm just kidding, obviously.<eos> I don't wanna invade your privacy. I just wanna see if you need anything.<eos> - I'm good.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Jake.<eos> I know I can be kind of a dick sometimes.<eos> You don't deserve that.<eos> It's okay. Most people think I'm a dick too, so I guess we're even.<eos> This past year hasn't been my best.<eos> The truth is, I wouldn't be surviving it if it weren't for you, so thank you.
I'm not interested.<eos> But we all have a will to survive, and when in extreme situations, people do extreme things.<eos> That doesn't make it right.<eos> Right or wrong doesn't make it into the equation.<eos> There are other forces driving us.<eos> What's driving you?<eos> Dexter.<eos> The passing of the torch.<eos> I taught you the code.<eos> Now he's learning it from you.
Yes, I know.<eos> People sometimes think I'm gay.<eos> - Do they?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Weird.<eos> But at the end of the day, there's only one thing that gets me out of bed in the morning.<eos> Same thing that gets me in.<eos> I'm talking about dudes.<eos> Here you go. Hey, hon. Where did you get that sandwich?<eos> In the kitchen. I made it myself. The appetizers are so small here.
No.<eos> No. Gloating is not in your character, is it, Bohannon?<eos> Too much integrity.<eos> That was always your problem.<eos> I came to ask for help.<eos> Haven't you heard?<eos> I'm ruined.<eos> There's nothing I could possibly do for you.<eos> Even if I wanted to.<eos> Union Pacific offered me a job, and they gave it to someone else.
Feeling better?<eos> Sort of.<eos> 'Cause we could use another pilot in the rotation.<eos> Can I put you in?<eos> Sure, sign me up.<eos> See how I'm feeling in the morning.<eos> All right.<eos> Been going for about 10,000 years.<eos> We have to go ahead with the rally.<eos> If we put it off now, it'll look like we don't mean business...
Rest assured, he will be found.<eos> Security is launching a full-scale investigation into the genealogy records of every single one of our employees.<eos> This man will be found, and there will be dire consequences.<eos> Too bad about that Chinese guy, huh?<eos> Campers, we are now in our state-of-the-art space shuttle simulator.<eos> Hey, you're a girl.<eos> I just figured that out.<eos> By the time you leave Space Camp, you will all be familiar with every device on board this craft.<eos> What's this button do?<eos> Why don't you go ahead and push it?
Oh, I have no idea what his face looks like.<eos> And I didn't get a good look at the passenger.<eos> All right, start at the beginning.<eos> They were blasting their music pretty loud.<eos> When I pulled in behind, he started driving like a church lady.<eos> Driver was all twitchy.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Used to think wearing that vest was a pain in the ass. But my daughter kept nagging me about it every morning.<eos> Now I wouldn't be caught dead without it.
And try to remain calm. The guy can't see you, okay?<eos> There's no cameras in here.<eos> Please don't.<eos> They'll kill my wife.<eos> And if we try anything, he'll press that button before we're out the door.<eos> I'm gonna take my arm off your throat.<eos> You think about trying anything. Remember.<eos> Who's got the gun now. Look. They kidnapped my wife.<eos> I mean, my ex-wife, Julie.<eos> The earpiece. They just give me instructions through it.
I found out yesterday on my shift.<eos> The brass. The big wigs. They told me.<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> That's, that's brilliant.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wait Jake.<eos> It's a federal task force.<eos> Anti terrorism.<eos> I won't be running it. But I will be a senior director.<eos> They got a spot for me, if I want it.
Hold this.<eos> What was that for?<eos> To show people when they don't believe me.<eos> ♪ Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state ♪<eos> ♪ Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started...

You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.
Rapist, murderer... these are the kinds of people I'm used to dealing with.<eos> And you know where they are?<eos> Spending the rest of their lives realizing that I wasn't just a pretty face.<eos> Is that what you think this is about?<eos> You treated me like shit because I'm a woman. How dare you?<eos> I worship women.<eos> My mother, my grandmother-- God rest her soul--<eos> Hillary Clinton, Gwen Stefani.<eos> Then what the hell is your problem?<eos> You took a job from somebody who deserved it more.
We'd better get the rest.<eos> Listen, I've got a rhinoceros here in the house, and I want it out today!<eos> It's dangerous and scary, and I want it dead.<eos> Or buried in a hole, put in a cage, or put behind barbed wire!<eos> My dad sounds really angry!<eos> We have to protect Otto!<eos> I just want it gone.<eos> This all sounds very drastic.<eos> So, you really have a rhinoceros?<eos> And you want to sell it to me?
There are a lot of sharp elbows out there.<eos> So this is a talking filibuster.<eos> You see this coming, boss?<eos> - Yup. I just hope to God this is a one-off.<eos> What we need is good jobs, and that comes from fossil fuels.<eos> - What time am I on?<eos> - 3:45 A.M.<eos> Do I have a speech?<eos> Not unless you want one.<eos> No one's gonna hear it.
I see you in the background.<eos> All right, the years have not been kind to you.<eos> The panties he's wearing are very confusing.<eos> I agree.<eos> And he's taking 'em off, great.<eos> Baby, you want me to make it hard for you? JEANNIE:<eos> I don't know, I'm just an innocent farm girl.<eos> How about you stop showing off for the camera and bring that sweet stuff over here?<eos> How can I un-see that?<eos> It was like a thing, but then everything was through it.
- Thank you.<eos> How is she doing?<eos> She's taking even more pills now.<eos> Different kinds.<eos> - Come on.<eos> So she constantly falls asleep.<eos> Hey, come here.<eos> You lost your growling spectator.<eos> Clara got a birthday card from her.<eos> Clara was reading it aloud and just stopped suddenly.
That is a lot of highly-trained â€œsquintspertiseâ€... you are sending on government-paid vacation.<eos> The investigation is need-to-know only.<eos> All calls are on burner cells. No computers.<eos> I've got as much blood as you've got tests.<eos> Potentiometer assay. Gamma count.<eos> Don't leave anything out.<eos> Ooh. There is a needle in your radial artery, Dr. Hodgins.<eos> Try not to bounce around so much.<eos> You are running a gamma count, aren't you?<eos> If the hematology warrants it.
That's why we've never seen these.<eos> You still want me off this one?<eos> Nah, it's too late for that.<eos> I just heard from Leah Kressin.<eos> She is the best hematologist I know, top expert in her field. I completely trust her work, and... she couldn't I.D. the gas that Pelant used. I'm sorry.<eos> But you're not giving up on this, right?<eos> I don't know what else to do.<eos> There's no residue in your blood. There's no residue on the victim.<eos> The tech team went over every inch of your place.<eos> Then they go over it again. I mean, every millimeter.
But there is actually... a chance?<eos> Maybe.<eos> The odds aren't good.<eos> Let's double them.<eos> Biopsy my lung too.<eos> Booth.<eos> Guess again, Dr. Brennan.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to register my disappointment with you.<eos> I left you a masterpiece of a body, and you still haven't read it properly.
But if you can't do it, that's on you.<eos> Come on!<eos> Seriously, come on!<eos> I have sympotence!<eos> - What?<eos> - Sympotence!<eos> You-- you couldn't get it up, and I'm an empath-- sympathy impotence-- sympotence!<eos> I didn't know you had people over.<eos> All right, I'm going for the lip balm.<eos> I'm going to casually walk over there and take it. - Then I'm gonna Tom Cruise-sprint the hell out of here.
We all miss our land, Anton.<eos> - But this is our home now.<eos> - You never think about going back?<eos> Of course we do.<eos> It's just not possible.<eos> We have no way to get there.<eos> How's the farmland here?<eos> Pretty good.<eos> The stem is from a beanstalk.<eos> If I plant it, it should be able to grow some magic beans.
She doesn't like the word butthole.<eos> - Oh, yeah. - Butthole?<eos> Ugh, stop.<eos> Please don't.<eos> - It's her trigger word. - Yeah.<eos> - Butthole.<eos> - Stop saying it! Seriously--<eos> Butthole sends you over the edge?<eos> - Yes, it's awful. - Really?<eos> Maybe you don't like it 'cause you're imagining his butthole right now and now there's a very adorable little sentry guarding it and you no longer have access to said butthole.
California Bureau of Investigation.<eos> Now put the gun down.<eos> Yeah, I remember those clowns from Visualize.<eos> That land's right next to mine.<eos> Killed everything they--they touched.<eos> Plus they were thieves.<eos> Why thieves?<eos> Well, they stole my damn water.<eos> I got a stream up that way.<eos> They diverted it into their fields, like I wouldn't notice.
I was riding along when she made a visit in the area.<eos> And she said she wanted to check on them to see what was going on.<eos> It had rained that day... So the ground was wet.<eos> You stay here.<eos> I'll be just a minute.<eos> Next thing I knew, I heard someone shouting.<eos> Don't tell me what to do!<eos> There are laws.<eos> I don't care about any of your laws! Laws that say this animal has to be fed and taken care of!<eos> And if you won't take care of it, I will report you!
Yeah, get some rest.<eos> Ever since then I've been nothing but lies.<eos> Rain...<eos> It's raining again today in Kanto.<eos> Here at Shinjuku Station's south exit, the commuters all have umbrellas in their hands.<eos> July<eos> Here, this is for you.<eos> For me?<eos> I've always ended up eating your food, see...<eos> And you said you wanted it, right?
Tell her I said thank you and I look forward to having her over for tea as soon as I'm settled in.<eos> I will.<eos> Is Jason back, too?<eos> He's down South.<eos> Renovating grandma D's place.<eos> It's a beautiful house, but she let things go.<eos> And it smells like old people.<eos> Ali hated that smell.<eos> It's good to hear someone say her name.<eos> People avoid it.
Bye, Mr. Fitz.<eos> He was shot multiple times.<eos> And the place that he was killed was a different location than where the body was found.<eos> Says that time of death...<eos> thank you... was between ten and midnight.<eos> Which is when we were at the lodge.<eos> So, we can't use that as an alibi.<eos> Eat.<eos> And "A" knows that they're going to figure out fire was arson.<eos> And who would believe that we were there and we didn't start it?
You could actually fucking quit, Davis.<eos> Thank you so much, you guys.<eos> We are Annie Tee and Her Bayou Cadillac.<eos> And don't step away. Michael Doucet and BeauSoleil are up next.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Hey, Annie. ( speaks French )<eos> And love the name of the band, by the way. - You do?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You don't mind?<eos> - No, we take it as a compliment.

Well, yesterday, one of my kids got the clap.<eos> Robert.<eos> Had to take him to a clinic for some treatment.<eos> A little young for that.<eos> Eh, not too young.<eos> Caught a dose from an older gal from around the way.<eos> Every neighborhood's got one. - Yeah, I know.<eos> - Don't get all nostalgic now.<eos> Shoot, I can't even remember that girl's name.<eos> If you knew it to begin with.
Let me think on that.<eos> And that was Stoudamire?<eos> Tom Stoudamire.<eos> The lieutenant in charge of intake that shift.<eos> So, he comes back to your station and asks for Gilday's personal effects. You give him the envelope.<eos> Was it sealed?<eos> You see him open it?<eos> Oh, he opens it.<eos> Dumps it out on the counter in front of him.<eos> He takes the inhaler, walks into the outer office and I see him toss it in a trash can in the corner.
He hates me so much.<eos> He likes money more.<eos> What'd you give him?<eos> 100% of nothing.<eos> You know something?<eos> I spent time in this town, made a lot of money.<eos> And a friend of mine, a cousin, actually, once asked me if I ever built anything or if anything ever got fixed for all that I got paid.<eos> When you put your sign up, take a little penknife, carve my initials in the bot of that sucker, okay?<eos> I'll do more than that.<eos> You got this corner table any time you want it, gratis.
Aw, man.<eos> I left it on "record," too.<eos> Well... anything you wanna say before I go?<eos> No, I-I think I've... Said enough.<eos> Okay, I don't want Kim to see all the hurtful things I said about her. Now let's just get in, get the camera, and get out.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can do this.<eos> I just read a book on lock picking.<eos> Why can't you read "Fifty Shades of Gray" like every other old woman?<eos> Well, I will, when you give it back to me.
It's pretty good.<eos> I mean, I feel like the hardest part is always getting started, but I have a lot of great ideas that are forming in my brain--<eos> - Where's your dustpan? - Uh, I don't know.<eos> You know, I think what's most stressful with this is that it's my first book.<eos> It's like, with a first book, you have this duty to express yourself<eos> - in a really clear way that's--<eos> - Hannah... whether you write this book or not, it's not gonna change anything.<eos> This book doesn't matter.<eos> That's the first thing you need to know.<eos> It's not gonna matter to the people who read it or to you.
Look, Finch, I understand your pain.<eos> I do. But I'm not gonna let innocent people die just to soothe your guilty conscience.<eos> So you can help me or not, but I'm gonna do this with or without you.<eos> I cannot let you do that. I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Give me that book!<eos> - You're making a mistake.<eos> - Give me that book, kid.<eos> There's gotta be another way.<eos> And I'm gonna... I'm gonna find it.
You mean I've been hurting guilty people?<eos> But Buster was a peaceful man.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Pilot down!<eos> Medic! It was the kind of emergency that the drone pilot paramedics had long been waiting for.<eos> I got a man down!<eos> Sorry we're late.<eos> Some kid swallowed an eye at the Build-A-Bear.<eos> Why do they have us at a mini-mall?<eos> It was the first known injury to a drone pilot and the Army took it seriously.
Carlton, you gonna be late for work again.<eos> And tell the tramp laying next to you not to leave her nasty drawers on my banister.<eos> (doorbell rings) Have to get a haz-mat suit and a pair of tongs.<eos> Good morning, Nana.<eos> - What's good about it?<eos> I got woken up at 4:00 in the a.m. by some drunk Russian girl thinking my bedroom was the commode.<eos> Ah, Carl brought home another one, huh?<eos> Each one nastier than the last.<eos> The boy always did pick low-hanging fruit, but this one was a road apple.<eos> Yeah, I get his morning-after recap every day, whether I want it or not.
Only your struggle.<eos> I know this because I have seen it.<eos> I've lived it. And I promised myself I would never put myself in the position to live through it again. And yet, here I am, trying to save the life of yet another man who--<eos> No, no, no, no, no. No need to save me. - I'm fine.<eos> - Yes, yes, yes.<eos> That's exactly what he said, and then I lost him.<eos> A patient.<eos> Grief, Agent Nielson, real, gut-wrenching grief is not something you can power through or ignore.<eos> There's no detours, no shortcuts.<eos> You look it in the eye and you do battle, and you keep doing battle until you are finished with it, and it is finished with you.
I was just trying to avoid being hypocritical.<eos> I am an atheist.<eos> WOMAN: Really?<eos> Don't you worry about how that will play in a state where only 15 percent call themselves nonreligious?<eos> MADDIE:<eos> I worry about everything, but I am who I am. And I don't think you should run away from that.<eos> Let's just let the voters decide.<eos> WOMAN: And what about you, Mr. State's Attorney?<eos> I respect Maddie's point of view.<eos> WOMAN: But you don't share it?
- This line of questioning... Your Honor, this is absolutely relevant.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> This is nothing like a real court experience.<eos> Because you are not addressing me as the plaintiff.<eos> The only reason you know his daughter's name is because<eos> - he's our client. - That would happen in court, Mr. Gardner.<eos> - He would be goaded into telling... HOWARD: That's enough!<eos> (banging gavel) Let's have a little quiet, please.<eos> Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.<eos> You got a problem, you bring it to me.
- So?<eos> Maybe the kids will read it.<eos> - God Almighty!<eos> - How much is it?<eos> - Aquarterkurush.<eos> - Give him a quarter.<eos> - It's all I have anyway.<eos> - Take it and go.<eos> - Here, the book.<eos> I don't want it!
Oh, yeah, skip it. Skip it.<eos> Go to him. I'll bring you back a sandwich and a six-toed husband.<eos> - Maybe if she landed at a different base...<eos> - Gary.<eos> This is not your area of expertise.<eos> (LAUGHING) It's just typing into a calendar.<eos> - I'm sorry, Sue.<eos> Your job is really difficult.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - You do it very efficiently.
That's my dad.<eos> Jesus, he doesn't look like he's dying.<eos> My family was guilt-tripping the shit out of me and so I exaggerated to come visit.<eos> Besides, a dying dad can be a get-out-of-jail-free card.<eos> - Like with Furlong.<eos> - Wow. That is cold.<eos> Also kind of hot.<eos> (SPEAKING WITH MOUTH FULL) and as a homeland for the Jewish people while at the same time we support a settled homeland for the Palestinians.<eos> I can still see the pig's ass.<eos> You're not blocking it.
Then you could rate how stupid they were depending on how silly their deaths were.<eos> Neither the American government nor anybody else appreciated the site.<eos> I had a spare line which I let him use for the site.<eos> It was from British Telecom.<eos> Someone at the US State Department called the head of British Telecom.<eos> He called the head of the operator in Sweden where I worked.<eos> So the US government ordered us to remove the site.<eos> We fought them for a long time before we removed it.<eos> We argued that it was freedom of speech and parody.<eos> After a while we closed it down, when it became too much of a fuss.
- Don't you "Jesus" me.<eos> People put all sorts of stuff in.<eos> Once I found a parakeet.<eos> - You're kidding.<eos> - It's true.<eos> You've no idea.<eos> Nothing goes into the coffin.<eos> - It's just a tiny flower.<eos> - Sure, to you it's just a tiny flower.<eos> Okay, I'll put it in her hand.
Hey, Wade.<eos> Lavon, what are you...<eos> No, I know I said<eos> I was done in the romance department, but these last few days I've helped couples find each other in war zones and... among the undead.<eos> But it made me realize that... this is worth fighting for.<eos> Now, I-I know you got your girl code, but I will wait.<eos> That's all.<eos> ♪ Hey.<eos> You would not believe the night I've had.<eos> I got so lost. This place is not easy to find-- maybe that's why they call it Tricky Rick's.
Oh, mm-hmmm, good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll gladly send you a tin of those.<eos> Well, you have your certificate.<eos> Oh, honey!<eos> A little finishing touch here.<eos> Oh, that's creepy.<eos> I am looking for a ride share to Sacramento.<eos> Yeah, good job on the flier.<eos> Put it up here.
Sharks in the city. Fine with everyone.<eos> Here's a great one.<eos> "Rats often bite young children and infants on the face because of the smell of food residues on the children."<eos> That makes us sound like we're an undiscerning species.<eos> Actually we have very refined tastes.<eos> It is really mean.<eos> It's like the meanest book.<eos> The whole staff loves it?<eos> They love this book.<eos> Everyone's reading it?
And the director of the movie even asked me if you were single.<eos> What?<eos> (Brakes screech) Why didn't you say something sooner?<eos> (Gasps) He's, like, half my age.<eos> (Men speaking indistinctly) Oh, my God. I'm attractive to a whole new generation.<eos> Mom, maybe you should keep moving.<eos> (Laughs) Keep moving.<eos> Oh, look, he's already got a cheese knife.<eos> Let's just drop...<eos> let's drop it off at the food bank.
So, let's try this out.<eos> When you think of Maeve, what's the first thing that comes to mind?<eos> Thomas Merton.<eos> What about him?<eos> In her letters, she... will always sign up with... a quote... from one of her favorite philosophers.<eos> Camus, Voltaire, Plato.<eos> When we had the near miss at the restaurant a couple of weeks ago, she... left me a book with a... a quote by Thomas Merton... written inside.<eos> He said... "Love is our true destiny.<eos> "We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone.<eos> "We find it with another."
Now come in alone.<eos> Reid.<eos> Put it on.<eos> I can't take the blindfold off?<eos> No.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi.<eos> I was hoping you'd figure out my riddle.<eos> I-I mean, I knew you would.<eos> The fun was just... how fast you'd do it.
I can't quite see... but you would if I let it survive.<eos> Is that bad, seeing a picture?<eos> Isn't that the point?<eos> So where are you guys from?<eos> We're nomads.<eos> We're just in from Bavaria.<eos> Bavaria, really?<eos> That's where mad Ludwig's castle is.<eos> I've always wanted to see that.<eos> The way he saw it, or the way it is?
Late last year, I found unsuccessful New York playwright Chester Winkle dead in his extended-stay hotel room.<eos> Among his belongings were a hot plate, a stack of Baby Gap catalogs, and 12 American Dad episodes he had written for the stage in one cocaine-fueled night.<eos> They were literally the finest collection of words ever put to paper.<eos> And now, we're proud to present the only one of Mr. Winkle's plays I didn't eat out of sheer jealousy:<eos> Blood Crieth Unto Heaven.<eos> (clears throat loudly) Shh!<eos> Hurry, everyone!<eos> Stan'll be here any moment.<eos> Do you think he'll like my gift, Mother?<eos> If it's anything like you, sweet Steven, I'm sure he'll adore it.
I miss us... having a ton of sex.<eos> You... look tired.<eos> Smith residence, Francine speaking.<eos> You silly, stupid girl.<eos> Hello, Betty.<eos> Does this mean you won't be coming to your only son's birthday party?<eos> There's a reason Stan hasn't celebrated his birthday since he was a child.<eos> Why couldn't you just leave well enough alone?<eos> Enough!<eos> You and I have a very strained relationship and we both know it!
I wish things could've been different, Bets.<eos> I never stopped loving you, Jack.<eos> (sobbing) No, no...<eos> Not again!<eos> Everything's been my fault.<eos> All these years we'll never get back.<eos> Here's your present, Papa!<eos> Steve!<eos> Let me guess: you don't have time.<eos> Well, how 'bout I open it for you?
But...do you remember this?<eos> The scientist makes a thing called a ghost cell which he puts into a buffalo.<eos> The buffalo's killed, fed to the man, and the man rots. Yeah.<eos> It's what all the BSE conspiracy stuff was based on. Yeah, yeah.<eos> Look, and then Grant's drawings.<eos> The scientist creates a god with two faces and the god goes inside the ghost cell.<eos> Roman mythology!<eos> A god with two faces.<eos> It's Janus.<eos> And that's how they get it into us.
The manuscript's here, but I'm warning you not to take it.<eos> Don't do what I did.<eos> Don't find out the truth about our father.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> You look more gorgeous every day... Jesus Christ!<eos> Stop that!<eos> Why's everybody hitting me?<eos> You're selling it? ! You're selling it to them?<eos> !<eos> You only want it from me so you can give it to them!
He's with them!<eos> No, no, Alice!<eos> It's OK!<eos> It's all right!<eos> Fuck, Ian, you brought him here? !<eos> No, my name is Michael Dugdale.<eos> I'm with the Department of Health.<eos> I'll cut your fucking face off!<eos> I know where the vaccine is.<eos> They're releasing it tomorrow.
Stay with him. - All right.<eos> Jane.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Lorelei shot him.<eos> He had a pulse but it's gone. - Where is she?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Jane, let me take over.<eos> I got it, I got it.<eos> He knows who Red John is.<eos> - He had a pulse. I can't find it anymore.
Henry?<eos> Henry!<eos> Come to your mother.<eos> Come on, you must remember me?<eos> Go on, Henry.<eos> Lady Mother.<eos> Henry, I miss you very much and I would have come sooner, but I have been made to live very far away from you.<eos> It is punishment for my loyalties.<eos> Henry, the wicked York king, has taken your title.<eos> But we will get it back for you.
I hate the name Olivia.<eos> She's my baby, I can call her what I like.<eos> I don't need permission from you or your family or your bloody church.<eos> Fine. Then I'm calling her...<eos> Angela.<eos> That is a horrible name!<eos> That's what I want. Rubbish!<eos> You just saw it just then on the waitress' nametag.<eos> No, I didn't, I've always loved the name Angela.<eos> And I'm going to shorten it to Angie.
Yeah, but look!<eos> He's heading right for the Candy Kingdom!<eos> And he's too big to duke it out with.<eos> Unless...<eos> Giant poison candy aspirin.<eos> I've got this one, but it might be too small.<eos> No. We'll kick him in his heart 'til he's history.<eos> Those must've been Lemonjon's guts we saw before.<eos> His heart is his weak spot.<eos> Yeah, but we'll never find it again in time.
Previously on Once Upon A Time...<eos> - Uhh! - What the hell is that?<eos> - It's poison.<eos> - We need to get him back. - The captain's ship.<eos> The "Jolly Roger" instead of a car?<eos> It's Regina. She's working with Cora to find Gold's dagger.<eos> The dagger controls him.<eos> If Cora gets it, she can force Gold and all his power to do her bidding.
It's just, uh...<eos> Sweetheart, I... I'm dying.<eos> I'm, uh... I'm... I'm so sorry.<eos> I know that you're... you're confused about who you are.<eos> So I'm gonna tell ya.<eos> You are a hero who helped your people.<eos> You're a beautiful woman who loved an ugly man.<eos> Really, really loved me.<eos> You find goodness in others.<eos> And when it's not there, you create it.
No, no. I'm good.<eos> Let me do some more digging.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm gonna talk to the hotel clerk, see what he knows.<eos> Where did everybody go?<eos> Tracking that vamp.<eos> Well, I think we got a problem a lot closer to home.<eos> Look at this.<eos> See that blue van?<eos> My brother saw it outside the hotel yesterday.
Andy is great.<eos> And on the surface, he was there for me and very supportive. But then he kind of got fed up when it was so much about me and my career.<eos> And when push came to shove, he felt like he had to pull away for his own well-being.<eos> Oh, my God, we are Rihanna and Chris Brown!<eos> But I'm Chris Brown.<eos> Speaking of Chris Brown, I'm gonna start to batter.<eos> How's that stove?<eos> Warm, but it's really wobbly.<eos> Yeah, it wobbles, it smokes, and one time it burned me.<eos> That's why I nicknamed it "Mom."
- Go into it! Go further!<eos> - Go, keep going.<eos> - Keep going!<eos> - Keep going, Chrissy. Do it.<eos> Do it!<eos> All their dirty little stories, all the things they did, those fucking cunts!<eos> All the things they expected of her... but filled her with so much fear she couldn't even dream about them!<eos> She hid it all away in a hole.<eos> You're going to lose your soul.<eos> "But the more she filled it, the more she hid..." "from those whispers, the stronger they became."
I just got back to work.<eos> And, Derek, you just got your hand back.<eos> Don't you want to just work?<eos> Work where?<eos> I don't want somebody telling me which patients I can and can't treat.<eos> Or putting a stopwatch on how much time you can spend with them.<eos> Yeah, if we ran the place, we could make policy decisions based on experience.<eos> Do y... Uh, no offense, but that is a naive way of putting it.<eos> The job is much harder than you think.<eos> I wanted it once, and I hated it.
When's his birthday?<eos> What's his favorite color?<eos> Is he outraged that the Monkees are not in the rock and roll hall of fame?<eos> I don't know any of those things. I only knew him for 24 hours.<eos> Tepid tragedy.<eos> Does that mean that he wasn't the love of my life?<eos> How long did it take for you to fall for the love of your life?<eos> Not long.<eos> There's a storm coming.<eos> I can always feel it in my dance leg.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> You wouldn't be too much competition.<eos> All I have to do is sign here, and it is official.<eos> Put down that pen, Danny.<eos> We're gonna get more. More?<eos> The jewelry that you gave her, those savings bonds from her grandparents.<eos> The diaphragm that she got using your health coverage.<eos> I don't want a diaphragm. Well, sell it.<eos> Use it for a yarmulke.<eos> We're getting it.
Like mice running a maze of his own design.<eos> Oh, speaking of vermin.<eos> What is it with you and that woman?<eos> It's obviously more than just hating profilers.<eos> If you're asking if we had sex, the answer is yes, obviously.<eos> Oh, so she's an ex?<eos> More like a "C," C-plus at best.<eos> We had an arrangement while she was in London, similar to the arrangement<eos> I have with other women here in New York. We performed the act of love loudly and repeatedly, without any actual love, or even any like.<eos> I would describe it as an act of self-love were it not for the fact that she was technically present.
I'm gonna save you, and then Holmes is gonna save Emily, and then that'll be that.<eos> All I ask is you get out that door, okay?<eos> I imagine that you learned about the robbery he'd perpetrated after you infiltrated the cartel.<eos> You know, they were never able to find him or the money.<eos> But then again, they didn't have the resources of a powerful government agency behind them, did they?<eos> I imagine you found his name from Emily's Social Security information?<eos> Am I close?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I want you to transfer the money now.<eos> As soon as I see it in my account, I will let your friends go.
Identical to the one ship, and the design of the Russian boats.<eos> French ship?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> North Star sailed from few days before the Polar Star.<eos> But if you have passed Despite this island, why there is no trace of them?<eos> Welcome to North Star!<eos> Cho, boat!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Cho, you prolupao?<eos> Clip the boat, I'll take it current!
What are you talking about?<eos> We have a candle stand.<eos> We gotta do something.<eos> We gotta make money off this place.<eos> - By doing what?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's got grass and trees.<eos> What about picnics?<eos> Picnics?<eos> We should go into the lucrative business of people bringing their own food and eating it on our lawn?
no drugs, no guns, no girls.<eos> This wouldn't involve drugs or guns or girls.<eos> Well, not dirty girls. There would be girls, though.<eos> - I was joking.<eos> I joke sometimes. - Oh, okay.<eos> Well, you know all that land that Fanny Flowers and I own?<eos> Well, it's just kinda sitting there idle, and I was wondering if you'd like to buy any of it.<eos> It's not zoned for commercial development, so what could I possibly do with it?<eos> Oh, I don't know. Bocce, croquet?<eos> It's great land. The candle guy loves it.
I wasn't wearing that necklace last night.<eos> That necklace was at my home in my bedroom.<eos> You heard what Russell just said-- now, come on.<eos> Just tell me-- did you find that necklace in the hotel room?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, come on, let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ronald Basderic.<eos> Been terrorizing Edie for six months.<eos> I tried to help her get a restraining order, but the judge denied it.
But you made me, Ronald.<eos> You discredit me at my job, you get me arrested, you go after my mother? !<eos> You don't really think you can get away with this.<eos> I don't really care.<eos> Somebody needs to stop you.<eos> You have ruined so many lives.<eos> And now I'm gonna ruin yours.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> I removed the firing pin when I was in your house.<eos> Don't worry, I'll put it back.
Do you, little mami?<eos> Do you?<eos> That's a pretty good Geoffrey.<eos> Well, this sucks.<eos> Welcome to the entertainment business, honey.<eos> But here's what I don't get...<eos> If it's so hard, why do people keep doing it?<eos> And why do you keep doing it?<eos> 'Cause I have to.<eos> Artists who do what they do, they do it because they love it, not for money or fame.
- Oh, that would be perfect.<eos> So the whole world knows, but i don't.<eos> Just like before, right?<eos> - 16 years. - Mr. Murphy--<eos> - Don't even try.<eos> - I'm a gay man.<eos> I like to go out and i like to meet people.<eos> - You like to meet people for sex.<eos> - I enjoy sex. It makes me feel alive.<eos> I never do it to hurt anyone.
Okay then.<eos> Help me pick out a new dress?<eos> By my reckoning, you rank the best person for Office Manager.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Glad you could see that.<eos> But I can't give you the job.<eos> Not now.<eos> Not after the mixer.<eos> I deserve that job.<eos> I earned it. I know you did.
Oh, I'll tell you what you can do, you sanctimonious sack of shit.<eos> You will stop your persecution of vampires.<eos> You will rescind your order to shut down vampire-run businesses.<eos> And you will prosecute all human-on-vampire crime to the fullest extent of the law.<eos> As a matter of fact, you now love all vampires.<eos> - Guards.<eos> - Move in.<eos> Sorry, son, but that shit's not gonna work anymore.<eos> Yeah, we figured out your hypnosis trick.<eos> What did you all call it?
- Or was she temporarily blind--<eos> - You know what? All that matters is that you got married, and you're happy.<eos> So as all-time best man, I suggest we raise a cone to Jerry Gergich.<eos> Jerry Gergich.<eos> Jerry! - Thank you.<eos> - Aw, jeez.<eos> No worries, Gary.<eos> Oh, thanks, Sherm.<eos> How did you have that ready so fast?<eos> I always make a backup cone. He drops it about half the time.
Madness indeed.<eos> I love this!<eos> Usually you can only get board game t-shirts in XXL.<eos> I just remembered.<eos> We left Jerry back at the gas station in Martinsville.<eos> I'll go get him.<eos> Ah, that guy's the best.<eos> I feel bad he didn't get to have his moment last night.<eos> Hey, you know what we should do for him?<eos> Yeah, get him a pet snake, but I keep it.
My theory-This is a great way to transport something If you don't want people to look at it.<eos> So it's just another cover story. All right.<eos> Let's print out a list Of every 41 trust property and clinic.<eos> Let's see which ones are related to biohazardous materials- Toxins, viruses, that kind of thing.<eos> Hank, it's a massive organization.<eos> There's hundreds of properties.<eos> Then let's get started.<eos> I had a funny feeling i'd find you in here.<eos> I'm missing an important file on r.N.A. Replication.<eos> I can't do any more work until i find it.
Previously on "Once Upon A Time"...<eos> I was in an accident.<eos> You're not gonna believe what I saw.<eos> If I own that dagger, I control The Dark One.<eos> - Don't break our deal!<eos> - I have to!<eos> Papa!<eos> Do you remember that favor you owe me, Ms. Swan?<eos> I'm cashing it in.
It's not me he wants.<eos> It's Gold... and his hook.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna enjoy throwing his ass in jail.<eos> Hook isn't the problem, David.<eos> - Tell that to my head.<eos> - It's Regina.<eos> She's been lying to us.<eos> She's working with Cora to find Gold's dagger.<eos> The dagger controls him.<eos> If Cora gets it, she can force Gold and all his power to do her bidding.
It's what my mother taught me.<eos> How many more lives is following that lesson going to take away from me?<eos> You can't let Cora make you lose faith in who you are... someone who does the right thing.<eos> You know, that's exactly what she wants.<eos> I made the "right" decision when I stopped Regina's execution all those years ago... When it could've saved us all of this heartache.<eos> I made the "right" decision when I sent Emma through the wardrobe alone, and we didn't see her first steps.<eos> I made the "right" decision when I let my own mother die from Cora's poison.<eos> And we keep beating them.<eos> At what cost?<eos> All I want is our happy ending. It's time. We've earned it.

It's time. We've earned it.<eos> No more lives lost. No more hearts broken.<eos> The dagger... It's useless until Gold returns to Storybrooke.<eos> We have time. We'll get it back.
(Dallas) Sorry I can't take your call right now.<eos> I'm doing me.<eos> Leave a message and I'll return when I'm ready to do you. (Beep)<eos> Hey, Dallas, it's George.<eos> Uh, so let me see... you took off without saying good-bye, and now you're not answering my calls.<eos> So I'm guessing you're still upset with me.<eos> Could you call me back please so we can talk?<eos> (Lowered voice) Leave your number.<eos> (Lowered voice) She... she has my number.<eos> I like to leave it again just in case.
I just wish the hell I knew why.<eos> Okay.<eos> We all know it's a tough nut to crack.<eos> Dan's got the only plan that might get us by those Mech emplacements.<eos> It's tactically unsound. It's damn near insane.<eos> On the other hand, it just might work. I like the sound of it already.<eos> The main entrance is heavily guarded by Mechs.<eos> We'll never get through it.<eos> Our only hope is to come through these dense woods, down this cliff. Get them from behind.<eos> But no matter how good the plan is, if our spy leaks it to the enemy, we'll be walking into an ambush.
These Mega-Mechs, they're part of the forces the Espheni want to use against Charleston.<eos> We deny them their fuel, we knock these pieces off the board.<eos> Will the Volm be joining us on this mission?<eos> No, they will not.<eos> We can't leave the city unprotected.<eos> You will take a small unit of our best fighters.<eos> General Bressler's troops will stay on the perimeter, and the Volm will stay in Charleston to assist them.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We still haven't talked about the elephant in the room.<eos> I can get a team close enough to destroy the reactor with one of Cochise's big guns. But if we blow it up, we're going to spew radioactive fallout sky high.
Right!<eos> I declare this cheeky little day ready and open for the business we call life!<eos> Gary, look at you in your own restaurant.<eos> Are you renaming it?<eos> What? "Gary's"?<eos> What's wrong with Gary's?<eos> Well, it's like a greasy spoon.<eos> Yeah, it's like, it's like a chippy, Gary's, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, seriously, what are you calling it?
It's classified.<eos> That's funny, that's funny.<eos> Sorry, man, I'm not risking my life for this.<eos> Ocean's too unforgiving.<eos> You think I haven't seen worse than you, bro?<eos> We are looking for a three-meter torpedo canister.<eos> It weighs at least a hundred kilos.<eos> Where is it? I don't know.<eos> That's why I need you.<eos> Who else is looking for it?
Thank you very much.<eos> How did it go? Went good.<eos> He said yes.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Yeah, he's in the bathroom right now.<eos> I'm just... I'm gonna go home and pack.<eos> Not bad for day three as a dad, if I do say so myself. Wait.<eos> Where's his backpack?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> He took it with him.
M... mister... Mr. Gold, I'm...<eos> I'm so sorry about what happened back there. I... I...<eos> I didn't know that you two were still together.<eos> We're not.<eos> Oh, so we're good then, right?<eos> There's no hard feelings?<eos> You know, I have tried so hard to be on my best behavior.<eos> But I guess there's no point now.<eos> Looks like you won't be needing that bow anymore.<eos> Actually, I think I'll hold onto it. You never know.
Sorry about your father.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Do the folks back at the home office know anything about it?<eos> Yeah. They did.<eos> And you're never gonna believe what it does.<eos> A trigger?<eos> That will destroy Storybrooke.<eos> No.<eos> I had a fail-safe built into the curse.<eos> Then why exactly were you carrying it around?
Well, in that outfit, finding her should be easy.<eos> Teach me my mother's shape-shifting spell, allow me to hide.<eos> It took your mother months to learn that.<eos> You?<eos> Well, perhaps in a week, you'll be able to, uh... Change your hair?<eos> Highlights?<eos> Maybe.<eos> If I can't do the spell, you can.<eos> Put it on me.<eos> If I do, you won't control it, and you won't have any magic while the spell is working.
You know what That's not your concern.<eos> It's not ours, either.<eos> Not your concern?<eos> So you're telling me you don't know who commands you?<eos> Unlike you, Hook, we believe in something.<eos> We have faith in the sacredness of our cause.<eos> We're here.<eos> So your sacred cause is pilfering a dwarf's pickaxe?<eos> Regina... had this in her pocket when you turned her over to us.<eos> It's a trigger, and this axe, according to our people, is what activates it.
You know, I think it hits men especially hard when they're unemployed.<eos> Yeah, but even worse than that is the new therapy that he's on.<eos> Hey, Mark.<eos> Oh, hey, Colleen.<eos> You need help, you want me to get you something?<eos> No, I don't need help, I'm not five.<eos> Where's my lucky glass?<eos> It's next to the books.<eos> I'm at the books.<eos> I see it right in front of you.
Do I ever?<eos> It's an affidavit for a wiretap for Rizzo's phone.<eos> They're looking for information pertaining to the murder of Diane Desmond.<eos> She O.D.'d.<eos> My hands are clean.<eos> There's a confidential informant who's been feeding information to one of my A.D.A.'s.<eos> Whoever it is, they say Rizzo killed her.<eos> It has to be someone in your organization.<eos> I want this rat's name.<eos> The A.D.A. won't give it up.
I can't believe that son of a bitch made me do that.<eos> He's the boss.<eos> So what are you gonna do?<eos> Ah, Rizzo's been a disaster ever since he took care of Angelo.<eos> This guy's either gonna bankrupt us, get us all killed or thrown in jail.<eos> If he wasn't around anymore, this whole case would go away.<eos> Are you saying what I think you're saying?<eos> He's a damn animal.<eos> And I'm sick of cleaning up after him.<eos> We ask permission from Chicago, we'll never get it.
Fireworks?<eos> We'd pack the Cavalcade if we got some, they're such a rare treat nowadays.<eos> Yeah. Not a "booming" business.<eos> Hardy har.<eos> Ever since I went to go visit my dad in the internment camp the police have been giving me a hard time.<eos> Marco, there's nothing illegal, about a man buying fireworks during his off-hours.<eos> I know. It's just, they got me chasing my own tail, you know.<eos> Sorry.<eos> There's one place,<eos> Vinzo DiCarlo's son Frankie runs it.
The pictures?<eos> I took one at the funeral.<eos> Soyou don't want anything?<eos> A picture of the deceased is something.<eos> Seeing his face soothes you, is that it?<eos> Forget it<eos> Yes.<eos> I loved my grandfather and I played his piano, so I want my grandfather's piano.<eos> Thierry wants it<eos> If my brother wants it...

Did you call him 'papa'?<eos> Did you call him by his name?<eos> I called him "m. "<eos> Will you come find me at school?<eos> You'll be here on Sunday?<eos> "Did you think about my sister's birthday? '<eos> That's a 'tu. " 80 that I exist a little.<eos> I want the ball, as an inheritance.<eos> Can I have it?<eos> Thieny doesn't want it for his daughter?
"A love battle'<eos> Because 'sessions' means I have to pay you.<eos> I told you it was free.<eos> But if you want to pay, no problem.<eos> Did you get your piano?<eos> You'll need to fight harder against your estimable family.<eos> I deserve some of the rage you pour into me, but with your family you should exert yourself a little more.<eos> You get distracted by me.<eos> It's a pointless waste of energy.<eos> The day when you want the piano, you'll win it easily.

Then I'm going lo concentrate on my piano.<eos> Think about how little your father cared about you.<eos> Youcangetit<eos> Slop talking about him!<eos> Wm].<eos> Gol<eos> Go save your piano and be done with your fucking familyl<eos> You want to save your piano and you can't even take half a round!<eos> I want my piano!<eos> And if I don't get it?

This morning I had a dream.<eos> Can I tell it to you?<eos> I see your eyes, in the distance, in the fog.<eos> I approach, and I see that you're a wolf.<eos> You scare me so much... that I can neither move nor flee.<eos> The wolf starts to circle around me.<eos> It comes up to my ass and smells again.<eos> I start to run as fast as I can.<eos> And when I can't run anymore, I see that the wolf isn't there.<eos> I stop, catch my breath... and I feel it on my neck.
- $200!<eos> - $300!<eos> - $400! - $400 right there! What?<eos> - I know how much Jimmy makes at the grocery store.<eos> - Where'd you get that kind of money? - I won 800 bucks coming in second place at a demolition derby.<eos> My Pacer is totaled. Look.<eos> If you care about me as a friend at all... $450! You won't do this.<eos> Okay, fine. I'll make you a deal.<eos> $475!<eos> You can keep the tape, but I would like to rent it on occasion.
Where you goin'?<eos> - Just hold up now.<eos> - You stole some of my salt pork.<eos> - I'll make my own way from here on.<eos> - Man, I ain't eat your food.<eos> I knowed you was a thief.<eos> You don't know a goddamn thing.<eos> What, you think I stole that shit?<eos> Why?<eos> You smell it on my breath?

We're ready.<eos> Hold on.<eos> We can clap outside of church.<eos> - Don't you clap in Poland?<eos> - At the theater...<eos> Poles are classy.<eos> What were you thinking marrying this Italian hick?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Agostino, why is Lorenzo wearing a wool suit in May?<eos> It was on sale, he can wear it this winter, too.
- You've been here before, right? - No.<eos> Your first time, like I thought.<eos> - I saw them. - Who?<eos> Alida and Tonino Rizzuti.<eos> Pay no attention to them. When they go in or out, just ignore them. - As if they were ghosts.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - We're going to a nice place now.<eos> - Where?<eos> It's a surprise.<eos> If I can find it, I'm a bit lost.
- I want you to leave me alone.<eos> - You're pissing me off.<eos> - Get lost, leave her alone.<eos> - He's acting tough!<eos> - Rebellion...<eos> - Stay out of this.<eos> - Huh?<eos> He said leave me alone.<eos> Shrimp, you only use your dick to piss.<eos> At least he uses it.
- That's not a style thing?<eos> - Aw, sweetie.<eos> What do you think of the dress?<eos> It's pretty.<eos> Okay, you guys want to know the truth?<eos> I have been putting off planning my wedding.<eos> It's just all the details are stressing me out.<eos> You end up fighting over tablecloths and whether or not the DJ should be able to play hot hot hot... No.<eos> Listen to me, busty Owen.<eos> We want a wedding, and we want it now.
But there's nothing I can do about it now.<eos> Actually, there is.<eos> I found a story about a kid in Great Britain who's eight and still nursing.<eos> Look!<eos> What?<eos> Oh, no! And he has braces?<eos> That poor woman.<eos> She clearly knows the benefits of breast milk, which is why I want in on yours.<eos> You are nine years old.<eos> I don't need to suck it out of you.
Oh, hey, Cash.<eos> Whatcha doin'?<eos> Workin' on your play?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I nailed that sucker.<eos> Boom! But now I gotta come up with something to follow my masterpiece. Pressure's on, mama.<eos> Yeah, but I've heard that the great writers keep tinkering on their masterpiece.<eos> You know, fixing all the stuff in it that's, um... wrong?<eos> Mom, tinkering is what ruined "Hamlet."<eos> Unlike Shakespeare, I know when to back off. Anyway, I-I was staring out at the ocean, wondering what story to tell next, and it hit me... a drama about a family of dolphins that kidnap a human baby and raise it as their own.
Dr. Charmelo?<eos> I, uh... I just wanted to reassure you, I'll hold my own on the team.<eos> I'm sure you will.<eos> You're obviously an excellent surgeon.<eos> Excuse me. Do you have a package for Dr. Charmelo?<eos> Uh, let me check.<eos> I, uh, read your paper in the archives last month.<eos> I didn't know anyone read those things. I do.<eos> But who cares who reads it?<eos> You wrote it.
I'd love to see you. Yeah, I'd love to see you too.<eos> There's something I need to talk to you about.<eos> I could swing by after work.<eos> Great.<eos> - I wanna strangle her.<eos> - Yeah, I know the feeling.<eos> But sometimes we need to restrain ourselves.<eos> So if she's convicted of a contract killing, that's the death penalty, right?<eos> Look, Julian, we just need the phone, okay?<eos> When you go in there, you see it, if you can grab it, great.
Looks like they're building something over there.<eos> Doesn't look guarded, though. Come on.<eos> Gee, thanks.<eos> What is this place?<eos> This is a kill house. They must be planning a mission.<eos> This will be challenging.<eos> Our enemy is well trained.<eos> And heavily armed.<eos> Their compound, an underground maze with only one way in or out.<eos> They call it "Division."
You got two weeks to figure it out.<eos> - He chipped away at me, you know?<eos> Every day.<eos> Your father.<eos> He convinced me that, not only wasn't I a worthy mother,<eos> I wasn't even a worthy person.<eos> I believed him.<eos> Then he started to do it to you.<eos> Every day another sidelong comment, another criticism.<eos> You remember it.
Lizards regrow limbs.<eos> Cosima, Kira's not a lizard.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, it's not magic.<eos> It's just stem cells, you know.<eos> Look, I have a guy who's sequencing the German's DNA alongside mine to see if the illness she had was genetic.<eos> If you want, I can give him samples of you and Kira to compare.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm not giving you our genetic material.<eos> You'll probably hand it over to Delphine.
Alone.<eos> Still got one working credit card.<eos> It's time we start enjoying our lives a little more.<eos> I already got Dec on board to take care of Carl.<eos> What do you say?<eos> How about "I love you"?<eos> And, um... I've got a gift of my own.<eos> Why do you have a check from Emily?<eos> And why are there so many zeroes?<eos> She wants us to convert it to a cashier's check and buy back the bar from Conrad.
Caterer number one's presentation was simple, mm, yet exhausting.<eos> Number two's was subtle and provocative, like a coy Dutch woman guarding a dark secret.<eos> Nothing you're saying is helpful.<eos> But number three's told a story-- a story from a book I wouldn't read but I would watch the movie of.<eos> That's nonsense.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna go with the first place.<eos> I really loved that appetizer.<eos> Oh, the mini-calzone?<eos> I wouldn't call it that. It was more like a savory pastry.
Congratulations. Nice work.<eos> And you're suspended.<eos> Remind me why again.<eos> You want the whole list or just, like, the good stuff that I underlined?<eos> What's going on in there?<eos> We're getting ready to transfer Thompson to Con Air, take him to Supermax.<eos> And Theo Tonin?<eos> He's gone underground, but we'll get him.<eos> Gentlemen, if you'll excuse us for a moment.<eos> You want to change the terms of your deal, then why don't you talk to the people who are gonna be most pissed off about it?
I'm just supposed to stand here while he runs his mouth?<eos> Just hit him in the gut next time or the balls.<eos> No. We're not gonna rob anybody.<eos> You're gonna take us to where you're keeping Shelby.<eos> Get whoever's guarding him to open the door.<eos> Then we're gonna go in and do what needs doing.<eos> Cobb will stay here with Ms Hawkins.<eos> Anything goes wrong, he kills her.<eos> Slow.<eos> Maybe tears the baby out, kills it separate.
You never even notice he's there.<eos> How long we gotta keep it here?<eos> Just until Jimmy gets back with that funeral truck.<eos> - Speaking of which, Jimmy...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Best you head on over to Paxton's.<eos> He said he's going to leave the key on the front tyre.<eos> Got it.<eos> Baby, you sure this is gonna work?<eos> Well, we're gonna wait for Jimmy to get back with that truck, then we're gonna load up this body, take it over to the funeral home, and we're gonna make the swap.
Ah.<eos> That explains it.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, can I have everybody in the briefing room?<eos> Moment of your time?<eos> Thanks.<eos> As you can see from the prospectus, the offer on the table fluctuates based upon how many of us get on board with the actual offer.<eos> Now, it also entails that the owner be carrying the loan himself.<eos> 70,000?<eos> He'll never take it.
Sometimes I wonder, if I had just been somewhere else...<eos> We denied it for months, because that's what you do.<eos> You deny it.<eos> You pretend it's not happening. You pretend it's all above board and it's appropriate, and the next thing you know, you're having sex in the coat closet at your brother's engagement dinner.<eos> Pete loves her. She's his wife.<eos> And she and I...<eos> Well, we have what we have.<eos> It might not be much, but it's what we have.<eos> You have nothing.<eos> You have a pile of secrets and lies, and you're calling it love.
Focus your energy on cases we can close.<eos> Efficiency is our most important tool.<eos> I get it.<eos> We want a quick, high-profile win to impress the bureau.<eos> There you go.<eos> You're gonna drop the case?<eos> No, I can't let a multi-million dollar forger go Just because it might not be an easy win.<eos> That's why they should have given you the job.<eos> They're gonna realise that.<eos> I don't want it.
Got it.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Then we shouldn't have any problem.<eos> I know that look. I don't like that look.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> I know how we can find the box in the Empire State Building.<eos> The scanner.<eos> That little device is worth a small Dubois.<eos> I can't just check it out like a library book.<eos> I'll use it while I'm supposed to be in Bellmiere's loft.
Oh, I was just... looking at your handiwork again.<eos> Dubois' handiwork.<eos> Stick to the ones in back.<eos> All right.<eos> Here it is.<eos> The calibration's off. It's completely unreadable.<eos> Yeah, I'm pulling him out of here.<eos> I'm gonna get some fresh air.<eos> You know what? The initial carving isn't working for me.<eos> That's exactly how I did it for Dubois.
Stay out of trouble, Caffrey.<eos> I will.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> That's what I like about you.<eos> Pratt: Your son has it, doesn't he?<eos> Tell me where he is right now.<eos> Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> That's your plan?<eos> Wherever the hell that thing is going, you're gonna bring it to me.
The danger there is cytotoxins, which can cause severe necrosis.<eos> So my dick's gonna fall off?<eos> Maybe. Aah!<eos> The bigger danger is neuro- and cardiotoxins which can cause respiratory failure, cardiac arrest...<eos> So the most important thing is for you to stay calm.<eos> Ew.<eos> Oh, boy. What?<eos> That's good, right?<eos> If my body's throwing up the poison? It might be.<eos> If you had drunk it.
Whoa whoa, take it down a notch, St. Louis! His head is not up his ass!<eos> How'd you know what he said?<eos> It was an eight-hour flight.<eos> Wow, did you learn Romansh?<eos> Who am I, Cypher?<eos> The gayest X-man?<eos> I dunno, Gambit looks like he knows his way around a pair of -<eos> Basta! Here is the access card to the Holy Father's private apartment.<eos> I assume you have a plan once inside?<eos> We call it the old switcheroo.
I'm here to file a will, please.<eos> "Ginger Gallagher"?<eos> Second one today.<eos> - What?<eos> - Had another will filed earlier.<eos> Um, how is that possible?<eos> Here, it's...<eos> Dated last year.<eos> It supersedes yours.<eos> Who the hell filed it?
- Aunt Ginger's.<eos> A will's no good without a death certificate.<eos> Yeah, we're gonna need a body too.<eos> - A real live body?<eos> - Not live.<eos> I'm here to file a will, please.<eos> Ginger Gallagher.<eos> Second one today.<eos> Supersedes yours.<eos> Who the hell filed it?
Maybe she's excited to have a grandchild, wants me to be properly motivated.<eos> And that doesn't freak you out?<eos> I'm like a professional athlete.<eos> If I think, it affects my performance.<eos> My job is to not think.<eos> Fuck!<eos> If you're gonna follow me to work, how about giving me a ride?<eos> Not your chauffeur, bro.<eos> Don't burn the milk.<eos> It's not good when you burn it.
But I say we keep hope alive.<eos> I got family down in Sedona.<eos> They have healing vortexes out there.<eos> Alternative treatments and stuff.<eos> Well, she just got home.<eos> We don't know what she needs yet.<eos> She seems nicer, though.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - You left your phone at home.<eos> You didn't have to bring it.
It would be like a build-a-bear workshop, but for hogs and honey pots.<eos> Yes, exactly! Jeannie gets it.<eos> Come on! Stupidest idea I've ever heard, Doug.<eos> It is the stupidest idea I've ever heard.<eos> No one wants a mold of their own penis.<eos> No, that's not what I'm saying. Of course not.<eos> No. But think about it, all right?<eos> He's away on business, she's at home all alone, missing her man.<eos> What does she do, huh?<eos> Reaches for the bottom drawer, opens it up. Two hands.
You're worried that if you take this job, things could change, just as things have changed for the better, right?<eos> Valid concern, don't you think?<eos> I-I've told you the story about my itinerant youth.<eos> Your parents and the Volkswagen bus.<eos> Dodge van. Sorry.<eos> That wasn't the life I would've chosen, but, you know, it's part of who I am, so I-I like change.<eos> But Barbara can't stand it.<eos> So, what, coming to Vegas...<eos> Did not thrill her.<eos> But she knew how much I wanted it, so...
Well, then... that's what we're going to do.<eos> Well...<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone's ever given me.<eos> And that's including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.<eos> I'm your girlfriend.<eos> That's my job.<eos> And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so... whatever you got me, you can return.<eos> No.<eos> No, after everything you didn't do for me tonight, I want you to have it.
I need to know how much hellfire is gonna rain down on me.<eos> I thought Teri knew about Cynthia.<eos> She does, but neither of them know about Lydia.<eos> Okay, so what's this lever do?<eos> That manipulates the secondary shaft.<eos> Oh, the secondary shaft.<eos> The lift capacity's up to 2,000 pounds.<eos> That's a lot of beets.<eos> Let's talk terms.<eos> If you agree to a 40-60 split on this tractor, I'll store it in one of my barns.
Come on. Have some fish.<eos> Maybe you change the face that you have the dog.<eos> After so many years, you continue the same.<eos> I guess it's much easier to throw puppy, but change itself.<eos> What?<eos> 3 days and 5 hours so he took Masters of the mine.<eos> I spoke with them, Julian.<eos> I told them it was a mistake, that prlozasis through a bad period, and that you failed to command.<eos> I know that you're not capable of to throw a puppy into the water.<eos> I would not throw it, do not you?
I just figured it out.<eos> We think maybe he was trying to con someone.<eos> Make them think he was selling them drugs.<eos> He wasn't trying to con anyone.<eos> He was just trying to make a few bucks.<eos> Couple years ago, some Canadian greaseballs came in here, and-and they start going on and on about the cheese, how it's cheaper here and more expensive there.<eos> They said if I could figure out a way to get it over the border, I could make four bucks a pound.<eos> Smuggling cheese?<eos> Low risk, high reward.<eos> "White gold," they'd call it.
Will you look at that, Harvey?<eos> Even Ms. Scott understands that being childless and unmarried doesn't make you damaged goods.<eos> But if that's how you're framing your argument, good luck.<eos> We'll see you in Bakersfield...<eos> And everywhere else.<eos> How could you not tell me that she'd had a hysterectomy?<eos> Because I just got the information on my way into the room.<eos> You could have taken five seconds to fill me in.<eos> I didn't fill you in because I wasn't sure you could play good cop.<eos> Because you weren't sure that I could play it, or because even when we're on the same side, you still want to win?
I'm... I'm... I'm awake.<eos> You know, maybe we should wait until tomorrow, until Dr. Cole's out of surgery and he can explain this himself.<eos> Explain what?<eos> You want what's best for Dr. Cole, right?<eos> I do.<eos> And if he were in some kind of trouble, you'd want to protect him, right?<eos> What did you find, Josh?<eos> Dr. Cole was on Ruben's flight to Jamaica.<eos> He used his credit card on the plane.<eos> I didn't know anything about the flight, I didn't book it.
Sit down.<eos> Sit down!<eos> Gonna need you to be a lot less combative.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> I knew you'd turn up.<eos> Claire had her doubts.<eos> You found the book?<eos> Of course you would have noticed the final chapter is missing.<eos> That's because we are writing it now.
- You know what? I never get anything. - I would like it.<eos> - I need a win.<eos> Give me the spot, or I'll kill you all!<eos> d Who's that girl?<eos> d d It's Jess. d 2x17 Parking Spot<eos> I park under an overpass.<eos> Guys, guys, guys, guys.<eos> We all have crappy parking.<eos> Guys, why don't we just all share the spot?<eos> We'll each get it for a day and a half every week, and then we split Sunday into six-hour shifts.
they have the bodies For pregnancy, certainly, But the wisdom, the spiritual certitude<eos> They're hardly more than girls.<eos> She served her purpose.<eos> She proved it could be done.<eos> Now it's time for the real work to begin.<eos> With the one that'll actually bear the child.<eos> Then who?<eos> Oh, theo...<eos> Don't you know?<eos> If I asked you for help, Would you give it to me?
It's-it's amazing.<eos> It's amazing, right?<eos> I mean, I think it'd be a little more impressive, uh, with 50,000 people in the stands, the greatest athletes of all time on the field, but it's... it's nice like this;<eos> I like this.<eos> This is... this is nice.<eos> I'm sorry that you had to miss the game because of me. I am.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> But look at it this way-- next year Peyton Manning's, like, he's virtually a lock for the Pro Bowl team again, right?<eos> All right, we've got the field for ten minutes, and then they got to cover it up.
Aim a little higher.<eos> A little higher.<eos> Now we just slowly pull the trigger.<eos> That felt good.<eos> Wanna know what she's thinking?<eos> Outta my head, Number Three.<eos> Okay, Miss Holly.<eos> I do want you to know something.<eos> There's plenty of other places I could've taken you today, places closer to town, but this place I brought you to, Terry and I practically grew up here.<eos> We called it Fort Bellefleur.
You have become quite the gourmet.<eos> Boss-man would have a bird if he knew we were up here.<eos> I'm done with them.<eos> Their rules, their boiled canteen chow.<eos> You hear they lace the stuff with saltpetre?<eos> Haven't heard that in the office.<eos> Well, they do say it's not natural for men and women to work together like we do.<eos> It's true.<eos> They used to put saltpetre in bullets.<eos> Now they use it to take the power out of our pistols.
Seymour and...<eos> Gabriel.<eos> You made these for them?<eos> Yeah, they come apart, see?<eos> So you can put them in the Post, and they can lend the air-support while our men are storming the beaches.<eos> They'll love them, Ivy.<eos> I'm a soldier, Betty.<eos> I could be shipped out at any time.<eos> So we make hay,<eos> I know the drill, every girl here is doing it.
- It is dying. I know, but it's fallen out of the thing.<eos> Got a baby bird.<eos> Emergency everyone.<eos> Look, found a baby bird.<eos> Hannah, found a baby bird.<eos> Fallen out of its nest so it's all weak and everything.<eos> Call the RSPCA.<eos> - Oh, I can't call the RSPCA, Derek.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I think you should put it back where you found it.
My Stan gave me that.<eos> My Dad.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> He sold his car to buy me that.<eos> Still, life goes on.<eos> 'They're here for the ring, aren't they?<eos> 'So obvious, so obvious.<eos> 'They want that ring when she goes.'<eos> If I could, I'd have a word with Marge and say,<eos> "Look, why don't you sell it?
I don't know a lot about art, but I know what I like.<eos> And I like pictures and models and posters of them...<eos> all these. Tom:<eos> Yeah, stripped-down, naked art.<eos> I like it.<eos> I like it, too. Mildred: Well, it was Victoria's taste.<eos> Maybe it runs in the family.<eos> Saucy.<eos> Well, we were both evacuated to the same boarding school, right out in the sticks.<eos> - Mildred: In a sea of mud we were, - and we loved it.
- That's cool.<eos> These were in the London Games.<eos> This is your grandfather's jockstrap.<eos> - I'm sure she'd like you to have that.<eos> - Just put it on the glove.<eos> - Yeah. Love that.<eos> - There we go.<eos> This is the prize of all.<eos> This is Victoria's shot put.<eos> I can't lift the damn thing, but she used to chuck it.
Um, she was with someone.<eos> - Some guy called Clint.<eos> - Clint?<eos> It was closure, actually. It felt nice.<eos> Although she did do this thing where she'd-- that kind of, you know-- "Hey, Tom," you know?<eos> She'd kind of drop her head to one side. I'm like, "I'm not having that."<eos> So then I was like, "Oh, I'm fine.<eos> How are you?" She was wearing red lipstick.<eos> I used to love when she would wear red lipstick.<eos> She would never wear it for me because she thought it looked too slutty.
What are you doing with this?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's my dress.<eos> You steal from gypsy?<eos> No, it's-- I'm being a maid in it.<eos> It's for the feast of St. Krakowitz.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> You know, in the village?<eos> What's that-- the feast?<eos> We've done it for, like, centuries.
I'm ashamed to say, I don't care for her.<eos> No offense, but she's too American.<eos> Tries to get Amir to relinquish his heritage.<eos> Amir listens to her more than me.<eos> I'll need her address.<eos> If Amir is in trouble, she's the reason.<eos> Really?<eos> You can't still be upset with me.<eos> Listen, you left it on your desk.<eos> I just took that as a sign that you wanted me to read it. What?
Ivan, he's gonna pick it up from...<eos> Katrina?<eos> That didn't happen. I'm not believing it.<eos> Katrina, I want to move to a practical next step.<eos> I'm here in the dark in our bedroom and...<eos> Oh, God, nothing looks the same.<eos> Ivan?<eos> I can't... I can't speak very well. I...<eos> I have felt scraped-out for months.<eos> She phoned and said that she was having a baby and keeping it because it was her last chance to be happy.
Sorry.<eos> Sean, I need you to do me a favor.<eos> - There's...<eos> - You have a call waiting.<eos> There's been a cock-up at work and I need to speak to someone.<eos> In my blue coat in the kitchen, yes? There's a notebook.<eos> There's a phone number in the notebook of somebody called Cassidy who works for the council clerk of works. I need the number.<eos> - Why don't you ask Mum? - Please...<eos> Sean, please.<eos> Just get the number. Text it to me.
SUE: Amy, Ed Webster is here to see you.<eos> I think he's nervous.<eos> His voice sounded clammy. Okay.<eos> That's good.<eos> That's good.<eos> Look at you all flustered.<eos> It's good that you'll have sex soon.<eos> Okay, guys, we need to prep two press releases for the end of the Mary King talks at the party tonight.<eos> Okay, version one, Selina Meyer ends fiscal deadlock, saves America.<eos> Version two, Mary King steals peace pipe, breaks it in half, shits all over it.
The driver's door was blue.<eos> The rest of the truck was burgundy, and there were these different colored splotches all over it, like it had been sanded down.<eos> I didn't get the license plate.<eos> Mm-hmm. And I can confirm that there was no sexual assault.<eos> Well, thank God for that.<eos> But when I opened up his lungs...<eos> Yeah? I found pollen.<eos> Like from a flower?<eos> Yeah, just like that.<eos> The lab is analyzing it now.
We know the sample was faked.<eos> We know you pointed us at Benny Cordero in the first place.<eos> We know you had access to his genetic makeup via your fiancée.<eos> We know your employer has probably the top lab in the city.<eos> We also have a pretty good idea of the equipment you'd need to manufacture a fake DNA sample.<eos> Now, we can get a court order to look at it, but as it turns out, we don't need to.<eos> We shared everything we know with your bosses.<eos> They gave us access.<eos> Our crime scene unit is processing the lab as we speak.<eos> You may think you've covered your tracks, but if you made the sample there, we' find it.
Well, then, you won't mind if we take a look inside your home, will you?<eos> 'Cause there won't be any more of the chemical needed for further attacks.<eos> We have team of detectives heading to his home as we speak.<eos> A stunning arrest today, as entrepreneur Dr. Brian Watt has been charged in a bizarre string of poisonings...<eos> Hi there.<eos> Are my sweaters ready?<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> This is Detective Bell from the NYPD.<eos> I told him about the world's worst dry cleaner's, and he got curious.<eos> Do you know who bought this place from the Korean couple who used to own it?
That's why you're here.<eos> You handle the business. I handle the boxers.<eos> Look.<eos> I know we're having some cash-flow problems, but this, this isn't the solution.<eos> Then what is?<eos> You figure it out.<eos> I got faith in you, knucklehead.<eos> Thanks, dumbass.<eos> Carl Gordon says that you and Mark had a falling out.<eos> I wouldn't call it a falling out.
The weapon sliced the common iliac artery.<eos> He bled out quickly.<eos> The weapon looks like some kind of shiv. Yeah.<eos> A shiv with a hilt.<eos> Both wounds have the exact same depth.<eos> It doesn't explain why someone got the drop on him.<eos> That is probably the knee.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> The killer knows that Mason's left knee is compromised from a previous injury.<eos> He sneaks up, hits it, then stabs him.
There are similarities.<eos> Hang on. Nobody's even willing to consider that I might be the Hitler of this group?<eos> We were the good guys.<eos> How could everybody think we're the bad guys?<eos> We are. When Karl and I were raiding the Diamond North Caves, I was facing 50 Death Beatles.<eos> I would've perished for sure, but he saved me. Then when I had a chance to return the favor, I looked him in the eye, and I told him it was solid cake.<eos> You were just following orders.<eos> There's probably a way I can make it up to him.<eos> Oh. Maybe I'll give him my four-pronged trident.<eos> Why don't you call it a "quadrident"?
And 2 million other viewers.<eos> I do, Wendy, I do.<eos> I'm gonna pretend you guys aren't here.<eos> Micha, I love you.<eos> And that I hurt you, it tears me up, but that guy wasn't me.<eos> And this guy, the real me, is so, so sorry.<eos> And I'm gonna do everything to prove that to you.<eos> I'm canceling my tour, all my concert dates, because right now, making things right with you is all that matters.<eos> This friendship ring is for you, Mich.<eos> I'm hoping one day you'll wear it.
You put it on my desk.<eos> But it's your box. And now it's yours.<eos> My-my box?<eos> Your box.<eos> So, if you could just take it off my desk, please.<eos> Just to clarify, you're giving me your box?<eos> Okay.<eos> What's in it?<eos> What's in the box?<eos> Open it and find out.
He made a call from a roadside emergency phone.<eos> Said he'd crashed his car.<eos> Someone was chasing him.<eos> Emergency services found him about ten minutes later.<eos> Low-caliber round to the back of the head, like he was executed.<eos> Motive?<eos> Definitely wasn't robbery.<eos> His wallet, his cash and his credit cards were found next to his body.<eos> Not the way Marines normally end up getting murdered, if there is a "normal."<eos> The ballistics report linking him to Santoso's murder puts it in a whole different light.
-Eat fruit.<eos> You don't think I'm getting my five a day? No.<eos> I don't think you're eating anything that isn't made from cheese.<eos> I think you'll find you have to press the button first.<eos> I did press it.<eos> I used a pressing motion.<eos> There now.<eos> -I just did that.<eos> -OK.<eos> Thanks for your support. Really appreciate it.
We have a window for appeal.<eos> -Maybe not now, but...<eos> -Come on!<eos> -No, optimism was never...<eos> -Forget it. We lost.<eos> It's over.<eos> Will!<eos> Are you coming?<eos> I never knew about this place.<eos> Yeah, Kate's cousin lets us use it every now and again.
- Please.<eos> The ambassador's about to bring a shitstorm down on your head.<eos> The Irish Consulate know that we're holding McKenna.<eos> They're threatening to take it to Number 10, claim we're using the embassy as a black site for illegal renditions.<eos> She's assured them you're going to take McKenna to London, now.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> An attack is about to take place, and she is the only lead we have.<eos> She has to go, Philip, and it has to be official.<eos> This is bullshit.<eos> An imminent attack, and we can't question the terrorist who's planning it because we're in the wrong fucking country?
You know, I just watched a Valentine's special on the OWN network-- you know, the network Oprah wasted $2 billion on?<eos> No, I assumed Oprah had died.<eos> Mm-hmm. So, Oprah was doing a show about renewing your wedding vows.<eos> She said a renewal ceremony can strengthen a marriage.<eos> Oprah, who's never been married, said that?<eos> Oh, Cleveland, it's not just Oprah.<eos> All my friends have done this.<eos> Mary, Sybil, Edith, Lavinia, O'Brien, Mrs. Patmore, The Dowager Countess...<eos> Those are aren't your friends, that's that cast of Downton Abbey!<eos> You did watch it.
She's excited.<eos> Her son is potty-trained.<eos> Brian is her cocker spaniel.<eos> Check this out.<eos> At 1:14, Nicole posted a status update saying she's waiting for somebody to rescue her from a loveless relationship.<eos> I assume she's referring to her and John.<eos> On 1-8, Patricia tweeted, quote, "Saw one of the most beautiful oak trees<eos> I wish I could just take a nap under it like I did when I was a little girl." End quote.<eos> On 2-18, Laurel posted on her personal blog about how much she likes pain.<eos> She describes it as, "the best foreplay."
You haven't even told me.<eos> Yeah, I'm trying to keep it low-key.<eos> Keep it low-key?<eos> Hey, we're gonna go check on Briggs.<eos> I just know something's wrong. Thank you.<eos> I was literally just saying that to Jakes.<eos> What do you think is wrong with him?<eos> Remember the other day on the pier, when his watch went out?<eos> - The Odin no-show day. - Yeah.<eos> The watch was working fine before Briggs got it.
I didn't realize hostile takeovers were filled with so much hostility. Not at all.<eos> I'm actually in quite a good mood.<eos> So destroying companies agrees with you?<eos> Winning agrees with me.<eos> You haven't won yet.<eos> Since you majored in dropping out of college, let me put this in terms that are easy for you to understand.<eos> You control 45 % of Queen Consolidated stock.<eos> I control 45 %, leaving 10 % outstanding.<eos> But, in two days the board will release the final 10 %.<eos> And I'll buy it before you do.
Especially being thrown off balance by the giant fairy wings.<eos> So whenever you feel the urge to steal, remember to take a deep breath and realize that this is all just part of your compulsive disorder.<eos> It will pass.<eos> Now give me back my fountain pen.<eos> And my stapler.<eos> And my phone.<eos> By the way, you're very good.<eos> Oh, Charlie, what are you doing here?<eos> Waiting for you to realize she just stole your watch.<eos> She'll bring it back.
Between you and me, not very good, sir.<eos> Go on, sit down.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Here, I want to read you something.<eos> This is "'Why I want to be an FBI agent,"' by Michael Warren, age nine.<eos> Wow.<eos> Might as well have just said, "'Why I want to be my grandpa."'<eos> "'The FBI is the best law enforcers in the world.<eos> "'Every day, they put bad people in prison and protect America.<eos> "'Lf there is a crime, the FBI stops it.
Maybe it's better if we just get out now.<eos> I heard a customer saying a Whole Foods is going in over there.<eos> You know who goes to Whole Foods?<eos> Rich ladies with those freaky toe sneakers.<eos> And I cannot be seeing no freaky toe sneakers.<eos> Whole Foods?<eos> That's the sign I've been looking for.<eos> No wonder they wanted to get rid of us.<eos> With a Whole Foods there, they can raise everybody's rent.<eos> That's fine, we don't pay it anyway.
Just don't know.<eos> Just don't know that she's gonna be good for you, Clyde.<eos> No, she's fine.<eos> Now, maybe she don't measure up to you, but trust me Bonnie's more than good enough for me, all right?<eos> Bonnie?<eos> No need to rush things.<eos> Probably sounds crazy.<eos> Guy like me, convict and all but I ain't afraid of making a commitment.<eos> I ain't afraid of making a baby.<eos> I'm giving up criming. I'm going straight-arrow. I want to do it for you.
You got a play on your jack of hearts.<eos> Wish she'd just shut up.<eos> She don't even mean it.<eos> Why do they always get the bigger room?<eos> Why's she always the one divvying up the money?<eos> Can we just play dominoes?<eos> She talks about family, us all sticking together but she's just out for herself.<eos> She's shorting us, Buck.<eos> That little hope chest of hers?<eos> Notice how she never opens it when anyone's around?
♪ Take me out to the job search ♪<eos> (bat cracks, organ playing music) These are great seats, Cleveland.<eos> How'd you get these tickets?<eos> I bought them. From a scalper.<eos> How much severance did you get?<eos> Let's just say it had a comma in it.<eos> (whistles)<eos> Exclermation point. Don't you feel bad lying to Donna?<eos> Guys, I've been working since I was six, when my father locked me in a slaughter house with four cows and a pen knife and told me not to come out until I had steaks.<eos> I'm just gonna take a breather for a while, because I've earned it.
I got to go number two.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Those boxers were not clean.<eos> (gasps): The shape-shifter!<eos> Hwah! Guards, find Jeff Fischer.<eos> I'm right here, dude.<eos> The emperor's been lying to you all!<eos> True love does exist.<eos> He's just been hiding it.
I know all about it.<eos> - You do?<eos> That's how the Kerkoviches deal with their stuff.<eos> They talk to someone else, never each other.<eos> That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard, and I've heard Alex and Dave talk about the Civil War.<eos> Well, that's what they do.<eos> I mean, Alex and Jane tried being honest with each other, like, 20 years ago.<eos> The fight lasted for weeks.<eos> The family never talks about it.<eos> They just call it...
Well, we should call the cops.<eos> No.<eos> No, don't be naive. The cops don't find stolen cars.<eos> Plus they only help white people.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - I'm 1/16th Navajo.<eos> Well, we should at least go out and try to find your truck.<eos> I mean, we found your clogs that time you left them at the duck pond.<eos> All right. Fine, let's go find it.<eos> But in the off-off chance that we do find it... I'm gonna bring my spare key.
No, it's not for sex. It's just a great snack.<eos> (Kisses fingers) Zesty ranch.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> It's my fave. That's disgusting.<eos> Just get some zesty ranch chips.<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but I'm Brandon Tyverson.<eos> I work for a company that specializes in guerilla marketing.<eos> Would you all be interested in becoming tastemakers?<eos> Hold up.<eos> So we come up with a taste, you make it, and we get paid?
Mom...<eos> Good morning<eos> Hey<eos> Let's put hard feelings aside and talk this out<eos> I've got nothing to say to you Piss off<eos> Psychometry<eos> I don't care if you're a psychic or an alien or God-knows-what<eos> But I know that you're not lying<eos> Hey, I really envy your ability<eos> I'd buy it off you if I could
I... I will... I'll try and come to the party.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen. for the last time -<eos> Act One was 43 minutes, Act Two, 44 minutes and Act Three, 46 minutes.<eos> There will be no call on Monday.<eos> Thank you and good night.<eos> There you go!<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> You really shouldn't do that, you know.<eos> Richard, I bought you a present.<eos> I want to hang it up.
See, it's not for me, management and control.<eos> I'm not the captain - either on land or at sea, anywhere.<eos> I will always be your shadow.<eos> Ulises was at, right?<eos> - There was no one at the hotel.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> But is Ulises alive. I feel it.<eos> The father could feel such things.<eos> And if my son is out there, we'll find him.<eos> - We'll to find it, I swear.
Where is the red folder?<eos> The question is ...<eos> And what is the Max in bed?<eos> Vilma, I slept with Max.<eos> Right.<eos> - I speak softly, because my father was here ...<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> And I'm an idiot to believe that.<eos> Not a big deal.<eos> You had sex, but If you do not want to talking about it, because you're a princess, and not talking about it ... Ok then.
Oh, dang it. I lost my other earring.<eos> Leave it to me.<eos> Earring.<eos> Oh. Thimble from Monopoly game.<eos> Wondered where that was.<eos> $25 casino chip.<eos> Oh. The smallest nesting doll. Oh.<eos> Can you find anything you like in this bed?<eos> Just my honey pie.<eos> Want to split it while we snuggle?
It's very rare, but there are some deposits here in Rockville.<eos> That is a strawberry farm near Rockville.<eos> - Tell Booth.<eos> - Cam, I actually came in here to ask you for a gun.<eos> Okay.<eos> I wanted to shoot the gun.<eos> Well, I am the one authorized to shoot the gun.<eos> My only question is, why?<eos> The microfracturing on the victim's ribs did not occur due to electrical shock, but the waves in the gel made me think of hydrostatic shock.<eos> See, the high rate of speed at which a bullet enters the body causes displacement in the liquids surrounding it.
Well, I'll have a look this afternoon. Wonderful.<eos> We'll be in touch.<eos> I see you're taking your coffee Irish this morning.<eos> What do you want, Mathis?<eos> I want another bite at the apple.<eos> Back when you became C.E.O., you told me you'd keep me in mind in the unlikely event that a seat opened up on your board of directors.<eos> Now it seems that that unlikely event is your father's play for the governor's mansion.<eos> Yeah, well, I wouldn't count on the success of that campaign.<eos> Successful or not, the fact remains that there's now an open seat on your board.<eos> And you still want it.
It takes and keeps all that a person is... That a person was.<eos> And when death takes from us someone as extraordinary as Amanda, it takes with it not just her past, but who she was to us every day.<eos> Amanda was special.<eos> But she never had it easy.<eos> A childhood torn from her... A rough adolescence, and a damning identity that was thrust upon her, which she bore with dignity until she made herself a new name:<eos> Amanda Porter...<eos> - We can trust Aiden. - He made the trades.<eos> A name that was her own, free from the binds of history, Looking forward with a man who loved her for all of her strengths and all of her weaknesses.<eos> Amanda, all of us here today have embraced you, and we love you.<eos> We will protect the husband and child that you leave behind, the sister that you were just getting to know. And we will greet every new day as a gift, approaching it with the same bravery and determination with which you lived your entire life.
Later.<eos> Gibbs.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You weren't very forthcoming.<eos> Thought I'd check in with Director Vance.<eos> He assures me NCIS will share information that's pertinent to my investigation.<eos> We will.<eos> So, give me the name of your suspect.<eos> Vance claims, uh, he doesn't know it.
I leave in two days for Pyongyang.<eos> Isn't that classified?<eos> I figure an old army buddy can keep a secret.<eos> I was glad to get your call.<eos> Lyla, that's not why I called.<eos> There's something else you'd like me to do for you, then.<eos> Well, actually, I think there's something I can do for you.<eos> I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that Deadshot is on Argus' most wanted list. What do you know about him?<eos> Well, his name, for starters.<eos> We don't even have that. Where'd you get it?
The ethernet cable still works.<eos> Would you plug in your tablet, please? Did you decide to remodel?<eos> Long story.<eos> Where's Dig?<eos> Long story.<eos> The hostage-taking junkie.<eos> He is the only lead to the Count we've got left. What type of information are you looking for?<eos> Anything that will give us a line on the Count's location.<eos> Has the M.E. performed the autopsy report yet?<eos> Yeah, just pulling it up now.
He taught me how to play football.<eos> And then he took me to his cabin on the lake.<eos> I was a kid.<eos> I was a kid from the Southside. I'd never been to a cabin, much less a lake.<eos> Morgan, you don't have to do this.<eos> They need to know, Hotch.<eos> They need to know this guy's M.O.<eos> Buford built up my trust.<eos> And then he would lower my inhibition with Helgeson wine.<eos> He called it his Jesus juice.
All right? So, you pull out that one.<eos> You put six flavors into it.<eos> You taste it.<eos> It tastes horrible. But the value is just outstanding, and, you know...<eos> So, you get to your car with your slurpee.<eos> You're as happy as a pig in shit, and you put the slurpee down next to you.<eos> And here's your first hurdle, right?<eos> Your cupholder's not big enough to hold this.<eos> You need a cupholder like a hula-hoop to hold this.<eos> So, you put it on the passenger seat.
You're welcome to come and help us.<eos> "If you see anything that you like that we're gonna throw out, you can have."<eos> I just wanted to go find out who she was.<eos> Just a quick thing.<eos> I found this leather chest.<eos> It was, like, taped shut with just, like, box tape or something.<eos> And so we cut it and we opened it.<eos> And it was filled to the top with rolls of undeveloped film.<eos> I took one canister and I shook it, and it rattled.<eos> So I opened it and there was teeth inside.
Or somebody crying, it was just, bam!<eos> They...<eos> You know?<eos> Like, "Oh, my God, what is this woman doing?"<eos> We'd joke about hitting her over the head with a camera, because she embarrassed us so much.<eos> It was imposing and rude.<eos> They felt, I'm sure, that they were being mocked in some way.<eos> I'm surprised she didn't get shot.<eos> My mom put her foot down and wouldn't let Miss Maier take me into the slum areas.<eos> She loved to read the paper, she liked it that we took the New York Times, and she read it every day, and she always had an eye for the bizarre, the grotesque, the incongruous.
"I told you so."<eos> Some man murders his wife and then gets caught in cold blood,<eos> "I told you so."<eos> I mean, these things that revealed the folly of humanity.<eos> If you look at her art, she sees the bizarreness of life, the incongruity of life, and the unappealingness of human beings.<eos> There were little things, all the time, that she was just plain... in microscopic ways, just chipping at me.<eos> All the time.<eos> I would go down, with my allowance money, to the crafts store, and buy myself a thousand little tiny, you know, like rainbows and...<eos> Glass tchotchkes.<eos> Viv would look at my trove of tchotchkes and hate it.

Car makers, please, stop it.<eos> You're meddling with forces unseen and more powerful than you.<eos> Shall we get back to cars?<eos> Yeah, let's do it.<eos> Peugeot, as we know, are the worst driven cars on the road, always doing 40 in the outside lane, they're always in your way.<eos> But now there is a new car from Peugeot. We have it here in the studio. It's called the Onyx.<eos> It looks absolutely fantastic and you'll notice that some of the bodywork is made from copper.<eos> Just like the boiler tubes on a Gresley A4 Streamliner Pacific.<eos> Yes, James, yes, yes.<eos> And it's actually untreated copper,- so over time, it'll turn green unless a scrap metal merchant removes it in the night.
Yes, so I was going towards the wall and I remember just holding on for dear- life knowing it was going to hurt.<eos> Did it hurt?<eos> It did.<eos> Particularly in my legs. For some reason, I don't know, I went in straight ahead, but my legs seem to hurt when I go straight into a wall.<eos> Now, I do know what I need to talk to you about.<eos> The handbrake in the modern car.<eos> Have you ever thought, "If I pull this, she...?" I am sure I have.<eos> In the first years that I was driving, I'm sure.<eos> We were discussing this earlier. It is one of the weirdest things. We are all fairly clear, girls don't like men who do handbrake turns, but we think they do.<eos> My girlfriend loves it.
I think we've learned two things tonight.<eos> Number one, if you want to play rugby in a car, the Cee'd is brilliant.<eos> It's fast, it's agile and it's tough.<eos> But, perhaps more importantly, we've learned that grass is not a good surface.<eos> I mean, we've only played one match here and look, the pitch is completely ruined - absolutely ruined.<eos> APPLAUSE<eos> INDISTINCT CHATTER<eos> Hold on.<eos> Chaps?<eos> ! What? Do you know why they call it hallowed turf?
I mean, he did his bit on the ambulances.<eos> But some people still held it against him.<eos> Eureka.<eos> Well, unless there was anything else, I'll leave you to your...<eos> "Last Farmer Leave Booth Hill"<eos> "Family Forced to Move for New Shopping Precinct"<eos> Booth Hill?<eos> What makes you ask?<eos> It's come up in connection with a case.<eos> We've been reporting on it for about the last 18 months.
No one and nothing leaves my office.<eos> How about that?<eos> How 'bout it?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I just wanted to watch "Hazel," but I can't get any reception.<eos> I think you should go home.<eos> I love how you work every account like it's make or break.<eos> I need some of that right now.<eos> You've been working plenty.<eos> I have a new way to go. I'd show it to you, but it's top secret and it may be terrible.
This is General Motors.<eos> They fight the war with bodies on the ground.<eos> I saw Dancer at the airport.<eos> Looked like half my office.<eos> This business is rigged.<eos> Damn it.<eos> That's what I said.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> I'm tired of this crap.<eos> I should just let Chevy buy my brain and put it in a jar.
[Zipper rasps] Oh!<eos> Hey! - Hey!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Fuck.<eos> I thought you said this wasn't about sex.<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> It's not. Hold on.<eos> Look!<eos> - You got a tattoo? - Yeah.<eos> And I had them face it towards me so I can look at it.
Good for you, Jen.<eos> Would you like to do that?<eos> Be number two in London's main cardiology unit?<eos> Then you must apply.<eos> Er, just leave those, thanks, Ludmilla.<eos> Would you mind going to get some flowers?<eos> Previous man liked swans.<eos> What if I got the job?<eos> Well, then we'd have a problem.<eos> But we'd work it out.
This is the entertainment committee for the home, innit?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Erm, we're planning a cabaret night. - Innit?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We, erm...<eos> We used to get a professional act to come in and... and do, er... a show, but now we haven't got a budget for that, so...<eos> We can't afford it. No.<eos> But it doesn't matter, because we'll do it ourselves.<eos> Do it ourselves, innit? Erm...
I indulged your theory.<eos> But if we're gonna be honest here, you're exactly where we started with this.<eos> That is not true.<eos> You have nothing connecting<eos> - Trisha Seward's murder to these girls.<eos> - What? It's the same wound, it's the same weapon type,<eos> - it is the same trophy-taking behavior!<eos> - That is not enough!<eos> This job is not for human beings.<eos> I mean, you do it right, it eats your life.
Make me.<eos> Are you for real?<eos> "Dr. D.F."?<eos> Dr. Douche face.<eos> Who's that supposed to be?<eos> Who do you think?<eos> Now give it back.<eos> Make me.<eos> It's called a domino transplant.<eos> Because you guys are the same blood type, we will put the new heart and lungs into Mr. Schulz, and then take Mr. Schulz's original heart and give it to Mr. Crump.
It was snowing, the day the memorial came down.<eos> They'd sent in a builder from Chesterfield to do the job because they said it wasn't safe for untrained men.<eos> I said what we all felt.<eos> It's our memorial and our dead and we'll be taking it down.
And what do the four helmets represent?<eos> Pathos?<eos> And what would you have instead?<eos> Intestines, maybe?<eos> There were great swarms of them everywhere, living off human flesh.<eos> They used to get in your nose and in your uniform.<eos> Used to wonder where they'd been.<eos> You knew, of course you knew where they'd been.<eos> A buzzing cloud of happy, busy bluebottles above every shithole.<eos> In the summer, I'd put my best sniper on lav duty, we called it.
- We have to get down there.<eos> - I've now got five stranded people and no way off this rock, this is where I need to be.<eos> Absolutely, Deputy.<eos> So we'll go and bring him back here for you.<eos> Special kind of man ricks his life in this weather for a few crustaceans.<eos> Fellas, I'm just a fisherman.<eos> There's a lot of money in this haul.<eos> I didn't know I was breaking a law.<eos> You have ID?<eos> Don't get asked for it on the water.
What about phenylketonuria?<eos> No, we screen for that at birth and treat it with diet.<eos> What about a giant hemangioma?<eos> Like a huge, out-of-control bloodsucker?<eos> Now that's a possibility.<eos> Or maybe a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation.<eos> Again, I will operate and do a lung transplant.<eos> We own a hospital--<eos> "a cutting-edge, research-oriented hospital with an advanced level-I trauma center."<eos> Whatever's wrong with your baby, we will fix it.
You know how many, um, cooking shows they have now?<eos> I don't.<eos> It turns out, I love watching people cook things.<eos> And then this morning, the pain was so bad,<eos> I couldn't move, so I-I called the ambulance.<eos> Okay, Madeline, so from what I'm seeing here, it looks like gallstones.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Does that mean surgery?<eos> It does.<eos> But the good news is, we can do it laparoscopically, which means no big incisions and very little recovery time.
I have a friend who's a very talented stylist who I just encouraged to quit his job and, well, he needs a new one.<eos> Send him to me. I'll put him on my team.<eos> Really?<eos> Just like that?<eos> I love to give people breaks, especially if they can sing, but everybody thinks they can sing.<eos> - You got yourself a deal.<eos> - All right.<eos> Okay, one more favor I need from you.<eos> The girl I met on the way in, I want her number.<eos> I'm gonna do you an even bigger favor, I'm not gonna give it to you.
My son makes those kind of decisions and as I say...<eos> Is this a mill or a prison?<eos> For apprentices, it's a home that their parents failed to provide for them.<eos> What time does she finish?<eos> Some time after nine this evening.<eos> She'll be praying for the Ten-Hour Bill, then? Like the rest of us.<eos> You'll need to go now.<eos> Don't tell me what I need to do!<eos> There are writing materials over here.<eos> If you wish to leave your sister a note, I will make sure that she gets it.
Do you think Jonah hill is funny?<eos> I didn't know he died.<eos> Did Jonah hill die?<eos> He didn't die, but he's not fat.<eos> Ah. We're gonna get you into my acting class.<eos> I'm gonna give you a 10% - discount... - Huh?<eos> And I'll get you my traiainer... my trainer. Trainers of the stars.<eos> You know what, Jim?<eos> Lose a few I-b's, come to my acting class, and we'll Polish this turd...<eos> Or at least roll it in some glitter.
Exactly.<eos> I'm also having Daniel check into those monthly cash deposits, though they're probably just tips that Dean's trying to hide from Uncle Sam.<eos> But there was something else that jumped way out at me in Judd's banking history.<eos> About a month ago, yeah, he deposited a $50,000 check from Nicky Holloway.<eos> 50 grand?<eos> That's a lot to be giving Judd.<eos> Well, what do you think that's about?<eos> I have no idea, but I'm looking forward to hearing her overly prepared answer.<eos> Oh, and get Daniel to look into Dean's cellphone.<eos> See if it really is lost or whether there's a reason he doesn't want us to find it.
I mean, an added bonus, maybe.<eos> Plus, he didn't have to work in that sleazeball club.<eos> That guy, Disco Dean, he's a creep.<eos> A couple of my clients went in there and refused to go back in once they crossed his path. Huh. Daniel?<eos> What do you got for me?<eos> You asked me to look into your stripper's cellphone?<eos> I did, though I'd like you to refer to Dean as our stripper.<eos> Turns out he was using his cellphone regularly right up until five hours before Judd was murdered.<eos> Then radio silence, and it hasn't been used since.<eos> Meaning it's still on and you can find it for me?
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> You believe this guy is real?<eos> Moriarty?<eos> I do.<eos> No Holmes?<eos> Well, finally tracked down the owner. I don't think we're gonna learn too much from him.<eos> He's nine, and he lives in Austria.<eos> Kid's never even seen the place.<eos> He inherited it from his uncle when he was three years old.
I won't be president of the club, too much responsibility.<eos> I'm a fishing man, I caught 37 this month !<eos> Three, I caught the rest !<eos> Nonsense, Luciano !<eos> - Dad...<eos> - Piero.<eos> - It's official.<eos> - What is ? - You're a failure.<eos> - Why ?<eos> You're divorced, you had a shit job and you lost it, you drive a turquoise FIAT 1 27...
Clear Constance, Ludmilla Lorenza...<eos> There's no Clear here...<eos> What TV program did we put her in ?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I just wanted to visit the library at the Presidency but forget it, I want nothing from you.<eos> In fact, pull over. I'd rather go with the bodyguards, if you don't mind.<eos> - This way.<eos> - I'm coming with you.<eos> Thugs are better than hyenas.<eos> He's holding a blank check and he wants to rip it up !
Mr President, I presume.<eos> Jafar is 9.<eos> His mother was deported, he has no one here.<eos> I asked for assistance but there's no more staff.<eos> So I said...<eos> - Jafar ! How are you ?<eos> My head hurts.<eos> Know the story about the king who lost his headache ?<eos> There was a king who always had a headache and after many years he made friends with his headache.<eos> - He called it Gigi.
- What's this smell ?<eos> Come in.<eos> My brother, my sister-in-law and my mom.<eos> Mom, this is Peppino.<eos> - Nice to meet you, mom.<eos> - Mr President. No, watch out !<eos> I'm fine. Something cushioned my fall.<eos> - Here.<eos> - Is the roast...<eos> I'll put it here, we'll eat it.
And I guess I inherited it.<eos> Why have I never heard about this?<eos> When I became a CSI, I felt like I had to choose:<eos> science or... the other.<eos> I chose science.<eos> So, now you've reconsidered?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, 'cause of Carrie... and what I feel in this place.<eos> But I-I thought the feelings came from the infrasound, the vibrations from the ventilation fan.<eos> Henry turned it off, and since then, I-I don't feel a thing anymore.
Apparently, Jenny's called in sick.<eos> Does she have the flu again?<eos> The flu?<eos> You think?<eos> Sh-sh-shit!<eos> Hey, hey, I need to get out of here. You need to, uh, give me a ride.<eos> Sure. Give your number.<eos> Uh, I don't know my number.<eos> Who doesn't know their own number?<eos> Uh, I don't ever call it.
Garage!<eos> Come on, we do this every weekend!<eos> The place where you put your car!<eos> No, I don't know anyone.<eos> Come on, you must know someone.<eos> Ben.<eos> Ben? Who's Ben?<eos> Yeah, Ben, the repeater from work. Yes.<eos> Uh, text me his number.<eos> You got it.
Woops.<eos> Sorry!<eos> No Vera, what is it?<eos> Maybe I'll come back later...<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes!<eos> There's something you need to hear.<eos> It's about the Revue.<eos> My oven's broken or I'd heat them up.<eos> If my husband were in town he'd fix it.
- ♪ my heart starts doin' Hey! What's up, man?<eos> I love this guy!<eos> [All cheering] This is better.<eos> It's better in here.<eos> Ryan, I think your inability to confront Carrie is symptomatic of a larger avoidance issue.<eos> I respectfully disagree.<eos> Fausta, de-hat me.<eos> Thanks. Thanks a lot.<eos> Ryan, what have we learned in this group?<eos> If there is an issue, we confront it head-on.
Why the hell is it your business?<eos> How do you know I can help?<eos> You don't even know me.<eos> Do you even fucking know them?<eos> Cut that shit, are you helping or not?<eos> Are you even capable of helping others?<eos> Look at yourself. You're a fucking mess!<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> That's obviously drawn by a kid,<eos> The ink's already faded and you're still keeping it.
In fact, everyone, I would like to propose a toast.<eos> To my tireless slave, but above all... friend.<eos> Grumio!<eos> Me.<eos> OK, that's the polish.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Is that my vase?<eos> Yea - Mmm?<eos> Why were you in the bog with it? Er...
And if you want to be imperious, Grumio.<eos> Can you be imperious?<eos> No, I can't. One<eos> - I don't know what it means.<eos> Two - I'm not playing.<eos> Come on, Grumio.<eos> It's fun, mate.<eos> Why not get your slave to clean the toilet, Grumio?<eos> Nah, toilet's fine.<eos> Blokes can just piss it clean.
Say hello to Mrs. Evelyn.<eos> I thought your son was still in Mexico.<eos> Oh, no. This is the Westmores' son.<eos> I was gonna say he's awfully white.<eos> Well, since she's working and he's in the hospital, I have to watch him.<eos> Honestly...<eos> Rosie, don't you think you should have mentioned this in the interview?<eos> Why would you worry about such a sweet boy?<eos> This rug is worth over $100,000.<eos> If you ruin it, I will personally see to it that you end up in the public school system.
Now, surely you can understand why she wants to tap the brakes a little.<eos> I thought you were gonna say, "She'll come around, man" and give me one of these.<eos> This is good, too.<eos> Well, maybe I'll be carrying a bouquet of sawgrass and poison oak, but, man, I love this dress.<eos> Stunning.<eos> It's a shame you'll never wear it outside of this room.<eos> What? Unfortunately, 14% of Americans feel that this dress is too "hotsy-totsy."<eos> You focus-grouped my dress?<eos> Within an inch of its life, ma'am.<eos> Well, what if I said to hell with the focus groups and wore it anyway?
My grandmother gave me diamond earrings that I wore at the first wedding.<eos> Are those okay to wear?<eos> We'll need to make sure they're not conflict diamonds.<eos> Where the hell are those earrings? !<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Hey.<eos> The thing Skip was supposed to mail!<eos> The marriage license!<eos> I've had it this whole time!<eos> Now I remember, I took it back from him at Waffle Circus after I realized he did this to the back.
He's had to keep his "project"" to himself all these years.<eos> Probably relieved to finally have an audience.<eos> Gottlieb's getting a text.<eos> What does it say?<eos> What's he saying to you?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> I-I can't read it.<eos> Tell me!<eos> That's not the code we used.<eos> If you want to read that message, you're going to have to translate it yourself.
Don't look at us, you pig.<eos> Take your Juicy sweatpants and your dirty pillow from home, and your bucket of Coke, and get the hell out of my sight.<eos> What was her problem?<eos> You see that, Brian?<eos> That's going to be our penises later, right?<eos> Stewie, that teleportation machine is amazing. It's so great that we're already here.<eos> Yep, drink it in, Bri.<eos> Time to enjoy all the Bellagio has to offer.<eos> Classic architecture. Beautiful art.<eos> Plus, the air is clean because they suck up all the cigarette smoke and dump it in the bad hotels.
It seems today that all you see<eos> Is violence in movies and sex on TV<eos> On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do<eos> He's... a... Fam... ily... Guy!<eos> Hey, Brian, have you seen the remote?<eos> I want to watch The Weather Channel.<eos> There are tornados in the Midwest, and I like watching poor people scramble to save what little they have.<eos> Uh, I don't know where the remote is.<eos> All right, I'Il find it myself.
I'm gonna play this really loud tonight to get back at our Armenian neighbors.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, looks like a fun party.<eos> Um, hey, listen, it's 2:00 in the morning.<eos> Uh, when is your five-year-old gonna go to sleep?<eos> Soon, very soon.<eos> You want weird food wrapped in weird leaves?<eos> Yeah, look, I'm guessing there's some kind of soccer match from your home country going on, and I get that, I do.<eos> But, uh, some of us are trying to sleep, and I could almost deal with the noise, but it's the cologne, all right?<eos> I can smell it in my bed, and I live two houses from here.
But Mr. Barrington told me to...<eos> Who's Mr. Barrington?<eos> From the club.<eos> What club?<eos> You're in a lot of trouble, mister.<eos> I'm sorry I got us both kicked out, Carter.<eos> I was just trying to helyou out.<eos> Mr. Barrington told me I couldn't see Amanda anymore.<eos> We never even got a chance to have sex.<eos> Everyone knows rich, Waspy girls are the best at it.
No. They are the Doctor.<eos> You're the Doctor too.<eos> No.<eos> Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame... whatever the cost.<eos> You know the sound the TARDIS makes?<eos> That wheezing... groaning.<eos> That sound brings hope wherever it goes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I like to think it does.<eos> To anyone who hears it, Doctor.
Yeah, but there are plenty of other little skanks in our town.<eos> Why did he have to pick my little skank?<eos> I wish there was something that would make you feel better.<eos> Uh, what if Jake apologized?<eos> What if I cut his balls off?<eos> So, we've got options.<eos> All right, you two, now-now, let's, uh, let's think of the couch as a safe place for communication.<eos> Uh, uh, neutral corner, neutral corner.<eos> Now, and-and this, uh, this pillow represents the wall of respect.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna place it between the two of you.
Together.<eos> And not just for us.<eos> For all the people that they've hurt.<eos> I, uh... I got to ask you a question.<eos> All right.<eos> Agent Davis-- he might have been a defector, but he managed to find you pretty easily.<eos> And you know it won't be long before more of them find you, yeah?<eos> So, if you had a choice,<eos> I mean, would you want me to, to keep you at a safe distance?<eos> If-if I had a new place to live, would... would you want me to keep it a secret from you?
"He lies beneath ever hungrier for souls."<eos> And this bit: "Now I see the perfect hideous logic"<eos> "I may have a new master now."<eos> And that's it.<eos> That's the last thing he wrote.<eos> Does any of that mean anything to you?<eos> - No.<eos> No, but I'll tell you something:<eos> I don't think it's an accident that Mandeville's journal ended up in the church records. I think Crellick put it there.<eos> I think he wanted us to find it because we would read it and understand something.
Father Crellick!<eos> Did you sleep here?<eos> Were those voices coming from over here, Father Crellick?<eos> Looks like those kids have played a wee trick on you.<eos> You think I'm a fool, don't you?<eos> We want this to be a miracle just as much as you do, dude.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I'm not like Mandeville.<eos> If there is anything in this church this will help us find it.<eos> I mean, if a poltergeist farted in here six months ago we will hear it.
Quite so, sir.<eos> During the picket, Cullington acted as barrier between the women and the owners.<eos> After the settlement, it was felt he no longer had the support of the workforce.<eos> The match-girls. The match-girls.<eos> Show me a group of women more ill used than the match-girls.<eos> Miss Cobden.<eos> Miss Cobden, she is committed to those girls. To answering their grievances, even though their strike is now past.<eos> Phossy jaw!<eos> Necrosis of the jawbone.<eos> The phosphorous from the yellow-tipped matches converts into biphosphonates - these laid down in the bone to then eat it away.
May I introduce Sir Walter De Souza?<eos> Mr Thomas Ely, you already know.<eos> And Mr Henry Cullington.<eos> Raine, what are you doing?<eos> Raine, stop, please!<eos> Please!<eos> No, Raine please, I beg you, think of what you do!<eos> The world will hear us now.<eos> What will they make of you?<eos> For surely a day will come when not only one woman - but hundreds will take their fully-enfranchised position among you and none shall remark on it as anything more than the everyday heartbeat of political life.
So I must ask you whether or not you bribed Knightly to support your bid for St Paul's Wharf side.<eos> Yes, we gave the man money.<eos> But so we might not be ignored.<eos> The field of play thus levelled, we were to win, Mr Reid.<eos> We are, yet.<eos> My competitors cast spells of death and destruction as if they think the people of this city are Neanderthals to be terrified at the sight of fire.<eos> I have no need of such strategy.<eos> Electrical current is a fierce and unruly force.<eos> What alternating power promises is the means by which such ferocity is made benign.<eos> You drop the voltage using your transformer, then you hive it off for domestic consumption. Indeed.
No thanks required.<eos> Nonetheless, Sir, you have them.<eos> Miss Rose.<eos> Susan, am I to wait in bed all morning for my kippers?<eos> That one there.<eos> Make it two. Thank you, Sir.<eos> Good day to you.<eos> Lunchtime repast for you boys.<eos> Mr Judge, you may feel protected by your familial relationship with this station house.<eos> Should you try to sell our diamond, Sir, we will have it from you.
H Division!<eos> Welcome, Constable.<eos> I am a man of greedy anticipation.<eos> A greed for you, son.<eos> Let us hope you make a better fist of it than the last finalist to arrive from the Leman Street ranks.<eos> Chief Inspector.<eos> It is a while since you partook of such sport.<eos> They have changed the rulebook, Jedediah.<eos> My day, anything went.<eos> Had I fought you, I would have carried a knife in my britches, and - in my current mood - used it to cut your knackers off.
Wait! ♪ ♪ The Earth began to cool<eos> ♪ The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools ♪ ♪ We built the Wall ♪ We built the pyramids ♪<eos> ♪ Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery ♪<eos> ♪ That all started with a big bang ♪<eos> So "tenured" means a job for life?<eos> - Yup.<eos> - And you can't get fired even if you're bad at it?<eos> Mm, not really.<eos> Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.<eos> While I disagree with the premise of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldn't diminish my output.
- Yeah.<eos> You're Gail's brother.<eos> Uh, it's nice to meet you. No, we've met before, actually, but I guess this is the part where I swallow my pride and say it's nice to meet you for the second time, right?<eos> I'm starting to see the family resemblance.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, now that we're all getting along, let's get a leg up on the day, shall we?<eos> All right, get it out.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Okay. All right.<eos> 'Cause we got a job to do. We're gonna go do it.
But I gotta tell you, Perik's been a model prisoner.<eos> So glad to hear it.<eos> This is the last four months of visitor logs, video.<eos> We've recorded every visitation and interview.<eos> Wait.<eos> This is only four months?<eos> Guy like this draws a crowd.<eos> He's had four lawyers since he got here, each with a team of associates.<eos> Then there's the psychologists, psychiatrists, journalists, criminology students.<eos> I'll send over the earlier stuff as soon as we get it out of records. This is gonna take weeks.
You can do better than that.<eos> I want something real, something you're ashamed of.<eos> You know, I do wonder how Grace Finn is doing right now.<eos> I killed a cat. Okay?<eos> Are you happy, Ross?<eos> I was 9 years old, and we had just gotten a new kitten.<eos> And my brother was chasing me, so... I ran into my bedroom because I didn't want him to take it away from me.<eos> Put it in a drawer, but he picked the lock. And he got into the room... and I slammed... the drawer shut.<eos> So he wouldn't see.<eos> Last moment had... sort of popped its head up... and I didn't see it in time. You snapped its neck?
And I see the white crystals-- tetraphosphorous decaoxide.<eos> Well, this is impressive, but we didn't find any mole poison in Burt's trunk.<eos> Well, that's because the mole poison wasn't in his trunk, it was in Burt.<eos> Wait-- he ingested mole poison?<eos> That would kill him.<eos> I checked Burt's FriendAgenda page. He and Sandy Larken had a volatile relationship.<eos> And the day that Sandy broke up with him, he posted a virtual suicide note.<eos> Swallowing mole poison?<eos> Yeah. And his stomach enzymes-- like the potassium bicarbonate-- reacted with the poison to create the phosphine gas.<eos> So Burt didn't swallow fire, he belched it.
he's got a good reputation.<eos> He's in lockstep with the mayor on social reform and anticorruption.<eos> Industrial site.<eos> Double tap to the head.<eos> Anybody else want to say it?<eos> Mob hit.<eos> We'll get started on the canvass and surveillance.<eos> Hey, Don.<eos> This case is huge, man.<eos> It's big enough for both of us to get our grade bumps if we close it right.
Women go missing every single day, and the police don't lift a finger, and yet when one of their own daughters, like Ellie Brass, is lost, they will part the seas and tumble down the walls to find her.<eos> You question my mission,<eos> I question yours.<eos> You know, in the 16 years that we were married, I never saw the inside of your office at the Newark PD.<eos> Nancy, you know, you didn't really have to fly all the way out here.<eos> You remember what happened the last time you tried to find her in Los Angeles by yourself?<eos> You know, I don't have the will to listen to a whole recitation of my past failures, okay?<eos> I-I can't beat myself up anymore about this.<eos> Okay.<eos> I didn't tell you this on the phone, but Ellie had your engagement ring, and then she sold it to another girl.
You don't have to say another word.<eos> I will find a way to shift things around.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> This is absolutely no concern of yours.<eos> She came to me.<eos> And you couldn't say, "I don't feel comfortable discussing this"?<eos> She's my friend, Bill.<eos> She was asking me for help.<eos> You know, Jonas Salk volunteered himself and his family to be the first test subjects for the polio vaccine.<eos> Werner Forssmann inserted a urethral tube into his elbow, pushed it to his heart, then x-rayed himself to prove that cardiac catheterization is possible.
Hey.<eos> Thing goes fast.<eos> Yeah, boy!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Circling these motherfuckers all day.<eos> Eddie just picked your father out of the line-up.<eos> All systems are go, Ray.<eos> - Warrant's getting delivered today.<eos> - Make sure they know he's in L.A.<eos> Yeah. When we get the warrant, we'll fax it to L.A.P.D.
Cut it out, man.<eos> So you're a movie producer, huh?<eos> Ever make anything good?<eos> Good?<eos> I don't know about that. Made a hell of a lot of fucking money, though, if that's what you're asking.<eos> If you ever need a great idea, I got one.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I got a fucking doozy in my head.<eos> Just need someone to spill it out to.
This is an ambulance.<eos> Make do with your surroundings. Go on.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Where do I start?<eos> Taylor Gossard has the transport vehicle and Becker's kidnapped Tinny.<eos> What?<eos> Explain.<eos> He's using her as leverage.<eos> He wants me to get to the transport vehicle before you guys do.<eos> And then he'll exchange it for Tinny. What a mess.
Then... then it's my fault.<eos> But Allie... she treats your family members with compassion and love, and what more, she means it.<eos> You ask anyone here.<eos> She's the best thing about this place.<eos> She is.<eos> We love her.<eos> She is the best.<eos> Look, I made mistakes.<eos> Racing them was a mistake.<eos> Putting numbers on them... it really dehumanizes a person when you put a number on them and they don't know about it.
Soon, one of you will be ridiculed mercilessly. Ha!<eos> Nature.<eos> My transfer was approved.<eos> So starting now, lam an employee of the County Health Board.<eos> You are no longer my boss, and we can have a baby without it being a conflict of interest. Clear sailing.<eos> Goodbye, Ann Perkins, my excellent employee.<eos> Hello, Ann Perkins, my fallopian princess.<eos> So here's the drill.<eos> Make a deposit in here.<eos> If you fill it up all the way, you get on the board.

Sounds romantic.
- He passed out.<eos> - He had to be carried.<eos> - Bingo.<eos> But now for the huge part, and I mean that literally.<eos> Noah Daniels was 6 inches taller and 50 pounds heavier than Darryl Orton.<eos> There is no way Orton carried him out of there on his own.<eos> GIBBS: He had help.<eos> McGEE: Darryl's brother has an alibi.<eos> He was working the graveyard shift at a Roanoke pulp mill the last two nights.<eos> - The supervisor confirms it.
He takes out a page in the yearbook and he writes a poem using the first letter of every word spelling out Hailey Moore.<eos> I don't want to talk about Hailey Moore anymore.<eos> Okay?<eos> - We need to talk to your fiancée, though.<eos> - Alone.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Call her. Just... I hate what this is doing to her.<eos> We need to also put together a reel of your greatest hits.<eos> Nancy's got them all.<eos> So, in this one prank, Freck had a fake lottery ticket made and gave it to our friend who manages a cigar store.
Okay, okay.<eos> And for the record, this has stopped being fun. Hey.<eos> How you feeling today?<eos> Great.<eos> I went out with Penny last night. Oh, yeah?<eos> How's the courtship going?<eos> Third date and she hasn't slammed the door in my face.<eos> She told me that I was the most respectful man she's ever dated.<eos> Wow. I think she might be the one.<eos> Well... Love is hard to come by, so if you find it, you got to grab ahold of it and hold on tight.
She created the spell that made Silas truly immortal, invulnerable to any weapon.<eos> You'd like that for yourself, wouldn't you?<eos> I can give it to you.<eos> Bonnie Bennett, we have a deal.<eos> Hey...<eos> There you go.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> The pain's still there.<eos> The grief... And shame.<eos> I get it now.
Thought Stefan got rid of you.<eos> He did, and I spent the night crawling out of a cement grave.<eos> Isn't that the witch your friend Caroline killed?<eos> And over there, that's my hybrid friend Adrian, also dead.<eos> In fact, these seats are scattered with two dozen supernatural faces, all of who have reason to lash out since their lives were sacrificed in order to make your expression triangle.<eos> All they're waiting on is word from me. The veil goes back up tonight.<eos> Don't you have anything better to do<eos> - than harass me and my friends? - Well, that's the thing.<eos> I don't want the veil to go back up.<eos> In fact, I want you to drop it completely so I and my fallen friends can live, Bonnie.
You're just saying that.<eos> And it doesn't matter if Manny likes her. Knowing Javier's track record, he'll dump her like he dumps everybody.<eos> You are wrong, Jay.<eos> I'm not going to dump her.<eos> In fact, this weekend, I asked Trish to marry me.<eos> You're going to marry her?<eos> I was waiting for the right time to tell you.<eos> - Nailed it.<eos> - I wanted to ask you for my abuela's ring back.<eos> I really want Trish to wear it.
No, no, no.<eos> I sent them.<eos> Oh, okay. Yeah, I-I called in a favor with a couple of friends at Metro.<eos> No, they're just there to keep an eye on you.<eos> Look, I got a question for you. Uh-huh.<eos> Did Edgar Roy retain Ted, or was it someone else?<eos> Kelly Nelson, I think the name was.<eos> You remember the address?<eos> Rockville.<eos> I can't recall it exactly.
Warden thinks he heard the tone pads and was able to memorize the harmonic pitch of each key entry.<eos> Well, that sounds like your run-of-the-mill serial killer.<eos> Familiar?<eos> Yeah. It's my business card.<eos> Edgar Roy left it on his pillow, like he wanted us to find it.<eos> Told him he could contact me anytime he wanted.<eos> - Has he tried?<eos> - No.<eos> And the number on the back?<eos> I didn't write it.
Then he gets caught burying bodies out in the barn and everything screeches to a halt.<eos> He changed the startup sequence, they can power up the system they can't string the data, let alone figure out how to interpret it.<eos> - You think he killed those men?<eos> - I think anything is possible.<eos> Are we done?<eos> Just as soon as you give me the address to the datacenter.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Looks like bunting is using a privacy protocol.<eos> Anytime his name appears on the Internet, it's flagged.<eos> He gets to allow the reference or delete it.
According to my contact it is.<eos> Looks deserted.<eos> Hasn't operated since Edgar Roy was arrested.<eos> He's the only one who knows how to access it.<eos> - - So we're gonna break in?<eos> - No, not break in.<eos> Walk in.<eos> Edgar Roy left my business card where it could be seen.<eos> He knew the FBI would show me because of the number on the back.<eos> - He wanted me to see it.
It puts him at special risk for suicide.<eos> Don't talk to me about special risks when I am prosecuting a serial killer.<eos> I want that boy out of your house and placed somewhere else posthaste.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> And I suggest you factor my legal guardianship into your case.<eos> Oh...<eos> I am. And in just the same way you're factoring in how your suspect never told you about his baby.<eos> I can't tell you who he was asking to lie for him, because Elliot was calling himself.<eos> The number he dialed for his alibi belonged to his own corporation, Riverway Films.<eos> He ordered another cell for his company and gave it to someone.
Boiler plate?<eos> So, it's bullshit? Sorry, I'm ...<eos> I'm upset.<eos> You're right.<eos> You never know what a jury will do.<eos> - Poor Jane.<eos> Me, too. You could have a conversation.<eos> - You want some coffee?<eos> - Love some.<eos> - You want a little irish whiskey in it?
- 8:00. The good news is, this is no longer a police-brutality case.<eos> Oh, that is good news.<eos> - What's the bad news?<eos> - It's a civil matter.<eos> And because you weren't on the clock, the city's refusing to indemnify you.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> So I'm on my own?<eos> Look at that ... another 17 cents.<eos> I wonder if F. Lee Bailey will take your case now.<eos> If I tell him to shut up, do you think he'll put it on youtube?
Maybe they were spying on the neighborhood.<eos> Frontload Tech just moved its RD offices right nearby.<eos> Yeah, but there would be a ton of firewalls to protect proprietary information.<eos> Yeah, but look at all these houses sold.<eos> Frost, who lives around Leroy?<eos> Frontload Tech engineers.<eos> A lot of them.<eos> That's it.<eos> You take your phone and your computer home.<eos> If I wanted to steal, I would send a drone, fly it over your home.
And what good does that do me?<eos> Well... You can turn me in. You can do whatever you want to do.<eos> Personally... what I would prefer, Sherlock, is that if you and I could work together just one last time.<eos> One of my suppliers from the restaurant-- I'll be a moment.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Um, have you seen Sherlock anywhere?<eos> He never came home last night.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> His bed was undisturbed.<eos> You live with him. Surely you know he'd never sleep in it, then make it.
He then dials 999 at 6:36 to report that his wife has been murdered by an intruder.<eos> The acetone, meanwhile, is dissolving the gun he used to murder her, leaving nothing but a milk-like liquid in the bottle in his refrigerator.<eos> It's unbelievable.<eos> And all of this from a photograph of a pint of milk?<eos> And a nail.<eos> It's illegal for a gun company to make or manufacture a plastic weapon.<eos> But with advances in 3-D printing, it makes it possible for anyone with the right specs to build one in the comfort of their own home.<eos> They only need one piece of metal to make it work: a nail to act as the firing pin.<eos> Now, Pendry couldn't very well melt a nail, could he? So he hid it in plain sight.<eos> He used it to re-hang one of the masks in the living room before the police arrived.
For the last time, she's not loony.<eos> She's just going through something.<eos> Welcome to marriage.<eos> People change.<eos> They get old, they get grumpy, they get ugly as a monkey's butt.<eos> But you stay.<eos> And you know why?<eos> Because you promised Jesus to stick it out.<eos> Just remember, marriage is not for the faint of heart.<eos> I'll never understand why the gays want it so bad.
Okay, hurry.<eos> Let's put it in the pot.<eos> Okay.<eos> This needs to steep for a few hours.<eos> So we leach out all his sweat. Then, we add the reduction to the rest of the potion.<eos> Then comes the hard part.<eos> Hard part?<eos> Didn't we just do the hard part?<eos> All this does is help us make the antidote.<eos> Which we have to get into Kellogg's toad before he eats it.

Uh, okay.<eos> I guess that makes sense.<eos> But how do we get it into his toad?
Big Al!<eos> - Hey, Wallace.<eos> [Chuckles] What brings you out?<eos> I guess that Severide character's got himself in a bit of a pickle, huh?<eos> How'd that get on your radar?<eos> Well, the girl he attacked, her lawyer contacted me. Attacked?<eos> Since when do you believe everything lawyers tell you?<eos> [Scoffs] Yeah, well, regardless, I guess they want my account of events.<eos> They're looking to establish a pattern of behavior.<eos> And I wanted you to hear it from me first out of respect for our friendship.
For a liar?<eos> IAD lacked the sufficient amount of confidence needed to disprove her claim, so they wanted to move quickly to have this go away.<eos> You know what?<eos> Make her the Queen of England, I don't care.<eos> Are we done?<eos> No.<eos> Because of Chief Rutkowski's rather incendiary statement, the I.G. has sustained Tara's allegations.<eos> They're kicking the case up to the State's Attorney's office.<eos> - Meaning what?<eos> - Meaning they will review it.
I'm not up for it. - No.<eos> Of course.<eos> All right.<eos> - Hang in there, man.<eos> - This is it, you guys.<eos> - Ready or not. I got jitters, I ain't gonna lie.<eos> This is probably, like, the craziest, riskiest, insanest thing any of us has ever done.<eos> And for Herrmann, that's saying something.<eos> But if nothing else, I have had so much fun spending all those days off and all the wee hours building Molly's with you guys.<eos> And I know that you guys have heart because I saw it when you put it in the business, and I just want you to know that I consider you guys family.
Nah, CJ is gone.<eos> I told him to dump his phone and clear out for a bit.<eos> You know how I work.<eos> This is your problem now.<eos> Five stacks.<eos> A little welcome-back gift.<eos> So you can start the college fund when, um, the baby's born.<eos> And it's only, like, 5 dollars a month.<eos> Even if they don't go to college, they still get the money.<eos> So I'm not quite sure why they call it a college fund.
Come on, in here.<eos> Get Lucci!<eos> Get Lucci!<eos> Get Lucci!<eos> You're dead, Lucci.<eos> You ain't coming out of here alive.<eos> Severide, did you find that supply duct?<eos> Yeah, big problem, Casey.<eos> We got the fire.<eos> We're putting it out now.
Excuse me.<eos> Can I have your autograph?<eos> Well, why don't you give me your phone number instead?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't know how you do it, man.<eos> I got a system.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> She entered on the phone, uh, her actual name, which is Kelly.<eos> I'm gonna change it to, uh,
I lost my mom, too, you know.<eos> Different circumstances, you know? But I have some idea how it feels.<eos> Yeah, you don't know what it was like to grow up with a mom like that.<eos> I grew up in the dirt.<eos> Everything was filthy.<eos> And now I get to put her back in the dirt.<eos> I just lived my life knowing that this day was gonna come.<eos> Dreading it.<eos> Wanting it.<eos> Hating myself for wanting it.
Uh... Now, some of you may know I recently took over the Rammer Jammer...<eos> This is a disaster.<eos> How could you encourage Wade to hold Fight Night at the Rammer Jammer?<eos> You know the type of people that show up to mixed martial arts?<eos> 'Cause I do.<eos> Fight Night is a moneymaker. Wade is right.<eos> You know, BlueBell needs a sports bar, not a-a... wine saloon, with frilly tablecloths and antique sofas.<eos> It is a "salon,"<eos> not a saloon. Oh...<eos> And Lemon is just trying to elevate the place, and the people in it.
He's ready.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> - Hi. - Oh! Shit.<eos> Do you want tell me what the fuck is going on?<eos> You are to become one of us. A Scout?<eos> Can't I just fill in a membership form?<eos> You are to become an agent of Satan.<eos> And if I say no?<eos> Shit.<eos> Then I'll cut out your heart and burn it in hellfire.
Why did I laugh?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> God, I was a monster.<eos> But now you are a man again.<eos> And you have been saved.<eos> Did he just... Cure a demon?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Could we take this hoodoo on a test drive?<eos> Um, I mean, I have the exorcism right here. All we need is the blood, consecrated ground, and a demon. So, what?<eos> We summon a demon, trap it -- Or -- or we use one that we've already tagged.
Kudos.<eos> So we'll spare the hands.<eos> I'll start with the toes.<eos> Your toes, or the name of your contact.<eos> Makes no difference to me.<eos> Toes it is.<eos> ♪ bright, sunshiny day There's something I'd like to go over before we begin, Mr. Collins...<eos> Can I call you Marcus?<eos> Would that be all right?<eos> See, Marcus, you need to understand that pain is the only human process that is completely defined by the person experiencing it.
I'm not in the mood, mark.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know what to do about Danny.<eos> And I don't know how to be a good mom to him.<eos> You're a wonderful mom.<eos> Mark, I said I'm not in the mood.<eos> How can I help, Karen? You can't help.<eos> I can't help.<eos> No one can.<eos> He even has an alibi and he won't use it.
I've got you a booking in a pub in three weeks, just to test the water.<eos> You all in?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Keith?<eos> What?<eos> Are you in?<eos> In what?<eos> Do you want to do the show?<eos> Are they doing it?
You might want to join us for this one, sir.<eos> The Musai's lips secrete a kind of psychotropic substance for which there's no medicinal antidote.<eos> What?<eos> There's gotta be something, right? Oh, wait, wait.<eos> Mm.<eos> Nothing. So what?<eos> It's the proverbial kiss of death?<eos> Obsessive desire can be confused with love.<eos> Whatever this is, it ain't love.<eos> No, but it probably feels like it.
Kammie's brother, Tony Leeds, had a long rap sheet and an extremely violent history. All right, I'm thinking Kammie confides in Tony, all right?<eos> Tells him about the break-in, about having to go on the run.<eos> And brother, being the criminal genius that he is, puts two and two together.<eos> Realizes Percy was in possession of something valuable.<eos> Exactly. Tony tracks down Percy, puts both barrels to his head,<eos> Percy starts talking, he tells him everything.<eos> Tells him about the currency plates, about the map tattoo, about the Russian stalking him.<eos> All right, and then Tony kills Percy, makes it look like a mob hit.<eos> That was to throw us off.<eos> Well, then he cuts the tattoo off Percy's arm so no one else can find it, and goes on a treasure hunt.
Look, Shelby, I can't just flip a switch and turn off the last 15 years.<eos> But I made my choice.<eos> And I want you.<eos> Can't we just start over fresh, forget everything?<eos> I don't think we should do this anymore.<eos> You don't even want to think about it?<eos> Our time together was... I can't be with you.<eos> Just hear me out.<eos> I got feelings for you -- strong feelings.<eos> And had I known our last kiss was gonna be our very last, I'd have made sure you never forgot it.
Does Florence have an interest in France?<eos> Florence has an interest in everything.<eos> So tell me, what do you think of this one?<eos> Forsake the colourful display.<eos> Wear the simple black satin.<eos> Really?<eos> Why?<eos> They have never met a Riario, or a Medici, let alone a Borgia.<eos> Italian wealth unsettles them.<eos> As much as they want it, it offends their martial nature.
Your husband.<eos> He is but a cousin on the mother's side.<eos> - Oh, good shot. - This king is strong, my lady.<eos> His father lived a long life.<eos> He will be with us a long time.<eos> Until my son is a boy no longer?<eos> That's why I'm the king.<eos> So you can free me of this wife of mine?<eos> Your Highness, I would do anything to free you.<eos> In return for the annulment Charlotte D'Albret is yours if you desire it.
I would eliminate the Sforza dynasty.<eos> Ludovico, first.<eos> And it need not trouble the papal armies one iota.<eos> Then, Catherina.<eos> But to have the French in Milan was not our design.<eos> No. But it was the only design that ensured success.<eos> And you told me to secure our every advantage.<eos> And I have done so.<eos> I brought you an army, Father.<eos> Would you have me send it back?
Because I didn't give you time enough.<eos> But with enough time, you would have burnt me in that mound of sulphur. Huh?<eos> Is it true, Baglioni?<eos> Too true, my lord.<eos> Why, Baglioni, why?<eos> Because, my friend, this is what we do.<eos> We are connoisseurs of treachery.<eos> So can anyone tell me who owns this pile of dust?<eos> Catherina Sforza?<eos> Why would she store it in Rome?
No, nothing like that.<eos> And it is better if you know nothing of my progress.<eos> I will have them at the borders of Florence before Florence awakes.<eos> Well, we cannot justify to the Florentine ambassador-<eos> You will not have to.<eos> I have his assurance we can skirt their territories and move on.<eos> Hm, well, as Socrates said,<eos> "True wisdom is knowing that you know nothing."<eos> I will carve you out an empire, Father.<eos> But who will rule it after we are gone, huh?
No. Um, this is Dr. Boswell.<eos> She's consulting on the sims baby.<eos> Uh, hi.<eos> Dr. Callie Torres. Ortho.<eos> Do you mind if I sit in?<eos> You-you see these, like, never.<eos> No, yeah. Yeah.<eos> Please come in.<eos> - The more, the merrier. Yeah. - Yay.<eos> Um, so then I will take a calvarial bone graft from the... parietal skull and then use it... to form the base of the skull.
Seriously?<eos> Did they have Edwards's blood on them?<eos> Not a trace, but Allen doesn't need to know that.<eos> He's the guy.<eos> And if Mr. Jennings is a decent lawyer, he'll deal on the four reported robberies as one crime.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> These robberies don't include the one at Edwards's house.<eos> If they did include that one, Emma, even Tyler Allen, our suspect, would know what we're up to.<eos> I want double homicide.<eos> And these other robberies are the way to get it.
And no questions.<eos> My backpack wasn't upstairs.<eos> What's that?<eos> Postcard from a friend of Claire's- - Rachel.<eos> "Living it up in Club Med Cozumel."<eos> Looks like that marriage went down the drain.<eos> In other shocking news, Phil subscribes to a trampoline magazine.<eos> Going through other people's mail-- keeping it classy, Jay.<eos> Mom, my backpack isn't in Luke's room.<eos> I don't see it in here, either.
- Véronique!<eos> Father Vincey abused several pupils at the school.<eos> Denis and I were among his victims.<eos> It's wrong to sully the church's reputation like that.<eos> Father Vincey is an amazing man.<eos> I saw him crying at my son's funeral.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> - Here's my phone number.<eos> - I won't be needing it.<eos> I'll leave it anyway.
It's my fault.<eos> I should have told you.<eos> I must go.<eos> I'm meeting the lawyer tomorrow.<eos> I won't be back tonight.<eos> Goodbye, Mum.<eos> - You wanted to talk to me.<eos> I need your help, Daubresse.<eos> Father Vincey's file has gone missing.<eos> You haven't seen it, have you?
Should we get a warrant to search his R.V.?<eos> Pretty sure Szabo would have flipped all of these gifts for cash, but check his financials.<eos> Oh, and see if Walter filed a new will.<eos> If they were churning his credit cards, maybe they were setting him up for the big one.<eos> I tested the leaf from Walter's mouth. It's Foxglove, all right.<eos> Get this. It's been used as a gypsy curse dating back 300 years.<eos> It's a natural source of digitalis.<eos> Oh, a common heart medication.<eos> It contains cardiac glycosides that affect the muscles of the heart.<eos> Was Walter on it?
Did I miss something?<eos> You guys don't tell me anything, seriously.<eos> Ruth fell off the wagon.<eos> She's in rehab.<eos> She's not fit to be a mother.<eos> All the more reason to figure out who this guy is and what he wants, 'cause like it or not, Mike's enemies are our enemies.<eos> Fine.<eos> But I'm doing this for Madeline.<eos> The concept of only sharing information that operatives need to know isn't just used by intelligence agencies.<eos> Terrorists use it too for the same reasons.
I can't say which room they'd been in or if they'd been in a room at all except... I don't know why else they'd be up there.<eos> Anyway, they went downstairs and he drove her back to the village.<eos> Who was this lady?<eos> He said her name was Miss Bunting, a Miss Sarah Bunting.<eos> Of course, Mr Branson is still a young man and he can't be expected to stay single all his life but even so...<eos> Thank you, Barrow.<eos> Yes, My Lord.<eos> Do we have anything I can take up some ice in?<eos> Why do you need ice?<eos> Mr Levinson seems to want it in everything he drinks.
Jesus fucking Christ...<eos> You're killing me, man.<eos> This is nuts.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Get your badge out.<eos> How are you?<eos> There was this guy, Georgie, I hung with in prison.<eos> Thought he ran the joint.<eos> We're in the cafeteria, beating the Christ out of some guy and I see this guard come over from behind and he cracks Georgie over the head with a stick and his fucking eye pops out.<eos> I could've caught it in my hand.
Modicums of deceit are one thing, father, but I will not be part of blatant corruption.<eos> It's no different from that pathetic little spur in Pennsylvania into which you dumped our fortune. Except, this time, we'll be on the other side... the victorious side.<eos> The answer is no.<eos> If you would like a "yes", go buy it from somebody else.<eos> We might have underestimated just how much tincture is necessary to knock the pig out.<eos> Again, I'm very sorry.<eos> Have I ever told you about the time I pissed in that pimp's hat?<eos> No.<eos> It was quite an offloading.<eos> I nearly filled it right up to the brim.
- Lorna, can you get me the Department of Labor on the phone?<eos> Diane and Will asked for you. - They...<eos> Now?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Could you close the door?<eos> We have an insurrection on our hands, Alicia.<eos> Because of you.<eos> - The assistants are asking for a raise.<eos> - They're inspired by this case that isn't a case.<eos> We thought you were giving it up.
You have to keep going for her sake.<eos> could you come up to the bridge quickly, there's an urgent call for you.<eos> BASTARDS<eos> PARIS, ONE MONTH LATER<eos> Bye, honey.<eos> - Good morning, Ma'am.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Wait, there's some mail for you.<eos> So they've sold the old lady's apartment?<eos> No, they're renting it in the meantime.
We're getting on the plane, but we won't close the door, and we won't take off unless you say you're ready.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me -<eos> - Darryl.<eos> Listen.<eos> You've heard that expression "Keep your eye on the ball?"<eos> Well, right now the ball is Kansas City.<eos> This is the first step in getting you there.<eos> Those stairs take you to your dream...<eos> But you need to decide how badly you want it.
It was sent to protect you.<eos> Protect us from what?<eos> You'll see... in time.<eos> How can we see anything now that you've blacked out the dome?<eos> If you want the darkness to abate, you must earn the light.<eos> How?<eos> By protecting the egg.<eos> And if we fail, it's the end, isn't it?<eos> For all of us.<eos> So how do we protect it?

Naturally, you wanna dream a little larger.<eos> And Alec, believe me. You will.<eos> I mean, I am living proof.<eos> But, pardon the pun, there's time for that.<eos> Arc is now.<eos> You said so yourself, it's gonna create a new matrix in protecting our privacy, our security...<eos> How we engage the world, how we communicate with one another...<eos> - It's going to change the world!<eos> - And Alec, you're going to change it.<eos> Yeah, and you're going to sell it.
And can you please just tell your son to stop coming to the gallery and trying to friend me online?<eos> I'm really not interested.<eos> "Missing masterpiece lost during the early occupation of Poland in 1939."<eos> That's why she really wanted your painting.<eos> Do you know how much it's worth?<eos> Over a million dollars.<eos> Are you following me?<eos> I looked it up.<eos> It's not the real painting.<eos> Then give it back.
This is fun.<eos> They don't let me out of the office very much.<eos> Really?<eos> Could've fooled me.<eos> Thanks for letting me tag along.<eos> Well, we didn't.<eos> Director Vance insisted you join us.<eos> So, what does that do?<eos> We traced a stolen cell phone to this complex.<eos> Now we just need someone to use it to pinpoint its exact location.
(Sighs) You're about to tell me you don't want her to go to Africa with me.<eos> Oh, Remi.<eos> I have seen so many women throw their ambition away because they're scared of losing a man.<eos> To be honest, I'm the one who's scared of losing her.<eos> I know.<eos> But if you love her, you must let her go to school.<eos> Let her be everything she can be.<eos> So what do you want me to do?<eos> I've written a note.<eos> You're gonna copy it... (Voice breaking) In your handwriting and leave it for Valentina.
You want me to get excited about the ground floor idea, five percent, no overhead, clean.<eos> Hi, Patti. It's odd you're in on this.<eos> The pharmaceutical industry likes Kresteva over your boy.<eos> Is this a new one?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've lost track.<eos> You can call me Nana Joe.<eos> - I love your beret.<eos> - I took it off out of respect.<eos> No, put it on.
You saw a suspicious man carrying in ballots?<eos> And you have no reason to lie here today.<eos> Nana Joe... do you take the prescription medicine<eos> - memantine?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And why do you take - this medicine?<eos> - My doctor - told me to.<eos> - But it's an Alzheimer's medicine, isn't that correct?<eos> I'm not showing the symptoms.<eos> - So, then, why do you take it?
Did she?<eos> I believe she happened upon one of your nauseating DVDs.<eos> Which one? This exercise in voyeurism featured the Stappords.<eos> Did Marisol say anything?<eos> Mnh-mnh. But she was hiding it when I walked in the room.<eos> She was clearly mortified.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe not. Marisol has an agenda.<eos> We've known this for a while.<eos> Maybe she was searching for it.
Let's go.<eos> I thought you said I wouldn't enjoy this, Harold.<eos> Sadly, though, if my access to the machine only lasts 24 hours, it's time to go.<eos> Your friend John's been keeping up with us. How is that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I wasn't asking you, Harold.<eos> You wanna fill me in on who you're talking to, John? Our fairy godmother?<eos> The group you used to get your intel from.<eos> You called them Research.<eos> Your ex-boss called it Northern Lights.
These people. This office. And what this is all about.<eos> What's in this code?<eos> Memories.<eos> They're its memories.<eos> You call it a life, I call it a machine, but the truth is... somewhere in the middle.<eos> Even when I was building it, I began to encounter anomalies.<eos> As if it had imprinted on me, like a child with a parent.<eos> Then it started looking out for me, altered its own code to take care of me.<eos> It was behaving like a person.<eos> But the world didn't need a person to protect it. It needed a machine.
What is the Initiative planning to do with Carrion?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Don't care.<eos> After I validated it, I tweaked your code for a little insurance.<eos> Carrion can't operate without my magic touch, which means either you get me out of here or they will.<eos> Just a question of who wants it more.<eos> - We done here?<eos> - Ah, almost.<eos> How do I access the Amanda Clarke Foundation account?<eos> Since you like games so much, you'll find it in a place I was born, if not made.
Michael, if you want to save me, save yourself.<eos> How do we know Dr. Kang isn't working for the Shop too?<eos> We don't.<eos> Part of me hopes he's dirty.<eos> At least I could punch someone.<eos> Alex, look.<eos> If this goes bad, I'm worried about what it'll do to Nikita.<eos> Make her understand that her family, the one that she's built, is there for her.<eos> She started this journey by herself.<eos> I need to know she will not end it alone.
It was never intended.<eos> Tony...<eos> I care too much about our... friendship.<eos> I do not want it to be awkward between us.<eos> Hey...<eos> Nothing's awkward between friends.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> On the phone with JSOC.<eos> Did Wayne tell you about the McBride case?<eos> Wish we could have intercepted that package before the wife ever opened it.
We were just talking.<eos> I was helping her with her kill.<eos> With her kill, really?<eos> What can I say, I'm irresistible...<eos> Relax.<eos> You know I wouldn't date one of your lame friends anyway. Right?<eos> So, I won't be able to go to school with everyone else?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Honey, listen, all we need to do is give you the test, and once you pass it, everything's gonna be fine.<eos> If he passes it.
Hey, if you can't outrun a horse...!<eos> Sorry, did I disturb you?<eos> What's wrong with you today?<eos> Esther's run off with the new girl because someone told her she could find her baptism certificate.<eos> Might find, I think I said.<eos> As if it mattered.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> One of the carters.<eos> There'll be big trouble if Master Robert sees this.<eos> You'd best give it back, then.
I'm upset because an innocent man is going away for murder.<eos> You said they found a gun in the apartment.<eos> The gun was a plant.<eos> The question is, who wanted to frame him?<eos> The publisher.<eos> The publisher.<eos> Wasn't the victim her best-selling author?<eos> Yes, but she was the one that put us on to Weyland.<eos> Okay, assume for a minute that...<eos> That Barbara did give Weyland's book to Preston, and maybe he did plagiarize it.
- Exactly.<eos> What?<eos> - It was implicit.<eos> - SELINA:<eos> Implicit? Implicit like a "kick me" sticker on my keister would be implicit?<eos> Uh, Madam Vice President, greatest respect, but it has been the job of the VP over the ages to take it in the ass to save the President.<eos> Yeah, let me tell you something.<eos> This ass is closed for business.<eos> This ass is in clench-down.<eos> I don't want to be a decoy. Let the President take it in the ass.
You did it.<eos> The resolution took less time than you anticipated.<eos> Well, it took all the time leading up to this time.<eos> So you were expecting a solution today?<eos> Yes, I was, yes.<eos> And yet you said it was going to be a long process.<eos> And it was, yeah.<eos> It was.<eos> Were you involved in the--<eos> Janet, it's like when you loosen a pickle jar and somebody comes by and they just open it.
People, not profits!<eos> Friends!<eos> Friends!<eos> Terrorist!<eos> Terrorist!<eos> Terrorist!<eos> Yes, from some points of view, you could say I'm a terrorist.<eos> I instill fear, terror into those that want me silenced, the ones that want all of you silenced!<eos> So if fighting for you, the ones that can't fight for themselves, makes me a terrorist, then I guess that's exactly what I am.<eos> But same with George Washington and Nelson Mandela, Geronimo! Any kid who picks up a stone and throws it at a tank advancing on his village!
But they had each other.<eos> If you think I care more about land than my brother you're wrong.<eos> But if what you're saying is true if someone killed Marko over a piece of pasture... you best pray you find them, Sheriff.<eos> Because if I get to them first I will rip them apart with my bare hands.<eos> Death came in like thunder.<eos> [Vic] Walt?<eos> If you're a man like Sal and you wanted to kill someone you do it face-to-face.<eos> You'd want to see him up close watch the light go out of their eyes and you wouldn't care if you got caught.<eos> Poison is a coward's weapon.<eos> Killers that use it are patient, sneaky.
I'm mentioned in it 'cause I'm sick.<eos> Sorry, Maggie. I just don't have the touch today.<eos> Mom, I found your wedding dress.<eos> How?<eos> Using something this town has never, ever seen-- good, honest police work.<eos> I staked out the alley and befriended the garbage man who took it. Then he gave it to a local theater company, who used it in the first unsuccessful version of Mamma Mia.<eos> In a bankruptcy sale, it was bought by a young couple. That couple right there.<eos> I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> Thank you for finding it, sweetie.<eos> And seeing someone else get married in it is better than having it myself.
So do I.<eos> Everybody's here.<eos> The minute they mention the location of the bombs, we move in and this ends.<eos> Professionally, they're all armed and dangerous. Proceed with extreme caution.<eos> Personally, I don't need any of them to spend another day on this earth.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Get ready to move.<eos> I'm going to check the gold.<eos> It's all there.<eos> We count it just the same.
It's a text.<eos> That's got to be from Michelle.<eos> Eric, get everything you can off that phone.<eos> Just give me a minute.<eos> I don't like being teased, Quinn.<eos> You don't want me breaking down the door.<eos> Just a sec.<eos> You are supposed to be in a hospital.<eos> Do you know what room they're in?<eos> Michelle got Sidorov's phone. Eric's downloading it now. I asked you...
Have pity.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> If only I had the money, man. I wouldn't even think twice.<eos> But I'm really broke.<eos> I'm feeling sorry for Eliza.<eos> That ring is important to her.<eos> I know how hard it was for her to pawn it.<eos> I must get it back for her.<eos> We've only a week to pay for it.<eos> I won't rest until I've redeemed it.
He did not know how to fish, to walk barefoot or to fight<eos> Years later, he feels guilty for not having helped more those who were poor<eos> It is said that when we speak about things we can smooth the pain, understand, go through<eos> I will never find wisdom<eos> I'm not in search of an image of my relatives I would like to touch them<eos> Their voice is missing so I stop speaking<eos> I would like to leave everything, my language, my country - but to no avail<eos> Childhood comes back to mind<eos> Now, it is my childhoog which is looking for me<eos> I see it, it would like to speak to me
That's a joke.<eos> It's a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.<eos> Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?<eos> Oh, my.<eos> That's an uncomfortable topic.<eos> Amy... fore I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.<eos> And now?<eos> And now what?<eos> Do you have any interest now?<eos> I have not ruled it out.
Erik Sullivan and Catherine Hatchitt both withdrew money from the same ATM on the day that they died.<eos> That ATM is located in a bodega two blocks from the Edinburgh.<eos> What you want to bet that's where they bought their wine?<eos> Good work, Garcia.<eos> We'll send Morgan and Reid.<eos> Yep.<eos> What'd you find?<eos> Well, they didn't know names, but thanks to Thane and Liz, we now have a map of the distribution chain.<eos> The Ecstasy was flown from Canada into Franklin, a private airport outside the city.<eos> And then a courier transports the drug supply to 5 drop-off points, where the dealers pick up the product and then sell it to their clients.
I know.<eos> Her children want to meet me at Bethesda.<eos> How old are they now?<eos> Too young for this.<eos> You all right?<eos> She smells of booze, Aaron.<eos> You and I know it's because that bastard took away her dignity. But her children might not believe that.<eos> It's hard for them to trust anything to do with her drinking.<eos> She struggled with it all her life.<eos> And she was finally beating it.
Previously, on Touch... A cipher.<eos> An algorithmic tool for sending and interpreting messages.<eos> This amulet, whosoever possesses it shall become the protector of the 36 righteous ones.
- Yes, sir, the Dresden Triptych.<eos> - Ah, the Dresden Triptych, eh?<eos> - 15th century, Romanian baroque.<eos> We intercepted a telegram from his man, Renfield, to the auction house.<eos> Seems that for 12 years,<eos> Grayson has employed agents all over the globe in search of this triptych.<eos> The auction is next week.<eos> Good work, Mr. Cameron.<eos> Hackett, get me this Dresden Triptych.<eos> If Mr. Grayson wants it, then so do I.
Leave. See if I care.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - I have no earthly idea.<eos> Look up there.<eos> - Hello, Abed.<eos> - Hello, Evil Jeff.<eos> What?<eos> How did you--<eos> I may not be good with facial expressions, but I know an evil doppelganger when I see one.<eos> Plus your arm makes a noise every time you move it. Silence.
You've managed to survive on a craphole island that looks like the moon and smells like rotten eggs.<eos> And to do that, you have to be stubborn.<eos> But I ask you to put aside your stubbornness while I tell you about Carl Carlson.<eos> Shame on Carl's family!<eos> The blood of 1,000 tiny horses is on their hands.<eos> Doesn't matter what happened 1,000 years ago, for Carl Carlson's honor has been redeemed by the deeds of Carl Carlson.<eos> Carl Carlson who helped me move, even though I moved the week before.<eos> (crowd gasping and murmuring)<eos> Yeah, and when we were painting my house, Carl Carlson brought that blue tape, you know, that makes you really look like you know what you're doing.<eos> You peel it off, and you got that super straight line there.
The proper question is, what are you going to do to her?<eos> The caterpillar has a forget-me-knot.<eos> That's not a solution. That's another problem.<eos> It will be okay.<eos> Wait here. I'll pop in and get it.<eos> You'll pop in?<eos> To the creature who has all of Wonderland hunting you?<eos> You think he'll just hand over the knot?<eos> He likes to make deals, and I have a deal for him.<eos> You think he'll take it and not just kill you on sight?
I'm going to just hang out here, not at my grandmother's house, and coach him.<eos> - Just for a few days a week. - No.<eos> Ethan, he's just a friend.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> He wants to have sex with you.<eos> How did you jump to that conclusion!<eos> I'm a guy.<eos> And I know things. Like.<eos> If that guy is smart enough to make it to the state spelling bee, then he doesn't need your help.<eos> He may not need it, but he wants it.
I'm just gonna...<eos> I wasn't sure you were ready to do what had to be done.<eos> What'd you tell Martinez and Rosicki?<eos> To capture Julian Randol, get him to confess to what he did, and lead us to the location of his Liber8 friends by any means necessary. What?<eos> That's how we're doing things now?<eos> It's what's required.<eos> Inspector, that's bullshit and you know it! - Detective!<eos> - What?<eos> You think I like the idea of leveraging a kid?<eos> He is part of the cancer that is killing this city and when you have cancer, you cut it out.
What?<eos> Okay, Dr. Brennan said the kill shot was delivered at the picnic table, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So the victim didn't run.<eos> So you're saying that he was left there, knowing that we would find him.<eos> Pelant?<eos> I did a paper on pathological narcissism for my doctorate.<eos> Now, it focused on the killer's need to display his handiwork.<eos> It's-it's a mixture of pride and a need for attention. Pelant.<eos> It's been a while since I read it, so I need to take a look, but some of the details of this body find seem very familiar.
My something old.<eos> This locket was my grandma's.<eos> She kept it hidden in her butt all through World War II.<eos> What?<eos> Where was she?<eos> Winnipeg.<eos> Oh, come on. Lily, it's a joke.<eos> Yeah, I was going to wear this when I married Ted.<eos> I guess that's not going to happen.<eos> So I am taking it with me to Japan.
What?<eos> Where was she?<eos> Winnipeg.<eos> Oh, come on. Lily, it's a joke.<eos> Yeah, I was going to wear this when I married Ted.<eos> I guess that's not going to happen.<eos> So I am taking it with me to Japan.<eos> Okay, Lily, help me put this locket in my butt.<eos> Okay. Uh, you know what?<eos> Why don't we put it in this pencil box instead?
Jesus.<eos> What the fuck am I doing?<eos> Remember when Bridget got suspended?<eos> - Which time?<eos> - She set her purse on fire.<eos> She what?<eos> What?<eos> I don't remember this.<eos> She was smoking in the bathroom at school and someone came in.<eos> She wanted to save the butt. Thought she put it out, stuck it in her purse.
I'll see what you did here.<eos> Why are you taking a photograph of something that's already a picture?<eos> - That's for a brochure.<eos> - This painting sucks.<eos> Why would anyone want it in a brochure?<eos> Yeah. Some people think it's art.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I see what you're doing here with the lights.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Well, when you light it from the side like this, it's still bright without being shiny and having glare.
What do you want to do to them?<eos> Cora's obsessed with power. She's obsessed with status.<eos> I want to make them bow.<eos> She's obsessed with winning at all costs.<eos> Look.<eos> I did it.<eos> Rumplestiltskin was the only man Cora ever loved.<eos> They were almost like soul mates.<eos> The king humiliated me.<eos> I want to kill him, show him his heart as I crush it.
Vick, DeAngelo, come with me. Get Franco.<eos> Little help here!<eos> This is not getting better.<eos> - You okay? - Yes.<eos> Monroe!<eos> They keep coming!<eos> Holy crap, there's a lot of them.<eos> Whatever kind of drug this is, I hope I never see it again.<eos> Bust open one of these containers. Round them up, get them inside.<eos> There's an antidote... we'll get it down here as soon as we can.
No power. Here, let me...<eos> give me that. It's probably just the batteries, man.<eos> You gotta give 'em a spin.<eos> (Switch clicking) No, he's right.<eos> No power. Which also means no heat.<eos> Okay. That's...<eos> Yeah, that's no big deal.<eos> (Sighs) Come on, dudes, we're, uh, men.<eos> These are problems that men fix.<eos> If the generator is not working, then we will repair it.
Alcohol?<eos> That is a big yes.<eos> Unless she gave that up, but I can't imagine<eos> - she would do that.<eos> - No, that's still a yes.<eos> (Chuckles) Last tetanus shot?<eos> No clue.<eos> Currently on any medication?<eos> (Huffs) Man, I don't know.<eos> Well, she has an inhaler, but she barely ever uses it.
Of course not.<eos> Come on, you have to do it.<eos> And the left.<eos> Daddy, you came!<eos> You didn't tell him I was here?<eos> I wanted it to be a surprise.<eos> You catch any fish?<eos> Damn it, I made you a wallet, but it's back in my cabin.<eos> Bobby, language.<eos> We'll get it later.
That was fast.<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> You said you were going to get some ice... and we were going to have a drink and watch the sun set.<eos> I have some things to do.<eos> Stop doing that.<eos> You are really uptight, aren't you?<eos> No, I'm just on a deadline.<eos> - Where'd you get that?<eos> - It was upstairs in one of the offices.<eos> You want to get it on?
It wasn't the guy in room 5. Yeah.<eos> That's our suspect... room 5.<eos> But he won't answer the phone in his room, so we're gonna knock on his door... really hard.<eos> Look, your so-called suspect is testifying in a big murder trial today, so just have your people stand down while we straighten this out.<eos> - One minute.<eos> - You got 30 seconds.<eos> Uh, what are you looking at me for? !<eos> Call him on the cell you bought him!<eos> Oh, uh, what's the number?<eos> You didn't write it down?
You're not taking my children out of Missouri.<eos> You're welcome to visit.<eos> You visit now.<eos> Who the fuck do you think you are?<eos> I'm just saying, I'm going to be there for them.<eos> You don't have to like it.<eos> Well, let me tell you something, pal.<eos> It doesn't matter what you and Virginia do or where you go, 'cause you are never gonna be those kids' father.<eos> You want to keep the title, George?<eos> You got it.
So I keep hearing.<eos> And the nurse involved, I wouldn't want...<eos> Well, as an ex-colleague I wouldn't want anything bad to happen to her.<eos> Jean is a friend.<eos> I won't let anything bad happen to her.<eos> Trust me.<eos> To Mr and Mrs Boss!<eos> Thank you.<eos> For getting us two down the aisle, like you did.<eos> Well, this place isn't nearly as depraved as the papers cut it out to be.
What bait are you using?<eos> Pinkies.<eos> I think there's a big one.<eos> I got a fright, you know.<eos> The next time you want to go fishing at night, wait for me.<eos> - Will I scare them off?<eos> - No, you'll wake him up.<eos> - Yuri, it's late!<eos> - I can't find my maths book.<eos> You can't find it?

I won't get 30 years like the others.<eos> Not if you only cleaned up. Like you said in your statement.<eos> That right, sir?<eos> Where's Bruce Reynolds?<eos> No idea.<eos> 30 years' service.<eos> MBE.<eos> A fine career, Tom, congratulations.<eos> Here's to a well-earned retirement.<eos> I don't want it.
I know what you did.<eos> You're finished at this hospital.<eos> Any normal man would be shaking my hand right now.<eos> I mean, you may not like the way it happened--<eos> You stepped into something you can't even begin to understand, like a child-- willful and stupid, completely unaware of what you've done!<eos> I capped Libby because you were too selfish to do it yourself.<eos> I like your wife.<eos> She deserves to be a mother.<eos> And you know what?<eos> Even though it cost me my job, I'd do it again.
It's a good deal, Damien.<eos> All we want to do is to keep you out jail.<eos> You're asking me to trade my reputation for the firm's. You have 48 hours before the deal's off the table.<eos> How could they legally take something that doesn't... that doesn't belong to them?<eos> Title IV of the Homeland Security Act gives the government permission to verify all weapons of terrorism.<eos> It's a rock, not a nuke.<eos> Yeah, they're both four-letter words to the government until proven otherwise.<eos> Speaking of weapons of mass destruction, 11:00.<eos> How could you lose a meteorite?<eos> Technically, we didn't lose it.
Was anyone injured other than herself?<eos> It wasn't Corinne's fault.<eos> The other driver came out of nowhere.<eos> The coroner said so.<eos> Maggie Bishop, 43.<eos> Nine months ago, missed a give-way sign, shot out of a junction straight into Corinne Franks' car.<eos> The coroner ruled accidental death, but said Mrs. Bishop's failure to give way was a major contributing factor.<eos> God, would you look at that?<eos> Wafer-thin bloody nonsense.<eos> Shave a pig, call it ham?
I know she's dead.<eos> I do know that.<eos> I just can't seem to make it stick.<eos> I keep turning round to tell her what's happened.<eos> Mr. Franks, is there any reason you can think of why anyone would have wanted to harm your wife?<eos> I told your colleague.<eos> No.<eos> No. But when Lizzie Faulkner was killed, she was where Corinne should've been.<eos> We didn't even book the cottage.<eos> We won it in a raffle.
Ma'am!<eos> We got something.<eos> Same pattern every week to ten days, an incoming call from a number that's never appeared before.<eos> Corinne answers.<eos> The call lasts a minute.<eos> In the next couple of days the same number calls, sometime several times a day.<eos> She never picks up again.<eos> Soon as she knows who it is, she stops answering.<eos> But at some point... a new number shows.<eos> She doesn't recognise it, answers it... ..and it all starts again.
Then what?<eos> He told me he wouldn't blame me if I did kill him.<eos> I wouldn't blame you.<eos> I really wouldn't.<eos> But then, I wouldn't be able to get you any money. - What money?<eos> - It's... it's in the note.<eos> - Please, just... just read it.<eos> - I don't want your damn note!<eos> Please.<eos> But I let him read it to me.
- I'll get him.<eos> Is he good to go?<eos> Yeah, he's good.<eos> Okay, big guy.<eos> Come on, let's get you out of here.<eos> What's this?<eos> In case you get cold.<eos> We're still sweeping the area.<eos> Last body?<eos> We'll probably fish it out downstream.
If you can't follow through, you have to stop doing it.<eos> Mmm. Obviously, we'll push being primary carer for your mother as grounds not to disqualify you, but that's temporary.<eos> Do you need a licence for your work?<eos> Oh, I'm not working at the moment.<eos> So unemployed?<eos> Semi-retired.<eos> My husband's still running the vineyard.<eos> -A vineyard?<eos> -Yes, we make wine.<eos> We don't actually drink it all ourselves.
And no one was open?<eos> Kyle was all by himself right under the basket.<eos> Okay, wait. Who's Kyle?<eos> Burke.<eos> Kyle Burke.<eos> The guy who was supposedly wide open but wasn't.<eos> You're always doing this.<eos> Doing what?<eos> Criticizing my game in front of a stadium full of people.<eos> Look, if you have a comment, why don't you save it for when we're at home instead of 20,000 fans?
Everything else is irrelevant.<eos> OK.<eos> I get it.<eos> We're doing it by the book.<eos> Back to the beginning.<eos> Start with the parents.<eos> That's right.<eos> Anderton was right all along.<eos> That stranger abduction crap the brass got hung up on was a dead end.<eos> Byrne knew we were closing in, he realised we'd find the body, so he moved it.
I'm confused.<eos> I feel like this is a test, or a trick question or something...<eos> You know what, forget it.<eos> Forget I said anything.<eos> I'm going to go. I have homework I need to do.<eos> Wait, Lexi, come on.<eos> Come on yourself, Jesus.<eos> So, here's the truth.<eos> There's no way this case is ever getting in front of a jury.<eos> The judge is going to throw it out, as sure as I'm sitting here.
All: Recall Knope!<eos> Recall Knope!<eos> Legalize weed!<eos> Last week, I was an answer in the Pawnee Journal's Crossword Puzzle.<eos> The clue--"Who's the worst," but you know what?<eos> We're fighting back.<eos> I've broken my defense initiative into 40 phases.<eos> We are currently in phase 26:<eos> "No problem too small."<eos> Anyone can come to me any time with any problem, no matter how petty or small, and I will fix it personally, and let me tell you, some of these complaints are pretty damn petty and small.
We're 4,000 miles away.<eos> [Cell phone chiming] - Hello.<eos> - Leslie, it's Jerry.<eos> Jerry who?<eos> Gergich.<eos> Jer--oh, Jerry.<eos> Jerry, why are you calling me?<eos> I don't want to waste my international minutes.<eos> Leslie, your speech was webcast, here in Pawnee.<eos> Everyone saw it.
Jerry who?<eos> Gergich.<eos> Jer--oh, Jerry.<eos> Jerry, why are you calling me?<eos> I don't want to waste my international minutes.<eos> Leslie, your speech was webcast, here in Pawnee.<eos> Everyone saw it.<eos> What do you mean, "everyone"?<eos> I had organized a big viewing party, you know, to support you, and, well, now that Kathryn Pinewood lady, she's already pounced.<eos> She's calling it the... "Pee-pee-head" speech.
Our tactical team is moving into position.<eos> There is no way off that roof.<eos> Yes, but I've got Dale Gordon.<eos> If you come in, he dies.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> I'm on a rooftop, idiot.<eos> What do you think I want?<eos> She wants a helicopter.<eos> It's gonna take some time.<eos> Let me know when you have it.
I'll see you at the rendezvous point.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They all look the same.<eos> Not like twins.<eos> More like cousins.<eos> Who were these men?<eos> And why were they worth so much money?<eos> Wait, I think I found something.<eos> I saw the buyer using this weird piece of tech.<eos> Looks like he left it behind. What is it?
- Mm-hmm. So, what are you reading?<eos> You looked a little emotional.<eos> These e-mails from my professor client and his model girlfriend, whom he's never actually met.<eos> That's weird.<eos> I thought so, too.<eos> Anyway, they've been e-mailing for about two months, but we can't locate her.<eos> Oh! She's a model named Melody Lanthum.<eos> Mnh-mnh. No agency's heard of her, either.<eos> Well, maybe she models under a different name.<eos> Remember when I almost changed my name to Lady Gaga before Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta stole it from me?
I warned you, Bob.<eos> When it comes to fishing, I'm bad luck.<eos> How so?<eos> Come on!<eos> How many hours were we out there, huh?<eos> Not a single fish caught, not even a nibble.<eos> That's why they call it "fishing," not "catching".<eos> I ran Seth's name through the AP wire and all the other known agencies, including the local affiliates up there in Alaska, and nothing came up.<eos> I guess that's good.<eos> Believe me, if he'd been in an accident, somebody would've covered it.
Well, even if you know it, it's nice to hear it.<eos> "You got it going on yourself, big guy."<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Guys, slow down.<eos> This is going too fast.<eos> He wants to know what we're wearing.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> How desperate does he think we are? I'm wearing black fishnets and a torpedo bra.<eos> "Torpedo bra"?<eos> Haskell's definitely doing the typing.<eos> "Sounds hot. Why don't you take it off, baby?"
She was a good person.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss, Ashley.<eos> And yours, Mrs. Phillips.<eos> Hey, Dr. Isles.<eos> I'm just reading a law reviewarticle Judge Harper and Roger Thorson wrote when they were at BCU...<eos> "Rehabilitation instead of retribution."<eos> - She was amazing.<eos> - Thinking about the road not taken?<eos> What's the matter with your wrist?<eos> I've had intermittent tingling and stingers ever since I broke it in the parking-garage collapse.
There isn't one.<eos> Even if we get past their security...<eos> Which we can't.<eos> Their server room is uncrackable.<eos> I hope you're not telling me that this is impossible, Michael, because failure is not an option here.<eos> There is a way in. It just won't be easy.<eos> Their camera cables run through an outside wall into their security room here.<eos> If we access those cables, we might be able to hijack the system.<eos> This office is on the eighth floor.<eos> How are you going to get to it from the outside?
In your career, how many times have you had to execute an action that you knew was morally wrong for the mission?<eos> You make a deal with someone who you know is a monster because you had to follow orders?<eos> Too many times.<eos> I was the same, once.<eos> Then one day I was done with that.<eos> I can't fight and bleed for men without principle anymore.<eos> That's why I've created this network...<eos> To be the conscience, to do the right thing.<eos> Now, when we find a monster, we don't make a deal with it.<eos> We destroy it.
They... they can't be out of stock.<eos> I need 17-85B.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I think I have an idea.<eos> But Jane needs me now.<eos> But but... trust me, I will take care of this.<eos> Hey, boss.<eos> What's up?<eos> Are there any more photos of the crime scene?<eos> Well, it's a 500-square-foot apartment, and these photos cover every inch of it.
Are they serious?<eos> I wasn't sure if the snake was poisonous, but Sam, he had no fear.<eos> He just, you know, he stepped up to the mic.<eos> Put it on top of its head.<eos> Watch out now, guys.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Be careful, Sam.<eos> To me, I just see food.<eos> A snake is protein. They say it tastes like chicken.<eos> So my intention is to cut its head off, gut it, we cook it, cook it good, then we eat it.
- A what? - We gotta get out of here.<eos> We gotta get back to camp.<eos> - Well, uh...<eos> - Now. Let's, um... how about we finish this up real quick?<eos> No.<eos> No. You don't get it.<eos> They smell blood.<eos> They're attracted to it.<eos> Hey! We shot this (Bleep) deer!<eos> We're not just gonna leave it out here.
Let's put it close to the fire, because if we sit, tiger's gonna be like... The tiger is real.<eos> I know that.<eos> So it's gotta know that we're here.<eos> I mean, why wouldn't you?<eos> And then we had that deer and that blood all over the place.<eos> I mean, I just think that right now we should lay low and just keep a fire burning and... and be smart about it.<eos> It was the first time in my life that I've eaten like a pig.<eos> I had grease everywhere.<eos> I enjoyed that deer like it was the last meal in someone's life.<eos> We couldn't completely enjoy it because we were literally (Bleep) ourselves about the fact that there's a tiger out there.
It's great.<eos> And then...<eos> What the hell are you doing? !<eos> What are you doing?<eos> !<eos> - What's the matter! - Listen, guys, we don't know who is- ...to collect this wood?<eos> ! - Listen to me!<eos> We don't know what or who's out there in these woods.<eos> We have no idea.<eos> You light this fire, and everyone is gonna see it, everyone, friends or enemies.
Come in.<eos> Kathy Thompson, Assistant chief of police Russell Taylor, Captain Sharon Raydor, Lieutenant Michael Tao,<eos> And Detective Amy Sykes. And you know your fiancĂ©e, Ron.<eos> Ron, what is going on?<eos> Don't stress out. This will be over in a minute.<eos> I apologize for the crowd, Miss Thompson, And our hurry, But we're trying to avoid a gang war.<eos> And the sooner we can take a look at your engagement ring, The faster all this can be done.<eos> My ring?<eos> Ron, why do they need to see my ring?<eos> Because the LAPD just dug up the last woman Who was wearing it from underneath a row of hollyhocks.
Let me get a drink first.<eos> These are really, really good.<eos> I'm actually very proud of you.<eos> - So, where does Emily think you are? - Comedy workshop.<eos> (SNORTS)<eos> You could use actual words, you know.<eos> Fine.<eos> This is fucked up.<eos> If she finds out now, she'll go mental and drop out of her internship.<eos> She worked her tits off to get it in the first place, and I'm not gonna be the reason she loses it.
Oh, that's great.<eos> Well, I mean, if you're so into India, maybe you should just go ahead and get really into India.<eos> You're being really ridiculous.<eos> You know what?<eos> We wouldn't even be having this conversation if you had just gone through with the treatment.<eos> Oh, so, that's what this is really about, right?<eos> So, I should have just doped or just juiced, no matter what it's gonna do to my health and the fact that it's cheating?<eos> T.K., it's not cheating!<eos> It is cheating!<eos> Not if nobody knows about it!
Never thought I'd have to kill a man.<eos> I was Reemy, I-I fixed spark plugs.<eos> But the Chinese... They never stopped coming.<eos> We needed all the fire power we could raise.<eos> Then they came at night.<eos> They came so close, we had to use our bayonets.<eos> It was like... carving meat... in the dark.<eos> Blood dries on khaki. You can't get it out.<eos> And when you sweat, it smells like... liver in a butcher's.<eos> Can you smell it now, Alan?
It is nothing like a magic trick.<eos> It's exactly like a magic trick. Don't worry, Benny.<eos> We have your lunch.<eos> Out of the kindness of your heart?<eos> We need information.<eos> What else is new?<eos> We're trying to find a stolen cellphone.<eos> Grabbed right out of a man's hand on the street this morning.<eos> Ah, the new purse-snatching.<eos> All the cool kids are doing it.

Chances are, whoever took your guy's phone is probably working that same spot right now.<eos> Time to set a trap.<eos> Double or nothing.<eos> Pick the one without the pea.<eos> Okay.<eos> Abracadabra.<eos> Soup's up.<eos> You know he's gonna grab my phone, right?<eos> Why is that?<eos> Because I'm using it like a normal human being instead of holding it out like bait.
Daniel died.<eos> Yes, Daniel died.<eos> Tell me about Daniel.<eos> He was smart and funny.<eos> He loved to draw...<eos> Pencils and ink, mainly.<eos> One day I fell asleep, and he drew this beautiful dragon on my arm.<eos> I didn't want to wash it off.<eos> The next morning when I woke up, it was gone.<eos> He called it a magical dragon.
Now give me the phone.<eos> How would your dad feel if you got yourself hurt?<eos> Or killed?<eos> Come on.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> I warned you.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Marcos?<eos> Marcos can't come to the phone right now, but I have what you're looking for.<eos> I'll trade it for the kid.
Is there another explanation for Bob Scott, for this?<eos> Yes!<eos> That you're getting too close to the truth about Clyde Ritter.<eos> That's it.<eos> Michelle, I am not letting this happen again.<eos> Eight years ago, my father came here to give a speech.<eos> It was about guiding principles.<eos> You see, dad... dad thought everybody should have one word that summed them up. Told you who they were, what they stood for.<eos> Back then, my word was "party".<eos> Afterward, um... they gave me a speech, and I read it.
So, why don't you tell me the truth, Brady?<eos> Who's really behind the murder of your father?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about. The gunman got into the ballroom wearing an e-pin.<eos> 17 were issued that day, three to members of your family, including you.<eos> The truth was staring at me all along, that photo of you and your father taken the day of the assassination.<eos> And you're not wearing your pin.<eos> You weren't a politician back then.<eos> You were a drunk... With a trust fund.<eos> And along came Bob Scott with a generous offer to buy your pin.<eos> Your own money. Not doled out by a disapproving father... And you took it.
And a down-and-out spy you met along the way.<eos> That's how we do it, people.<eos> Bottom line, as long as you're burned, You're not going anywhere.<eos> It's not easy knowing how far to go To build trust.<eos> Last night, Sonya and I--<eos> Why are you telling me this, Michael?<eos> I couldn't ask for you to be part of this operation without you knowing everything.<eos> Michael, it's not okay to sleep with the enemy.<eos> She is still the enemy, right?<eos> When we find a monster, we destroy it.
I'm quicker than all of you.<eos> Then let's race.<eos> I'm a world champion on the verge to become world champion again.<eos> I could beat this guy. Trust me.<eos> The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel.<eos> This lot are going to wet themselves.<eos> In the film, you show Niki Lauda, warts and all.<eos> I had no idea he was like that, this OCD, very straight guy.<eos> How did he react when he saw the finished product?<eos> When he saw it, he was moved by it, and I think it was because he never really had a perspective on that period around the accident.
Your driving makes me tense.<eos> Tell me something.<eos> Have I ever had an accident?<eos> Even a small one?<eos> Have I ever?<eos> Why do the _o of you bicker?<eos> What was that, son?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Spin the grindstone, spin the grindstone<eos> Spin the grindstone, spin the grindstone lf the grain is ground too fine the wind blows it away
Tell me something.<eos> Have I ever had an accident?<eos> Even a small one?<eos> Have I ever?<eos> Why do the _o of you bicker?<eos> What was that, son?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Spin the grindstone, spin the grindstone<eos> Spin the grindstone, spin the grindstone lf the grain is ground too fine the wind blows it away<eos> And if ground too coarse no one will eat it lf ground too fine the wind blows it away lf ground too coarse no one will eat it
I just needed a light.<eos> Why would you not sweep me off my feet, hmm? I know plenty of guys would.<eos> Pick one.<eos> I have.<eos> He's sweet, but a fool.<eos> I throw myself. He never catches.<eos> He sounds like a sap.<eos> What are you afraid of, hmm?<eos> That you'd break my heart?<eos> I'd crush it.
A few words?<eos> I echo the sentiments expressed here today by Mayor Bowron.<eos> My department is a proud and honorable one, and I will not stand by while the malcontent press dwells on a few bad apples and drags our good name down.<eos> Don't forget where you found it.<eos> Don't make me come looking for you.<eos> I won't.<eos> I'm sitting in his office right now.<eos> Yeah, he just walked in.<eos> Yes, Jimmy. It's in his hands.<eos> I will make sure he brings it back.
I'd have talked him out of it.<eos> It was a stupid bet.<eos> She's got spunk.<eos> You didn't tell me that, either.<eos> Shame on me.<eos> Anyhow, I thought it couldn't hurt to ask, huh?<eos> Look, I would love to stay and talk. But I'm flying to Nevada for a quick meeting.<eos> But when I get back, dinner.<eos> Mickey's got my number.<eos> Then I'll use it.
You see, it backfired.<eos> I did my research.<eos> You may have worked for the Smithsonian Institute, but no one in my line of work has heard of you.<eos> You're out of your league.<eos> You're right, Dion, I've never worked on this side of the business, but that's a good thing.<eos> I don't have allegiances to anyone else.<eos> And there's one more reason.<eos> Your Klee isn't in any of those crates.<eos> That painting alone is worth over 1/2 million.<eos> You kill me, you'll never see it again.
Yeah, you do.<eos> So sounds like you're moving into a new place.<eos> Yeah, importer/exporters keep really weird hours.<eos> Sometimes they stay out until the middle of the night driving around in their fancy cars.<eos> Sometimes they even pick up sexy blind guys.<eos> I can keep playing this game of charades as long as we need to.<eos> The night I wore this dress to the opera, I was hoping I'd have another fancy occasion to put it on.<eos> Then I thought, "why wait?"<eos> There's only one problem. Mm?<eos> I'm gonna have a hard time waiting for you to take it off.
You know, I want to be able to tell them that they've got a really awesome dad.<eos> "Dad."<eos> See, you said "dad."<eos> But you didn't get a dad.<eos> You got a sperm donor.<eos> That's what you asked for.<eos> I wrote up the amendment because I... I sensed you might be looking for more.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um... okay.<eos> I'm gonna go home and sign the amendment and then I'll bring it back.
The plywood's been affected, but it's not been eaten through.<eos> It's just sort of like it's been charred. And the bathtub?<eos> The bathtub looks like it's been burned some,<eos> But, uh... It's completely intact, And it's holding 20, 25 gallons of stuff in there.<eos> That's amazing. I've never seen anything like that.<eos> The -- the pig is just like it was never there.<eos> It's turned into some kind of black goop.<eos> What pig?<eos> I don't know anything about no pig.<eos> There's no pig because the chemical reaction Literally broke it down into its elements. Inside the tub was sulfuric acid
It's too hot for all that jawing, negro.<eos> Won't hear me complaining, though.<eos> Yeah, I was built for it.<eos> Thrive in it.<eos> Live for it, hear?<eos> Reckon I done felt every kind of heat there is.<eos> Dry heat, wet heat, windy heat, calm heat.<eos> Hell, I done even felt cold heat.<eos> What the hell is cold heat?<eos> Know it when you feel it.
Yeah, I was built for it.<eos> Thrive in it.<eos> Live for it, hear?<eos> Reckon I done felt every kind of heat there is.<eos> Dry heat, wet heat, windy heat, calm heat.<eos> Hell, I done even felt cold heat.<eos> What the hell is cold heat?<eos> Know it when you feel it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I been feeling it at home ever since the baby come.
Rose.<eos> - Hey-<eos> - Some heat?<eos> Hey, me and Psalms built a windmill today.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Know something?<eos> It's gonna work.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That wind gonna turn the blades, shaft gonna pump the water, and water gonna spill and spill.<eos> Caught this breeze while we were trying it out.
You here to punish us for exercising our right to free speech?<eos> It's a free country.<eos> I hear there's another protest at a fracking rig going on right now. Why aren't you there?<eos> You have a change of heart?<eos> Can't protest every dumb thing the white man does.<eos> Wouldn't have time for home and gardening. - [Chuckles] You lookin' to sell?<eos> - We were.<eos> Then gas started leaking out of the faucets.<eos> Then the neighbor's house blows up.<eos> We could turn this place into the Taj Mahal. Nobody would buy it. That's a tough break.
We never wanted you to find out that way.<eos> But just know that I did everything in my power to keep that video from coming out.<eos> The minute Rico told me about it...<eos> You knew about that video?<eos> Look, I was... I was just trying to protect you.<eos> I am so sick of being protected!<eos> Just get out.<eos> Just get out, all of you.<eos> I forgot my backpack.<eos> Jo's probably burning it right now, anyway.
Camille.<eos> You've been avoiding me, Uncle K.<eos> My favorite niece?<eos> Never. Don't lie.<eos> This is a church.<eos> Besides, I came about professional advice...<eos> About Sean.<eos> The spell of unknotting?<eos> This is a sanguinem knot.<eos> The witches use it as representational magic.
You know, I contemplated leaving bits of you artfully arranged outside your family's tomb.<eos> I thought it would leave a fitting message.<eos> Don't touch my family.<eos> Leave her.<eos> I gave my word.<eos> You tend to give your word at the most inopportune times, brother.<eos> We've been doing things your way all day.<eos> Come on.<eos> Just one little snap, and it's toodle-loo, Agnes.<eos> She deserves it.
No one was ever good enough for me, Nik.<eos> You made sure of that.<eos> Now where's Elijah?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> It appears the night is not quite over yet.<eos> I'm off for another drink with Marcel.<eos> Elijah told me your plan to take apart Marcel's empire piece by piece.<eos> I don't remember it involving you two drinking New Orleans dry together.<eos> I know you don't have many friends, Rebekah, but what some friends do when they get together is they drink, and when they drink, they tell secrets.<eos> Marcel has somehow found a way to control the entirety of witches in the quarter, and I aim to uncover the how so I might take it for myself.
There are people up there who are hearing information we don't want leaked.<eos> And also this is a shot of Charlie on the floor with broken champagne glasses, which isn't the best optic for us right now.<eos> - I don't have the muscle to get security to... - That's Lisa.<eos> - Kneeling on the floor, that's Lisa.<eos> - That is Lisa.<eos> She didn't want you to know she was here tonight.<eos> She's been working for a caterer to earn extra money.<eos> Why didn't she want me to know she was here?<eos> This is where I'm gonna check out.<eos> But someone upstairs has a phone and they're using it.
- Have a good show tonight.<eos> - You, too.<eos> This is gonna be the night when social media - takes the mantle of democracy from--<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Hey, did you know your book sold for $1,000?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - At the auction.<eos> - My book?<eos> - It got bid up to $1,000.<eos> And you were afraid no one was gonna buy it.
You have to...<eos> Bye, Rachel. See you tomorrow.<eos> Good-bye, Dani.<eos> Aren't you heading out, too?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> I like to watch the sun rise over that building.<eos> I just love how the diner goes from being quiet and dark to suddenly just... glowing.<eos> I've never seen it.<eos> Well, stick around.<eos> We'll watch it together.
The last round of radiation almost did me in.<eos> It's funny. You take medicine, tryin' to kill a disease and it almost kills you.<eos> I told Lee, I said, "No more.<eos> No more doctors, no more hospitals, no more medicine."<eos> So, um... What's all this, then?<eos> Oh, just herbal remedies.<eos> Are you familiar with a supplement called Velvetine?<eos> Yeah, Lee got it for me, after he read about it on the Internet.<eos> It's supposed to be some miracle cure.<eos> I don't know if it's makin' me any better, but it makes him feel better, when I take it.

Your punctuality.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> You're late and the car smells like olive oil.<eos> Hold this... and this.<eos> What am I doing here?<eos> You're heating my coffee.<eos> Hey!<eos> I like it hot.<eos> It's best between 155 and 175 degrees.<eos> Most people prefer it at 175.
You're heating my coffee.<eos> Hey!<eos> I like it hot.<eos> It's best between 155 and 175 degrees.<eos> Most people prefer it at 175.<eos> You like it at 165, and that's what it is.<eos> You know how I like my coffee?<eos> Yes, I, unlike you, pay attention to details, like what time it is and what time you're supposed to pick up your partner for shift.<eos> Oh, I pay attention to details, like you just put your finger in my coffee.<eos> If you'd like, I could put it somewhere else.
- Maybe they're outside the building.<eos> - But the jammer's still on.<eos> If they have people outside, they wouldn't be able to talk to each other.<eos> Unless they were talking some other way.<eos> "Start."<eos> They must be using it as some sort of point-to-point communication with someone in proximity - of the building.<eos> - Paige said the man in charge... kept going to the window.<eos> I didn't think they'd come through.<eos> What if there's a tracking device?<eos> We're not taking it anyway.
He shares our values and has his own career.<eos> That's important now that you come from a rich family.<eos> Trust me.<eos> There are men out there who will only want you for your money.<eos> You took Ted back?<eos> Sure.<eos> He just needed a couple of days to get his head straight.<eos> You know, we haven't been communicating so good, so he took some time to figure things out.<eos> Yeah, like how to explain all those texts to the cable guy.<eos> There was a problem with the fibers or the optics or something, and they fixed it.
- You nearly killed a man.<eos> - No, I let him live.<eos> And you're lucky he did.<eos> What happened?<eos> Did you lose your nerve?<eos> Never.<eos> He should suffer.<eos> He should live in fear.<eos> You sure you don't want that sandwich?<eos> 'Cause, I mean, I'll eat it if you don't.
You ladies planning on coming to work today, or...?<eos> Nice press conference.<eos> I can handle the media, but I can't man every city surveillance camera by myself in the hopes of finding...<eos> My boyfriend?<eos> We need to work together, pull in JT, do whatever it takes to find Vincent before he hurts anyone else.<eos> You make it sound like he's some out-of-control killer. This was revenge, plain and simple.<eos> Muirfield had Vincent for three months.<eos> They changed him. He is clearly more dangerous than before.<eos> Look at the brutality of this mauling.<eos> And he did it with a different M.O.
No, but I have answered about 60 phone calls this morning about the Ebola attack on the public library that wasn't.<eos> So before we go announcing a bomb-making scare, I'd like a little more proof.<eos> Eliot, C-4's only used for one thing: to blow stuff up.<eos> Yeah, look, maybe this guy's digging himself a swimming pool or taking a tree out of his backyard.<eos> - Oh, please. - All I'm saying is, for now, I'd like to keep this in-house.<eos> I get it.<eos> We go wide with "bomb-maker" now, we've got to bring in Homeland Security, - they take it off our plate.<eos> - And I like things on my plate.<eos> I imagine you guys do, too, so... keep going. Let's see what this guy was trying to blow up.<eos> And when we need help, we'll ask for it.
Well, it's-- It's all right.<eos> When one loses a parent at a young age, they miss out on a whole lifetime of unconditional love.<eos> Lucky for you, I know where you can find a little extra. Hmm?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Daniel.<eos> - Look, uh, about yesterday...<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Obviously, I was mistaken.<eos> The old Daniel wouldn't have hesitated.<eos> Now the new Daniel picks up my dress and hands it to me.
Make sure your phone's on.<eos> If you hear from Scott, you let us know immediately.<eos> Yeah, I'm thinking that's gonna be kind of unlikely.<eos> Both of you, try to remember he's just doing what he thinks is right.<eos> I can't shoot a gun or use a crossbow, but... Well, I'm... I'm getting pretty good with these.<eos> I've heard it's something only an Alpha can do,<eos> - and with good reason.<eos> - Which is?<eos> You know normal wolves never abandon an injured member of the pack.<eos> They care for it. They bring it food from a kill and then regurgitate it into the mouth of the injured wolf.
You'll be giving power back to the Nemeton, a place that hasn't had power for a long time.<eos> This kind of power is like a magnet.<eos> It attracts the supernatural, the kind of things that a family like the Argents can fill the pages of a bestiary with.<eos> It will draw them here, like a beacon.<eos> Doesn't sound any worse than anything we've already seen.<eos> You'd be surprised at what you have yet to see.<eos> Is that it?<eos> No.<eos> It'll also have an effect on the three of you.<eos> You won't be able to see it, but you'll feel it every day for the rest of your lives.
It's gotta be now. I don't have a choice.<eos> You always have a choice.<eos> It's whether or not you can live with the consequences... facing Kali as a beta.<eos> But it's not just a full moon coming.<eos> It's a lunar eclipse.<eos> We'll all be powerless.<eos> All right.<eos> What did you bring?<eos> Um, I got my dad's badge.<eos> Jennifer kind of crushed it in her hand, so I tried hammering it out a bit.
Look, Bob, I appreciate your concern, I do, but we all know the real estate market is still struggling, right?<eos> So I really have no choice but to rebuild on my property in order to change the value.<eos> The lighthouse is a historic landmark.<eos> Well, no, it isn't, actually.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah. A structure that old has no historic building protection?<eos> I mean, I've seen buildings half as old as that fall under the protection of the state.<eos> No. But feel free to check out the town records, if you'd like.<eos> I don't care about the town records.<eos> I care about the townspeople, and the people will not let you tear it down.
What are you writing?<eos> I'm working on Tiger's manuscript.<eos> - Is it funny?<eos> - Have you heard me laughing?<eos> Why are you helping such a peacock.<eos> You owe him nothing.<eos> - He never took an interest in you.<eos> - He gave me a painting!<eos> And a horrible one at that!<eos> Don't hang it in here.
What is it?<eos> It's for the fridge.<eos> - How do you know? - For wrapping food.<eos> Our neighbour got it too.<eos> What is it?<eos> Dad taught me design and technology.<eos> Let it go.<eos> The knife will break.<eos> And never to give up.<eos> You can take it off now.
Screw you, Wayne.<eos> Mr. Hayes?<eos> Mr. Collier. Mr. Collier, what's going on?<eos> In light of recent developments, Mr. Deaver doesn't think LifeTrace is the best partner for us, after all.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> This is getting better by the minute.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> I was hoping you could tell me.<eos> No. No, no, no. You gotta take the site down.<eos> We already did, but not before Riverton saw it.
It's for opposing counsel.<eos> Half-cranberry, half-grapefruit juice.<eos> You drink that every morning, don't you?<eos> - Yeah, uh...<eos> - Come on, A.J.<eos> Anybody who's ever had breakfast with you knows you order that crap.<eos> But why are you bringing juice to opposing counsel?<eos> We subpoenaed room-service records from the Atlanta hotel where Lonna attended a cosmetic conference a year ago.<eos> Well, it turns out A.J. was at the same hotel for a legal symposium.<eos> For three days, he ordered juice to his room, then he ordered it to hers.
Um, yeah, you did.<eos> I-I got, like, 20 more larges with pineapple in my trunk.<eos> I'm afraid you've been duped.<eos> This is for your trouble.<eos> Please see those pizzas find a good home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What is happening?<eos> Hmm. They most likely traced the phone here before the microwave destroyed it.<eos> Who-who traced the phone here?<eos> Hector the security guard realized his phone had been stolen, and then tracked it to this address before I realized he was a member and destroyed it.
Let me guess.<eos> They're suing you for groping them while you had them under anesthesia.<eos> Oh, it's completely ridiculous.<eos> They were totally knocked out.<eos> How could they possibly remember anything?<eos> Don't worry, Nelson.<eos> I will bail you guys out.<eos> I just need your debit card and pin number because I'm broke.<eos> Great idea, Wood.<eos> I'll just get it from my wallet.
I'm not stealing.<eos> And I'm not a cop.<eos> It's a shame, isn't it?<eos> So much is wasted when there's so many hungry.<eos> I never knew.<eos> Peanut butter and jelly?<eos> It's pretty good.<eos> No, I can't take your food.<eos> You're not.<eos> I'm giving it to you.
See? Plain, inconspicuous.<eos> They probably parked it in a hangar and then re-skinned it as an emergency vehicle.<eos> And then all they had to do was wait for the crash to happen.<eos> So they show up on the scene as emergency workers, and when everyone else is busy, they walk off with the flight recorder.<eos> Which also means that they knew that the crash was going to happen.<eos> Which proves it was sabotage.<eos> I'm running the hangar rental and owner lists now, but still no luck facial rec-ing these guys.<eos> Okay, what about the vehicle?<eos> Working on that, too.<eos> I doubt you're gonna find it.
You have a dungeon in this place?<eos> Of course you do.<eos> So maybe you should...<eos> I am not hiding, especially in a dungeon.<eos> Wicked Witch, a key, a quest?<eos> Let's do this.<eos> C-Charlie...<eos> I can't believe I've lived here for 75 years.<eos> How long have you called this place home?<eos> My brother calls it home.
Their young, innocent lives?<eos> - See, the way democracy works is...<eos> We appreciate your views... Mr. Bite me!<eos> Well, I didn't get the tape back.<eos> My life is over.<eos> You can sell the rest of the furniture and the house.<eos> I'll just... Live in a box behind the supermarket with the rest of the sex perverts.<eos> Relax, would you?<eos> Making a sex tape is hardly going to ruin your life.<eos> Heck, a lot of people use it as a springboard to move on to bigger and better things, like... Marrying rappers.
- But we're a team.<eos> No, Mel, look, you need to stay here.<eos> We can't leave the kids alone with "Shawshank redemption".<eos> Devin, the Bible study kid?<eos> What, are you afraid he's going to baptize somebody?<eos> No no, look, it's more than that.<eos> I mean, if you get caught, your career is over. Me...<eos> I'm working here.<eos> I'm already paying for a crime I didn't commit.<eos> And if I have to, I can do it again.
You know, it's kind of fun. It brings you back to being a kid.<eos> I've been journaling a lot, writing a lot of my thoughts down.<eos> It's kind of like my own version of poetry.<eos> I'm a type of guy who says,<eos> "Hell, even though I'm an adult, I'll still eat a fruit roll-up."<eos> Got to say, can't miss my Kathie Lee and Hoda.<eos> [ Chuckling ] I mean, those two are wild.<eos> So, I'm taking this spin class, right?<eos> And all of a sudden, I'm like,<eos> "Why do they call it a spin class? They should call it a sweat class."
So good to see you.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Uh, thanks. Good to see you too.<eos> Hey, babe, can we speak in private?<eos> Sure, loyal person who has not betrayed me whom I trust more than my own family!<eos> Wow, I have not seen such hostility since... I last talked to my mother.<eos> Okay, uh, you know what?<eos> Here's the deal.<eos> This is it.<eos> I'm just gonna put it out there.
Shocking. For what, pray tell?<eos> "Pray tell"?<eos> What is this, the old globe?<eos> We're suing for the return of our client's drone.<eos> Pindar Singh was flying his drone under the 400-foot ceiling required in California and was doing a service to his neighbors, scanning the area for toxic Tsunami debris.<eos> The drone wasn't in Mr. Lowe's airspace, which is designated as the open space above the property lines.<eos> Your Honor, if the drone wasn't over Mr. Lowe's airspace, how did it end up landing on his deck?<eos> So glad you asked.<eos> Your Honor, if we may demonstrate with a clone drone, since the plaintiff refuses to give the original back to our client?<eos> Can you operate it safely?
I'll be going to the morehouse mansion on west 23rd street.<eos> Yes sir, mr Donovan. Detective Corcoran.<eos> Just the man I was hoping to find.<eos> I was out of line yesterday.<eos> The lads in the sixth precinct hold you in such high esteem for the very characteristics I criticised.<eos> Truth is, you're a finer copper than I ever was.<eos> I was just noticing your old badge.<eos> Some of my fondest days.<eos> I wanted to tell you, I've been realising that you were right all along.<eos> About police work being easier than I make it.
So we get the fire department to clear that, we break in and then disappear inside the crowd.<eos> This could work.<eos> You said you cracked the anklet, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, this device... is synced to your anklet.<eos> I flip the switch, and that's it.<eos> The tracker says you're standing right where you are.<eos> I am standing where I am.<eos> Yeah, right now you are.<eos> But this captures the signal and loops it back to the FBI.
Kneel down on the shore of the sea, and call unto Him by His name.<eos> When He cometh to thee, and to all who call on Him, He cometh, bow thyself at His feet and ask of Him the remission of thy sins.<eos> Let me kiss thy mouth!<eos> I will kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan.<eos> I will kiss thy mouth.<eos> Thou art accursed, Salomé, thou art accursed.<eos> We must bear away the body to another place.<eos> The Tetrarch does not care to see dead bodies, save the bodies of those whom he himself has slain.<eos> You are right, we must hide the body.<eos> The Tetrarch must not see it.
I remember I saw that he looked languorously at Salomé.<eos> Truly, I thought he looked too much at her.<eos> There are others who look at her too much.<eos> His father was a king.<eos> I drove him from his kingdom. And you made a slave of his mother, who was a queen, Herodias.<eos> So he was here as my guest, as it were, and for that reason, I made him my captain.<eos> I am sorry he is dead.<eos> Why have you left the body here?<eos> Away with it.<eos> I will not look on it.
Is he dangerous?<eos> He's kind of like this fella.<eos> He'd kill you if he got a chance, but he's not very smart, either.<eos> So how does a not-so-smart semi-dangerous man run the rackets down in Tampa?<eos> Enough money and the right connections, you can do pretty much anything down here.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What you want, friend?<eos> You want some of this?<eos> - A switchblade.<eos> - I'll use it, too.
You're not the only one in this house with cool powers.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You missed last call.<eos> For the record, I know exactly what you're up to.<eos> Oh, well, maybe you do, maybe you don't.<eos> Either way, it has no effect on me or my plans.<eos> Yeah, well, look, I'm thinking maybe you should change your plans.<eos> 'Cause you won't win this one, Killian, I promise.<eos> I don't want you getting hurt.<eos> Appreciate the concern. I'll take it under advisement.
We didn't know how to stop it back then.<eos> We do now.<eos> This drink is the cure.<eos> I'm gonna need you to make it.<eos> But why me?<eos> Honey, even with all your inexperience, you have a gift for potions.<eos> It's in your blood.<eos> I'm never gonna be able to make it as good as you.<eos> So this branch can kill regular people, too?<eos> Anybody who touches it.
So, you have my book. When do I get to read your dissertation?<eos> Oh, no. Mmm-mmm.<eos> That is not happening.<eos> I never even finished it.<eos> Why not?<eos> I realized that an academic study of witchcraft was kind of ridiculous.<eos> Oh, so you don't believe in the supernatural?<eos> No. Mmm-mmm.<eos> I'm a rational skeptic, all the way.<eos> In that case, you probably shouldn't read the book I'm working on, if I ever finish it.
Will you slow down, McGee?<eos> I do not understand a word you are saying.<eos> In English.<eos> There's a way of finding the plane if it's flying under the radar.<eos> Social networking, Gibbs.<eos> Twitter.<eos> Abby's got a friend who's in a band.<eos> And right now, every single one of their tweets is being followed by hundreds of thousands of fans.<eos> We post a picture of Keith's plane and ask the group's fans to be on the lookout.<eos> And if anyone sees it, then we tell them to tweet the location with the hashtag "FindThisPlane."
It says all your upgrades were used this weekend by a Thomas Miller.<eos> Uh, Dad?<eos> Something happen with the phone this weekend?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I had a little accident.<eos> How'd you go through three phones in two days?<eos> That's over a thousand dollars' worth of phones literally down the toilet.<eos> They were very slippery.<eos> Especially in a moist environment.<eos> Well, why didn't you just put it in your pocket like a normal person?

Lurking about in the shadows.<eos> Shawn, I'm almost done.<eos> Where are you?<eos> First of all, the correct question is when am I?<eos> And the answer is 1888, London.<eos> I believe the east end.<eos> You are at the show?<eos> Yes, and I know what was in that envelope.<eos> A script. Z's original script.<eos> He mailed it to himself and kept it at the theater.
I liked you because you were smart and marginally easy on the eyes.<eos> And then, there was the codex.<eos> Speaking of, can I ask you something?<eos> You wanna know why I'm investigating Chapter 13.<eos> Well, if it's not for the bureau...<eos> When you're a criminal, you get to know other criminals.<eos> My friend was in a lot of trouble, and the only person who could help him was a really bad guy, and the payment was Chapter 13.<eos> So I stole it.<eos> And you made a copy.<eos> To find out why he wanted it.
When he asked her what was bothering her, she said it was something at work.<eos> Yet her boss claims she was worried about a medical procedure her mom was having.<eos> Go ahead, Garcia.<eos> I am loathe to admit this, but I'm having a hard time recovering all of Alice Emerson's texts and emails.<eos> That company that runs chat alert is damn good at scrambling their data.<eos> And although I am as fast as hot lightning, my server is not because it needs updating, so if someone with great hair and a tie could approve the funding to update such server, we could get this show on the road and I could--<eos> Put in a requisition, Garcia.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Filing form 9093B now.<eos> I am familiar with it and the void it disappears into.
- Was your daughter in porn movies?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Was she in porn movies?<eos> - She was not.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Yes.<eos> If she did, Would you have known it?<eos> - Why do you think that?<eos> - She had silicone breast implants.<eos> It could explain how she could afford it.
- It's Sammy Nyrop.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> What do you want? - Theres another barrel I'm to pickup.<eos> - What should I do?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Wait for instructions from me.<eos> "Mother of three" does not know we found Julian.<eos> - It is certain Ramon is in the barrel.<eos> - What do we do with the barrel?<eos> Sammy gets it.
I told her the news, and she understood, but...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think there's something wrong with the kid.<eos> What if I don't like it?<eos> You lived with Vadim, you can live anywhere.<eos> And it's supposed to be one of the top schools in the world.<eos> Not every kid gets to become the ward of a reclusive billionaire.<eos> Now if you're ever in trouble again, call this number.<eos> Don't sell it, okay?<eos> I know it won't mean much to you, but it'll mean a lotto me that you have it.
We're not begging.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> Saz, no!<eos> Please can I have my journal back?<eos> Charlie didn't catch that.<eos> You need to beg!<eos> I'm begging, please can I have my diary back?<eos> - No.<eos> - It's such a good read.<eos> We're going to hang on to it for a bit.
- No. She is not.<eos> But do you want her to be?<eos> I did... but then a lady in a tree took my love away.<eos> And by the time I got it back, Bo had a girlfriend.<eos> You forgot to start with 'once upon a time'.<eos> Once upon a time... we never found the right time.<eos> The End.<eos> - What does love feel like?<eos> - Are we really doing this?<eos> When you feel it, you'll know it.
You are a brilliant woman.<eos> Own it girlfriend.<eos> - I'll never trust you.<eos> - I wouldn't respect you if you did.<eos> But do remember, I let you see me eat pizza.<eos> Made I just let you think I'd let any schmo do that?<eos> Here are the keys to your new condo.<eos> Call me if you need anything else.<eos> This was ah...<eos> what do they call it?
Clare Balding?<eos> Motherfunkster.<eos> Oi, numbnuts. Why are you wearing goggles?<eos> Er, because I have a severe chlorine allergy.<eos> I don't want to get any splashback from this bad boy.<eos> Wait, you've got webbed feet, but you can't actually swim?<eos> I know, Jing.<eos> God can be a cruel mistress.<eos> It's like giving the Pope a big willy.<eos> Right, I am going to throw this plastic brick into the pool and then each of you is going to take turns to dive in, collect it and then swim it back to shore.
Move. - Come on, come on.<eos> - Let's go. Come on.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Drop the knife.<eos> Sir, put down the knife.<eos> You heard him.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Sir, don't stand up.<eos> Sir! Drop the knife!<eos> Put it down now!
What's wrong?<eos> Oh, Mr. Gold.<eos> Hello.<eos> I should have known.<eos> I'm not as fast as I used to be.<eos> I see.<eos> You're my Clarkswap contact.<eos> You can go now, Deborah.<eos> She seems a little young for you, Mr. Gold.<eos> So, Zach took the gavel home, you stole it, and now you're selling it?
And so, our question is, does this lawsuit change anything, or can we continue our surveillance?<eos> Last time a person of interest contacted these lawyers was two years ago?<eos> You mean Danny Marwat?<eos> Yes. And you're a two-hop warrant?<eos> Yup.<eos> We can go from Marwat to his lawyer to his lawyer's contacts, that's all.<eos> And this has taken you to the governor-elect of Illinois?<eos> Well, yeah, but we're not actively pursuing him.<eos> Doesn't matter. You're going into the governor's mansion, you need a more recent terrorist connection.<eos> Get it to me in 36 hours, and we'll take it to the FISA court.
- Oh, that part I understand.<eos> What I don't understand is why.<eos> She kept fishing.<eos> It was like she wanted me to sell Will out.<eos> Yes, people fish because the fish are biting.<eos> Everyone knows about Will's troubles.<eos> He's my partner.<eos> We built this firm together.<eos> I mean, that means something.<eos> I hope it means everything, because that's what you've traded it for.
Googi, googi, time.<eos> My googi, googi, googi...<eos> I remember, oh, my God, we're doing that thing, which is getting so close to, you know, real things that are genuinely issues that are terrible and the ignorance of people.<eos> And you're doing it in a way that we can make fun of it.<eos> Based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a - very good driver.<eos> - Oh, man, am I a woman?<eos> I think my favorite episode of all-time is one called "The Injury".<eos> I burned my foot very badly - on my foreman grill.<eos> - He wants to wake up to the smell of bacon in the mornings.<eos> This man wakes up every morning and plugs in a foreman grill, goes back to sleep, puts - raw bacon on there and then eats it.
- Yeah, I'm gonna jump from the top of the bridge to the water.<eos> Okay, I need you to act like concerned citizens, but I need this to feel real, okay, guys?<eos> So, I need you to be neutral about the jumper prior to the jump, 'cause you don't know me.<eos> You don't know this man. But I need you to react at the same time because I need to draw the jump in later to match your reaction.<eos> You lost me there.<eos> What do you mean, "Draw the jump?"<eos> - You're not jumping?<eos> - No, I'm not gonna jump.<eos> Of course I wouldn't jump.<eos> I draw it in later because it's like a post effect.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.<eos> Whoa, Martin, are you okay?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Getting old is tough.<eos> My grandpa sneezed once and now he looks like the letter N.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> He threw his back out this morning in the park playing chess with the local Negroes.<eos> Was it the chess, Ed, or was it the running away after you called them "local Negroes"?<eos> Well, what's the big deal?<eos> They call it the United Negro College Fund.

The way I feel about you has changed.<eos> Um, I've outgrown that the way I've outgrown the lab.<eos> But I haven't outgrown our friendship.<eos> So...<eos> Please be my friend, and let me be yours.<eos> [Knocks at door] - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Nice job getting Russel to us.<eos> Nice job getting the antivenom to Russel.<eos> A lot of hospitals don't even stock it anymore.
So, you're saying I shouldn't be happy?<eos> No, what we're saying Is, do you really know who this guy is?<eos> Do you know his religion, his politics?<eos> Thanks for stopping by, But I actually do have to go to work.<eos> No. Diane, please, just sit and talk.<eos> Fran, lyle, If I fell into a life of addiction,<eos> Then, please, do intervene, but don't for this.<eos> Not for love. The best advice You ever gave me, diane, when I met lyle was,<eos> Make sure your love can survive outside the bubble.<eos> I give it back to you.
I'm sorry for making you stay and wait for me here even if the closing time has passed already.<eos> No.<eos> Senator Jo has something to discuss with me. It's worth the wait.<eos> It's because a woman's organization asked me for a favor.<eos> A woman's organization?<eos> What does that...<eos> It's about the murderer that escaped today.<eos> I heard that a female prosecutor will be taking care of the murder case.<eos> Yes, Prosecutor Park Jae Kyung will be...<eos> But... what about it?
Five...<eos> Four...<eos> Oi!<eos> Three...<eos> Two... I'm Just going to get my nephew one of those Dino-cress things from the gift shop.<eos> Seriously, I will be ONE second.<eos> This diamond job is a smoke screen.<eos> There's something else in that museum we're after.<eos> The Big Man's offered top dollar for it.<eos> This is where you'll find it.
He was your friend, too, once.<eos> More than a friend, from what I gather.<eos> Or was he just a means to an end as well?<eos> That's your problem, Alice... always dwelling on the past, when really you should be thinking about the future.<eos> What exactly is it you want me to do?<eos> Help me procure something.<eos> Just a little bit of magic in the form of dust.<eos> It's about a day's journey away.<eos> And it's going to protect me against dark magic such as Jafar's.<eos> If you want it so badly, get it yourself.
What the hell?<eos> Wha--<eos> Hey! Perkins!<eos> What are you doing with my bear?<eos> I've been playing skee ball for, like, two hours trying to win that for Nadia.<eos> I just bought it for 50 bucks.<eos> When I was a kid, I taught myself how to make out on this bear, pretended it was cockroach from The Cosby Show.<eos> Hey, what's going on here?<eos> Why does blossom have my bear?<eos> I bought it for myself, but apparently, he was trying to win it for you, so I'm sorry.
You don't need any of that romantic junk.<eos> That's right.<eos> Just give Ol' Bev. A hallmark card and a used ring.<eos> All right, you know what?<eos> We're gonna get you the $5,000 ring, and you can be the one who tells Adam.<eos> That his teeth are gonna be crooked. For the rest of his life.<eos> Great. That's exactly what I want... a spite ring.<eos> Great, because that's what you're getting.<eos> Okay, my friend, we are buying the ring.<eos> I'd like you to ring it up, because we are buying it!
There's no record of the stuff that I do.<eos> You know, maybe there is.<eos> - There isn't.<eos> - What if there were?<eos> - There's not.<eos> - Dad, I'm saying I have an idea.<eos> My dad may not have been able to say. How he felt about my mom, but luckily, I recorded a bunch of ways that showed it.<eos> Turns out the most romantic movie of the '80s. Was the one that I made with my dad.<eos> I hate my new ring.<eos> I'm gonna take it back tomorrow.
Pawnee is going to have fluoride in its water for the first time in our history, our oral history.<eos> Nailed it.<eos> Of course I'm upset that I lost the recall election. But I'm just gonna spend the remainder of my term cramming in as many good projects as I can.<eos> Lame duck?<eos> Try flame duck... 'cause this duck is on fire.<eos> It's hard doing stupid government stuff now that Rent-a-Swag's closed.<eos> I'm a businessman. That's what I was born to do.<eos> Well, look, you just got to make the most of the job that you have.<eos> Like, take that trash collector.<eos> It's not the most glamorous job in the world, but he's doing it with a smile on his face.
Either way, it's a win for me.<eos> Next on the docket is a vote to approve the Pawnee-Eagleton reservoir merger.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We're just goosing our water supply with fluoride?<eos> Are we really gonna force every Pawnee resident to ingest a chemical we know nothing about?<eos> Fluoride is used by the communists to control our minds.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> - Fluoride can control minds?<eos> Like, you can use it to make ladies do stuff?<eos> How am I the one that is getting booted off of this city council?<eos> Okay, fluoride is safe, it is good for you, and almost every town in America uses it.
Look, the board forced me to hire you, so I did.<eos> But you quit and I replaced you.<eos> My uncle is in charge of the entire grant foundation, and he says if I'm not working here, he's going to shut down your entire study.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> It gets worse.<eos> He says that I am in charge, so I guess that kind of makes me your boss.<eos> You're my boss?<eos> And we start at 9:00 AM here.<eos> And I think that our first priority should be making this an alcohol-free office.<eos> Okay, why don't we take all the booze and put it in that room over there?
They can be traced right back to this time, to them.<eos> Kim Lafonde has grown up in a world that has prospered through the widespread use of victicite.<eos> But the key to the Martian code she uncovered in her great grandfather's cabin is set to question the benefits of this progress<eos> Kim may have lifted the lid on a warning - the invasion is not over.<eos> My family, at some point, we forgot my great grandfather.<eos> I was born nine years after he died, and 21 years later,<eos> I came here and opened up that trunk. The things that he learned about the war, those things survived.<eos> They remain in this book and they were here for me to find.<eos> In his study of these notebooks, the historian Lawrence Hart believes that Gus's Anishinaabe heritage granted him a unique perspective on the alien symbols, and led directly to the cracking of the Martian code.<eos> Hart has completed the work, and applied it to the collected alien texts.

- I love your stand-up comedy.<eos> - I'm Dana White from the UFC. - You're not Howie Mandel?<eos> - No.<eos> Dana White!<eos> Even bigger fan.<eos> I send you videos of myself, of me doing some MMA in my backyard.<eos> The glory in the quarry.<eos> I have no idea what that is, and I don't know who you are. I know what you're doing.<eos> You're trying to play it cool, so you can, like, negotiate a cheaper contract for me.<eos> That's not gonna work, because I do it for free. - All right. We'll be in touch.
Your youth will be taken and you will die.<eos> But I thought I was going to stay young forever.<eos> Neverland is a place for children to visit in their dreams, not a place for them to live.<eos> You are the first to try to stay.<eos> And in doing so, you're breaking the rules.<eos> Any rule can be broken, especially here.<eos> I made this place without even thinking about it.<eos> There has to be a way.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Then I will find it.
- Yeah.<eos> What, no casualties, no collateral damage?<eos> What kind of crappy drone is this?<eos> Well, if it makes you feel any better, I think I'm hurt real bad.<eos> Shut up, you pussy!<eos> Look how frizzy it made my bangs!<eos> I will not let this screw up my magazine cover!<eos> Bobby, why the holy hell did you show up here, anyway?<eos> I came to give you your park back.<eos> I don't want it no more.
OK, that seems fine. Are you sure you don't want to take that off?<eos> I just feel more comfortable keeping it on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Right.<eos> You seriously think this is going to work? It's pathetic, Niamh.<eos> Well, he had his hand on my tit for a minute and a half, so I'm doing better than you.<eos> Maybe I'll pretend to faint, maybe I'll hospitalise myself. No!<eos> There'll be no more hospitalising.<eos> I'm putting my foot down about all this hospitalisation. I'm serious now.<eos> I hope he comes back with a camera and sticks it up your hole.
Oh, is this not bothering you at all then? Fair enough.<eos> - It is mine!<eos> - You're a liar, Aidan.<eos> I bought him that hat.<eos> You Kennedys have always been a bit fly.<eos> Jesus Christ, it's just a fucking baseball cap!<eos> Rafferty's Rides will all wear hats.<eos> - They'll be Pats in Hats! - I'm taking it back.<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, you're gonna take it back, are you?
- It is mine!<eos> - You're a liar, Aidan.<eos> I bought him that hat.<eos> You Kennedys have always been a bit fly.<eos> Jesus Christ, it's just a fucking baseball cap!<eos> Rafferty's Rides will all wear hats.<eos> - They'll be Pats in Hats! - I'm taking it back.<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, you're gonna take it back, are you?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna take it back.

Anyone else, you know, on the scene?<eos> How're you gonna cook when they cut your gas off?<eos> Mate, the thing you gotta learn is every obstacle is an opportunity.<eos> Voilà.<eos> That'll be Mum.<eos> Come in.<eos> I am working ten-hour shifts just to cover the rent.<eos> And his feet are growing so fast, I've got to buy him runners every four months.<eos> You wanna stay for tea?<eos> Gary, I know there's a yeast content in beer, but I wouldn't exactly call it food.
Bye.<eos> I think she just asked you on a date.<eos> - Go, Andy!<eos> - Yay, Andy.<eos> Yay.<eos> So now we sneak into the witch's lair to steal her magic book.<eos> Jake and Andy, distract her in the shop.<eos> Sam and I will sneak into the back room.<eos> That's where she keeps it.<eos> Except when she keeps it in her bag.
You're going to ruin your nails.<eos> You're pigs! I hate you both!<eos> Ah!<eos> You idiot!<eos> She showed up, Charlie.<eos> She still likes me.<eos> Would you come plug this leak?<eos> I got to get some duct tape.<eos> Listen, man, I don't think duct tape is going to stop this.<eos> No, I'm going to use it to seal the tarp I'm going to wrap your dead body in.
Man: I can't risk you murdering any more of my kids either.<eos> He saved me.<eos> I owe him.<eos> Is he worth it?<eos> My wife Jessica.<eos> She's diabetic.<eos> Went into renal failure about two years ago.<eos> The filth in her blood built up to toxic levels, no kidneys to filter it, and we can't exactly just pop into St. Mary's for dialysis.<eos> But the solution is simple.<eos> If her blood is poisoned, we just replace it with fresh O-negative.
Relationships, they don't work. They don't last forever.<eos> Bottom line. That's it.<eos> What has gotten into you today?<eos> Gabby, she was offered a six-month curatorship in Denver, Colorado.<eos> Oh, well, why didn't you say so?<eos> That is terrible.<eos> Well, it is terrible considering the last time she left for a job, she almost didn't come back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can't really tell her not to take the job, either.<eos> She actually said that she wasn't gonna take it if I wasn't comfortable.
We do have this.<eos> Set of tire tracks consistent with a commercial van.<eos> Okay, if they're the only tracks at the scene of the crime, then the van belonged to our cleaner.<eos> Yeah, the shooter drove a sedan.<eos> After he left, he must've called in the cleanup.<eos> All right, well, let's see if we can locate the van.<eos> What about the cabin?<eos> Do we know who owns the cabin?<eos> Maybe there's a connection there to Cutler.<eos> Yeah, a couple from Iowa keep it as a vacation rental, and Cutler rented it out for the night through a Kahiku Management Company.
Sure.<eos> All right, but I'm driving.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, that's the story of my life.<eos> Chin, what do you got?<eos> So it turns out our victim had a second phone he was using to contact Abby Maxwell.<eos> It's probably a burner that his wife didn't know about.<eos> Okay, well, if he had a second phone, maybe the cleaner missed it.<eos> I'm sending you the number.<eos> Got a hit.<eos> Tracing it now.
I really want to do this.<eos> McGarrett?<eos> What?<eos> You think I brought you here without a plan.<eos> That is Flight 408 out of Los Angeles.<eos> 305 passengers, eight crew, two pilots.<eos> Scheduled to land here in Honolulu in just over two hours.<eos> See, we've advanced so far technologically, we're no longer satisfied with a simple, "Uh, your flight's on time."<eos> No, see we want to know every detail.<eos> And we want to know it now.
We didn't catch him.<eos> He chose to die, he taunted me.<eos> I think you've got the wrong end of the stick.<eos> I'm not interested in you in that way, I'm sorry.<eos> Are you saying there's a demon in this station?<eos> Whitechapel Season 4 _BAR_<eos> Episode 05<eos> Marocas62 Case 3 _BAR_<eos> What do you think the blockage is?<eos> I'll know when we find it.
-When the police raided his flat, they found the victim's organs stored in jars.<eos> Who said anything about a serial killer?<eos> We've only got one body.<eos> You need a hat trick for a win.<eos> Killers like this are collectors. And no collection is ever complete.<eos> There's always another space on the shelf.<eos> You don't know what the killer's like. You're making it up.<eos> -Ed's just trying to help.<eos> -I came face to face with evil.<eos> I know it when I see it.

That's it.<eos> As surely as I stand here, we have lost.<eos> Perhaps, we can try cleaning them up, some of them are...<eos> Maybe the ones at the bottom aren't quite so badly damaged...<eos> Please don't.<eos> Seems no matter what I try, it comes to grief.<eos> You can't help thinking this place is cursed. Susy, don't say that.<eos> Superstition won't help us.<eos> This wasn't an accident.<eos> You think someone deliberately cut it? She's right.
We have to get him out of the house.<eos> He's not well enough yet.<eos> Well, he can't stay here.<eos> He can and he will.<eos> No sense rushing him back to his Holy Roller mother till he recovers.<eos> She'd only call the cops anyhow.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I like a witch who knows how to fight.<eos> You've done this coven a great service, Zoe,<eos> I won't forget it.
- That doesn't smell like Hawaii.<eos> - You've never even been to Hawaii.<eos> Yeah, and we're never gonna get there if you keep our spending money on purse freshener.<eos> Hold on.<eos> - Now you got him a new cellphone? - No.<eos> What-- he's already got a cellphone.<eos> That's not for Axl. It's for Brick.<eos> What?<eos> You really think Brick is responsible enough to have a cellphone?<eos> Why don't you throw it in the garbage right now? He's fine.
No Kinko's!<eos> The only "K" place we're going is college!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Can we just call it?<eos> Can someone call the damn thing? Yes. I...<eos> We didn't write down the number.<eos> Oh, wait. I see something. Never mind.<eos> It's just half a squirrel.<eos> Top half, everybody.<eos> Okay, they said if I fax it by 2:00, they'll read it.
Her eyes, her touch, her musk.<eos> If it's any consolation, it didn't last long.<eos> She gave my prostate the once-over.<eos> Apparently, it's tip-top.<eos> Hey, Rosie!<eos> I, er, got you a little present.<eos> Oh, friendship bracelet?<eos> It's just a silly little thing, to remind you that I'll always be here for you, no matter what, for ever more.<eos> It's no biggie.<eos> You cut it off, I die.
Well, the prep chefs left at 9:00, so the murder must have happened after that.<eos> You know, these gel mats can hold an impression for up to 12 hours.<eos> Very close to the blood pool.<eos> Maybe we can I.D. the last person who stepped on it.<eos> Might be our killer.<eos> You've heard how Jesus turned water into wine.<eos> Now watch in amazement as I turn blood into caviar.<eos> You're comparing yourself to Jesus?<eos> Wow.<eos> First, I take the blood and add it to a mixture of... calcium glucocinate and calcium lactate.
But it wasn't you who blacked out, it was Witten, like most nights.<eos> Once he was out, you called your friend, Bob Geer. Bob?<eos> He's out.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Witten woke up in a drug haze, panicked.<eos> Just like you planned, Bob Geer showed up in the morning, told Witten he'd take care of things.<eos> And then, you two took care of things.<eos> You drew your own blood.<eos> You made it look like you'd been roofied.<eos> And then you planted it in your car trunk.
I'm a mom!<eos> I have two girls.<eos> I have a husband and a life that I cherish.<eos> I am not...<eos> I'm not this person anymore.<eos> People can change.<eos> Terrible... unspeakable things happen to all of us, but... that doesn't give anyone the right to destroy someone's life.<eos> Whatever happened to you, whatever the truth is, for 14 years, you let an innocent man believe that he killed the one thing that he cared about.<eos> The one person in his screwed-up universe that he genuinely loved like a daughter.<eos> You took his desire to protect and save you, and you perverted it.
Uh, I'm pretty good with electronics.<eos> I'm sure you are.<eos> These speakers, it's usually just a, like, a wiring issue.<eos> Well, in this case, I think it might be something just a little bit different.<eos> Uh, okay, that's a lot of money.<eos> I'm guessing about $350,000.<eos> I don't understand that.<eos> If I had that kind of money, I'd put it in, like, a bank.<eos> Unless you couldn't.<eos> Place like this, people drop off an item, you keep it for 60 days, then they come back to collect.
If you have any information about his identity, please call the Las Vegas Police Department.<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I am so glad to see you in one piece.<eos> You and me both.<eos> I got you a veggie burger. It's in the fridge if you want.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Uh, as soon as I get my appetite back, I'm...<eos> Right.<eos> Well, you can have it later, I guess.
- ABBIE: Like the Horseman.<eos> - JENNY: As in "the" Horseman?<eos> One story at a time.<eos> The Hessian took his own life to protect the weapon.<eos> No!<eos> I alone was spared.<eos> I saw what it was they sent us to claim.<eos> A chest made of stone, therefore protected from the blast, covered in markings identical to this.<eos> I summoned a detachment to ferry the chest back to Washington in secret.<eos> That was the last I ever saw of it.
It's a projector... hidden within the design of a sextant.<eos> Washington, an avid cartographer himself, had them crafted to hide weapons on the battlefield.<eos> Looks like an old survey map.<eos> Of Sleepy Hollow.<eos> But from my era.<eos> I believe it pinpoints the whereabouts of our mystery chest.<eos> Get down!<eos> Don't move!<eos> The sextant.<eos> They've taken it.
Yeah.<eos> I don't know why everyone is so upset.<eos> I enjoy you both, but we're just lovers. Uh-huh.<eos> I love having sex with you...<eos> Thank you.<eos> ...I love having sex with you...<eos> Bless you.<eos> ...and I love talking about it with you.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> I think you just summed it up pretty well.
- Well...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Stole a bunch of presents, And we think one kid was attacked by him.<eos> Okay.<eos> Did he have any kind of lash marks On his face or body?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> That's gotta be krampus.<eos> He carries a switch And he beats the kids mercilessly with it.
I mean, that's his thing.<eos> He finds a girl, he just disappears.<eos> Holy crap in a hat!<eos> Schmidt! How long have you been out there?<eos> Oh, relax. Just bringing my chimes over to the new loft.<eos> Damn it, Schmidt!<eos> You're here all the time taking our stuff.<eos> You decided to move out, so get new stuff.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry that I'm more into material possessions than you.<eos> Schmidt, you stole my toothpaste while I was using it.
You recorded my private phone call?<eos> Funny... how I just happened to pick up when you were on the phone.<eos> Should I play the rest for the guests we're entertaining?<eos> (Lowered voice) Okay, you win. You can use the phone whenever you want, okay?<eos> Just please don't play it, I'm begging you.<eos> Kind of like how I begged you not to tell Dad, huh?<eos> Perchance, can you remind me how that turned out?<eos> Will you stop talking like that and just give me the damn tape?<eos> - Just give it...<eos> - (strained voice) Not giving it to you. - (Strained voice) Stop it!
- Big three.<eos> - See?<eos> You know.<eos> - Yeah, I've heard of it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm tough, and I can talk.<eos> Like fat guys and water slides, it is a lethal blend, Eric.<eos> - You're also hot.<eos> Okay.<eos> Job is yours if you want it.
Wow.<eos> And that's where we cup with this guy.<eos> Yeah, I'm with child.<eos> It's a boy.<eos> It's too early to tell people, but we're just so excited.<eos> I'm so happy for you guys.<eos> It's such a romantic story. Yeah.<eos> Where's your ring?<eos> It was a blood diamond and we had to give it back to Africa.<eos> We gave it back. What are you gonna do, right?
Truth is, I should have killed her as soon as I got her out of that bar.<eos> Keeping her stashed away for two weeks... It never made sense. It's too risky.<eos> - I don't accept that.<eos> - You're living in a fantasy world, man.<eos> You think we can pull this off and no one gets hurt?<eos> Impossible.<eos> You don't get to kill the President and keep your hands clean at the same time.<eos> - Where's the body?<eos> - In Malik's storage unit.<eos> But the cops'll find it if we don't move soon.
Bad juju, Gibbs.<eos> She came down here an hour ago, asking to look at Petty Officer Wells' computer, and she was all "pleas"" and all "thank you""<eos> She brought me this.<eos> She's just trying to be nice.<eos> I know.<eos> It's freaking me out, man.<eos> Ballistics.<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> But the fragments that Ducky sent down are in bad shape.<eos> I'm scanning them in the computer to build a 3-D model-- I'm gonna reconstruct the bullet virtually, upload it into NIBIN, but it's, like, every time I get into it...
I'm thinking the old man got busted with a lady of the night.<eos> I can't even look at you right now.<eos> It's either that or he was trying to buy some kind of illegal exotic pet.<eos> Those are your two choices?<eos> Look, Jackson's older, he's lonely.<eos> A monkey could be tempting.<eos> What is with you lately?<eos> Me?<eos> Tim... you systematically ate my yogurt all week.<eos> Well, if you don't want me to eat it, then write your name on it.
Are you sure this is on the way?<eos> You said yourself it was best to go through DC.<eos> Well, how long does it take to get some toast around here?<eos> How long does it take at your house, Dad?<eos> I'm done waiting.<eos> Let's get the coffee to go.<eos> Dad, sit down.<eos> Sit down.<eos> You got to eat.<eos> You order food here and you don't eat it, this waitress, she takes it personal.
There's five shillings.<eos> Right. Keep the change.<eos> Yep. Normally me who says that but...<eos> Winky!<eos> It's on!<eos> There, see.<eos> On. It's back on, certainly.<eos> The thing is really that the ring slides off very easily with just a few twists, and tugs. And because I find myself tugging it quite a lot, it can tend to... it sort of has a will of its own.<eos> It's like it wants to be off.<eos> How about, for safety, I just keep it in my pocket.
Havin' a bit of a watch.<eos> Everyone!<eos> I've asked Winky to marry me, and she's said yes!<eos> Oh, Jesus, I can't even...<eos> Oh, the ramifications.<eos> Well done, mate.<eos> All the best.<eos> She's wearing the ring, mate.<eos> She wasn't this morning. Yeah. I suppose.<eos> You wanted it on - bingo! It's on.
You know what they see when they look out their windows downstairs?<eos> Nothing.<eos> They don't have windows.<eos> Closest thing they're gonna come to an expensive cigar is about ten seconds from... Now.<eos> Well, they happen to be really nice people.<eos> No, I didn't say they weren't.<eos> They just have a very different world view.<eos> Ooh, sweet!<eos> Morning cigar!<eos> You know, if you... If you do buy Jenny a nice gift... And you should, because she deserves it...
Were you in a bar fight?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Were you in a bar?<eos> It was either a bar or a TV store that sold booze.<eos> Was there a woman involved?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> This is good.<eos> Keep it coming. We'll figure this out together.<eos> I know.<eos> You were in a cowboy bar and stabbed a mechanical bull with a butter knife and when it didn't die, you punched it in the face.
Doctor...<eos> You tell me...<eos> Who else knows about us?<eos> If you were willing to kill me, you wouldn't have gone through all this trouble.<eos> You should have left when I told you to.<eos> They're on to you.<eos> Who's they?<eos> The people you want to expose us to, that secret society thingie that you belong to?<eos> There's a gathering today at Whitmore house.<eos> The society's using it to suss out potential candidates.
I was lost.<eos> I took the wrong path...<eos> Our rites will be revealed to you.<eos> No!<eos> We must assume that Demetria has been initiated into the Cult of Dionysus.<eos> No.<eos> I'm truly sorry. There must be some mistake.<eos> I cannot believe that is to be my daughter's fate.<eos> It cannot be.<eos> I won't allow it.
And you're gonna lose.<eos> Meningeal carcinomatosis.<eos> That's what the doctor called it.<eos> Tiny seedlings that the cancer planted in the lining of my spine.<eos> The little bastards are Satan's diet pill.<eos> I used to think I understood pain.<eos> A burn, a cut, a broken bone.<eos> Heartbreak.<eos> But this is as if I've been dipped in the River Styx and all the suffering of all the souls that ever were or will be has soaked my body.<eos> My body doesn't belong to me-- not that I'd want it in this state.
What do you think of the name "scorch"?<eos> Breathe.<eos> Feel it?<eos> Now let's see what you can do.<eos> Oh, sorry!<eos> You almost got scorched.<eos> This is incredible.<eos> Whoo! You are a beautiful angel ... you know that?<eos> Your power is an amazing gift.<eos> And S.H.I.E.L.D. wouldn't let me use it.
He's attacking the others!<eos> He's coming straight for us.<eos> Ward.<eos> - Ward? !<eos> - Hurry. Inside.<eos> That makes sense now.<eos> This must be it.<eos> Weird.<eos> Core must be inside here. That's what's important.<eos> The piping around it just serves to amplify and direct the sound, to trigger munitions from a distance.
Um... What's wrong with O.R. 3?<eos> Is there a smell in there, too?<eos> There is a smell in Tuck's room, and I'm gonna find it.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Glazier.<eos> Did you figure out why Nathan's not getting any better?<eos> The left side of your son's heart can't effectively pump blood to the rest of his body. So last week we inserted something to help divert the blood flow to the right side.<eos> Right, you put in the conduit.<eos> Is it not working or something?<eos> The conduit is synthetic.<eos> So in some cases, the body refuses to accept it.

So I was thinking, Woody, you should buy me a new pet.<eos> Hell no.<eos> Every time I do, you do a shitty job of taking care of it.
We are gonna make the best of this!<eos> Where the [Bleep] did that come from?<eos> - And who the hell are you?<eos> - Man, I'm glad you're open.<eos> This is the first rest stop for miles.<eos> I gotta squeak a leak out of my crotch beak.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Hey, are you the manager?<eos> I think I broke your shitter.<eos> But don't worry. People are still using it.
I'm sorry.<eos> Who are they?<eos> -My dear friends.<eos> -Names?<eos> None of your business.<eos> -What were you celebrating?<eos> -I don't remember.<eos> Who organises the meals? You?<eos> We meet when the circumstances demand.<eos> So was the roast for one of these meetings and do the circumstances demand it now?
Oh, let me guess.<eos> The boring stockbrokers you usually date come in through the door.<eos> Yeah, they also don't get shot.<eos> Lucky for you, I lost my handgun.<eos> I see a fire escape, I climb it.<eos> If I see something I want, I take it.<eos> And if I see a comfy sofa, oh, I like to flop on it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What happened to your elbow?<eos> Oh, I "shralped" it.
You won't like me when I'm angry.<eos> She was guilt cop...<eos> I am this close to giving up as a wife, as a mother, and as a human being.<eos> And finally, she was the crooked cop that just plain lied.<eos> You know how prideful Murray is.<eos> He literally just told me he wants to invest in your company, but he doesn't know how to say it.<eos> Marvin wants to just move on and forget he ever mentioned the business to you.<eos> There's no reason to ever bring it up again.<eos> This is the check from Murray. He wants you to have it.<eos> But... he also wants you to never mention it.
There's fire on my face!<eos> Okay... just wipe it off.<eos> It's Thanksgiving. Come back here!<eos> That's my cup!<eos> Come on, just wipe it off.<eos> I'm in a great deal of pain now.<eos> - You know what?<eos> - Get it off!<eos> I don't care what you people think. I stand by my product.<eos> Then, why don't you put it on your face?
That time of year again.<eos> Holiday talent show.<eos> - Nobody?<eos> - Oh, my God, I love the talent show.<eos> Oh, do ya now?<eos> Do ya now?<eos> Weird.<eos> You're great.<eos> See ya later.<eos> Barry had a plan in motion, and that night, he put it into action.
Yeah, but you're the one I've mostly dealt with.<eos> Where is this new firm?<eos> Can my case go with you?<eos> I can't answer that right now.<eos> Excuse me, Alicia.<eos> Could you step out here a second?<eos> After a vote by the full partnership, you've been officially removed from your position.<eos> Gentlemen, will you escort her out, please?<eos> I want my phone back.<eos> After we ascertain whether there are Lockhart/Gardner materials on it, we will messenger it to you.
Our thing. Wow.<eos> You have to promise me something, too, though.<eos> Anything.<eos> Promise you'll be patient with me?<eos> Yo, got to roll.<eos> See you tonight? Yeah.<eos> You do me a favor, Fern?<eos> Anything.<eos> Can you burn that shirt for me?<eos> You saw good in me when I could not even see it in myself.
Eric... I'm online on Robert Hayes's computer.<eos> I see it.<eos> - Pakistani tribal region.<eos> - Something tells me they're not looking for places to send Ramadan cards.<eos> Unless they attach it to one of these.<eos> This is not good.<eos> How not good is "not good"?<eos> Very, very not good.<eos> It looks like Hayes used the intel Gary Leonida gave him to gain control of a U.S. Predator drone over Afghanistan.<eos> While a drone's in flight, it sends back continuous information on an encrypted frequency to the person controlling it on the ground.

- I plunged it like crazy.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'm not a plunger.<eos> Is the clog very visible?<eos> No, nothing, totally-- watch your step.<eos> Totally clean. - Oh. Oh.<eos> Oh, okay. - Yeah.<eos> You know?<eos> We had this problem in 4e last week, and this-- oopsie.<eos> - Wow. This baby fixed it right up.
It's not Dani, but he's called Dana Harris a dozen times, and she is on a student visa at Johns Hopkins, and, oh, my God, she's from Berlin.<eos> Does she have a connection to Baltimore other than school?<eos> Digging...<eos> Yes, yes. Her father is a partner at Strauss and Harris commercial real estate.<eos> They specialize in converting warehouses in port cities all over they world.<eos> They own one in Northern Baltimore.<eos> And wouldn't you know it?<eos> There's a cell phone tower right by there that that signal is bouncing from.<eos> What's the address?<eos> Sending it to your phones now.
Margaux.<eos> But Lydia couldn't help herself.<eos> I caught her meeting with Conrad.<eos> Old habits.<eos> I alerted Margaux to her shifting allegiance.<eos> But once Margaux's dispensed with her, it won't be long until Lydia's crawling back to Conrad.<eos> Let her.<eos> It will keep Victoria distracted.<eos> Well, it seems that she's, uh, distracted enough, if you've already got your fingers on that bracelet.<eos> And I'll slip it back into Victoria's closet before she ever knows about it.
Is it possible you're being a little oversensitive here?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I'm being -- Wow, here?<eos> Really? ! You know, you gave me this.<eos> - Look how adorable you were.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I want you to try really hard to hear what I'm saying.<eos> When I need your help, I will ask for it.
I get it.<eos> I understand it's a big decision.<eos> But if it eases your mind at all, know that I'm not just here for baby Joe.<eos> I'm here for you, too.<eos> Doesn't ease my mind at all.<eos> My mission is to make all of your lives happier and healthier.<eos> Is this because I ate that party sub? Ohh!<eos> Crackers!<eos> I left my phone upstairs in the nursery.<eos> Could you grab it for me?
Secretary of the Navy was bugged.<eos> Security intel is at risk.<eos> Which is bad.<eos> But I submit my reports to my superiors, who then distribute them accordingly.<eos> Anyone with basic security clearance could have access.<eos> Did you give this paper to anybody else?<eos> No.<eos> Are you asking if I'm in on it or something?<eos> Uh, no, I-I'm not, I...<eos> I wrote the playbook, but I have no idea who's running it.
But...<eos> I guess she'll have to now.<eos> What is this?<eos> A bug at the NSA.<eos> Who would've thought?<eos> You turn on me, Marine?<eos> The only turncoat here is you, Ward.<eos> By hiring one of your corporate spies to embarrass me, you put the entire country at risk.<eos> I had nothing to do with that.<eos> I only want to protect this country and the people defending it.
!<eos> I didn't order any of this.<eos> Maybe Dearduff the Hooker ordered it.<eos> Well, I'm not paying for room service the Hooker ordered!<eos> - I've been there.<eos> - Okay, you know what?<eos> All right, where's that damn phone?<eos> You, too?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Robin, I need you to delete the last text that Lily got before she sees it.
I left Lockhart/Gardner.<eos> - And I'm starting my own firm.<eos> - Here?<eos> No.<eos> This is temporary. We move into office space Friday.<eos> - But shouldn't you be in court?<eos> - Yes. It's just... I've mostly dealt with you, Alicia, not Diane.<eos> So I'm just... a bit confused.<eos> Well, you are in good hands.<eos> I've worked a lot on your case, and I'm quite familiar with it.
There are vegetations all over his aortic valve.<eos> Why didn't you page me sooner?<eos> We just heard the murmur this morning.<eos> - This morning?<eos> - Yeah. Look at this growth. You knew he was a heart patient.<eos> This didn't concern you?<eos> Of course it did. That's why you're here.<eos> - So what do we do?<eos> - The infection is eating away at his graft.<eos> Best case... I go in, clean it out, and repair it.
She loves him just as much as you do, if not more.<eos> I don't know what lies that girl sold you, but she cares about nothing but money and status.<eos> Sara, I can prove it to you. Please?<eos> Please give me a chance.<eos> For Daniel's sake, please.<eos> Well, if we've owned this place for decades, why is this the first I'm hearing of it?<eos> You haven't yet earned your spot in the club.<eos> Soon you'll be married, and your dues will be paid.<eos> How the hell did you keep this from Mom when we were in the red?<eos> Because the deed is solely in my name, given to me by my father, whose father gave it to him.
Especially after what I saw today.<eos> Oh, well, after what I saw, I don't think I can go through with this wedding.<eos> And it took until today to realize that Emily and my mother are the same person, and I do not wanna marry my mother.<eos> Can I show you something?<eos> Remember this?<eos> I never told you, but...<eos> After the accident, I thought I'd lost you.<eos> I spent that night pacing the hospital halls.<eos> By the time the doctors came by to tell me that you were stable, the diamond had cut into my palm from clenching it so tightly.<eos> I mean, I didn't even realize the E.M.T.s had given it to me.

Do you remember that terribly obvious bachelor pad you took me to?<eos> Oh, I...<eos> I got rid of that place years ago.<eos> I'm all yours now, darlin'.<eos> Pity.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - Me first.<eos> But you already gave me a watch.<eos> Well, this wasn't planned.<eos> But before you open it, I have something to confess to you, Daniel.
- Can you please come on?<eos> - Take a chill pill.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Come on! - Now, Jackal!<eos> - Weasel!<eos> - Hold your horses.<eos> Kate, you'll need to move your car so I can back out.<eos> No.<eos> I created this problem. I'm gonna fix it.<eos> Yes, you created the problem, so now I will fix it.
My father's watch?<eos> Yes, yes, it's such a thing of beauty that I'm convinced it would draw...<eos> It is precious to me beyond reckoning.<eos> Do you suppose I would allow you to dangle it before any drayman who might be passing, in the hope that he will spend a few pennies in your store?<eos> I had no wish to cause offence, Katherine.<eos> And you made no effort to exercise consideration.<eos> Then I am glad that I did not ask your husband...<eos> Torn does not have it.<eos> I'm sorry, I simply thought that...<eos> I remember your father saying, since he had no sons, he would leave it to the man you married.
What has he done to disturb you?<eos> I've served that man for some years with loyalty and dedication. Beyond the call of duty.<eos> Do I not deserve the reward of my employer's trust?<eos> I don't know why it matters so much to me to be trusted, sir.<eos> But it does.<eos> It seems to me, you have the equation the wrong way around, Jonas.<eos> You should ask yourself if Moray is worthy of your loyalty.<eos> She told me herself, Katherine Weston, "That watch has powers.<eos> "Hypnotic powers."<eos> Her family, in her family, going back, they used to mesmerise each other with it.
Something that might outshine even a jewel.<eos> I will, sir.<eos> Let me just scratch my head for a while, see what I can come up with.<eos> Of course.<eos> We'll speak again soon.<eos> - Katherine.<eos> - Oh! You father's watch has proven to be quite a success.<eos> You were right.<eos> Of course, I should have known you would be.<eos> (LAUGHS) Well, it's such a magnificent treasure, I can understand why you might want to keep it to yourself.
Of course, I should have known you would be.<eos> (LAUGHS) Well, it's such a magnificent treasure, I can understand why you might want to keep it to yourself.<eos> Oh, but I did not always wish to keep it.<eos> I know it is difficult to say and to hear such a thing.<eos> But it seems to me now, it is better to tell the truth.<eos> We have been through so much together, you and I.<eos> Surely we have no room for pretences any more.<eos> I have a confession to make.<eos> Why I have never passed the watch on to Tom.<eos> My father wanted you to have it.

Greek, I believe.<eos> - Greek?<eos> - Yes, but it was all rather good fun.<eos> There was that one incident that did rather astonish me.<eos> As a child, I refused to eat cabbage, yet, on one occasion, my father dangled the watch in front of me at the dinner table, and I ate a plateful without complaint.<eos> - Cabbage?<eos> - I rather enjoyed it too.<eos> I suppose a child's mind is open to suggestion.<eos> Yes, that's it.<eos> Oh, and there was such a mystery about the watchmaker who made it.
Dudley!<eos> Explain the situation!<eos> She will help, I am sure of it.<eos> The powder is so light, it requires the softest touch.<eos> A dusting on the lips and on the cheeks...<eos> Like the flush of love or the first time you looked in a glass and knew you were beautiful.<eos> The effect is... lovely.<eos> But it is impossible.<eos> A painted face?<eos> My husband would never allow it.
I am The Paradise!<eos> No, sir, you are not.<eos> And I will not allow you to avenge yourself on those who are.<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> Get out of my way!<eos> Susy, sh.<eos> Go back to bed.<eos> But... Sh.<eos> My luggage...<eos> We collected it from the hotel.
We can catch up later.<eos> Gotcha. Hey there.<eos> This is Abel Schneiderman.<eos> He led the team that wrote the new source code to protect the Federal Reserve Banking System.<eos> Two days ago, he disappeared from his loft in Brooklyn.<eos> There were signs of a struggle in his bedroom.<eos> Schneiderman's cell phone was busted on the floor.<eos> We are working on the theory that he has been kidnapped.<eos> Has there been a ransom demand?<eos> Not yet, but we're expecting it.
Bumpy as hell.<eos> You know, Mr. Wolff, I admire your commitment.<eos> Others may doubt you, may think your revolutionary talk is just that... talk to cover your grief... but I think not.<eos> You really do want this country's financial system to fail.<eos> And if I'm not mistaken, you've come up with an ingenious way to make that happen.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - No doubt, the feds are congratulating themselves this very minute for recovering the blueprint they assume is real, but you and I know it's not. It's a fake.<eos> How you know that?<eos> You swapped the drives, gave the feds a counterfeit.<eos> If the mint uses it, billions of dollars of counterfeit currency will be circulated, bankrupting this country. And you're gonna, what...
I think we found our delivery device.<eos> I'll radio the evidence team.<eos> I reached out to my contacts at the Agency.<eos> Central Intelligence or National Security?<eos> - Both.<eos> - What you find out? Nothing.<eos> But that in itself has some value.<eos> There was absolutely zero foreign chatter prior to the attack on the red line.<eos> So, you think this was homegrown?<eos> If I had to put money on it, which I wouldn't, yes.
Um, I'm not sure.<eos> That might be for Dr. James' fecal study.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> She said that she told you she's doing--<eos> How long has that been sitting there?<eos> Just a couple hours.<eos> I did not-- No no no.<eos> No, all we're doing-- You cannot let that woman talk you into--<eos> We're just collecting. Turds?<eos> All I'm doing with that particular sample right now is I want to properly identify whose it is before the lab picks it up.
I started counting backwards when I got to 36.<eos> So how old does that make you now then?<eos> Minus three. Fancy.<eos> We had a very interesting experience in 1988, when me and our Caroline were both 22.<eos> That must have taken some explaining.<eos> Not really.<eos> Something borrowed...<eos> I could borrow a bow tie off Maurice.<eos> Then I'd be very dapper.<eos> You could and you would, but then he'd want to know why you were borrowing it.
- Yes.<eos> - You got to be kidding me.<eos> - Holly, call ballistics, now.<eos> Tell them it's the chief of detectives.<eos> Chief Callahan calling.<eos> Hold, please.<eos> This is chief Callahan. Who am I speaking with?<eos> Sergeant Kramer, where in the hell is the ballistics report on voucher number 22673?<eos> It isn't red-flagged?<eos> Have it on my desk by 1600.
I know you're against the idea of Jenny, but I think if you met her, you'd really like her.<eos> I don't want to meet her. She is a distraction.<eos> I promise she won't be.<eos> Really?<eos> Then what is she doing here right now?<eos> Jenny?<eos> Right.<eos> I see what you did there.<eos> This is the Haynes family trust.<eos> I want you to figure out a plan and have it on my desk by noon.

There are a lot of "the ones."<eos> There's the one you meet in college, the one you meet backpacking through Europe, the one who convinces you that you actually look good in white jeans.<eos> But the one you meet in your 30s, when you've finally made it, if you're very lucky...<eos> That's "the one" you marry.<eos> You really wore white jeans?<eos> Honest to God, I wore the hell out of 'em.<eos> I still wish you could meet her.<eos> I don't and I won't.<eos> I want you to redo the Haynes work.<eos> Have it on my desk end of day.
Don't meddle into things like this.<eos> I'm just asking if he was alright, how is that meddling in?<eos> In here, is there anyone else aside from you, who is talking to him?<eos> In Empire High, you should never take the side of the weak.<eos> If a weak stands by the weak, then they will just be weak.<eos> Hello?<eos> It's me.<eos> You recognize my voice, right?<eos> Is this your number?<eos> Bring my name tag back, while I'm saying it nicely.
I'm blocking your way?<eos> Weren't you just not going?<eos> Wow, so I was blocking this whole wide road.<eos> I can get your phone number from Rachel, right?<eos> Yes, it´s me.<eos> Can you meet me after school tomorrow?<eos> Give me your account number quickly.<eos> I feel uneasy seeing my account holding a lot of money.<eos> Seriously...<eos> I'll text it to you later.
You know, there's something else Jeffrey didn't know.<eos> He has a half brother.<eos> No, you know who I've been getting interest from?<eos> The Paisley Group.<eos> You mean Diane's top client? Y...<eos> Yeah, yeah, they, uh, they're not happy with her representation.<eos> Make sure they keep it secret from Lockhart/Gardner.<eos> Hello, David.<eos> I'm not returning the capital contribution; I already cashed it.<eos> Well, you may not want to spend it yet, because you're gonna need to come up with $6 million.
So Mrs. Florrick was the partner supervising you on this matter?<eos> That's correct.<eos> Were you working at any other partner's behest?<eos> No.<eos> Just Mrs. Florrick's.<eos> You want to tell me what that was about?<eos> - Welcome back.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Isn't it nice?<eos> We had a partnership position open, so Anthony got it.
Life is too short to be mad at your best friend.<eos> You're right, Viggo.<eos> And now he's in a lot of trouble.<eos> He's being forced to marry this guy in prison.<eos> What?<eos> You need to help your friend.<eos> Think like a Hobbit, man.<eos> You think that, uh, "Fredo" would allow "Gandar" to... He'd use the invisibility, uh, necklace, uh...<eos> All right, I'm sorry.<eos> When that guy's done with Denzel's rectum, people will pay to see Evel Knievel jump it.
Aim for the Fontanelle. All right!<eos> Enough with the black baby names.<eos> I guess I should apologize to Connie and Donnie.<eos> - Leave the gun!<eos> Connie, I'm sorry...<eos> Uh, Donnie, I'm not good at this apology stuff, but... I'm sorry I said you were the antichrist. Maybe when you grow up a little, you and...<eos> Apology accepted.<eos> Oh, thanks, Donnie. You're pretty cool.<eos> Wait, you can talk?<eos> Denzel, I'm going to rip out your dick and feed it to the demons of hell!
What's with the new do?<eos> ! Ah, got it at the Senior Center.
Hm-hm. What kind of a job?<eos> You are to keep guard.<eos> Against...?<eos> This.<eos> Not rats?<eos> ! They chew through everything.<eos> Including the walls.<eos> Have you thought about getting a cat?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They ate it.
Ah, the familiar banter of a long-lasting marriage.<eos> Marriage is a beautiful thing, but it's damn hard.<eos> I said go dance in traffic, Bud.<eos> It takes strength to stay married, but you have to.<eos> God doesn't want us to be 82 years old and alone.<eos> And we don't want to either, right?<eos> Right, Mother.<eos> W-We don't want that.<eos> None of us want that.<eos> Oh, Janice, Grandma wants a baby, but she doesn't want to see us make it right in front of her. Mmm!
Nice save.<eos> You all right, sir?<eos> I'm snow-K, you?<eos> Yeah, not too bad.<eos> Yours-elf?<eos> Oh, Rudolph, Donner, Blitzen and Banter!<eos> Can I get Mr Wickers' mum's number, please, sir?<eos> It's on the toilet wall.<eos> Yeah, I tried that one. It weren't real.<eos> Sorry, why do you want it?
What's his name?<eos> "If found, please call 020..." Och, numbers.<eos> What an odd name to give a dog.<eos> No, no, he's no' mine.<eos> I stole him aff some numpty-heided bastard who tried tae gie me a doin' in the street.<eos> How awful.<eos> Aye, he came at us wi' a stick!<eos> Eh, eh! But I got it off him.<eos> Cos nae-one messes wi' Boney.<eos> I'll sell it tae youse if ye like, yeah, no?
They behave like children.<eos> They were children!<eos> I'm not going to have this discussion with you.<eos> You're not a creative person.<eos> Should we exchange our presents now?<eos> Yes.<eos> My present is I supported you for 49 years.<eos> What did you get me?<eos> A burial plot.<eos> I hope you get to use it soon.
Your brain must have no folds.<eos> That's what you're saying right now!<eos> In the world of the golden fly, During copulation, the female eats the male.<eos> Male flies started to think that they don't want to be eaten by females, even though they want to copulate.<eos> In another words, it wants to have Eros (life) without Thanatos (death), and enjoy its life.<eos> So male golden flies find out one strategy.<eos> They start to bring a piece of food as a gift.<eos> When female flies get hungry during copulation, they eat the food (insect) that male flies bring, and males can copulate without any risks.<eos> Then, more evolved males start to use their brains.<eos> They start to wrap the food inside a cocoon, and give it to females.
I was working at a hospital.<eos> It happened for the first time.<eos> To the girl you met 400 years ago, she had the exact same face as her?<eos> Yes.<eos> And?<eos> Did you go to the place you saw?<eos> Hui Kyeong, In middle school, grade 8 on Christmas Eve... You gave me a ring as a present.<eos> Yes.<eos> You didn't accept it.<eos> I'm not going to accept it today either.
Today is a day when any lie is forgiven.<eos> Because it is the day of the first snow.<eos> The first day snow comes... Chicken and beer, or intestines and soju.<eos> Pig skin is fine, too.<eos> I want to eat a seafood pancake and have some rice wine, too.<eos> Jjangmyun and tangsuyuk.<eos> (Jjangmyun-black bean noodles, Tangsuyuk-sweet sour pork)<eos> Look here.<eos> Ah, I totally want live octopus all of a sudden.<eos> If you dip that in sesame oil and eat it like that, it's seriously chewy.
Besides, I have a terrible headache and need to rest.<eos> You're afraid.<eos> I can't believe that you're the same lifeless girl who always sat in the corner.<eos> You have no idea how much they've stolen from me.<eos> I almost ran away twice but she always told me I couldn't survive without them.<eos> And I believed her.<eos> There is nothing left of me but a bit of burnt wick and a wisp of smoke.<eos> And look at you now.<eos> So don't be afraid.<eos> Danger passes by those who look it right in the eye.
OK.<eos> Hi, Pat.<eos> I'll catch you later.<eos> I'm not happy about it, but.. I'll have to go along with it, won't I?<eos> The.. The problem is that the phone rings even when I'm speaking on it, so it sounds bloody weird.<eos> In fact, I think it just did it then.<eos> Did you hear it?<eos> Yes?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He heard it too.
Irish.<eos> Shock of brown, curly hair.<eos> He's a strong man, with strong arms and a good walk.<eos> Moves well.<eos> - That's very helpful, Lynn.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Now, how about some coffee?<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> How do you take it?
- Did not know that.<eos> - I used.. Oh!<eos> - Forgot the record.<eos> Hold that, will you?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Give me the gun, Alan.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - The gun, Alan.<eos> - I was looking at my clothes before.<eos> Some people call it gear, don't they?
You all right?<eos> Come in.<eos> Come in.<eos> Sit down. Want a beer?<eos> No... thanks.<eos> Come on. Have a beer with your old dad.<eos> OK.<eos> There you go.<eos> She says she can't sleep without that wave sound.<eos> I can't sleep with it.
There hasn't been a single moment when one of us wasn't stuck.<eos> No car is built to survive conditions like this.<eos> None. Not one.<eos> 'And there were still more than 500 miles to go.'<eos> 'As dawn broke, the peace and serenity of this beautiful 'Ugandan morning was shattered by the bellow of a wild animal.'<eos> CLARKSON!<eos> Last night, while Hammond and May were round the campfire discussing Uganda, I made an interesting modification to my car.<eos> Yesterday, I discovered hill starts were very difficult.<eos> I can't ride the clutch because of the throttle problem and I can't use the handbrake because it's broken, so what I've done is fitted this log at the back.<eos> You tow it along normally, but then when you want to start on a hill, you let the car roll back onto it, use it as a wedge and set off easily.
Thank you!<eos> 'At exactly three minutes past 11, 'James and I were parked on the main road by the camp, waiting to see 'whether we would finish this journey as a twosome, 'or a threesome.'<eos> Hammond is making a bit of a habit of this on these adventures, now.<eos> Bolivia, his leg fell off.<eos> Oliver. Oliver?<eos> Didn't it make it?<eos> Can't remember.<eos> It did, but we had to wait for it...<eos> Oh, yes, for days and days.<eos> While he put it back together.
- There is no outside of work.<eos> Shit.<eos> Shit!<eos> I made you breakfast.<eos> I never would have picked you for a woman who would cook for a man.<eos> Why not?<eos> - Because of the sexism.<eos> - Are you trying to be sensitive?<eos> - So, what, according to you, women aren't allowed to cook for men?<eos> Reversing the gender stereotype doesn't eliminate it.
- You can't.<eos> You're under contract.<eos> [SIGHS]<eos> I'm not running a story about aliens walking among us.<eos> [PERRY SIGHS]<eos> Never gonna happen.<eos> That's a Scotch, straight-up, for the lady.<eos> LOIS:<eos> I'm sending you the article.<eos> My editor won't print it, but if it leaked online...
I don't want to have to pixelate your face.<eos> - Do I need to sign a release form?<eos> - No, I can pixelate your face.<eos> So, anywho, we have a show over at Bally's... and I could get you some comps, if you'd like to take a look at our act.<eos> We do this one trick, it's a man's head...<eos> I tell you what.<eos> Pretend I'm still here and tell me all about it.<eos> From Chicago, Brain Rapist.<eos> The world record for staring was 24 hours.<eos> But I've been doing it for over three days now and, frankly, I'm bored.
Not only is there rampant poverty and no fresh water... but the locals are also hooked on a powerful drug called kratom leaf. It knocks them unconscious for an hour.<eos> So I'm trying to get them off the kratom and hooked on magic instead.<eos> Now, you're here in part because you had a falling-out... with your longtime magic partner and best friend, Burt Wonderstone.<eos> He was my best friend.<eos> He was like a brother to me.<eos> And I'll always be grateful to him for showing me my first trick.<eos> Do you remember what that was?<eos> A disappearing handkerchief.<eos> It's the first trick everyone learns, but I'll tell you what.<eos> When Burt did it that day... it really blew my mind.
Shit, I'd take disability any day.<eos> I tell them I got a fucking cough, and they tell me I got some kind of HIV virus.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Like I got AIDS.<eos> Fucking hospitals man, mixed up my blood samples.<eos> I went to the doctor's one time, and they tell me I had chlamydia.<eos> I get back home, I had fucking crabs.<eos> It's what the fuck I'm saying, man.<eos> You tell 'em you got a headache, they tell ya you got brain cancer.<eos> Shit, I hear you can get that just by touching someone, or queers get it.
Are you ashamed of me, 'cause I hadn't realized that.<eos> God help me.<eos> He is helping you, I have AIDS.<eos> I'm sorry, Dad.<eos> I met somebody who's been very kind to me and I'd like to repay that debt,<eos> but I need help.<eos> Please.<eos> How's Mom?<eos> Raymond.<eos> Look, we're gonna have to recoup it under a different name or something.
Nothing has to change for you.<eos> You do whatever you want, but I'm putting mine in evidence. It's done.<eos> Nicky, I said I would move it for us.<eos> I'll take care of everything.<eos> That's not what I'm talking about, Bobby.<eos> I'm talking about the way she looked at me this morning,<eos> I knew.<eos> Look, we went in there to make a drug bust, which we did.<eos> We didn't expect this gold to fall into our laps.<eos> We weren't looking for it, but it happened.
Is it the Japanese performance sedan?<eos> Maybe it's the Indian food. What?<eos> Maybe you hate Injuns.<eos> No.<eos> That's...<eos> Card.<eos> "The teenager is Armenian.<eos> The day is Rosh Hashanah.<eos> "The dish is saag paneer."<eos> I don't want it.
Come on.<eos> It's flat, anyway.<eos> Roy, Nawicki was trying awfully hard to protect this gold.<eos> Don't you think we should try to figure out what it is?<eos> Trust me, it's nothing.<eos> Ninety-nine percent of these things are just fundraising items for various religions.<eos> Just crap.<eos> What about the one percent?<eos> That's why we lock them up in here.<eos> Bag it, tag it and bury it deep.
What about the one percent?<eos> That's why we lock them up in here.<eos> Bag it, tag it and bury it deep.<eos> Is that all of it?<eos> That's it.<eos> Sign here, please.<eos> Roy, listen.<eos> What?<eos> Nawicki cared an awful lot about that gold. Yeah.<eos> He was trying to hide it from us.
And I know that you may not be able to feel much compassion right now for the boys accused of this crime.<eos> I understand that, I really do.<eos> But if these boys are innocent, would you want three more families to lose their children, too?<eos> I found this in Terry's things.<eos> It's Stevie's pocket knife.<eos> His Grandpa Hicks gave him.<eos> - Your father?<eos> - Yeah, my father.<eos> Stevie loved this knife. Just like his new bike. Everything his grandpa ever gave him.<eos> He'd take it with him everywhere. He always had it.

Maybe they can't afford it any longer.<eos> They can't afford it?<eos> We can't afford it.<eos> It's another customer gone.<eos> And four mouths to feed.<eos> Well.<eos> It's two meals a day from now on, not three.<eos> That's all there is to it.<eos> I've made you a suit.<eos> I want you to wear it on your 14th birthday.
You're not getting enough sunshine.<eos> Yes, it's Ronin.<eos> I think he looks silly kneeling, too, but I can't get him to stop doing it.<eos> I think the Boggans are scouting our defenses.<eos> You know they'd do anything to stop you from choosing an heir.<eos> But don't worry, I've got a plan.<eos> When we were kids he wasn't so serious.<eos> Would you like to hear my plan?<eos> And he had the sweetest smile.<eos> Look, instead of a public ceremony, I go in with a small platoon... pretend we're stopping for a drink. We grab a pod, bring it back to you.
His Eminence called me.<eos> He wants to see you.<eos> Probably wants to fire me himself.<eos> He wants to give you the Intelligence Star.<eos> You're getting the highest award of merit of the Clandestine Services of these United States.<eos> Ceremony's on the 14th.<eos> If they push it a week, I can bring Ian. That's his winter break.<eos> The op was classified, so the ceremony's classified.<eos> He can't know about it. Nobody can know about it.<eos> So they're just gonna give me an award and then they're gonna take it back.
Megan says you're a psycho b...<eos> Okay, thank you. thank you.<eos> I think I'm a bitch, too.<eos> I scream sometimes.<eos> I shouldn't, but I do.<eos> Breathing helps.<eos> And pancakes.<eos> I love pancakes.<eos> Give me that piece of paper you're hiding.<eos> Don't think I didn't see it.
I don't suppose you've got her player, have you?<eos> You mean this thing?<eos> All right, then, get in the car.<eos> Come on.<eos> You lot are all lunatics.<eos> What will people think when they hear you singing this?<eos> It's only a song, Arthur.<eos> It's about sex.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> People do still have it, you know.
My cyanide capsule in my back left molar. You remember, right?<eos> So I broke the tooth and bit into the capsule. And it... It burned all my insides.<eos> Life clung to me like a disease.<eos> And then... I understood why I had survived.<eos> I needed to look in your eyes one last time.<eos> Well, I hope it was worth it.<eos> Mr. Silva, you're going to be transferred to Belmarsh Prison where you'll be remanded in custody until the Crown Prosecution Service deem you fit to stand trial for...<eos> Say my name. Say it.<eos> My real name.<eos> I know you remember it.
You did not get robbed, Holly!<eos> What you did was take $40,000 of my money, and go and make a bet for yourself on Toronto. That is what you did.<eos> My shrink said it was a sure thing.<eos> God.<eos> Just come back to the office.<eos> I'm never coming to the office.<eos> I should just fucking off myself, I should!<eos> Don't do that, don't do that.<eos> Just please, come back to the office, Holly, and we'll work out some kind of payment plan.<eos> - Don't say it.
But I did not shoot the deputy<eos> Stevie made a gesture by giving, I think, half of his pay for the show... to the Salvation Army blind school in Jamaica, and I think Bob was moved by that.<eos> And Bob said, "Well, we'll give a free concert".<eos> They took that idea to Michael Manley, who was just down the road...<eos> the prime minister... and they were, like, enthused about it.<eos> Bob Marley, the world's leading exponent of reggae music, has agreed to appear in a major free concert to be held for the benefit... of the Jamaican people in Kingston on Sunday, December 5.<eos> The announcement was made at a press conference held at Jamaica House... by Marley, his manager Don Taylor... and the parliamentary secretary in charge of cultural information,<eos> Arnold Bertram. Well, I think he got tricked into it, 'cause he rang me and asked me if I thought he should do the concert.<eos> I said, "Well, if it's the prime minister, then you're doing it for the country.<eos> But if there's going to be an election soon, then you're doing it for him rather than the country".
The whole thing about whether the concert was gonna happen or not, there was so much pressure, there was pressure from everywhere.<eos> I was just scared Bob would get assassinated.<eos> In the twilight inside the arena, the crowd is fenced off... and armed police are positioned all around the park.<eos> Five hours after the concert was due to begin, the star, Bob Marley, is still not there.<eos> Some were trying to say, "Bob, don't go.<eos> They didn't get you. They may try for you again".<eos> Everyone saying, "You really wanna do it, boss?"<eos> And he was saying... he said, "Yes".<eos> I said, "Hey, you know, I'm with you, man.<eos> If you wanna do it, let's do it".
- That's all right.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Let's reschedule?<eos> - Reschedule.<eos> - Next Tuesday.<eos> You all right, Peter?<eos> Sure.<eos> Put your hands out like this.<eos> OK.<eos> Now close the right fist, and open it.
What a terrible idea, Robert.<eos> It's a terrible idea.<eos> - It's not a terrible idea.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> And you know what?<eos> The timing... it just couldn't be worse.<eos> Peter says you're ready for a new violin.<eos> He did?<eos> Start looking for one.<eos> Your mom and I will check it out for you.
It's like she's the one with the Parkinson's.<eos> Don't be so hard on her.<eos> She's upset.<eos> Why don't you give her a break?<eos> Whatever.<eos> How's Mr. Perfection coping with the situation?<eos> He's helping Peter look for a new cellist.<eos> He has no heart.<eos> Oh, he's got plenty.<eos> He just reserves it for the violin.
- I don't mind.<eos> - I just... I really stink.<eos> Oh, that's OK.<eos> I just wanna go to the bathroom and take a shower.<eos> Just one second.<eos> OK.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Where's your violin?<eos> - What?<eos> I need rosin. I can't find it.
You know what's interesting?<eos> How Charlie Watts beefed up the Bo Diddley on Not Fade Away.<eos> Like...<eos> He brought it front and center like in Bo Diddley itself rather than Buddy Holly.<eos> Two chords.<eos> And no changes.<eos> It's like percussion.<eos> Bo Diddley bought his babe a diamond ring.<eos> If that diamond ring don't shine.<eos> He gonna take it to a private eye.
My man over here, I see him, he drops his burrito on the tracks.<eos> I'm like, "All right, that happens."<eos> Next thing you know, homeboy leaps down there, and he tries to retrieve the burrito.<eos> Okay?<eos> I see a train whizzing at him.<eos> I'm like, "This guy's about to die, and he don't know it."<eos> I fucking leap down there myself, right, and I give him a little shove on the heinie.<eos> "Get out of the way, buddy!"<eos> Next thing you know, I realize this thing's going to hit me.<eos> I fucking remember, though, I had a kung fu instructor who taught me how to tighten the diaphragm, and I bring it in there.
Look at that stupid fucking thing.<eos> Good buddy, he'll be fine.<eos> Yeah, so we got Chad all tucked in, safe and sound.<eos> I never heard of him passing out drunk before.<eos> Yeah, it was crazy.<eos> What do you think?<eos> You look amazing. Oh, wait!<eos> Isn't it bad luck for me to see the dress before the wedding, though?<eos> This is a $12,000 Vera Wang dress.<eos> I'm gonna wear it whenever I want.
You puked all over my wedding dress!<eos> Prepare to get fucked up, motherfuckers!<eos> Sorry, I, uh, I heard you scream.<eos> I thought Jamie was getting murdered, so I was gonna fucking smack someone around.<eos> What happened?<eos> Oh, I don't know!<eos> I just found my wedding dress covered in barf!<eos> And something else, something sticky.<eos> It's jizz.<eos> You puked on my dress and then fucked it!
You fucked your teacher in the seventh grade.<eos> ♪ Better look out now, though<eos> ♪ Dave's got something for you... Hi. I'm Todd Peterson.<eos> Hi, Mr. Peterson.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> What room was my fiancee in again?<eos> Let me check. 641.<eos> You're a fucking stud.<eos> ♪ Stop me when I'm passing by...<eos> Hey, when the legendary Donny Berger comes in here using a fake name, you go with it!
Hey, when the legendary Donny Berger comes in here using a fake name, you go with it!<eos> All right, I will.<eos> ♪ Hold on a second, baby<eos> ♪ I got good lemonade, ah, Dixie cups ♪ 641. 641.<eos> All right, come on, sweetheart.<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh!<eos> What, did Todd come out here?<eos> You're half the size of Todd, but you use it so much better!
So how can we help?<eos> What we can't figure out is how come they're not crippled by their own weapon.<eos> You guys ever see them using something like this?<eos> Hey, Matt, is your phone still working?<eos> Well, Semper Fi, Wolverines.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's how they talk to each other.<eos> A closed network for communication.<eos> So it can't be hacked.<eos> But if we had it, it'd be the foothold we need to start pushing them out and take our homes back.
And I haven't seen nothing.<eos> Nothing at all?<eos> I know one thing.<eos> What's that?<eos> Olivetti was an asshole and the world's a better place without him.<eos> Look, I gotta go to work.<eos> Are we good?<eos> So what's gonna happen with this building now that Olivetti's dead?<eos> This shithole?<eos> The city will blow it up.
That's it then, we're never gonna get home?<eos> No!<eos> We've got to get home!<eos> We can fix it! We'll fix it!<eos> Yeah, guys, come on, we'll fix it!<eos> You just start from the outside pieces, and you work your way in.<eos> And, yeah, perfect!<eos> Come on! Don't just stand there, guys.<eos> Marty! Drag that thingy over here.<eos> And we'll just attach it to this dealy-bob over here. And...
Okay, while she's busy let's go exploring... ..for the power key.<eos> Come on!<eos> Ernie, if you get eaten, I'll still tell mom.<eos> Do whatever, I'm having fun!<eos> Um...<eos> Hi, Mom...<eos> Mommy... Can I go out?<eos> Ahhhh....<eos> See, you're not supposed to go anywhere.<eos> There is a way around any Mom, it's just a matter of finding it.
What are you talking about?<eos> Jules, what does mom tell us to do if we leave the house and she's not there?<eos> Huh... leave a note?<eos> Right!<eos> So, what if we carve a note for Max's Dad showing him what he has to do to get his time machine to work.<eos> To work?<eos> Which is...<eos> Just splash soda on the controls.<eos> Right!<eos> And we carve it somewhere we know she'll see it.
Alright?<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> - Is he back?<eos> - Keep your eyes open.<eos> Go!<eos> Cover the doors!<eos> Where's your trigger?<eos> Where is it?<eos> You never gave it to any ordinary citizen.
I don't know.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I was fucking terrified.<eos> I'm not a spy, I told you that.<eos> I'm a historian.<eos> You, what, thought I...<eos> went around all these years recording my clients with a hidden spy camera?<eos> You remember my first report?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I made it all up for you, Bob.
Cocky.<eos> So, uh... is that a second chance then?<eos> I believe you're on your third chance.<eos> Three strikes, you're out.<eos> - Got it? - Yeah.<eos> Mind a little company?<eos> Think it's gonna rain?<eos> - Hard to say. - True.<eos> I want that painting back.<eos> You've gotta give it back to me, Joshua.
I have fallen in love with Luisa Rey.<eos> Is this possible?<eos> I just met her, and yet... I feel like something important has happened to me.<eos> That's it.<eos> The music from my dream.<eos> This is from my dream, that night I came to your room.<eos> This is the music I heard in my head, somehow I gave it to you.<eos> I've been working on this piece for weeks now.<eos> I suspect you heard it, and incorporated it into your dream.<eos> I call it the Cloud Atlas Sextet.
Tired?<eos> How did it go?<eos> How was it?<eos> Who the fuck do you think was there?<eos> Do you know what I did today?<eos> I spent the entire day photographing a can of tuna.<eos> And once it was open and once it was close, an?<eos> Again and again.<eos> They even had a make-up artist for it, for the fuckin tuna!<eos> She kept on moving it back and forth between dressing rooms, like it was a fucking model.
And how long will that take?<eos> Could take three weeks.<eos> Could take three months.<eos> We don't have three months.<eos> The cops couldn't do shit for us, that's why we hired you.<eos> I understand that, but it's just not that easy, Derek.<eos> - You have to be patient. - I'm patient.<eos> My bank's not patient.<eos> I understand that, but these people use mail drops, they use Po boxes.<eos> They open an account one day, they close it the next.
Please do, quickly.<eos> They're gonna have a cop call me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I'm still gonna go. Okay.<eos> Can I please speak to the principal, headmaster's office, please?<eos> Dude, we're gonna get caught.<eos> We used a fake e-mail, man.<eos> Dude, just give me your iPad and I'll delete the profile.<eos> Use your phone.<eos> My dad has software that would totally wipe it.
We still have a chance to end it here.<eos> How?<eos> Place these transmitters everywhere you saw it try to manifest.<eos> Anywhere it's tried to get a foothold.<eos> I recorded the EEG emissions of our experiment.<eos> We're gonna use that power against it.<eos> We'll play the recording of the session in reverse.<eos> I'm gonna tap into the power lines and feed all that energy into our system.<eos> Four thousand minds put this together.<eos> Four hundred thousand can destroy it.
Time to go.<eos> Happy Easter, you little ankle-biter. I'm gonna miss you.<eos> Bye-bye, Bunny.<eos> You're leaving?<eos> But what if Pitch comes back?<eos> What if we stop believing again?<eos> If I can't see you...<eos> Hey, slow down, slow down.<eos> You're telling me you stop believing in the moon when the sun comes up?<eos> Well, do you stop believing in the sun when clouds block it out?
No, sir, I will take care of it.<eos> Yes, sir, understood.<eos> Fortunately, slightly premature.<eos> Of course, sir.<eos> What did he say, David?<eos> I don't think he'd want me to tell you.<eos> What did he say?<eos> I'm sorry... that's confidential.<eos> So help me God...<eos> I will find the cord that makes you run and I will cut it.
Do you know him too?<eos> My Pip is probably not exactly the same as your Pip, but, yes, I believe I do.<eos> Today, we are not going 10 start with Great Expectations.<eos> Today we are very lucky to have Mabel's mother.<eos> Mrs Tanganani.<eos> Thank you, Mr Watts.<eos> I am here today hoping to surprise you kids.<eos> What if I tell you that some gardens begin their life in the ocean?<eos> The heart seed floats on the water, then it washes up on the sand.<eos> Seven days later, the sun and the wind dry it as light as the husk.
He's a character in a book.<eos> I understand the confusion, but if you will allow me to show you the book, you will see that Pip is a character from the novel Great Expectations.<eos> It's a story.<eos> A wonderful story.<eos> Matilda, would you mind?<eos> I've left the book on my desk.<eos> The book isn't there!<eos> There is no book?<eos> There is.<eos> I just can't find it.
We came across a nest under attack, by an iguana named Budzo.<eos> Your mother fought so bravely.<eos> I may have lost a wing, but she gave her life.<eos> We managed to save one egg that day.<eos> And that was me.<eos> If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be here.<eos> Zoe?<eos> Now I understand why your are so interest in Kai.<eos> That was only a part of it.<eos> I know good talent when I see it.
Are we going back in?<eos> We are.<eos> What is it?<eos> Michael?<eos> The roof.<eos> Though the world has changed, our enemy remains the same.<eos> The Lycans will rebuild.<eos> And will hunt for her father as they did for her.<eos> But as they grow stronger so will we.<eos> The Vampire coven will not only survive this world we will reclaim it.
- Going, sir! - Gobshite (idiot).<eos> Brilliant.<eos> Daly!<eos> Where are you, you gobshite?<eos> Daly!<eos> ...last night, but by the time the Coast Guard arrived at the scene, the men... were no longer on board.<eos> With bad weather set to hamper tomorrow's search, the hope of finding the missing fishermen alive, has grown bleaker by the hour.<eos> Officials believe, the crew of the Sea Harvester were washed overboard...<eos> Hi, I'm just looking for an iron.<eos> Yeah, I'll just go and hock it out for ya. Great, thanks.
What was you, darling?<eos> That man in the armor, was that me?<eos> Yes.<eos> That was your spirit.<eos> Our spirits live on in the whole of time, exist in many vessels through time.<eos> This is the vessel you're existing in now, in 1950.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - As you all may recall, during the trauma that you went through while we were processing...<eos> Yes.<eos> ...It was of the utmost importance that you experience every detail every specific detail through all of your senses, of that memory, and that we go over it again and over it again and over it again until it loses its power.
You're hereby ordered to pay back $11,000 to the Mildred Drummond Foundation no later than June first, otherwise to incur penalties of interest.<eos> There's also the matter of $1,500 in fuel and damages to Mrs. Drummond's sailing yacht, that shall be repaid on the same date.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - Yes?<eos> I don't think Freddie's as committed to The Cause as The Cause is to him.<eos> When I told Freddie about your unpublished work... his question to me was...<eos> "What is something like that worth?"<eos> I think Freddie Quell's a spy.<eos> Perhaps working for some outside agency, or the man's working for himself.<eos> To steal and sell your book to any dissenters who may want it.
Hello, can you see me?<eos> Uh...yeah, Boss, I can.<eos> Okay, good, is it all there?<eos> No, there's only one point seven and a couple new cars out front.<eos> - Where's the rest?<eos> - It's all there...except for what we spent.<eos> - The cars, some hookers...<eos> - We bought them shoes and tacos, that's all.<eos> - Friends, where is the rest of my money?<eos> - That's all there was. Talk to the gringo that stole it.
I wish my dad could see this.<eos> He was an immigrant.<eos> Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.<eos> So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.<eos> That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond. You know, when I could.<eos> To honor him.<eos> You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.<eos> - Remember?<eos> But that's what's great about this country.<eos> If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
You won't have all this at Gates Academy.<eos> Naked men shouldn't squat.<eos> Do you ever worry about your parents?<eos> Did you ever?<eos> Not really.<eos> Wendy will be fine.<eos> I'll watch her.<eos> Goat Man once told me that in certain Native American tribes, an elder leads a young man out into the wilderness to fend for himself until he has a vision.<eos> She never lets me milk her.<eos> In one tribe, if no vision comes they'll chop off a fingertip and sacrifice it to the Great Spirit.
We have discovered some trends in the number and in the losses natural perils have caused.<eos> And, interestingly, for the weather related events, our activities-- primarily greenhouse gas emissions-- are contributing to more intense and more events.<eos> It cannot be acclaimed by just better reporting, it has to be explained by changes in the atmospheric conditions.<eos> Imagine a base ball player on steroids who steps up to the plate and hits a home run.<eos> Can you attribute that home run to his taking steroids?<eos> Well steroids occur naturally in very small amounts in your system but by adding just a little bit of those steroids you can change your background physical state and increase your chances for enhanced performance and that's exactly what happens in the climate system.<eos> Greenhouse gases occur in very small amounts but by increasing that just a little bit, you change the background state and make it much more susceptible to increased extremes.<eos> If you had an abcess in your tooth, would you keep going to dentist after dentist until you found a dentist that said, ahhh, don't worry about it.<eos> Leave that rotten tooth in.<eos> Or would you pull it out because more of the other dentists told you you had a problem?
Come on, you're gonna be okay.<eos> Frank.<eos> Returning fire.<eos> God, I hate heights.<eos> Watch out!<eos> - Mace!<eos> - Where are you?<eos> Get to the subway, Wilson platform 10.<eos> And dump the phone!<eos> They're using it to track you!
You called her your daughter.<eos> I'm writing my thoughts.<eos> You love me?<eos> of course.<eos> I don't have any friends.<eos> In paris I had lots.<eos> We need to leave.<eos> Both of us.<eos> There's something missing.<eos> there is a love That is like a stream that goes dry When rain no longer feeds it.
- Why did you take my vehicle?<eos> - To draw you out,<eos> Obviously it worked.<eos> You're naked and shivering in a tub, you're not capable of drawing me out, Plum.<eos> Just remember that.<eos> You know what, keep the wheels, I don't give a shit.<eos> No...<eos> Joe, no!<eos> I am taking the towel!<eos> Not as great, you can have it back.

Well...<eos> David Barlow can't be held responsible for what happened to the safe house.<eos> We just don't need the scandal.<eos> But, sir, you and I both know that, that is just not the truth.<eos> People don't want the truth anymore, Matt.<eos> It's too messy.<eos> Keeps them up nights.<eos> I'll tell you what I am willing to do, though.<eos> I think the Agency has grossly underestimated you, and I'm recommending you for a senior case officer position.<eos> Provided you still want it.
No.<eos> - "Prrh!" Yeah.<eos> OK, I'm just trying to think if I...<eos> if I lost my soul, how would that feel?<eos> I mean, that's er... I couldn't imagine that.<eos> I might start to cry.<eos> Where is er... the contract?<eos> Someone picked it up at the gallery, so you...<eos> Where is it?<eos> - Why do you ask? - I need it back.
Vincent Gallo.<eos> Vincent Gallo?<eos> So that's where you've been?<eos> Well, first I got a massage because I was tense, OK?<eos> And then I finally found out who was the anonymous person who bought my soul, so I called and we had a meeting, and it was Vincent Gallo.<eos> And then... and then I...<eos> tried to negotiate with him, my soul back.<eos> And the paper, he had the certificate that I signed.<eos> I just want it back, not because I believe in the soul, but because I believe something was wrong with me ever since I signed that paper.<eos> So he had it in a little area he said, like in a suede pouch, next to his groin area, you know?
I took this towel and put it on your face but you didn't react.<eos> Look, there's still dampness on your collar.<eos> And when... when was it?<eos> Just now, a couple of minutes ago.<eos> - So?<eos> - So? There's no "so".<eos> I went into the bedroom to get dressed. I wanted to get help.<eos> - Help? - Yes.<eos> But then you turned off the tap.<eos> Yes, because you left it on.
- Thank you.<eos> Okay, look, so I've been thinking about something.<eos> - What's your favorite book?<eos> - It's probably not what you remember.<eos> - That's fine. That's not the point.<eos> The Beach House by James Patterson.<eos> - No, really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay. The Beach House.<eos> Okay, if it was great, you probably loaned it to somebody, right?
But let me remind you that if I had to, I wouldn't have a problem cutting both their throats.<eos> Well, you'll never get them together. I'm the only one who can do that.<eos> Come on.<eos> Are you really bragging about that?<eos> There's something wrong with your love story, baby.<eos> They may love you, but they will never love you as much as they love each other. Otherwise, they wouldn't share you, would they?<eos> I gave your boy Alex a new bank account in Saint Kitts.<eos> Separate deposits of 120, 260, and 90.<eos> I spin it around the planet twice, and voilá.<eos> Alex Reyes now owns a building in Cabo, sells it to a resident of Palau who doesn't exist.
Grandma's in a better place now.<eos> No, she's not.<eos> She's in the living room.<eos> Your grandmother was old and sick and she died.<eos> That's all there is to it!<eos> Okay.<eos> Perry, this is just part of the mourning process.<eos> Oh, stop indulging him.<eos> I'm nothing if I'm not liberal, but that limp-wristed hippie garbage needs to be nipped in the bud.<eos> This behavior might be okay with your side of the family, but I'm not putting up with it any more!
I need you to run a stat blood series, including a CMP, CBC, P.T., and a PTT.<eos> That man you brought in.<eos> You know him?<eos> I saw him at the casino last night.<eos> He took my drink. He drank from your glass?<eos> That must be how you infected him.<eos> What?<eos> Mr. Damour, my name is Dr. Penderson.<eos> I believe you've been infected by a highly contagious and very deadly strain of meningitis.<eos> And it looks like you gave it to Mr. Howard.
Well, there was this thing with the copyright, and...<eos> Bob, put that down, please.<eos> I took it from the guard.<eos> I don't even know if it's loaded.<eos> Don't hold that lighter too close.<eos> This stuff catches fire easily.<eos> Help me to lift this barrier up.<eos> It's really heavy.<eos> And this sponge costume doesn't help<eos> Why don't you take it off?
Ch. my gosh!<eos> What a coincidence!<eos> I never come downtown!<eos> Will I see you at the Cinébal?<eos> Yves made a donation, so we're going.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Let me give you my number, in case you need a ticket or a ride.<eos> We got a limo, with a chauffeur. Slick!<eos> A ball is a ball, you know? I mean, go glam, girl!<eos> Let me give it to you.
So, this is the new den, and this is where I sit and watch TV all day long.<eos> Just wasting my Iife away.<eos> Thank God for Wellbutrin, right?<eos> I'm alone most of the time.<eos> Rick work a Iot?<eos> Well, he entertains clients at night or has affairs or...<eos> I'm kidding, of course.<eos> Are you?<eos> I have a dildo in here.<eos> Feel free to use it and know that it's clean because I put it through the dishwasher like Whoopi say to do.
It's my pleasure.<eos> Three can play at that game.<eos> There's a Kinko's 13 miles down the road.<eos> Go get copies.<eos> I will get more cards.<eos> I will be back.<eos> Come back and buy a zucchini.<eos> And we will build that casino.<eos> Carvin, do you have any idea where the deed is?<eos> No, I'll find it, because I use the think method.
All right, I'm turning around.<eos> No you're not.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You got the money, the Chinese have nothing you care about.<eos> No, they have something I did.<eos> Give the girl the combination to your safe and she will give you our number.<eos> We go to your location, you go to ours, we we've gotten the disc, we will explain the code, and you get the cash.<eos> That's the deal.<eos> - Let's hear it.<eos> - It's a very long number. You want to write it down.
Let's go, Devils!<eos> Come on.<eos> - Hey, Nothing. - Hey, Nothing.<eos> Oh, suck it, virginity pledges!<eos> Suck it!<eos> Hey, Patrick.<eos> Hey!<eos> You're in my shop class, right?<eos> How's your clock coming?<eos> My dad's building it for me.
Maybe I could join the cast as an alternate or something?<eos> Well, we're filled up now, but... they're going to need people when we go to college.<eos> I could put in a good word for you.<eos> - That'd be great. Thanks. - Yeah.<eos> Charlie...<eos> Have you heard of the Sadie Hawkins dance?<eos> The one where the girl asks the guy.<eos> Obviously, it is completely stupid and sexist.<eos> I mean it's like, "Hey, thanks for the crumb."<eos> And normally, I'd just blow it off because school dances suck torture.
- Do an X-ray at the hospital.<eos> Do an X-ray right away.<eos> I'll look after the baby.<eos> Where are the car keys?<eos> - On the desk, to the left, I think.<eos> I keep telling you to close the gate.<eos> - I know.<eos> For 6 months, I've been saying she could have a fall!<eos> I know...<eos> - So why don't you close it?
- Yes.<eos> Well then...<eos> To Malika!<eos> What about your office?<eos> Do you like it?<eos> - It's beautiful.<eos> I love the color.<eos> - That's your sister's.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Want to give it to her?
A man like you, if he wanted...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What's got into you?<eos> - Can't we have a laugh any more?<eos> Don't scowl like that!<eos> Mummy, it's not working!<eos> Jade...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Always ask me to put a tape in for you.<eos> Dallas mend it.
We thought you were dead.<eos> Well, actually, you are dead, right?<eos> Come in.<eos> Come in!<eos> You missed the party.<eos> You didn't have to involve her in all this.<eos> It was her idea.<eos> Tell him.<eos> They're asking for the ransom all at once.<eos> When it's paid, I'll pick it up.
Well, do you have a better take of that?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> Well, it's all kind of shaky and shit.<eos> Shaky?<eos> It's a handheld.<eos> It's supposed to be shaky.<eos> It gives it a sense of energy.<eos> Is that what you filmmakers call it?
Thanks.<eos> Hello.<eos> Quinn.<eos> You have my phone?<eos> Looks like it.<eos> - Where'd you find it?<eos> - Here.<eos> Is it... uh, where are you now?<eos> Home.<eos> So is it cool if I come by and grab it in like an hour?
Did he answer?<eos> Tells me he was a flamethrower on Peleliu.<eos> He torches a pillbox, right?<eos> And this Japanese officer and two foot soldiers come charging' out.<eos> His buddies take out the two foot soldiers, but the officer comes bearing down on him.<eos> One buddy shoots him in the bayonet, he goes down, gets back up with his service revolver.<eos> So Grampa lays into him with the torch.<eos> Handle's toast see?<eos> And there's the dent.<eos> He kept it for gutting' catfish.
Oh, my God. It's George!<eos> He's back!<eos> I knew he would come back to me!<eos> Honey?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God, honey.<eos> I was so worried that something had happened to you.<eos> Is my sandwich ready?<eos> Of course it is, sweetie.<eos> I'll get it for you.
Why is my bed so cold?<eos> These are the questions.<eos> I'll never know.<eos> I'm a ranchero.<eos> And I don't know.<eos> The only thing I'll ever know for certain ls love.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Holy Mary, a white cat.<eos> This is a rare thing.<eos> Let me kill it.
She's like Mother Teresa!<eos> Only younger.<eos> But not that much younger.<eos> This is number one on Yelp for best bar in a scary neighborhood.<eos> You're gonna love it.<eos> It's crowded.<eos> I'm dressed for a barbecue.<eos> Okay, let's get a drink.<eos> Okay.<eos> If I gave you all my heart Would you take it?
Cool.<eos> Of course, at the time, I had no idea how culpable he was for what was about to happen.<eos> The first signs that something was very wrong happened six weeks before July 4th.<eos> It was on the news, but I don't think anybody really put two and two together and knew what was going on.<eos> The bodies of two scientists were found in the Chesapeake Bay last night after having been reported missing for more than 36 hours.<eos> The cause of death was listed as unknown, although medical examiners found numerous wounds on the body that might be consistent with shark bites.<eos> The two scientists were oceanographers working to measure pollution levels in the bay.<eos> These were two oceanographers.<eos> One from the Cousteau Institute and another from the University of Maryland.<eos> They were keeping a video diary of their research and sending it to the Chesapeake Environmental Council.
Kaka!<eos> are we here to buy Michael?<eos> You are here to buy my donkey?<eos> Yes..it'll take us to America<eos> -America!<eos> Kaka we go to America with Michael?<eos> Yes, uncle you sell it or not?<eos> If you are going buy it..<eos> You must not call it a donkey!<eos> Only stupid people call it a donkey...
Is superman powerful enough to destroy all the bad people and bring back all the good ones?<eos> Yes.. he is..<eos> And he's very brave and he can fly too.<eos> Kaka, so why doesn't he destroy Saddam?<eos> everyone knows he's very bad with people And he has killed our parents too.<eos> I don't know maybe he hasn't heard of Saddam<eos> Kaka, i swear I'll tell Superman by myself.<eos> Zana, what is this notebook?<eos> Kaka i bought it...<eos> I write the names of all those who treated me badly on it And I'll give it to superman.
Zana, forgive me, I know you are angry with me.<eos> But i regret everything and i want to go to America with you.<eos> If you don't leave now, i will shout and make every single soldier gather here.. to take you and then kill you.<eos> But they will kill you too!<eos> Zana, please forgive me, I know you are angry<eos> But if you forgive me, I will leave everything behind and will never think about anything else<eos> But I want us to be together..<eos> to go to America to see superman<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> i have written your name on the notebook. and i'm gonna give it to superman.
Do you remember when we were children begging for scraps, like those wretches?<eos> - Yes sister.<eos> - Am I not kinder?<eos> Yes.<eos> These two were captured leading an ambush on one of our supply trains.<eos> Your son?<eos> Handsome.<eos> Obviously a debt owed to your mother.<eos> There was a time I would have lost my heart to a face like yours.<eos> And you, no doubt, would have broken it.
Undisguised, she'll be killed.<eos> She'll go dressed as a servant, and you as her.<eos> If ever you're stopped, I want her spared.<eos> In a way, Your Majesty, you're asking me to go as bait.<eos> An ugly word for a pretty mouth!<eos> Words are all I possess.<eos> I wield them well.<eos> No arrogance when I allow you to earn my love!<eos> Send for Madame Bertin.<eos> I confided in you yesterday my love for Gabrielle because you deserve it.
- Cough again. - Great school.<eos> Everything looks good.<eos> Your face is close to my face.<eos> Descending colon.<eos> I'm about four feet in right now.<eos> That's what he said.<eos> Just try to breathe through your nose.<eos> I grind all night.<eos> I think we need to turn the gas down. Turn it up!<eos> No, we're going to turn it down.
-Why not?<eos> I thought you said she had a tight little bottom.<eos> -Because.<eos> -Because of Jane?<eos> Seriously, David, that's never gonna happen.<eos> I accidentally spilled wine on her carpet. -Right.<eos> Who gives a shit?<eos> -She does.<eos> She's got this thing about her carpet.<eos> The way the sunlight hits it at a certain point in the afternoon and....
I don't usually go for high school girls.<eos> Too needy. Way too immature.<eos> But this one you know, she's inspiring.<eos> I'm actually writing a song about her.<eos> Well, about her knees.<eos> We're gonna have sex tonight.<eos> Yeah?<eos> We were supposed to do it last weekend, but I got the flu.<eos> Sure.<eos> I'm not gonna lie, Dan, it's been a long time coming but we're finally doing it.
You know what, Dave?<eos> You are in love with Jane. You're in love with her.<eos> You are in love with her smile and her hair tucking and her annoyingly perfect skin.<eos> Who has skin like that?<eos> It's ridiculous.<eos> It's, like, per--<eos> -You've got great skin. -Yeah, thank you.<eos> But that's because I work really hard at my skin.<eos> I'm on a first-name basis with my dermatologist.<eos> If there's a problem, Phyllis and I deal with it.
Honey, I'm sure you didn't.<eos> No, I did.<eos> I messed up.<eos> And now it's over before I....<eos> I'm never gonna see him again.<eos> Oh, sweetheart.<eos> I love you.<eos> Both of you.<eos> So much.<eos> And I'm sorry if I don't tell you it more.
You're not getting in my car like that.<eos> You smell like shit too, like gay shit.<eos> Look at this. Everything's going good. Shut up.<eos> It was beautiful.<eos> Yeah, we leave in the middle of the night, for fuck's sake. All the way to Florida, we're in this fucking rainstorm.<eos> The dogs are all pissing and farting and shitting... and we can't roll the windows down.<eos> Put the fucking window-- what are you, an asshole? ! Put the fucking cigarette out!<eos> It was awful.<eos> It was like riding in a shit house.<eos> And then after got over to Orlando, we're gonna burn the car... so Kenny sticks a rag in the gas tank, and he lights it off.
Take off, Rover.<eos> All right, Billy. You get a vantage point up there.<eos> There's fur in their hands. These guys were alive until the wolves got to them. Be careful.<eos> Is this it?<eos> Yes, it's here.<eos> Caesar! I need you in here.<eos> Caesar, grab a hold of this thing.<eos> I think it's spring-loaded.<eos> Lee, hook it on.<eos> Now, on the count of three, let's pull it back.
- She's just upset, cause the zoo guy didn't show up...<eos> But she'll be fine, right, Janice?<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> - What're you doing?<eos> Come on, Janice. You're being weird.<eos> - You just need a sence of acсomplishment, Janice.<eos> Yes, or yoga.<eos> - She just needs a new attitude, because she always so negative.<eos> - There's a chapter in my book about positive thinking...<eos> Every time I read it, it puts me in a real good place. See?
Kate, she's got a son.<eos> Is this because she has a pretty face, Mac?<eos> Because I thought you were a lot smarter than that.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> There you go.<eos> What do you think it is?<eos> Are you just gonna look at it?<eos> - He's doing nothing. - Open it, Mark.<eos> - Go on.<eos> - Open it up.
My God, I don't know how you handle that shit.<eos> Eat my bra!<eos> Eat my bra!<eos> What did he say?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't think he was talking to us.<eos> What?<eos> We could act out your masturbation fantasies.<eos> Maybe that would get you hard.<eos> Someone must've pirated a copy off the original site before I shut it down.
And, no, there aren't.<eos> Thirty years I've been doing this and I've seen a lot of other games come and go.<eos> Kind of sad. I think about all those guys from Asteroids.<eos> Boom!<eos> Gone.<eos> Centipede?<eos> Who knows where that guy is, you know?<eos> Look, a steady arcade gig is nothing to sneeze at.<eos> I'm very lucky.<eos> It's just, I got to say, it becomes kind of hard to love yourjob when no one seems to like you for doing it.
Mr. Litwak!<eos> What's the trouble, sweetheart?<eos> The game's busted.<eos> I can fix it!<eos> I can fix it!<eos> Oh, boy. Looks like the game's gone cuckoo, like my nana.<eos> Sorry, sweetie.<eos> Here's your quarter back.<eos> But what about the game?<eos> I'll have someone look at it tomorrow... But if he can't fix it, it might be time to put old Ralph and Felix out to pasture.
Who here wants to fuck, 'cause I'm ready!<eos> Are you through?<eos> Hardly.<eos> You want to know what Daddy said when she went off to India to find herself?<eos> I hope she never comes back.<eos> I only came to Valparaiso because I worry about you.<eos> But you don't give a fuck about anyone else.<eos> You're a selfish, spoiled, little shit!<eos> I'm selfish?<eos> That's actually funny, last I checked, you were the one who had an abortion and got Daddy to pay for it!
All right?<eos> - Let's go.<eos> All right.<eos> How grotesque.<eos> it's a good spot.<eos> I come out here to do my thinking.<eos> I used to bring Patty Overton out here and just wear her ass out.<eos> That was before the war.<eos> She married a Primitive Baptist preacher.<eos> She was hare-lipped and you needed Grandpa's bifocals to see her titties, but, you know, she had a $900 ass and, God damn, she could take it right up to the gills without so much as a hiccup.
No.<eos> I landed right in the middle of the goddamn US marines.<eos> It knocked me out.<eos> I broke my right leg, collarbone, a few ribs, pelvis, both hands.<eos> I don't remember a lot about it, to tell you the truth.<eos> November the 12th, 1942,<eos> I woke up in a hospital, had both my hands in casts and my right leg, just tore to pieces.<eos> And... the hospital got hit.<eos> And I nearly burned to death.<eos> I saw a guy coming at me with a big ol' wet blanket or something and he threw it over my head.
Your majesty.<eos> You came here to help us against the unbelievable offences of the infidel army.<eos> You and your heroic soldiers are worth more than anything for us.<eos> Of course, we are grateful for their support. But there are also a considerable number of people who haven't forgotten the pain caused by... ..the Latin armies, as well as who greet them exuberantly.<eos> Don't you think you are unfair to soldiers who came to die for your city, Grand Duke Notaras?<eos> Our people will embrace these heroic soldiers who came to die for them, Notaras.<eos> Never doubt that.<eos> Maybe you are right.<eos> We are almost out of copper, father. I know.<eos> They will deliver it tomorrow.
- Please?<eos> ( distorted ) Please give it back to me, Justin.<eos> - Justin: Get your hand off me, girl. - Girl:<eos> No!<eos> Could I have that back, please?<eos> Umm, hey, you're-- you're Amy, right?<eos> Um... do you want a beer?<eos> No, my dog just... bit some Jamaican guy.<eos> Man, my uncle lost a foot in his riding mower.<eos> Says you can still feel it.
We went out from the end of high school till... well, through college.<eos> What did she do?<eos> She studied Marketing at school.<eos> She's got a job at an ad agency now.<eos> And you?<eos> Me?<eos> I studied Neuroscience... with a primary focus on the relationship between the eye and the brain.<eos> My thesis project was about peripheral vision.<eos> It dealt with something called 'crowding' and 'size pooling'.<eos> How the width of one object is given a weighted average of the objects around it.
OK.<eos> What period?<eos> The Middle Ages and the Renaissance.<eos> And what are you studying?<eos> Er, I graduated, earlier this year actually.<eos> - But I was studying Neuroscience. - Mm?<eos> My focus was the relationship between the eye and the brain.<eos> My thesis project was about peripheral vision.<eos> It dealt with something called 'crowding' and 'size pooling'.<eos> How the width of one object is given a weighted average of the objects around it.
Where's your family from?<eos> Michigan.<eos> But before that, Korea.<eos> Immigrants built this country.<eos> Never forget that.<eos> Our family came from Ireland.<eos> Maggie Greene, I kind of figured.<eos> My grandfather brought this over from the old country.<eos> He passed it on to my father, who passed it on to me.<eos> I pawned it to pay for a night of drinking I no longer remember.
You must have done something.<eos> - Maybe he saw you leaving town.<eos> - So what?<eos> You said you picked a fight with that fat ass in the phone store, right?<eos> You want to fight, then fight!<eos> What did you do to that woman back there?<eos> Just gave her a piece of my mind.<eos> Same as you.<eos> No different.<eos> Except I didn't tuck it between my legs.
- I saved your life.<eos> We are in this together, John, like I said, whether you like it or not.<eos> Tammy, where's your phone?<eos> It's in my bag.<eos> He's alive, but just barely!<eos> So, what do you owe him?<eos> - It's not in here!<eos> Where's her phone?<eos> - How would I know?<eos> Because you took it out of her bag when you were in the back seat!
I leamed then, when it comes to women, there's always a catch.<eos> You're my fella, Richie, and when a girl meets a fella, they end up having tea and getting married.<eos> Oh.<eos> I want to be a spaceman and fly to the moon.<eos> Dinner time, April! Come on in.<eos> Okay, Mom!<eos> We'll get married when you get back from the moon.<eos> I'll wait for you.<eos> I don't care how much you plan for your future.<eos> You don't know what it's actually going to be like until you live it.
Sounds great.<eos> All right, man. Page me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What I'm about to ask you is very sensitive.<eos> The only reason why I'm asking is 'cause you're my friend.<eos> I don't know what I can do to help, but, yeah, what do you need?<eos> Right on. Deluca and I have been working on this case, all right?<eos> And I want you to keep this to yourself.<eos> And I don't want anybody to know about it, okay?
Looks good.<eos> He's getting bigger.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> You really gave Deluca quite a scare.<eos> He's ready to dump you, the whole thing.<eos> Enough with these fucking tests, all right?<eos> Either ask me to help you or just leave me the fuck alone.<eos> I need you to go into the locker, I need you to take the McKillen case out.<eos> It's a kilo, it's a big brick, it says "McKillen" across it, okay?<eos> I need you to break off a chunk, I need you to put it in a bag. I'm gonna come by, I'm gonna pick it up tomorrow morning.
Nobody's gonna question you, okay?<eos> You gotta do this for me. I'm in a jam with these guys.<eos> No problem.<eos> I knew I could count on you, man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tell Mike I love him. I gotta go.<eos> All right.<eos> I need you to go into the locker, I need you to take the McKillen case out.<eos> It's a kilo, it's a big brick, it says "McKillen" across it, okay?<eos> I need you to break off a chunk, I need you to put it in a bag. I'm gonna come by, I'm gonna pick it up tomorrow morning. All right?
We always move.<eos> How about Lancaster, New York? Baby.<eos> We're not moving.<eos> So can we talk about my name change now?<eos> Oh, brother.<eos> I spoke to the county clerk and he'll need your signature on a petition I've already filled.<eos> - You have a beautiful name.<eos> - And you changed yours.<eos> Okay, I'll make you a deal.<eos> For now you keep it, and when you turn 18,
I believe if we're primed and ready for an attack, the boys I vouch for will take the direct route.<eos> The others will come along. I feel almost sure of it, sir.<eos> Good man, Silver.<eos> Blade up, boys!<eos> Check the pistols and the powder.<eos> Gun crews primed and practice on the gun deck.<eos> Where's Mr Arrow?<eos> - Below deck was up incapacitated.<eos> - Did you give him liquor?<eos> - No. - Where did he get it from?
Why should I believe you?<eos> Cos Jake's got it in his head that your girl's gonna talk and get him put away for life.<eos> Why are you telling me this now?<eos> Cos he wants me to finish the job as soon as we get out.<eos> - He's threatening my daughter!<eos> I can't have that.<eos> But I can't be killing nobody.<eos> You gotta go see him.<eos> You gotta be prepared, brother.<eos> You gotta fix this mess, be it how you fix it with your girl, or how you fix it with Jake, cos I just know my daughter doesn't deserve to be involved in this.
Oh!<eos> You're in, you're in!<eos> - Mate, hang on, how old are you?<eos> - Eighteen.<eos> Eighteen?<eos> I've got porn mags older than you!<eos> Cheese and Marmite together?<eos> On the same butty?<eos> That's fucking repellent.<eos> - Can I have it back, then? - No.
The Roman army?<eos> ! We are all of us dead!<eos> Grab your fucking cock!<eos> We never wanted this.<eos> You gladiators, you will see us all to our end!<eos> You little fuck!<eos> Agron!<eos> We knew this day would come.<eos> Some have feared its approach.<eos> Others have longed for it.
Oh, geoffrey...<eos> Excellent timing. Come in.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> Geoffrey burton...<eos> Jarek novak.<eos> Yes.<eos> We've, uh, met.<eos> Jarek and rebekka made the initial breakthrough With the easter gene.<eos> I presume she's filled you in by now.<eos> Yeah, she mentioned it.
I asked him why he was moving, and he said he didn't like the women here.<eos> I said, "Why, what's wrong with us?" "Too skinny."<eos> I said, "Well, I'll take that as a compliment."<eos> Nothing else?<eos> - Well...<eos> - What?<eos> Tell me.<eos> I have his phone number.<eos> I threw it away out here.<eos> He gave it to me last night.
Can I help you, Mr. Cutler?<eos> Come on in here for a second.<eos> I'm in the middle of training--<eos> Yeah, yeah, he'll find his way back.<eos> Shut the door.<eos> You know what I did last night?<eos> On the absolute insistence of Debra, and God knows I tried to blow her off, I read your novel last night.<eos> You did?<eos> Have you, uh, shown this to anyone else, anyone outside the agency?<eos> No, no, you're the only one that's seen it.
Oh, yes.<eos> Well, I have a pen.<eos> So...<eos> I do have a story.<eos> A very good story.<eos> Now, I know you get this line all the time, but I think you'll like the story. Hm?<eos> If I was to tell you the story and you wrote it, well, then, maybe you could give me a little credit?<eos> Well, that wouldn't be fair, would it?<eos> Have a good day.<eos> It's about a man who wrote a book and then lost it and the pissant kid who found it.
♪ You missed again.<eos> Will you stop?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I'm just trying to help.<eos> If I wanted your help, I'd ask for it.
Fucking hell.<eos> All I'm saying is just ease up.<eos> Ease up?<eos> How?<eos> What have I said?<eos> Matt, we can all feel the vibes.<eos> Vibes? I thought Ruth was the one into vibes. Aha.<eos> You're so funny.<eos> Listen, we need to get this intro shot before she actually finds the place.<eos> If she finds it.
I know.<eos> You kn...<eos> I'm not an idiot.<eos> The only reason you started talking to me is because you wanted my money.<eos> And you're right, I was lonely, so I figured, why not?<eos> That's what it was.<eos> But I don't think that's what it is now.<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> Well, that's why you're back here with the cheque;<eos> 'cause you feel it too.
I know you, Raquel.<eos> You don't.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> I'm not even an alcoholic.<eos> I just went to those meetings to network.<eos> Well, that may be the case, but you still have a hole in you, just like me, and you're trying to fill with work, and God knows what else, and it isn't working.<eos> Just take the cheque.<eos> You must be so tired.<eos> Please, just take it back.<eos> I don't want it back.
God, you give an exceptional blowjob.<eos> I mean, seriously.<eos> Something to be said for putting in the time.<eos> Have you read Outliers?<eos> - Malcolm Gladwell.<eos> He claims that the secret to success in any field is a simple matter of practicing a specific task for, mmm, about 10,000 hours.<eos> What, you wanna suck my dick now?<eos> What?<eos> You want me to take mine out?<eos> Want me to put it in your mouth?
Let's run for it.<eos> What's going to happen to us now, Dad?<eos> Well, I reckon we'll just sit around this campfire awhile.<eos> - But then what?<eos> - Only a fool plans more than a few centuries ahead, son.<eos> Freeze, tin woodsmen!<eos> You're under arrest for kidnapping and burning raccoons without a permit!<eos> It's over, Dad.<eos> It ain't over!<eos> I can't outrun a hovercopter, but I can out-bend it!
I know, it's just that I was just assigned a new homicide case last night and, to be honest, I don't have the bandwidth for another.<eos> In other words, you're reserving that bandwidth for a fully-paying client?<eos> Yes.<eos> Times a little tough, huh?<eos> I just started a practice of my own a few months ago.<eos> Yes, and I'm very impressed with what I've seen so far.<eos> That's why I thought of you specifically for this.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> You meet the client.<eos> Afterwards, if you don't want the case, I'll assign it to somebody else, I promise.
But he wouldn't.<eos> He told me he was making it his business.<eos> The knife.<eos> Was yours, wasn't it.<eos> I warned him.<eos> But Nathan had to be Nathan.<eos> And that kid was supposed to be smart.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look how smart he was.<eos> Hey Mom, if you had a dollar, and you had to divide it between all of your friends, would you want a hundred pennies or a single bill? Why?
I need to know he's going to go through with this.<eos> He destroyed us once; I'm not going to let him do it again.<eos> I looked at the stats and if Christina doesn't accept the donation, then there is a good chance she won't make it to her next birthday.<eos> And now they want to meet Jim on death row.<eos> Yeah, she wants to look him in the eye and make sure the offer is genuine.<eos> 10 Vincent Avenue, Oxon Hill.<eos> I found the deed!<eos> I'm a home owner.<eos> - Boom! That place could be worth quite a chunk of change.<eos> We're not gonna sell it, Ray!
It's not.<eos> She's asking why. I'm asking why.<eos> He's not asking for forgiveness,<eos> - it's just that if something positive<eos> - No. I need him to tell us.<eos> I don't have an easy answer.<eos> I guess...<eos> I'm not a good person. And in my mind, I always figured that was mostly my fault.<eos> But maybe, also... there's a dark part of me... blackness in my heart... I didn't put it there.<eos> So maybe, if you have it... this heart... you can change it.
I don't know, it depends on what she's offering to trade.<eos> She made it pretty clear, if Stack or his people find out,<eos> - it won't be pretty.<eos> - Don't worry, bro.<eos> If Stack's guys move, we'll know it.<eos> A deal?<eos> Last time we talked, you were telling me how innocent she is.<eos> Things change, Diane.<eos> Maybe in your world, but not in mine.<eos> I wanted life before, and I want it now.
An investigation would do more than bring down your best client;<eos> In the midst of a legal recession, it could taint and destroy this firm... your father's pride and joy.<eos> I know what I agreed to.<eos> I don't need be reminded.<eos> Good.<eos> Although, I'd like to think your decision to support my mission wasn't entirely a business move.<eos> Not here.<eos> What are we doing about McDeere and the drive?<eos> We're attacking from two angles.<eos> We'll get the drive when McDeere brings it in.
And how did she get away?<eos> I don't know, I guess we'll figure that out.<eos> Claire...<eos> Your mom's gonna be okay.<eos> They've just given her something to sleep.<eos> What happened to her?<eos> They don't know.<eos> They're gonna keep her here overnight, and just make sure that everything's fine.<eos> So what about the hard drive?<eos> Feds have it, they're crackin' it now. - And Stack?
I understood.<eos> But I couldn't accept it.<eos> So I reached out to Margaret.<eos> The defendant's sister?<eos> Yes, she took care of Henry.<eos> I called her.<eos> I told her the world deserves to see Henry's new book.<eos> Did she help you?<eos> Eventually, yes.<eos> She took it when Henry was out.
She tells him the truth.<eos> That she wrote the Saddest Generation.<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> Because she can't control her emotions.<eos> She threatens to go public with it.<eos> - But why does he kill her?<eos> - Money!<eos> Miller's got Henry's new book.<eos> He knows it's worth a fortune.<eos> He sells it and gets a huge commission.
My business here prevents me from being home right now.<eos> When you comin' back to Chicago?<eos> I don't know.<eos> My childhood friend Patrick is facing a murder trial.<eos> I'm here to see that goes our way.<eos> Your childhood friend?<eos> That's what you call him?<eos> That a problem, John?<eos> Yeah, that's a problem.<eos> I'd say it's a problem when my boss names a new consigliere and hides it from the family.
Ray, who are these guys?<eos> I don't know. They didn't feel like the mob.<eos> They had masks and machine guns.<eos> There it is, east on Jefferson.<eos> I'll get him.<eos> Call me, track the signal, direct me to it.<eos> Tammy, talk to me.<eos> Okay, north on Woodson, then east on Jefferson.<eos> Where's the signal?<eos> I still see it, Ray,
Remember to explain your answers.<eos> Don't just give me names and dates.<eos> Relax, Martin, everything is under control.<eos> No, Alex, things are not under control.<eos> There are loose ends. McDeere works with us now.<eos> He knows nothing about why we hired him.<eos> He thinks it's because of some tort case he found.<eos> How did he get our case in the first place?<eos> A mistake.<eos> It was assigned by the court before we knew about it.
It didn't stop Ray.<eos> He yelled "shotgun" and he jumped in.<eos> Me, I wouldn't go.<eos> What happened?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing, two hours later, they came back, dropped Ray off and he went to work.<eos> My dad... He was killed that day.<eos> Killed in an explosion in the mine.<eos> It was his last day.<eos> And Ray got to spend it with him.
A boy who spent his young life in the shadow of his confident older brother.<eos> A brother that he loved more than anybody.<eos> Now, this kid, he had problems.<eos> He had trouble adjusting.<eos> It was hard for him to make friends.<eos> He didn't have much, but he had his older brother.<eos> And whatever his big brother did, he wanted to do, even if it meant getting into trouble.<eos> People gave up on him... his teachers, his mother.<eos> But this young man, he had potential.<eos> All he needed was for one person to see it.
Yeah.<eos> No, it has, I-I swear, I've... kept track.<eos> It's been a whole year?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ooh. The last time that-that you gave me head was on my last birthday.<eos> But if you think about it, like, the first year that we were, like, hanging out or whatever, together... you did it, I mean, probably like a hundred times.<eos> But, you know, ever since then, like for the past couple years, it's only been on my birthday.<eos> Now, we-we've been together off and on for, like, three years.<eos> So that means that if we stay together, then I'll only get a blow job once a year until, you know, who knows when?<eos> See, that's why I don't want you to do it right now.
What is this story<eos> How does the recovered material?<eos> The split with the crew?<eos> Three equal parts Will be four hours<eos> Because I'm the fourth<eos> You are not registered in our crew<eos> Where is the record sheet?<eos> Right I'll check later...<eos> So we divide into three parts the booty?<eos> Of course, There's no way I divide it even with the new guy
Didn't say I'd make it the first time.<eos> Whoo! All right, let's play!<eos> Here we go.<eos> Your file says you're a smoker.<eos> Would you like a cigarette?<eos> This office does have some perks.<eos> So....<eos> Tell me about that case.<eos> Isn't it in the file?<eos> Mm, I'd like to hear it from you.
God forbid the campaign come to an end while he heals.<eos> Hey, you left, all right?<eos> His sister's a no-show.<eos> This isn't about the campaign.<eos> You have 30 seconds.<eos> The doctors gave me a questionnaire to fill out.<eos> What's a typical morning like for Darren--<eos> You know, waking up?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I wouldn't ask if I didn't need it, all right?
Gimme some.<eos> Where's your moms at?<eos> She's outside smoking.<eos> Bad habit.<eos> Better not take that up, now.<eos> You hear?<eos> Are you gonna come over again more now?<eos> Get me my jacket over there.<eos> Got something for you.<eos> Been carrying it around with me. Waiting for the right moment, I guess.
That better be Zane in there.<eos> In here?<eos> This is not my fault!<eos> Of course.<eos> Let's drill into your brain, shall we?<eos> This day sucks.<eos> Okay. Maybe operating in your current state of mind is a bad idea.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> The haptic telepresence gloves are like a steering wheel for the nanoprobe she's about to insert.<eos> I'm gonna drive the probe through your brain to the axonal cluster and neutralize it.
Each day still better other's happiness Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap, Add an immortal title to your crown!<eos> We thank you both.<eos> Yet one but flatters us, As well appeareth by the cause you come,<eos> Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.<eos> Cousin of Hereford, What dost thou object Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?<eos> First - heaven be the record to my speech!<eos> In the devotion of a subject's love, And free from other misbegotten hate, Come I appellant to this princely presence.<eos> My body shall make good upon this earth, Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.<eos> Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,<eos> Too good to be so, and too bad to live, Since the more fair and crystal is the sky, The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
HE CHUCKLES Why, uncle, thou hast many years to live.<eos> But not a minute, King, that thou canst give.<eos> Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow, And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow.<eos> Cousin, farewell, and uncle, bid him so.<eos> Six years we banish him, and he SHALL go.<eos> Teach thy necessity to reason thus -<eos> Think not the King did banish thee, But thou the King.<eos> Look what thy soul holds dear, Imagine it to lie that way thou goest, Not whence thou com'st.<eos> Suppose the singing birds musicians, The flowers fair ladies, And thy steps no more<eos> For gnarling sorrow has less power to bite The man that mocks at it and sets it light.
Oh, sweetie.<eos> What is it? What's-<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> I don't know why I'm being like this.<eos> - It is just nerves.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, I-I-I... I can't breathe.<eos> This dress is cutting off my circulation.<eos> Maybe I should just take it off for a minute.<eos> Yes, I'll take it off for a minute.
I got a draft, it's okay.<eos> I just don't know if it's working.<eos> How come?<eos> I just feel like something's missing.<eos> I wish I could have been there so I could really understand, you know?<eos> Good talk, Russ.<eos> Okay.<eos> This will help you.<eos> It's my diary. Volume four, ages 15 to 18.<eos> I used to tell everyone I didn't keep a diary but it's just because I didn't want anyone to find it.
- That's so sweet.<eos> Of course.<eos> - To Margot?<eos> Hey, you didn't wanna go to the box factory?<eos> No. We were there last week.<eos> You know, Dad and Clay had a hard time with their agency at first.<eos> I'm starting to think this was just one big bad idea.<eos> You're like that farmer guy out in the middle of nowhere who decided to build a baseball field in his backyard.<eos> Everyone told him he was crazy. But you know what?<eos> He built it anyway.

But you know what?<eos> He built it anyway.<eos> All because he heard a voice that said:<eos> "If you build it, he will come. "
Now I go back to prison.<eos> Can I please have an application?<eos> - Sure, of cour...<eos> They say I need ajob now that I'm on parole.<eos> I guess they didn't find your little speech as moving as I did.<eos> So, what do you say?<eos> I'll be the best employee ever.<eos> That position has been filled.<eos> I just watched you put up that sign.<eos> Well, now you can watch me take it down.
You know why I want to find the book so bad.<eos> It's not to save the world.<eos> I wanna save you.<eos> Aww fuck this bitch!<eos> Bro's before Hoes!<eos> Destroy the world,<eos> DESTROY THE WORLD!<eos> What just happened?<eos> The book doesn't control me, I control the book.<eos> I used my powers of pure evil to send it somewhere where no one will every find it.
I had to move past Bo!<eos> And if there's anyone else in this world that I should be able to love, it is Ciara.<eos> This just doesn't make any sense.<eos> Only you know what this all means.<eos> No. There's another.<eos> Hello? !<eos> Hi!<eos> Bo!<eos> That bracelet looks amazing on you.<eos> Well, I wear it all the time.
Ah! So, you just come in here in and you're dressed in your bracelet and you're trying to butter me up, you didn't send me a thank you card, by the way, I'm starting to feel used.<eos> You said it was from an admirer.<eos> You didn't even tell me-- You didn't even tell me who the hell you were.<eos> You're supposed to be some kind of detective.<eos> Just sayin'.<eos> Are you gonna give me that thing, or not?<eos> I don't give anything to anybody.<eos> But, I will sell it to you.<eos> How much?<eos> Well, for the Ash's errand girl, I'll put it on the Ash's tab.
Does Sergeant Wrigglesworth not encourage you to jog somewhere different every time?<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> So...do you have anything on the black box for me?<eos> Or should I...should I ask Tony Fossett?<eos> The tabloids' favourite phone hacker?<eos> Well, the man had to eat.<eos> And you were the one who put him out of a job at MI5.<eos> He said that you sacked him to cover up your own mistakes.<eos> Did he?<eos> And does he think it's funny bandying that stuff about when he's aware there's people who'll twist it against me?
in my press conference a few days ago.<eos> When one of the largest oil companies in the world flouts our nation's safety regulations and the terms of the company's agreement with the UK government, I believe that we have to act, and act together as a nation.<eos> You know, I was told today that the oil majors could buy and sell this country.<eos> Petrodollars are a powerful currency, there's no doubt.<eos> But we hold a stronger one in our democracy.<eos> We call it the vote.<eos> Tom... I'm sorry to disturb you.<eos> That drone strike.<eos> The Iranians say it was on their side of the border.<eos> They're treating it as an act of war.
This is our man.<eos> Just need to get our angles right and get the word from you, Prime Minister.<eos> Go.<eos> Is that an attempt to embroil me in this conspiracy?<eos> It's not as if it's your first.<eos> What is that? The rules of engagement for Bosnia.<eos> I did, by the way.<eos> That drone strike.<eos> The Iranians say it was on their side of the border.<eos> They're treating it as an act of war.
What if we have something more valuable to trade?<eos> This belonged to a Faerie Warrior.<eos> Surely, that is worth something.<eos> You stole Ciara's bracelet?<eos> She would have wanted to be buried with that.<eos> This is what she would have wanted.<eos> She fought and died for you, Dyson, for all the Fae.<eos> If they fall against the Garuda, her sacrifice means diddly squat.<eos> Genuine iridium.<eos> And the one who wore it had a gifted essence.
There's hope for you yet.<eos> So, study hard, and then maybe you and I can work out a deal.<eos> A deal for what?<eos> Some freedom.<eos> You know, get off the chain, get out of the house, get a girl.<eos> You're older now.<eos> I think that... you should have a taste of a woman real soon.<eos> I won't take the puzzles apart.<eos> I won't kill them.<eos> I give you a gift of knowledge and you fuck it away!
As a poison, cantarella is undetectable.<eos> If given a sufficient dosage, it will definitely be fatal.<eos> But the pope has tasters for his food, his wine.<eos> He does indeed.<eos> So one of us must seek employment as his taster.<eos> And be prepared to die for our cause.<eos> Is there one among us who is willing to die?<eos> To administer the poison?<eos> Taste the poison?<eos> Serve it to the Pope of Rome and share his fate?
What is this, Signore Machiavelli?<eos> God's children.<eos> Savonarola's vermin.<eos> I feel a sudden chill.<eos> Give up your vanities!<eos> Hell is eternal!<eos> So, we take a turd in our hand.<eos> Cigarro. Yes, cigarro.<eos> Then what?<eos> You put it in your mouth.
He has married well.<eos> We would advise you to follow the same path.<eos> What is that in your mouth?<eos> It's a cigarro.<eos> Not a turd?<eos> No!<eos> It smells like one.<eos> Not good.<eos> In fact, very bad.<eos> Is it true that the disease can eat its way to the brain and destroy it?
If angels can fall from Heaven into Hell then so can we all.<eos> Purify your soul!<eos> The demon waits to devour us.<eos> Then we must go wrestle with the demon.<eos> Burn in hell!<eos> Protect us!<eos> Damnation for you!<eos> Damnation!<eos> Are fulfilled the sayings of Isaiah...<eos> "They declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not-".
Let's ask him.<eos> We don't have enough to fingerprint him, sir.<eos> Well, we've got him lying about what time he got home.<eos> And the missing 90 minutes when he was less than 100 yards from Miranda Thornton's house.<eos> What about the bin?<eos> Emptied this morning.<eos> Unless we go through the dump. As we don't know what we're looking for...<eos> Hang on.<eos> He was looking round, like he was checking no-one was watching him.<eos> Takes it out of his pocket.

I respect that.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> This "X."<eos> Park the truck on it now.<eos> And what if I don't?<eos> Oh, it's your ass, not ours.<eos> Thanks for your help.<eos> Okay, so now they've got our truck and our plans to break in?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What happens if they don't drive it in?
She's doing OK.<eos> We've informed Monsieur le Curé.<eos> Yes, yes, very good.<eos> Poor little one.<eos> I could do nothing.<eos> Serge, Michaël and Bruno are dead.<eos> And I don't know where Gustave is.<eos> Why did you go on this outing without talking to me ?<eos> Monsieur Fournier didn't tell you ?<eos> I never authorised it at such a time.
They must have taken the keys with them.<eos> I'll get something to pik the lock.<eos> Come on, Fi.<eos> Come on, Fi. Fi, if you get this, call me back.<eos> She's not picking up, Sam.<eos> That's bad, Mike.<eos> That's real bad.<eos> Take a bathroom break, wash your face. And pull yourself together.<eos> Like good poker players spies know it's impossible to hide the tells<eos> if showing fear or concern, jeoperdizes a mission, you replace it with an emotion that won't.
Are you interested in his fiancé?<eos> Just find out, please.<eos> Fine, then.<eos> Anyway, Cats' album's startin' to get noticed, now.<eos> Let's cook up something with your show and sell 'em like hot pancakes!<eos> I'm sure it'II do well.<eos> Of course.<eos> Hey, Min-chuI!<eos> Did you Iike the house?<eos> Mother said she liked it.
You want a present?<eos> It's not another cigarette, is it?<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, you going to the dance tomorrow night?<eos> My sister probably won't let me.<eos> You always do everything your sister says?<eos> Where've you been?<eos> It's before curfew.<eos> - Want some gum?<eos> - An Australian gave it to you?
That's what I was laughing at, there's a flower on your hat.<eos> Have a look.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> 'We now had to wait to see if James had pipped me at the post.<eos> 'But either way, it didn't really matter 'because our three King's Lynn crocks 'had made it to the finishing line.<eos> 'And on the way, they'd wormed their way into our hearts.<eos> 'In short, on this glorious island, 'all of us, in our own way, had fallen a little bit in love.'<eos> This is the bet, 25 pounds.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who do I give it to?

If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that.<eos> If you want to replace your current coverage, all the better.<eos> Hey, you seem like a nice guy.<eos> Oh, he's not that nice.<eos> That's true. Mmm-hmm.<eos> That's very true.<eos> Okay, shut up.<eos> Have you decided?<eos> Yeah, I'll have the linguini, red sauce on the side.<eos> If the sauce does not come on the side, I will send it back.
I'm-I'm good, really. Did, um...<eos> Did you come in here To talk about something related to the case?<eos> Yeah. I came in for bomb site photos.<eos> I'm trying to find a way to this tek guy.<eos> Well, I will get out of your way<eos> And let you have at it.<eos> It's all yours.<eos> Heard you wanted evidence from the blast at the meth house.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Why don't we put it over there?
Bye. - huh.<eos> Oh, thanks, hon.<eos> That means a lot.<eos> - Aw, that was sweet.<eos> - Yeah, she didn't mean it, though.<eos> She wants to trust me. It's just not in her.<eos> She's always gonna freak out if I bathe him wrong Or feed him wrong or pretend he's a top hat. Hello, guvnor!<eos> Incoming.<eos> Forgot my purse.<eos> Always look out for the purse. They leave it behind like a little spy.
Jeremy?<eos> Hello. It's Jeremy.<eos> Since college entrance exams are over, I wanted to give all of you hard working students a happy song as a present to give you strength.<eos> That's why I here today.<eos> Yes.<eos> I lost 10 years of life.<eos> Now everyone, shall we hear Jeremy's song that you've been all waiting for?<eos> Looks like he selected a fun and happy song that's just like Jeremy.<eos> The title is nice: "Very Good Words"<eos> These very good words were so precious to me, that I held onto it dearly.
At least have the decency to strap yourself to a polygraph...<eos> –What if a spy for... –...so we know which lie is...<eos> –Have you thought about that? We don't have?<eos> Silence!<eos> Mr Shore, would you wrap it up, please, and quickly.<eos> –One last thought, judge.<eos> –Thank god.<eos> I'm going to skip over the whole section I had on earthquakes, and proceed right to the waste.<eos> These facilities will produce tons and tons and tons... And tons and tons of nuclear waste.<eos> Where should we store it?
Your future is blank.<eos> Naughty boy.<eos> You scared me.<eos> Will you ever grow up?<eos> Good morning.<eos> Good morning, Jamal.<eos> Coffee's ready.<eos> No, thanks. I have to go.<eos> What can you do when there is no justice or freedom?<eos> The individual has to fight for it.
If he fails to pace himself, his heart will explode!<eos> You want him dead?<eos> Damn!<eos> Let's go.<eos> So you should teach him right!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I won't bother you again.<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> Don't use bad words around him.<eos> He remembers every word and copies it later.
Peripherals are reduced.<eos> Is this why all pilots undergo such rigorous eye exams?<eos> - It is.<eos> - What is your vision, captain?<eos> Twenty-twenty.<eos> Are you familiar with a technique called the deep squeeze?<eos> I am not.<eos> Apparently, if you squeeze your eyes with your lids shut, it momentarily changes the shape of the eyeball.<eos> It gives you one second of twenty-twenty vision, enough time to read an eye chart.<eos> Are you familiar with the technique now that I've described it, captain?
Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying.<eos> I'm not selling anything.<eos> I'd just like to talk to you.<eos> Please.<eos> Just for a moment.<eos> Is this your child?<eos> - What of it?<eos> - May I ask where the father is?<eos> Murdered.<eos> If I'd got here sooner, I'd have cut the liver out of Jack McCall and hung it on a tree, Indian-style.
- In Wonder World?<eos> This place is as high-tech as NASA and Nintendo combined.<eos> They got a hidden room under this closed ride.<eos> I was in there.<eos> That's why they were chasing me.<eos> My men were pursuing Mr. Foley because he's delusionary and potentially dangerous.<eos> This room, delusionary also?<eos> No.<eos> There is a closed ride, which we use to...<eos> - I'd better take a look at it.
That will be tricky.<eos> What does he need to know?<eos> Nothing.<eos> He needs to know nothing.<eos> He's going to know nothing.<eos> I want a copy of the President's authorisation of this new action against the cartels.<eos> - You want what?<eos> - You heard me.<eos> He doesn't know about it.<eos> Let me explain it to you very simply.
He's not good.<eos> It's cancer.<eos> Terminal.<eos> - He's a good man.<eos> - The best.<eos> You a coffee drinker, Dr Ryan?<eos> - Yeah, I like coffee.<eos> - Try the Lindo brand.<eos> - Lindo?<eos> - l think you'll like it.
What do they do with children in India? Carry you around in a basket?<eos> How dare you talk to me with such disrespect!<eos> Nobody's going to carry you around Misslethwaite Manor.<eos> We've far too much work already.<eos> So you'll have to look after yourself.<eos> There are 100 rooms here.<eos> This one and no other is yours.<eos> Don't expect to see your uncle because it's certain you won't.<eos> You are not to touch anything, or to go wandering and poking about.<eos> The house seemed dead like a spell had been cast upon it.
So, as I was telling your partner, we found no evidence of kidnap.<eos> No phone call, no ransom note and since we didn't turn up a body...<eos> You assume she ran away.<eos> Well, it wouldn't be the first time Ruby Morris ran away from home.<eos> How do you explain what her mother saw?<eos> Well, I think that Darlene has a very active imagination.<eos> I've been listening to those stories since the first grade.<eos> So, basically, you ignored her statement.<eos> I included it in my report.<eos> But you didn't bother to check it out.
Orale.<eos> Can I talk to you, ese?<eos> Yeah, come here.<eos> You thinking of letting him in, ese7<eos> I told you he was my best crime partner.<eos> He ain't Mexican, ese.<eos> Orale.<eos> So, homes, how's that leg?<eos> Check it out, hard as a rock, ese.<eos> Shit, homes, throw some shellac on it!
I can't reach my card.<eos> Wait one minute.<eos> We're late for the party on the second floor.<eos> Push the goddamned buzzer, will you?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Anybody remember how to defeat an electronic key pad?<eos> Don't even joke about that, Martin.<eos> Those things are impossible.<eos> Think I'm joking?<eos> Looks like they just put it in.
Well, it's a very intriguing drama.<eos> But I don't have the time it would take to learn a part.<eos> Anyway, I'm not much of an actor.<eos> That's no problem.<eos> You wouldn't be playing a lead.<eos> It's a very small part.<eos> Only two lines.<eos> - Really?<eos> - It's the role of the butler.<eos> I'll think about it and let you know.
You've made yourself clear, sir.<eos> Don't put at risk everything you've worked for.<eos> Thank you.<eos> May I be excused now?<eos> - Who is it?<eos> - Lt Worf.<eos> Come in.<eos> I have the plan for deploying warning buoys around the null space.<eos> - Fine.<eos> I'll take a look at it later.
She thinks she's a coward.<eos> A coward?<eos> Not a girl like that.<eos> How long did you stay with him?<eos> Too long.<eos> Three years, seven months, six days.<eos> Thank you for the apple.<eos> Hi. I'm Iris Nepper.<eos> So glad you could come today.<eos> The house has some great possibilities. I think you'd like it.
You'll know.<eos> You'll understand. The music's very powerful.<eos> There's a band.<eos> People's reactions to opera the first time they see it is very dramatic.<eos> They either love it or they hate it.<eos> If they love it, they will always love it.<eos> If they don't they may learn to appreciate it, but it will never become part of their soul.<eos> Did you enjoy the opera, dear?<eos> Oh, it was so good I almost peed my pants. What?<eos> She said she liked it better than Pirates of Penzance.
You're such a heathen, Jezzie.<eos> How'd I ever get involved with such a fucking ninny?<eos> You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.<eos> Yeah? For what?<eos> A good lay.<eos> Look what I got--<eos> - The best. - The best.<eos> So what's in the bag?<eos> Pictures.<eos> Your wife was tossing them, so what's-his-name dropped it over before school.
As you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English Department retired last term.<eos> You will have the opportunity later to meet his replacement, Mr. John Keating, himself an honors graduate of this school. And who, for the past several years, has been teaching at the highly regarded Chester School in London.<eos> I'm glad you could come by.<eos> - Thrilling ceremony as usual, Dr. Nolan.<eos> - You've been away too long.<eos> - Hello, Dr. Nolan. - How've you been? - This is our youngest, Todd.<eos> - Mr. Anderson. You have some big shoes to fill, young man.<eos> Your brother was one of our finest. Thank you.<eos> - Lovely ceremony.<eos> - Thank you. I'm so glad you liked it.
- You do this with your spare time?<eos> - It's an incredible breakthrough.<eos> A psycho-reactive substance.<eos> It responds to emotional states.<eos> Mood slime?<eos> Oh, baby.<eos> This stuff actually feeds on bad vibes?<eos> - We're testing positive reactions.<eos> - What kind of test?<eos> We sing to it and talk to it and say supportive things to it.
- You just shouldn't have, that's all.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Breakfast.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - What is the joke? - Well, there's no joke.<eos> I just think I'm lookin' at a dead man, though.<eos> It seems everywhere I go I hear that same joke.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, something tells me you bring it on yourself.
Thank you.<eos> Dynamite, isn't it?<eos> Fantastic!<eos> Debby is a real little witch with that needle.<eos> See you next time, you little devil!<eos> - Hello, Mrs... - What?<eos> That.....<eos> Shit! That thing is still here.<eos> That son of a bitch.<eos> Here... You like it? It's yours.
I thought I learned some new spanish shit !"<eos> I went up to my friend: "Hey, Sanchez !<eos> Guni gugu !<eos> And Sanchez says: "Get the fuck outta here !"<eos> I've been walking around for years confused.<eos> And I finally figured out about your wife, where you met your wife.<eos> "You didn't meet your motherfucker wife on no camping trip !"<eos> "Your wife is a Bigfoot, isn't she, Gus ?"<eos> "Your wife is a Bigfoot, isn't she, that's why the bitch's mustache is so motherfucker thick !"<eos> "'Cos you shaved the bitch down and taught it to speak !"
"If he's a lizard," quips one doctor...<eos> "then we shouldn't spend hospital money feeding him...<eos> "but simply catch him some flies."<eos> We knew we had a good story this time... because it had everything in it.<eos> It had romance. It had suspense.<eos> This fellow Zelig, he grew up poor.<eos> My city editor said, " Ted...<eos> "we want this story on page one every day."<eos> In those days, you'd do anything to sell papers.<eos> To get a story, you'd jazz it up... you'd exaggerate, play with the truth.
The director and Otar Zedgenidze have the right.<eos> But they've called you! They have!<eos> Yes, but a phone call doesn't solve anything.<eos> I need a written authorization from above, with an appropriate resolution.<eos> Otar has signed it. There is a resolution!<eos> That's right.<eos> But there's no Murmanidze's signature.<eos> And the resolution is not valid without his signature.<eos> I've written several requests!<eos> All the bodies have approved it!
And what if I paid you a decent price?<eos> What currency would you prefer?<eos> Dollars?<eos> Pounds?<eos> Or maybe Thailand's bats?<eos> So you know where we hide our cash?<eos> That's why you sailed into the channel with so much assurance.<eos> Don't get any ideas, Captain.<eos> I had the crew put a can of gasoline in your cabin.<eos> The last one alive will set fire to it.
A convict does his fair share of work and he's not gonna have anything to worry about.<eos> But I know that that ain't been happening around here lately.<eos> And there ain't no crop in no field at no prison that I'm in charge of that's gonna die in the fields.<eos> The trusties will divide you up into work groups.<eos> You listen now.<eos> Give them trouble, and they've got my permission to see to it that the troublemaker is punished.<eos> Hard.<eos> Fair, but hard.<eos> I packed up all your personal things I could find.<eos> If I've missed anything or you have any mail, I'll take care of it.
It was described by François Leguat as having round masses of bone on each wing, enabling the cock birds to inflict damage on their rivals.<eos> Agostina must have been aware of the coincidence but never remarked on it.<eos> Agostina camped for 17 months without human contact in the Bar-She cave near Lake Te-Anin on South Island, New Zealand, where a colony of notorni, a ratite long believed to be extinct, had unexpectedly turned up in 1948.<eos> It was from this cave Agostina wrote out her theory of ratite revenge.<eos> Ousted by greed and ignorance on the part of man, the ratites were attempting a return to their former supremacy.<eos> They had perpetrated the Violent Unknown Event to transform man himself into a ratite.<eos> When her thesis was published, not by the WSPB who thought it ridiculous,<eos> Agostina was pilloried, and on a number of different levels.<eos> Her landlady sought a court order to get her out of her flat in Torquay, the paperboy burnt her newspapers, her grocer accused her of stealing egg powder and her publisher withheld royalties.<eos> Agostina began driving her Land Rover in circles on the Torbay beach until that too was forbidden by the police who impounded the vehicle to search it for pornography.
Why don't you listen to your friend Chauncey?<eos> This is a time to think of life.<eos> That's right, Mr. President.<eos> Now, you take care, Ben.<eos> And you take care, too, Bobby.<eos> He's a decent fellow, isn't he, the President?<eos> Yes. I'm glad he came.<eos> Kaufman, I'll need some information on Chauncey Gardiner's background.<eos> - Gardiner, yes, sir.<eos> - And I'd like it sometime today.
- (James ) Fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> - We left the cow on her feet.<eos> Where are the keys?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> About the car, Siegfried.<eos> There were these sheep, you see.<eos> You've damaged it, haven't you?<eos> Well... yes.<eos> What have you done to it?
Why don't you come in?<eos> It will do you good. Come on.<eos> All right.<eos> Good?<eos> Is the water too cold for you?<eos> No.<eos> - Have you ever seen fish mate?<eos> - No.<eos> Neither have I, but I can imagine how it's done.<eos> The male approaches the female and circles around it.
Well, this is the oak tree.<eos> This is where we landed.<eos> Well, it's not here now, is it?<eos> It's not programmed to auto-operate.<eos> There's a fail-safe. -Unless...<eos> -Unless what, Doctor?<eos> Of course, I know.<eos> You've still got a Tardis key, haven't you?<eos> I must've lost it.<eos> You haven't lost it.
Her name is Roni Parker.<eos> She was stabbed to death in Central Park, back in 1995.<eos> And you're saying this knife was used to do that?<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> You think I'm the one who killed her?<eos> That's impossible.<eos> How's that impossible?<eos> It's been awhile, but I'll never forget that knife.<eos> It was in the window of the hardware store, around the corner from my building.<eos> I had my eye on it for the longest time.
Please, I'll give a hoot.<eos> I'll never litter again.<eos> I'll keep all my trash.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - Dream conundrum.<eos> This is bad.<eos> What's going on?<eos> The bad memory is manifesting itself.<eos> It didn't want to be exposed.<eos> Our dream bullets don't hurt it.
It was third year of university, so it will have been the 5th of December, 1994.<eos> And where was Gordon supposed to meet you?<eos> I was living with my parents.<eos> I live there now.<eos> I moved back after my dad died.<eos> Next door but one to the warehouse!<eos> Did you know Gordon owned the warehouse?<eos> No!<eos> No, he never told me!<eos> What was he using it for?
Okay.<eos> Nachtner says, "Look.<eos> "The teeth, we don't know.<eos> "A sign from Hashem?<eos> Don't know.<eos> "Helping others?<eos> "Couldn't hurt. "<eos> No, no, but who put it there?<eos> Was it for him, Sussman?<eos> Or for whoever found it? Or for just...
Yeah, of course.<eos> Vince.<eos> - What?<eos> What a wonderful time to not disappear.<eos> Where were you last night honey?<eos> Friends.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Beach.<eos> Okay, here's what I'm thinking... take the pipe and we'll run it right through here.<eos> We angle it off, we chase the steps up the hill and tap it to the main line.
What if there were simpler explanations for the wanderers?<eos> There is.<eos> But it is so absurd, so old. That no one gives it any credit.<eos> What theory is that?<eos> Do you think of Aristarchus?<eos> Aristarchus maintained that the earth moves.<eos> The strange behavior of the wanderers was nothing more than an optical illusion caused by our movement in combination with Earth around the sun.<eos> - Heliocentric model.<eos> That's right.<eos> The sun would be in the center acting as speaking of it as "King of the Stars".
But where to go?<eos> He's always there.<eos> In my head.<eos> And I don't know where to go.<eos> Where to put yourself after it all.<eos> It's the same for everyone.<eos> Some of us have found an answer.<eos> He's killed a few Catholics in his time and now he's killing his own.<eos> Some protection thing to control the estate.<eos> Released after the Good Friday Agreement, he's on top of the world again, still living it, just like he always was, with his mates watching his back, breathing in the scent of his victories.
It's my fault.<eos> Crazy me.<eos> Nobody touches this computer until it goes on display tomorrow.<eos> We are being watched, people!<eos> We can't screw this up!<eos> Calm and collected. Calm and collected.<eos> Hmm. Such ne'er-do-wells we have here.<eos> Emmett, I want you to stand guard tonight.<eos> Nobody gets close to this laptop, got it?<eos> Affirmative, Michael. Barclay and the Beverly Hills boys will be gunning for it.
Oh, Thomas.<eos> I have a fascinating article upstairs, translated from the Russian, concerning a physician named Ivan Pavlov.<eos> He has found that if one rings a bell every time a dog is fed, the dog will begin to salivate at the very sound of the bell.<eos> You are most instructive, as always, Miss Lane.<eos> If a person has been habitually bullied, Thomas, it will not take much to make them quake and cower.<eos> You should not blame yourself.<eos> But perhaps you... should learn to tread a little lighter.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> The farmer's son was going to kill it, but I says, "I'll buy that little piglet cos there's some children "I know with the name o' Arless, that'll feed it up "till it's the biggest porker you ever saw."
I can't do that. I don't know where I'm going to be in three years.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, then, let's just keep Looking.<eos> VIOLA: Didn't this place use to be the Hump Bar?<eos> You know what? I'm not going to answer that question anymore.<eos> It always costs me money.<eos> Mmm-mmm-mmm. -What a shame.<eos> -What?<eos> This place. Don't you hate what they did to it?
Nothing.<eos> You paused, something came to mind?<eos> Captain Wu saw the telegram.<eos> Go on.<eos> When I handed the telegraph to Chief Jin,<eos> Captain Wu was with him.<eos> Normally...<eos> A classified telegram would be eyes-only for the officer in charge<eos> But that day... when I delivered it to Chief Jin,<eos> Captain Wu didn't look away. He actually glanced at it briefly.
No.<eos> The battery's gone.<eos> You weren't kidding about the Hail Mary.<eos> Do we have any food?<eos> There's MREs in my gear bag.<eos> Well, did you move it?<eos> It was right there.<eos> Maybe it got knocked into the water. You don't think it took it, do you?<eos> What, the squid?<eos> After the shock we gave it, highly unlikely.
And decided to take out the trash.<eos> BECKETT: Mr. DePetro, I can understand the instinct of protection.<eos> If I had a sister, and her husband was cheating on her, - I'd want to set him straight, too.<eos> - That's not why I left the message.<eos> Did you know that Sam was cheating on Helen?<eos> Not until she called me last night and told me he'd been killed.<eos> Then what did you mean when you said, - "I won't let you get away with this"?<eos> - He owed me money.<eos> So, Sam borrowed money from you? Twenty Gs.<eos> He needed it to cover the mortgage.
I saw a flying object.<eos> It flew from here to there with a "whew" sound.<eos> Can you describe the object in more detail?<eos> That object could really fly!<eos> Though it wobbled a bit.<eos> I suspect it had crashed before.<eos> Crashed?<eos> Yes, like a car crash.<eos> It might have been broken.<eos> I took a picture of it.
Did Self talk about shutting us down?<eos> Let's just concentrate on finding Scylla, all right?<eos> Alex.<eos> Where's he going?<eos> Who cares?<eos> We don't even know where to start.<eos> Where's the rest of the stuff you found?<eos> Still printing it up.<eos> When my device was in Tuxhorn's house it must've been left next to his PDA.<eos> Sucked up all the data from it and got e-mails and photos.
...are you, uh, glad I am back?<eos> What do you think?<eos> It must have been hell for you.<eos> Must have been so lonely.<eos> You know, I'd understand if, uh, you partied some while I was gone.<eos> I want you to know that.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I was a good girl.<eos> I went to this store in dallas and bought a dildo.<eos> I wrote your name on it with a marker.
It's all shut up.<eos> They gave me painkillers.<eos> - Where's Perry?<eos> We gotta find him.<eos> - Perry's coming by here.<eos> I'm working a party on Sunset Plaza.<eos> Remember you said the killer may have been at Dexter's party?<eos> - Well, that whole bunch is here tonight.<eos> - Honey, put me on the list, I'll drop by.<eos> I'll see if I can stir up the kettle, stick out my hat, see if anyone shoots at it.
Thank you, Agent Fuller.<eos> Come on, Regis, let's get you up.<eos> Thanks, Gracie.<eos> And as a special treat for knocking my husband around I have a little surprise for you.<eos> I think you know these people.<eos> Here's Cheryl Frazier, Miss United States, and Stan Fields, host of the pageant.<eos> It's you!<eos> -l love your lipstick.<eos> -You do? Stila made it for me.<eos> -They named it after me. lt's called Gracie.
I don't have a part, sir.<eos> That's it. Like my old granddaddy used to always say, "The less a man makes declarative statements, the less apt he is to look foolish in retrospect."<eos> - That's quite brilliant, sir.<eos> - Ah, thank you, thank you, thank you.<eos> Thing is, there are some inherent obstacles in this undertaking. Aside from the obvious.<eos> First of which is being the fact that I'm not like Peter Lorre on that TV show.<eos> I'm not some sick fuck travelin' the countryside collecting fingers.<eos> All right, you know, we're all buddies here. No one wants Norman to lose his finger.<eos> We just want to chop it off.<eos> You know, if fate doesn't smile on old Norman, we'll put that fucker on ice, whisk it right to the hospital, where in all likelihood they'll be able to sew it right back on. Well, hopefully, sir.
Your hunch was right.<eos> Too bad the evil queen of numbers wouldn't let you play it.<eos> - You were saying?<eos> - No, no. I was just... just...<eos> Good. Because if I want sarcasm, I'll talk to my children, thank you very much.<eos> - Good evening, 007.<eos> - Good evening, M.<eos> The prime minister's waiting for an update.<eos> Proceed with your briefing, Mr Tanner.<eos> Thank you. Yes, after the distress signal, your helicopter took off and the Russians had three MiGs intercept it.
I don't need to remind you that it's treason for you to be hiding something from me, no matter how sensitive.<eos> For both of us.<eos> Whatever the MFA may prefer, this case is in Section 9's jurisdiction.<eos> But we wouldn't mind cooperating if there was good reason to.<eos> Dr. Willis?<eos> Confirmed.<eos> It's definitely him.<eos> "Him?"<eos> He's referring to the original ghost block within the shell.<eos> Its sex remains undetermined, and the use of the term "he" is merely a nickname the good doctor has given it.
Animals are worshipped in many cultures.<eos> That smaller symbol could represent Korgano.<eos> Ihat and the old man said Korgano was the only one who could control Masaka.<eos> Many ritualistic cultures incorporate the idea of balance into their belief systems.<eos> Now, Masaka is a queen.<eos> A powerful, godlike figure.<eos> It's not unrealistic to believe that she might have a counterpart, a consort.<eos> Look around, see if you can see that horn-like symbol anywhere else.<eos> This is the most prominent instance of the horn symbol.<eos> Now it appears as though Masaka's sun is chasing it.
You'll find him trapped in cargo bay four.<eos> Consider it my gift to you.<eos> Oh, my apologies.<eos> We'll see you there.<eos> Kira out.<eos> Well done.<eos> You certainly fooled her, didn't you, Constable?<eos> We're running out of time, Doctor.<eos> I've just about finished. I've set up an ionic interference signal in cargo bay four, calibrated to lock onto the resonance frequencies of the telepathic field and drive it out of all those affected.<eos> And what will happen to it then?
I am Catwoman hear me roar.<eos> I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.<eos> Good time.<eos> Everyone but the bandits'll be slacking off till after the New Year.<eos> I'm not sure I like the inference.<eos> I didn't realize I made one.<eos> I'm pushing this power plant now because it'll cost more later.<eos> A million saved is a million earned.<eos> I commissioned this report.<eos> Take a look at it.
I do not understand our values.<eos> By the way, speaking of American values, aren't we about due to start bombing some small country that only has a marginally effective air force?<eos> Seems to me like we're a couple of weeks overdue to drop high explosives on helpless civilians, people who have no argument with us whatsoever.<eos> I think we ought to be out there doing what we do best, gang, making large holes in other people's countries.<eos> I hate to be repetitious, but we are a warlike lot.<eos> We can't stand not to be fucking with somebody.<eos> We couldn't wait for that cold war to be over, could we?<eos> Couldn't wait for that cold war to be over so we could go and play with our toys in the sand.<eos> Go play with our toys in the sand.<eos> And when we're not invading some sovereign nation or setting it on fire from the air, which is more fun for a Nintendo pilot, then... then we're usually declaring war on something here at home.
But I can't help feeling I'm taking something from her, something precious, a part of childhood she'll never have again.<eos> Well, I'm not sure about that.<eos> I was just telling Clara about my imaginary friend.<eos> You have an imaginary friend?<eos> A Tarkassian razorbeast.<eos> It protected me.<eos> I knew as long as that razorbeast was around, nothing could hurt me.<eos> Over the years, his body kind of faded away, but the idea stayed.<eos> I don't seem to talk to him as often.<eos> - You still talk to it?
Why do I have to go?<eos> I like it here.<eos> - I feel safe here.<eos> - American 357.<eos> Why can't I stay?<eos> Definitely U.S. Air.<eos> Excellent airline. Flight 202 from Baltimore.<eos> There's a nice young man coming here to take you to find you an apartment and a job.<eos> You're looking forward to that, aren't you?<eos> He's afraid he'll see his girlfriend and won't be able to get it up.
Bubbly, thick, stagnant sound.<eos> A sound you could smell.<eos> This man worked for the carnival, you dig?<eos> And to start with it was like a novelty ventriloquist act.<eos> After a while, the ass started talking on its own.<eos> He would go in without anything prepared and his ass would ad-lib and toss the gags back at him every time.<eos> Then it developed sort of teeth like little raspy incurving hooks and started eating.<eos> He thought this was cute at first and built an act around it... but the asshole would eat its way through his pants and start talking on the street shouting out it wanted equal rights.<eos> It would get drunk, too, and have crying jags.<eos> Nobody loved it. And it wanted to be kissed, same as any other mouth.
We're missing a very important prop.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm having trouble.<eos> Well, just flick it.<eos> Now, what exactly did you need to find?<eos> - Lana?<eos> - Oh, did I do that?<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> Well, now, I don't know the exact technical name for it, but...<eos> Does anything...? Does anything in here look like it?
What'd I tell you?<eos> It's funny... I don't desire her.<eos> How come I don't desire her?<eos> It's the first time.<eos> We don't always have to screw.<eos> We're fine like this, in our little hideaway.<eos> I'm thinking of your ass.<eos> What'll it say if we ignore it?<eos> It'll sulk a bit, that's for sure.<eos> I'll explain things to it, say " it's not serious, you have to let up now and then".
We'll be eating the number one selling food In the rest of america.<eos> - What it is?<eos> - All right! Cheesy blasters. ?<eos> You take a hot dog Stuff it with some jack cheese Fold it in a pizza ? ? You got cheesy blasters ?<eos> And then all the kids say, "thanks, meat cat."<eos> And then meat cat flies away on his, um, skateboard.<eos> I can't eat this.<eos> I'm a foodie.<eos> These cheesy blasters are here to teach us a lesson.<eos> The economy is struggling and your parent company is struggling with it why?
I can't.<eos> The man is incorruptible.<eos> He was impervious to the charms of the nympho coed charlene larue.<eos> Guide me.<eos> Tell me what to do...<eos> Nixon.<eos> May i come in, kenneth?<eos> Of course, sir.<eos> Would you like something to eat?<eos> I have some leftover turtle meat from dinner. Or as you would call it, "bonus" turtle meat.
Uh, just, I remember the images... But I-I just can't put them together.<eos> But you remember how you felt about her?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> - You have to find her, Bryce.<eos> - How?<eos> She could be anywhere.<eos> Well, look at your paintings. Look at her. It's Japan.<eos> It has to be. Do you have any idea how many people live in Japan?<eos> You could put your story up on Mosaic.<eos> Even if she doesn't see it, someone she knows might.
So, tell me about your ability.<eos> I have an ability, too.<eos> I am the master of time and space.<eos> Well, I was.<eos> Lately, time and space has been the master of me. Oh.<eos> Is that my brain scan?<eos> No. Mine.<eos> I see sounds.<eos> They make colors.<eos> A new ability can be frightening, but you must not turn away from it.
South side of crossover drive.<eos> Adult male disrupting traffic.<eos> Possible psych 5150.<eos> Hey, sir?<eos> Hey, uh, sir.<eos> I'm a paramedic.<eos> You mind conducting the orchestra across the street?<eos> All right?<eos> Looked like you were playing some good music out there.<eos> Oh, you heard it too?
she didn't go through an agency.<eos> she was dropped off anonymously at a church.<eos> hospitals and churches are safe havens.<eos> you can drop a baby off, no questions asked.<eos> child protection services would look for the closest relative.<eos> another search that ends at the state line.<eos> and if cps doesn't find one, the baby will go into foster care, which is what happened to lisa.<eos> she was lucky. the adoption process happened within a month.<eos> so, this unsub had the opportunity to make money off this infant.<eos> he doesn't, drops it off at a church because he knows the state will take good care of it.
I see what happens.<eos> You'll see what happens?<eos> I will record what happens.<eos> I'll keep shooting and see what happens while you are away.<eos> Ok and you'll stay here alone with this thing?<eos> I want you to be cautelozo, Thomas.<eos> You know where you're getting into?<eos> I know, Mom, but ...<eos> Whatever this thing is, it does not seem interested in me.<eos> And that seems to be interested in it, which is another reason for you leave here.
Thank you.<eos> -Hi. Come, I'll take you home.<eos> I brought you some biscuits your favorites.<eos> So why you come over?<eos> When I called and you didn't come to phone, I spoke with your roommate... It sounds that you may need me.<eos> Daughters do need their mothers, occasionally.<eos> Mommy, why have we never done Sandrine's grave?<eos> Sandrine was cremated.<eos> Wait, this is not the point.<eos> I just ... I know, I just thought, know, we could go to her grave the pull weeds and took out around, would sit and would talk about it, and would tell stories, would laugh and crying and then we would understand each other.
And I hadn't had a reason to laugh in a Iong time.<eos> Well, this is it.<eos> This is who I am.<eos> You own this place?<eos> Whose name do you see up there in the lights?<eos> Started it up with a grand and a prayer.<eos> That is so cool.<eos> Are these your designs?<eos> Art don't belong to anybody.<eos> We are merely the fortunate vessels that channel it.
You seen the art?<eos> Yeah. Good stuff.<eos> Listen, got a complaint about a story you wrote a couple weeks ago.<eos> The woman who died from an allergic reaction to seafood.<eos> - Remember?<eos> - What about it?<eos> Lady knows the dead woman sister says our story made a lot of money for those kids.<eos> - A scholarship fund we wrote up.<eos> - So?<eos> She says the sister has a history of fraud, convictions on it.
Thanks for coming so quickly.<eos> How is it going? Great thanks.<eos> And you?<eos> Busy as always, you know what it's like.<eos> Please, take a seat.<eos> How's your wife?<eos> I haven't seen her for ages.<eos> She's very well.<eos> They just published a translation of Pereira's book on globalization.<eos> She fought for it, and it's a bit hit.
- Hey, Josey!<eos> Show us your tits!<eos> Don't look at me, Hank!<eos> I'm not the one can't control his family.<eos> Listen...<eos> No.<eos> Rules say she gets to talk.<eos> You can have the gavel next, but right now she's got it.<eos> - I'll take it next and...<eos> - All right, but she's got it!
Show us your tits!<eos> Don't look at me, Hank!<eos> I'm not the one can't control his family.<eos> Listen...<eos> No.<eos> Rules say she gets to talk.<eos> You can have the gavel next, but right now she's got it.<eos> - I'll take it next and...<eos> - All right, but she's got it!<eos> She's got it.
- O'Malley!<eos> Let me finish.<eos> You're wrong, sir.<eos> Now you can fire me, you know, or just bring me up on disciplinary action, or whatever.<eos> - But I'm telling you, Joe deserves our...<eos> - Deserves our help.<eos> Couldn't help yourself, could you?<eos> Whether or not it'd win you any points, even from me.<eos> I signed your request.<eos> Give it to Patricia. She'll know what to do with it.
A path can be traced from Manhattan to French Polynesia, and nucleartests sites.<eos> Dr. Tapadopoulos believes the creature may be nesting, using Manhattan as ground zero to cultivate the species.<eos> The military has been unable ...<eos> - You went to the Press with this?<eos> - No.<eos> - They mentioned you by name! - Yeah.<eos> - You gave them the tape?<eos> - No, it's in my tent.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> She took it.
Since Chappaquiddick.<eos> He wanted dirt on Kennedy. Colson brought him in.<eos> You know Hunt, sir?<eos> Yeah, on the list of horribles.<eos> I know what he is and I know what he tracks back to.<eos> He was involved in the plumbers? Oh, definitely.<eos> Colson had him break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace to plant McGovern's campaign literature.<eos> I had nothing to do with that.<eos> He was in this Ellsberg thing too?<eos> Yes. You approved it, sir.
I wish I could say the same, lass.<eos> Major Sharpe.<eos> Sir.<eos> Button your tunic, Harper.<eos> What's that you've got there?<eos> Oh, this?<eos> It's just another sword, sir.<eos> I found it... lying around.<eos> Someone host it. I found it.<eos> Why don't you have it?
What do you mean? I'm just an actress.<eos> The bakeries are working!<eos> Yes, but you're not a baker.<eos> You don't sell pies.<eos> You sell your soul.<eos> I personally will judge those who sell their soul.<eos> First, I'll kill the manager of your theatre.<eos> I'll strangle him with my bare hands... because I love the theatre!<eos> Congratulations, Mr. Blacky!<eos> Will this dinner eat us before we eat it?
Are you crazy?<eos> Yeah, good question.<eos> Look, this is haiku poetry.<eos> Haiku poetry contains only seventeen syllables per poem.<eos> That ain't a lot syllables.<eos> Don't skip any. Get out of my sight.<eos> My daughter is in your class.<eos> I mean, in the class that you're substituting for.<eos> My wife and I, we run a small printing shop.<eos> Actually she runs it.
I had to sleep in my car.<eos> Do you have a few bucks?<eos> It would really help me out.<eos> Give me your address, I'll mail it back.<eos> Honest.<eos> -Let me see your driver's license.<eos> -What for?<eos> It'll have your address on it.<eos> -l don't have a license.<eos> -You drove all the way without it?
Talk with a man out at a window.<eos> - A proper saying!<eos> Sweet Hero!<eos> She is wronged, she is slandered.<eos> - She is undone!<eos> - Beatrice!<eos> He is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it.<eos> I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.<eos> By this hand, I love thee.<eos> Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.
- I have very bad itch.<eos> How long ago did it start?<eos> A few weeks, almost one month ago.<eos> - Where?<eos> - On my feet and arms.<eos> - When is it worse?<eos> - At night, above all at night.<eos> Your skin is a little dry, let's see.<eos> Yes.<eos> Hold it.
Dr Julian Bashir, Chief Medical Officer, Deep Space Nine.<eos> - And you are Commander...?<eos> - Data.<eos> Cmdr Data.<eos> - The synthetic life form.<eos> - Yes.<eos> An honour to meet you.<eos> I've heard so much about you.<eos> You must have a fascinating perspective into cybernetic research.<eos> I'd be delighted to discuss it.
So, what brings you to the library?<eos> I'm doing research on civil disobedience.<eos> Good for you. lt is incumbent on the young to disobey.<eos> Are you a professor?<eos> Well, I teach, poetry is my area of expertise.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> You know, someone sent me a poem, maybe you know it.<eos> Oh, perhaps I do.<eos> Now, let's have a look.<eos> You read it.
Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure?<eos> Just as you specified.<eos> Is that coincidence?<eos> She's real. I dreamt about her before I even went to Rekall.<eos> Mr. Quaid. Can you hear yourself?<eos> She's real because you dreamed her?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Maybe this will convince you.<eos> Would you mind opening the door?<eos> - You open it.
AAH! OH, MY GOD!<eos> STAY AWAY FROM ME!<eos> NO!<eos> GET AWAY FROM ME!<eos> TAKE ME, LOGAN!<eos> I'M BURNING WITH DESIRE!<eos> SO MUCH FOR BURNING DESIRE.<eos> TO MARGARET... MAY SHE REST IN PEACE.<eos> I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER GET OVER HER DEATH. I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER GET OVER HER DEATH.<eos> IN FACT, I NEVER THOUGHT SHE'D GET OVER IT, EITHER.
- Doctor of what?<eos> - Zoology.<eos> - You?<eos> - Law.<eos> - We have to watch that guy.<eos> - Hyena?<eos> He's a coward. If you're taller than him, he'll keep his distance.<eos> But if you lie down he'll sneak up and take a chunk out of your leg.<eos> Take first watch.<eos> Call me when the moon gets there I'll take it to there, then you take it to first light.
This is not the god of Sha Ka Ree, or any other god.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Reveal yourself to me.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Don't you like this face?<eos> I have so many, but this one suits you best.<eos> No, it's not possible.<eos> - Bring me the ship or I will destroy you.<eos> - The ship.<eos> Bring it closer so that I might join with it.
Why did you kill him?<eos> - I didn't kill him.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> - What do you want from me?<eos> [PANTING]<eos> Huh?<eos> Look familiar?<eos> - Where did you get that?<eos> - In your suitcase.<eos> So you have it.
- I will have you compelled to testify.<eos> - I will find you in contempt of court.<eos> - I cannot be compelled.<eos> - You are not above the law!<eos> If you persist in this, I will call a mistrial.<eos> Were you the federal prosecutor on the United States vs Cook trial?<eos> This trial is a mistrial.<eos> And did you conspire with District Court Judge Lowell to dismiss that case in exchange for his promotion and your appointment to the seat you now hold?<eos> Did you wait 17 years while lesser men got appointments to a higher court?<eos> And, when an appointment to Circuit Court finally came, did your past come to haunt you and did you strike it down and kill it?
- Now, wait just a minute, Dad.<eos> - Well, sure.<eos> Now what's worth doing is worth doing for money.<eos> It's a bad bargain if nobody gains.<eos> And if we do this deal, everybody gains.<eos> Course, my son did work as a baggage handler... and freight loader for three summers.<eos> With those qualifications, why should we doubt his ability to run an airline?<eos> You don't want us, stay with the scum in present management... dedicated to running you and your airline into the ground.<eos> That scum built the company up with one plane in 30 years... and made something out of nothing.<eos> If that's a scum, I'll take it over a rat any day.
You do like to change things, don't you?<eos> For the better, I hope.<eos> I want my Kikuyu to learn to read.<eos> My Kikuyu. My Limoges. My farm.<eos> It's an awful lot to own, isn't it?<eos> I've paid a price for all I own.<eos> What is it exactly that's yours?<eos> We're not owners here, we're just passing through.<eos> Is life really so damn simple for you?<eos> Perhaps I ask less of it than you do.
Bulic, get your people out of here.<eos> Clear the airlock.<eos> You too, Turlough.<eos> -But Tegan...<eos> -Get out!<eos> -You go as well, Doctor.<eos> -I'm not leaving you.<eos> -There's no point in us both dying.<eos> -Who's talking about dying?<eos> The creature's in, sir, and our weapons are useless against it.
I am sorry.<eos> What is the matter?<eos> What is wrong?<eos> I cannot.<eos> Here.<eos> In that car.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I hate that car.<eos> You care more about it than you care about me.
A lot of ketchup.<eos> You like pepper, sir?<eos> How'd you guess?<eos> Oh, lots of pepper.<eos> One hamburger, raw. Alright.<eos> Hey, this hamburger stinks. Stinks sir?<eos> That's impossible.<eos> The meat's our freshest, it's still alive!<eos> - Oh yeah? - Yeah.<eos> Then you eat it.
More than you can ever imagine.<eos> You could be out of business.<eos> You know, I've misjudged you.<eos> You're not stupid. You're crazy.<eos> You think you caused an inconvenience?<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> Why don't you go home and polish your badge?<eos> You're dealing with grownups here.<eos> You're out of your league.<eos> Whoever sent that shipment will be mad that you lost it.
No, sir, it is my job to reform a prison.<eos> I'm not here to work for a political party...<eos> - ...or the state or a governor.<eos> - May I butt in a second?<eos> Let the record show that State Senator Charles Hite desires to comment.<eos> Mr. Brubaker, I think you owe it to yourself to face some hard facts.<eos> The people in this state have got themselves a whole lot of problems getting jobs, paying rent, insurance premiums.<eos> Now, come election time, they might vote for your prison-reform thing but that's just a reflex.<eos> They don't want to hear their taxes are being raised to take care of murderers and rapists.<eos> That farm wasn't costing anybody anything before you got your hands on it.
Inspector Hornung.<eos> - Would you like some champagne?<eos> - No, I don't drink.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Family?<eos> According to my father, one of them is deliberately trying to ruin the company.<eos> And when my father got in his or her way, my father was murdered.<eos> And whoever it was tried to murder me, too.<eos> You said you played the tape?<eos> The late Mr Roffe's secretary, this Miss Kate Erling, she heard it, too?
One rose a month! That's all she hears from him.<eos> It's like dying once a month.<eos> Am I right?<eos> We should also like to express our surprise that you are interpreting the quality standards contrary to the terms of the contract.<eos> We hope you will reconsider your position without delay and amend it to comply with the agreement.<eos> Failing this, we will be obliged, etc., etc.<eos> To place the matter in the hands of our legal department.<eos> Mrs. Ehmke, don't drive me crazy.<eos> We've included that sentence at least a hundred times.<eos> If I don't dictate it, you don't have to repeat it.
Yeah, we know. We were watching.<eos> And he killed DiMarco.<eos> They were partners.<eos> They were planning to split the reward money, but Mikel got greedy.<eos> Nice work, Detective.<eos> Former detective.<eos> Former former detective.<eos> Former former former detective.<eos> Are you turning in your badge?<eos> He has it.
- Do you have a point, Lieutenant?<eos> - As a matter of fact, I do.<eos> If you have nothing to hide I want you to open your books to me.<eos> Sure, you can see Lofton's employee files.<eos> But other than that, everything's confidential.<eos> That's a 5,000-gallon water tank.<eos> Well, we're running out of evidence.<eos> Where else do you suggest we look?<eos> We know that the killer was up on the balcony.<eos> Yeah, when the body falls, the evidence falls with it.
- Make it possible.<eos> Why so cross, Alined?<eos> Anyone would think you didn't want peace? But of course I do.<eos> Peace...<eos> love it.<eos> Well, you may return any time to view the treaty.<eos> You're very kind.<eos> - We may return, too?<eos> - You are always welcome.<eos> My heart will remain, and I hope to join it soon.
- A baby crying.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Do you hear that?<eos> What?<eos> The baby.<eos> Hey there, little man.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I think I've just seen Nathan stealing a baby.<eos> He just ran off with it.
He's the source.<eos> He gave us his soul.<eos> We are him.<eos> Load the cannon.<eos> Stop!<eos> You'll destroy the talisman.<eos> It's too late.<eos> Quick, quick get in.<eos> We need to take the talisman above the machine.<eos> It can be used against it.
And how you take it is important to me.<eos> I've asked Gary to move in with us.<eos> For real.<eos> Not just a couple nights a week or whatever.<eos> I know it's only been a little while, but it just feels so different this time, you know?<eos> Yeah, it is different this time.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Some people live for their pain.<eos> It's all they've got.<eos> They stay up with it.
In the kitchen.<eos> Remember how Dad used to always freak Mom out and tell her all those stories?<eos> Yeah, I remember.<eos> Like there was an owl living in the attic.<eos> There was an owl up there.<eos> -Come on.<eos> -What?<eos> -A real owl?<eos> -A real owl.<eos> You think it's gone too?
Why do you always have to fight?<eos> Asshole!<eos> You hit like your fucking boyfriend.<eos> I didn't fucking do anything!<eos> This is bullshit!<eos> He fucking started it!<eos> Watch your mouth!<eos> This is the second time today I've had to deal with this nonsense from you.<eos> I will not tolerate this barbaric behavior are you fucking blind?<eos> He started it!
You must have a name, hm?<eos> - Von Allmen.<eos> - What was that?<eos> Von Allmen.<eos> It looks sinister - the mountain.<eos> Don't you think so?<eos> It is sinister.<eos> Do you know the legend of the giant ogre?<eos> What's the guy's name?<eos> The mountain is named after it. Eiger.
If we're gonna make it anywhere in this world, we got to stand up for ourselves.<eos> This Cornelius and his dad can't be all that bad.<eos> No one's that mean.<eos> When Cornelius was five, his mother gave him one of them clockwork toys.<eos> He loved it.<eos> He was always playing with it, always winding it up.<eos> His father stomped on it.<eos> He just crushed it.<eos> Then there was the time when little Cornelius found a baby chick.<eos> Called it Pappy, fed it, you know, took a shine to it.
I'm a size 8.<eos> What would we do if we see a grizzly bear?<eos> You know, any kind of bear.<eos> Well, most people would run, which would be the worst thing you could do.<eos> - I'd run.<eos> - You never try to outrun a bear, son.<eos> They can run between 30 and 35 miles per hour<eos> I don't have to outrun the bear. I'd just have to outrun you!<eos> So... uh... what do you do if you see a bear?<eos> If you spot a bear and he's not seen you yet, you quickly and quietly get away from it.
Gardens don't grow the way they should.<eos> Never have.<eos> - How do you stay in contact with others?<eos> - I don't.<eos> How would you know if something were to happen? Like a world event?<eos> Mrs. Jones, something's happened along the East Coast.<eos> Whatever it is that you think is so important that you need to tell me, don't.<eos> Just keep it to yourself.<eos> The world don't care about me.<eos> I don't care about it.
Once, I too had ambitions.<eos> Not your grand ones.<eos> Simple ambitions.<eos> Marriage, children and a house of our own.<eos> He died.<eos> In the mud in France.<eos> A good, solid man.<eos> You would call him dull, no doubt, but he smiled whenever he saw me, and we could've built a life on that.<eos> Your heart knows the truth, Delysia.<eos> Trust it, for life is short.
She's so angry about the necklace I left, but I slipped a letter under her door the day before I died.<eos> It explained everything.<eos> But there was carpeting in the entryway.<eos> I didn't know the letter went under the carpet.<eos> She never got it.<eos> My God, you're boring, aren't you?<eos> My little boy has a stuffed animal, a squirrel.<eos> It was his favorite.<eos> He took it everywhere.<eos> Couldn't get to sleep without it.
This crackhead won't let us near this thing.<eos> She's up to her elbows in it.<eos> She's verifying.<eos> She's what?<eos> Verifying.<eos> She's verifying.<eos> Just let her do her thing.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Give me your goddamn radio.<eos> Sterling, it's not it!
I may not do it your way, but it gets done.<eos> So whatever else you got, bring it on.<eos> Okay, Dr. Grey, now that you've drained the organ, we can attempt to repair it.<eos> Now my day is perfect.<eos> I appreciate this.<eos> The chance to scrub in on this kind of procedure is, well -- yeah, I appreciate it.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Triple espresso, not too hot.<eos> Oh, I love you, seriously.<eos> Ah, coffee -- where would medicine be without it, huh?
Are they really that important?<eos> They got the most precious commodity.<eos> And I'm his waste them all.<eos> That's the general idea.<eos> I guess it could be fun.<eos> Malachi, this is a serious business, and not to be entered into likely.<eos> Alright.<eos> So how does it work?<eos> Within each first there is a desire we hold so deep, we may not even be aware of it.<eos> The desire is so strong that if we gave in to it, it would take control of our very being.
I am going to kill her.<eos> I'm going to hunt that bitch down and destroy her!<eos> Be my guest.<eos> She stabbed me!<eos> Right here, with that sacred blade!<eos> I'm lucky to be alive!<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You're growing stronger, Malachi.<eos> More powerful than they ever could have been anticipated.<eos> As you ill feelings grows... you grow with it.
Excuse me.<eos> Admiral, I'm questioning a former Marine who was a POW in Vietnam.<eos> Dong Ha, to be exact.<eos> He says a murder took place back there.<eos> Dong Ha?<eos> - This is news.<eos> - I would agree, sir.<eos> What's this about a civilian homicide?<eos> A Vietnamese man was found dead in Georgetown this morning.<eos> He says he did it.
Closest I ever came was Bambi.<eos> - Bambi?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My ex was a big hunter.<eos> He was always going off with his buddies, so I said to him one time, "Take me."<eos> After some complaining, he did.<eos> So I got out there in the forest with this big hunky shotgun and I fired at a deer.<eos> Hit it dead-on.<eos> So I went over to this thing and I leaned down, and this deer looked up at me with these eyes these eyes like flashlights.<eos> I knelt beside it and I held its head and I whispered, "I'm sorry."
Now you hold it.<eos> I protect them, Kenshiro.<eos> Meanwhile protect yourself.<eos> Kenshiro, my friend.<eos> - Julia.<eos> Playing soldier?<eos> I'm not playing.<eos> The world needs a leader.<eos> - Did it choose you?<eos> - l chose it.
Say, pard.<eos> You seen old Dave Tutt today?<eos> I sure have.<eos> He's right over across the way.<eos> Tell me, friend, is he wearing my watch?<eos> I really couldn't say.<eos> By God, Bill, I'm glad to see you could make it out today.<eos> You know, this ain't about no timepiece, Bill.<eos> You know it... and I know it.<eos> He called it.
In that case, he is literally a great Zen Master.<eos> General Peng!<eos> Yes.<eos> Go to Shaolin Temple and invite Master Dhrama here.<eos> Master, Shaolin Temple is inside North Ngai's territory.<eos> If I lead the troop there, will it cause any misunderstanding?<eos> Use your mind!<eos> Yes, Your Majesty!<eos> If Master Dhrama comes to my palace, I would ask him to discuss Buddhism with me everyday.<eos> If you don't have that fate, why do you still ask for it?
- They climb out, sometimes. - Would you mind coming down?<eos> You reported an epidemic which affects the dead.<eos> You claim they come to life within seven days of burial.<eos> - It says so, right here.<eos> - An M3 report.<eos> - Didn't you fill it out?<eos> - No. - Oh, splendid!<eos> So you'll provide us with a denial.<eos> Just sign here.<eos> Franco must have sent it.
So, your mom and I went dancing.<eos> It's hard.<eos> It's harder than it sounds.<eos> Dad, I don't feel like talking.<eos> No offense.<eos> I don't feel like talking.<eos> You want me to warm up that spaghetti?<eos> I have to say that when my father warms something up... It tastes better than when anyone else does.<eos> So how did your experiment go with Brian?<eos> He did most of it.
Bombing of pillar-box, Talbot Lodge.<eos> Bombing of naval club.<eos> Bombing of Aldershot Railway Station.<eos> Attempted murder of Edward Heath.<eos> Murder of Ross McWhirter.<eos> Possession of firearms, Balcombe Street, December 6, 1975.<eos> And the Guildford pub bombings.<eos> You have innocent people in jail for that.<eos> Take him out.<eos> He did it.
Mother # 1:<eos> Look!<eos> Mother # 1:<eos> I cannot think that for Pietro..<eos> the first few years of his life won't mean anything.<eos> Because he'll ever know.<eos> He won't remember this period of intimacy, of proximity, when he's needing me so much.<eos> Something new happened this week: he has taken off his own diaper.<eos> We thought, we'll take two weeks off... and teach him to pee.<eos> - But he took it off...
Why?<eos> Do you doub t it?<eos> It's not your love I doubt, but mine Maybe it's not enough to make you really trust me<eos> What do you mean?<eos> If you trusted me, you'd share your problems with me<eos> - I do trust you<eos> - What is it then?<eos> Do you believe that I got this wound in my dreams?<eos> There's an evil spirit. It won't leave me alone<eos> Seema was killed by it, Prakash
A kitten.<eos> I beg you!<eos> A little, sleek, playful kitten.<eos> Something I can teach.<eos> Something I can feed.<eos> Don't refuse me.<eos> Wouldn't you prefer a cat?<eos> Yes!<eos> A big cat!<eos> My salvation depends upon it.
I forgot something.<eos> Here.<eos> - I bought this for you. - Did you get the opportunity?<eos> Not.<eos> Store next door.<eos> 's Beautiful.<eos> You are very beautiful.<eos> - I do not want, it's too expensive...<eos> - Change the IUI Alberto bone.<eos> His'll like it.
He's fighting today for the territory of Alaska... rich in mineral wealth, oil, lumber ancl other precious natural resources.<eos> - Break him in half, Commander. - Little pieces, Wayne.<eos> - Crash and burn.<eos> - Crash and burn.<eos> - Crash and burn.<eos> Go get 'em, Commander.<eos> Right, there might a little lag in this right laser.<eos> - They fix the ankle joint okay?<eos> - Oh, yeah. You could dance with it.<eos> I'm gonna stomp with it.
So was opera.<eos> Terrific guy, Marcello.<eos> What'd I tell you?<eos> It's funny... I don't desire her.<eos> How come I don't desire her?<eos> It's the first time.<eos> We don't always have to screw.<eos> We're fine like this, in our little hideaway.<eos> I'm thinking of your ass.<eos> What'll it say if we ignore it?
We have to do something, Hans.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> Tell Karl his brother is dead.<eos> Tell him to come down.<eos> Franco, Fritz, take the body upstairs and out of sight.<eos> I don't want the hostages to think too much. Komm sofort.<eos> I want blood!<eos> You'll have it, but let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault.<eos> After we call the police, you can tear the building apart looking for this man but until then, do not alter the plan!<eos> And if he alters it?
I feel very attracted to you.<eos> Maybe... because you are the first to have come here.<eos> Do you know what imprinting is?<eos> I worked a bit in printing works...<eos> No...<eos> No!<eos> What does it have to do with it?<eos> sees another animal...<eos> Let's say a donkey...<eos> It falls in love with it because it's the first one it have seen since it opened its eyes.
It was in his jacket hanging on the back of his chair.<eos> He had it at 1:30 and when he checked again at quarter of 4:00... it was missing.<eos> Vivian thinks she remembers this dance kid... Johnny, walking by.<eos> So we ask 'im "You have an alibi for last night?"<eos> He says he was alone in his room, reading.<eos> There are no books in Johnny's room, hm...<eos> Look, there's been a mistake.<eos> I know Johnny didn't do it.<eos> There've been similar thefts at the "Sheldrake" and it's happened here before. - Three other wallets.<eos> - I know he didn't do it.
Arms.<eos> Prepare to mount.<eos> Mount.<eos> Port.<eos> Pray.<eos> This is my rifle.<eos> There are many like it, but this one is mine.<eos> My rifle is my best friend.<eos> It is my life.<eos> I must master it as I must master my life.
Iza!<eos> Creb?<eos> Creb... Ayla...<eos> Creb...<eos> Creb... Ayla?<eos> Ayla?<eos> The child must die.<eos> Ayla, the child must die.<eos> It will be a burden.<eos> No one will hunt for it.
Creb... Ayla...<eos> Creb...<eos> Creb... Ayla?<eos> Ayla?<eos> The child must die.<eos> Ayla, the child must die.<eos> It will be a burden.<eos> No one will hunt for it.<eos> Ayla has no mate.<eos> If the child is to die I want to die with it.
You go in my place.<eos> I don't think I'm his type.<eos> Can I borrow your body?<eos> hello.<eos> molly.<eos> molly.<eos> -There's a man on the premises.<eos> -Terrific.<eos> Great.<eos> Go to it.
Love, love's awaiting you<eos> All of a sudden, silence reigns<eos> Silence reigns<eos> What's going on?<eos> All cries are stilled Now is the time!<eos> All cries are stilled Now is the time!<eos> The bull is charging Leaping from the pen!<eos> He roars into the ring!<eos> He strikes!<eos> A horse is down And with it falls a picador
Merry Christmas to you too.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Jones.<eos> Hey, Peltzer.<eos> Look, I'm a junior vice president at 23.<eos> By the time I'm 25, I'm gonna have Mr. Corben's job.<eos> By the time I'm 30, I'll be a millionaire.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You're practically supporting your whole family.<eos> The world's changing.<eos> You gotta change with it.
It would be folly for the feeble to march with the strong.<eos> I am thinking only of those who are worthy of the work and are competent to do it.<eos> They must be few in number.<eos> Truly.<eos> But when found, it is right to offer them, direct from God, a place in the ranks of his chosen.<eos> If they're really meant for the task, will not their own hearts tell them so?<eos> What does your heart say?<eos> My heart?<eos> My heart is mute.<eos> Then I must speak for it.
That would really be a spectacular event.<eos> What are we doing, Calvin, planning a network special?<eos> We could be the first people on the planet to have a great white alive.<eos> Not if my guv'nor gets it first, miss.<eos> Ok. Say he kills it.<eos> Well, that's it.<eos> It's one shot, over, gone. But a live great white...<eos> You think about that, Calvin!<eos> Nightly bulletins on the progress of the killer shark.<eos> Pictures of us nursing it back to health and lowering it into a holding tank.
How's the astronaut, Mother?<eos> Really?<eos> - Oh, really? - Yes!<eos> - He has a name, though.<eos> - You really like him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, it's just so...<eos> It's so strange that relatively...<eos> Relatively late in life, I've found that sex is so... So... So...<eos> Anyway, that's what he calls it.
A ghost of me, after.<eos> Angels...<eos> We live by killing them.<eos> SCENE XXVIII CATULLUS' HOUSE;<eos> BEDROOM.<eos> INTERIOR, DAYLIGHT.<eos> The scene opens, dissolving onto a close-up Catullus' room.<eos> With eyes full of love, he looks at Clodia who lies on the bed.<eos> She's naked and holds in one hand graciously, a brightly coloured bird.<eos> She plays with it, teasing its small beak with her fingers, letting it brush against her erect nipples... or her lips with the mischievous tip of her tongue.
You should have joined me.<eos> - You're very persistent.<eos> - l'm also better than you.<eos> Sark?<eos> All my functions are now yours.<eos> Look at that!<eos> Your User can't help you now, my little program.<eos> I got it.<eos> Steer us over by the beam.<eos> Right next to it.
- Hey, Hardest! - Making a delivery?<eos> - Hey. I just got evicted.<eos> - Me and my painting.<eos> - Let me see you painting.<eos> - No! - C'mon, let me see your painting. - Don't be bashful about it.<eos> - This is really nice!<eos> - Thanks!<eos> - You wanna sell it?<eos> - You wanna buy it? - I'd like to buy one, but I can't even afford your paintings.<eos> - I'll give it to you for free. - If you take me with it.
Siegfried's pledge of love?<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> Hear my anguish!<eos> The world's woes stem from the ring<eos> Fling it from you!<eos> To end Valhalla's despair throw the accursed thing in the water!<eos> Do you know what it means to me?<eos> How can you understand? Unfeeling girl!<eos> More than the heaven of Valhalla more than the glory of the gods is this ring to me One glance at its gleaming gold one flash of its luster weighs more with me than the eternal joy of all the gods!<eos> From it shines like a blessing Siegfried's love on me
Vile deceit!<eos> Do you throw on me the blame for what you so dearly desired?<eos> Gladly you would have robbed the Rhine of its gold had you so easily found the way to forge it!<eos> How well it worked for you that I, in shame and fury gained the terrible magic whose work now gladdens you!<eos> Must this fatal, fearful deed serve you as a royal toy, my curse serve for your pleasure?<eos> Take heed, haughty god!<eos> If I sinned it was against myself<eos> But you sin against all that was, is and shall be if you seize my ring!<eos> Surrender the ring!<eos> No right to it can you prove
No knot holds you<eos> Am I free?<eos> Truly free?<eos> Then thus I give you my freedom's first greeting!<eos> Since by curse it came to me, accursed be this ring!<eos> Since its gold gave me might may its magic bring death to whoever wears it!<eos> It shall gladden no happy man<eos> Its gleam shall light on no one lucky!<eos> Whoever possesses it shall be consumed with care whoever has it not shall be gnawed with envy!<eos> Each shall itch to possess it, but none shall find in it pleasure!
No idea.<eos> Try the mosque.<eos> I want him to know the money is from Mali El Djebena.<eos> He'll know how to find me.<eos> Do as I say.<eos> Leave me a message afterwards.<eos> Move that ass, nigger.<eos> –How you doing?<eos> –Okay.<eos> Is the money at the mosque yours?
No, this is not a victory yet.<eos> They are yours, yours, damned son.<eos> You're slaying yours.<eos> Draw him towards the woods.<eos> Draw him there for me !<eos> And what are we going to do now ?<eos> So, sonny, you've been helping the Polacks ?<eos> Selling yourself like that !<eos> Selling your faith !<eos> Selling yours...
[chuckles] Now who's the one Who has no idea What he's talkin' about?<eos> We're not so different, You and i.<eos> The games we play, We chose because they Make us feel powerful.<eos> So what do you have, Special agent morgan?<eos> Prove beyond A reasonable doubt That I have Broken the law.<eos> But don't you sit there With that smug look On your face And judge me, boy.<eos> First of all, I am not your boy,<eos> And this look on my face Is a look of contempt, Because you disgust me.<eos> You and I are nothin' alike.<eos> When we do find this, Uh, friend of yours, There isn't a jury out there Who won't find you guilty.
She's within hearing distance.<eos> I'll help this poor man unload some of his burden.<eos> I wonder if they need help with Jack.<eos> They can manage.<eos> Are the cars ready?<eos> Don't you make a lovely couple? Have you got your speech?<eos> You've asked me twice.<eos> Yes, I've got my speech.<eos> I don't know which is beginning to wilt, mother or the hat.<eos> Daddy, yours is slipping.
- They've sealed off the whole place.<eos> I got sick.<eos> You'll get better, son.<eos> Praise be to God!<eos> You can talk now, can't you!<eos> May God grant your every wish!<eos> Here, this money is yours.<eos> - That wasn't my money. - No.<eos> Take it.<eos> It's yours.
How many do you want?<eos> Who give you permission to operate here?<eos> Hey, guys! Do it right!<eos> Do you really think that she'd do that?<eos> It's bothering me.<eos> Then you can check.<eos> Let me borrow your phone.<eos> Phone?<eos> Why?<eos> Yours ran out of battery?
Then when you opened your eyes that morning, did you see anything in the room?<eos> A business card or his belongings.<eos> Ah...<eos> He wrote a memo on the mirror.<eos> "Thanks for last night."<eos> In red lipstick.<eos> Wait.<eos> Lipstick?<eos> Yes.<eos> Was that yours?
- Sweetheart.<eos> - Brooks!<eos> Thank God.<eos> Mom.<eos> - How are you, sir?<eos> - Not great, Brooks.<eos> Not great.<eos> Can I get you something?<eos> - No.<eos> - That's okay. I'll have yours.
Oh, well, that worked like a charm, cal.<eos> We got blindfolds and locked doors.<eos> Are we even yet, terry?<eos> Are we ever going to be even in your eyes?<eos> Oh, you think that's what this is about?<eos> It's about who's even with who.<eos> That's a bit rich coming from you, mate.<eos> Ok, mate, I did three years in prison saving your ass.<eos> So what do I gotta do?<eos> I gotta die to save yours, have I?
Check out this beautiful snapper.<eos> A real beauty.<eos> Here is another little one.<eos> No, that's a big one.<eos> See?<eos> well.<eos> Am I learning or what?<eos> You're getting very good at it, son.<eos> I think I'm learning well, Dad.<eos> It's all yours, son.
Because I'd say that's what I've been wanting to hear for ages.<eos> And I'd turn down Hong Kong and say let's give us a go.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Right, here goes.<eos> Hi, Gary.<eos> I've got something I need to say.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm sorry I haven't said...<eos> Oh, wow, cute dog!<eos> Is that yours?
What does that mean?<eos> Oh, it's all written down in a book.<eos> You do read books, don't you?<eos> Steve.<eos> Look, don't...<eos> Don't go.<eos> What else am I supposed to do, man?<eos> Live with you and a bunch of freaks?<eos> It's too late now.<eos> I have my destiny, and you have yours.
You're a fucking little thief.<eos> Little thief.<eos> You're worse than a thief, you are a plagiarist.<eos> You can write the endings...<eos> What ending?<eos> What ending? The one that you couldn't face.<eos> My play does not need an ending, my play will not be published.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Ending!<eos> If you say it's your play, then that's declaring that it is yours. - Which means that you'll publish that.
Amen.<eos> - Amen!<eos> - Amen.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - Bye.<eos> What's for dinner?<eos> I'm starving.<eos> Let's eat.<eos> Have they decided about the name?<eos> "You shall put the name of Noah, it yours, or both?
- It's not.<eos> - Under your towel.<eos> - Why would it be under our towel?<eos> - I don't know, I think I was...<eos> - Did you come lay under here?<eos> - We're gonna find it, honey.<eos> - It's my favourite earring.<eos> It's probably in the pool.<eos> I found it.<eos> It's yours, I think.
- Your name.<eos> - Why do you want to Know?<eos> - I've been here three times.<eos> I want to Know your name.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> Nothing, kid.<eos> There's nothing wrong with that.<eos> - it's Hanna.<eos> - You look so suspicious.<eos> - What's yours, Kid?
Your aim's as bad as your cooking, sweetheart.<eos> And that's saying something.<eos> Come on, honey.<eos> Come to Daddy.<eos> Who's your daddy now?<eos> Can't do it.<eos> Don't! Come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> You want it?<eos> It's yours.
Why would I forget the woman I love?<eos> Love?<eos> You barely know her.<eos> Is there an understanding between you?<eos> Not yet, but there will be.<eos> She's destined for greater things than you, my son.<eos> Anyway, she'll be married to Shinar before the summer's out.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Shinar's got his hat set on having her and what Mr Shinar wants... Mr Shinar gets.<eos> So, anything you want, it shall be yours.
George, Sr came across a US Army combat Humvee, and the Pope Mobile.<eos> And he decided to escape in the bullet-proof one.<eos> Come on.<eos> I can't go back.<eos> And Michael caught up with George Michael... What are you doing? ... who was three rungs away from being in the army.<eos> I'm becoming a man, Dad.<eos> Isn't that what everybody wants?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Gob, can you get us out of these chains, please?<eos> So you steal my son, and now you need me to save yours.
If you don't stop, you can't be my brother no more.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll beat the black off you<eos> - if you don't stop being a faggot.<eos> - No, brother, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> But I thought you said that we're not down with faggots.<eos> Islam rejects homosexuality, yes.<eos> But you are never gonna reach Billie's heart through intimidation.<eos> You have to learn to open up yours and show him the way by example, as I did to you.
I want the names of all the other people he had with him.<eos> I don't care what you have to do to them to get them.<eos> You understand?<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> NICKY: To be truthful with you, I had to admire this fucking guy.<eos> He was one of the toughest Irishmen I ever met.<eos> This son of a bitch was tough.<eos> For two days and two nights, we beat the shit out of him.<eos> We even stuck ice picks in his balls.<eos> NICKY: Hope he gives me a name, or I'll give him yours, Frank.
Fat Ass!<eos> Talk to me, boy.<eos> I know you're there.<eos> I can hear you breathing.<eos> Don't you listen to these nitwits, you hear me?<eos> This place ain't so bad.<eos> Tell you what...<eos> I'll introduce you around, make you feel right at home.<eos> I know a couple of big old bull queers that'd just... love to make your acquaintance.<eos> Especially that big, white, mushy butt of yours.
How often have I waited for you<eos> Waited in torment<eos> And found consolation in a brief meeting<eos> I've loved you hopelessly<eos> I did not plague you with entreaties<eos> But humbly bowed my head before my bitter fate<eos> Oh, my poor friend, the fault is mine, forgive!<eos> - Oh, how I am deceived by fate!<eos> - You were always my faithful friend<eos> - I have been yours since we were children
On! My baby, my darling.<eos> You've become so thin.<eos> The red Princess!<eos> There she is!<eos> I'll carry your bag.<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> I tried everything to get you out.<eos> I prayed, I'd have given my life.<eos> I was so afraid you'd die.<eos> I've kept everything. The domain, the land. It's yours.
This is a letter opener.<eos> Yes?<eos> One moment.<eos> My friend... You haven't answered the phone all day.<eos> You were busy killing ten of my men.<eos> Six.<eos> I've only killed six.<eos> You were always bad at math.<eos> You thought it was all for you.<eos> I knew half was yours.
Okay.<eos> I should go.<eos> Joe, I'm so sorry.<eos> I know.<eos> Everybody copies that.<eos> We're just waiting on your signal.<eos> I'm sorry, Allison,. you say that this man disguises himself as a vagrant?<eos> Look, I'm saying he spotted the stakeout we set up for him.<eos> He went back to the parking lot.<eos> He took off his, what, costume?
Poop.<eos> Poop!<eos> So, sometimes I just bring the mail home.<eos> You have to be the worst mailman ever.<eos> Yep.<eos> I'm really not very good.<eos> I have passports.<eos> Show me.<eos> That is not his.<eos> No. Of course it's his.
We're here to see the Boss.<eos> Keep calm, Benny.<eos> The boss isn't going to eat you.<eos> Just listen and keep your mouth shut.<eos> - Ok?<eos> - Ok<eos> The boss is full of money.<eos> This is just one of his properties.<eos> He's made a fortune in "the business."<eos> What belongs to him is his.
You got half a brain, you're gonna help yourself out, because you're going down for kidnapping and robbery.<eos> Robbery? No way, man.<eos> That money doesn't rightfully belong to anyone.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Ask the Petersons.<eos> I'm asking you.<eos> Hey. You kidnapped her.<eos> Where is she?<eos> That's the thing, man, I didn't kidnap her.<eos> It was my partner. This was all his plan.
The rest of the team -- They don't need to know what I did.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> No. Mm.<eos> Well, then, I'm glad he didn't shoot me.<eos> You're a free man now.<eos> Job's not done.<eos> The job is dead.<eos> Moreau's gone to san lorenzo --<eos> Tiny, little european country With no extradition treaty with anyone.<eos> You couldn't touch him in your own country. How can you touch him in his?
You know from experience?<eos> I worked in a burlesque club when I was an undergrad.<eos> As a bartender?<eos> I never said that.<eos> So what do we know about this basement?<eos> It's an unofficial sublet to a company called Eastwick Receivables.<eos> And conveniently, there's no paper trail to lead to the name of a tenant.<eos> Let me guess... all cash up front, no questions asked?<eos> Landlord never even bothered to get a phone number.<eos> I'll make sure Homeland Security gets his.
According to Sid... the blade is consistent with the stab wounds and the tool marks found on Roni Parker's rib cage.<eos> I was able to get a partial DNA profile from the protected part of the knife.<eos> It came back to this guy. DANNY:<eos> It's Jimmy Valdez.<eos> That picture was taken when he was 15 years old.<eos> And this is him today.<eos> Well, he had more than... a few brushes with the law when he was a teenager, but he doesn't seem to have been in any trouble since then.<eos> Any connection to either of our victims? ADAM:<eos> Nothing.<eos> But this is definitely his DNA on the knife.
Just... look upon him.<eos> What do you think of his appearance?<eos> Very handsome, sir.<eos> And very much in the way of his father.<eos> Your valet?<eos> He had occasion to be there in the park... ..and did report...<eos> A meeting?<eos> I came upon the man.<eos> Then was it hoped for?<eos> Did you wish to reunite Garrow with what is his?
You are Lady Elisabeth, widow to Lord Fox of Argyll?<eos> You are well acquainted with Sir Arthur Hill, are you not?<eos> Yes. He is a most honourable man.<eos> Hmm... For clarity, a year after the sad death of your husband, you formed a liaison with Sir Arthur, did you not?<eos> I did.<eos> But it was no... dalliance. No simple intrigue.<eos> Rather it was an association of maturity and respect.<eos> With a man married?<eos> Our liaison followed and was born out of the sadness of heart his wife caused by her infidelity.<eos> How else can a husband feel who discovers his son is not, after all, his own?
I'm glad.<eos> I think you're dreamy.<eos> But in my dream, I'm stronger than you know.<eos> I think you proved that when you... That was luck.<eos> I'm not a prize fighter.<eos> That Russian thug had two left feet.<eos> I wish he had.<eos> It would have been a lot easier to I.D. a guy with two left feet.<eos> They did I.D. him.<eos> They got a name which I guarantee you wasn't his.
Okay.<eos> Thanks for dinner, cal.<eos> Oh, uh, sure.<eos> - Thank you. - Thanks.<eos> Don't wait up. I'll be at work till midnight.<eos> - You got a work night?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Deputy director's in jakarta.<eos> Um, it's 9:30 in the morning there.<eos> All our clocks run on his time.
There must be something amongst all this that tells us who the guy is.<eos> Excuse me, love?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Do you know this woman? I need to find her.<eos> TV: '..physician, Aesclepius, who enraged the gods by bringing a dead man back to life.'<eos> 'As punishment for this manmade miracle,<eos> Zeus killed Aesclepius... ..but from respect for his ability, placed the dead physician's soul amongst the stars...'<eos> Oh, this is a nightmare.<eos> There are dozens of birth certificates.<eos> One of them must be his.
At this rate, I wouldn't be surprised if someone dies.<eos> I think this is the first time it's been this bad since Jun Hee's wedding.<eos> Let's hurry up.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm not sure.<eos> Can you just tell me once?<eos> First things first, we should find the guy.<eos> You said you met him at a club, right?<eos> I went to ask but they said they didn't know him.<eos> Then when you opened your eyes that morning, did you see anything in the room?<eos> A business card or his belongings.
Yes, hard to get past that.<eos> I'm afraid the human race of Earth does not have the most stellar reputation.<eos> The fact is humans are crude, base, fearful and untrustworthy.<eos> Then there's the smell.<eos> You can't condemn an entire species.<eos> You've said it yourself, Ganthet.<eos> It's a wonder they've lasted this long.<eos> Maybe you'd like me to list their atrocities.<eos> Maybe our human can help us.<eos> Maybe he has a few of his own.
Thou know'st 'tis common, all that lives must die, passing through nature to eternity.<eos> Ay, madam, it is common.<eos> If it be, why seems it so particular with thee?<eos> Seems, madam!<eos> Nay, it is, I know not"seems".<eos> 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, nor customary suits of solemn black, together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, that can denote me truly.<eos> These indeed seem, for they are actions that a man might play.<eos> But I have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe.<eos> Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, to give these mourning duties to your father.<eos> But, you must know, your father lost a father, that father lost, lost his, and the survivor, bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow.
Sorry, I can't come. I have a bad stomach ache.<eos> Your stomach ache will pass. But if you don't come today, my sadness won't go away. You, Franca and Gabriele are all I have.<eos> Especially you, who could be my father. - What do you mean, "your father"?<eos> - Okay, my big brother.<eos> That's something else.<eos> Make me look like a man who has a family.<eos> - Pinuccio...<eos> - Come! It's not possible, I'm sorry.<eos> I have a heaviness that spreads from the stomach. Ah! Feel.<eos> These are terrible symptoms, my father also had them. His was an inexorable disease.
Adrian says he is, anyway.<eos> Ridiculous.<eos> My dad's not selling.<eos> Your dad is getting back together with your mom, so someone's buying the house.<eos> Might as well be my family.<eos> No.<eos> No one is buying my dad's house.<eos> He's not moving.<eos> He's certainly not moving back in with us.<eos> - It's his baby.
This rocks, dude.<eos> I totally thought I blew the physical.<eos> - Do I get a gun and stuff?<eos> - Jerome, I need you to focus here, okay?<eos> I'm trying to corroborate a suspect's flash-forward, and he claims that you were in it.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> No problem.<eos> What's "corroborate" mean?<eos> I need you to tell me whether you saw the same thing in your flash-forward as this guy claims he saw in his.
- How do I look?<eos> - Exceptionally ordinary.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.<eos> Will you stop eating?<eos> Your best friend is missing!<eos> Turn around, you lunatic.<eos> He's covered in blood again.<eos> - Why is it he's always covered in blood?<eos> - Looks like it's his own this time.
I gave him my laptop and some money. I love that boy. But he's too smart to tell me anything.<eos> All right, Feigenbaum's online.<eos> Yeah, I'll get Don.<eos> What are they saying?<eos> Okay. "Got a surprise for you."<eos> Got one for you, too."<eos> You got a trace?<eos> Yeah, but they're probably bouncing off a hundred IPs. I mean, they'll be off-line before we get a location.<eos> "We should meet."<eos> "Ha-ha. "Touch my system and it will eat your young."
Aren't those just your baby teeth?<eos> And he said,<eos> No, those are my grown-up teeth...<eos> And the vampires knew that he couldn't be a vampire anymore so they left him.<eos> The end.<eos> ...and the sun is the center of our solar system.<eos> It's the reason all the planets are here.<eos> Its warmth gives us sunlight, makes our planet livable.<eos> Now, of course the sun won't always be here to keep us warm,<eos> It, like all things, will die... and when it does, first it'll expand, enveloping all the surrounding planets, including Earth, before consuming them rapidly.
First, a rabbit from a hat.<eos> This is Madam Octa.<eos> Interesting fact, one bite from this spider means certain death.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> As long as I stay calm...<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> If I could just get my flute, that usually...<eos> Darren.<eos> His name's not Larten Crepsley.<eos> It's Vur Horsten.
My wife likes to say there are two kinds of people.<eos> Those chasing pleasure... and those running from pain.<eos> Lorelei Cranston is running.<eos> Running from all kinds of everything.<eos> Probably has been her whole life.<eos> If you ask me, nobody gets to escape their pain.<eos> It's there when you brush your teeth at night.
Daniel Jackson.<eos> This is it.<eos> Oh, you're sure this time?<eos> Definitely.<eos> We found it.<eos> You demonstrate great courage facing me in person,<eos> General.<eos> Courage is only required when facing that what you fear.<eos> The flames of ignorance burn without pain.<eos> Beware the power, or it will consume you before you know.
- Skim.<eos> - What if I miss it?<eos> It's a base directive. It's like the one that tells them to replicate. Only this one, when transmitted on a certain frequency, will command them to disassemble.<eos> It should stand out.<eos> What the hell?<eos> So much for the rumors.<eos> - Oh no!<eos> - What?<eos> I asked the core to analyze the program looking for the shutdown command.<eos> - It says there isn't one.
No, that's no good.<eos> Mysterious then...<eos> What hidden flavors lie in this virtuous yogurt?<eos> Patriotic?<eos> Nutri-yogurt, you are my country, my deliverance,<eos> Nutri-yogurt, for me, you are my France!<eos> That's nonsense.<eos> Medical?<eos> Nutri-yogurt, you know its role?<eos> It should reduce your cholesterol!
Yeah, a game of hide-and-seek, except the goal is never to be found, ever!<eos> Great!<eos> Now, we've got a plan, right?<eos> I'll see ya later!<eos> Remember, lay low.<eos> Yeah.<eos> OK.<eos> Bye.<eos> Look, Mama! There's the crazy chicken!<eos> Yes, it is! Crazy chicken. You're so smart.
Do I have anything in my teeth?<eos> You always have something in your teeth, Ruffshodd.<eos> -Hey, where's she going?<eos> -Excuse me. -Would you care to join me for a drink?<eos> -A drink.<eos> Good call.<eos> No.<eos> Talk to the tail, boys.<eos> Did you ever consider going around that tree instead of through it?<eos> Yeah, well, usually it moves out of my way.
- Give it back!<eos> - Stop fighting!<eos> - Oi, you lot!<eos> Quiet!<eos> You're driving your poor father to distraction.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Lily, what's this word?<eos> Lovingly."He took her lovingly by the hand."<eos> What's your book about, Evangeline?<eos> It's about the daughter of a nice man who remarries after his wife dies and the stepmother's horrid to her.
I plan to go straight.<eos> What I mean, is that you can change its nature.<eos> I did quite a few times.<eos> - Let's talk all night?<eos> - Talk?<eos> You're adorable, James.<eos> Where, the gun is on the rack.<eos> In case what?<eos> Your father is attached.<eos> If it is not the killer, it means that the other still lurking.
Can't hear you!<eos> Positive atmosphere.<eos> But I've had it up to here.<eos> From now on, it is going to be my way or the highway. All right?<eos> Does anybody have a problem with that?<eos> Hey, new guy.<eos> I said, does anybody have a problem with that?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> He has a name.<eos> It's Dragon.
How did you find them?<eos> Well, I had NCIS run down where Chief Harridan cashed his retirement cheque, sir.<eos> Drop the "sir," Bud.<eos> This is my home.<eos> - Try Harm.<eos> - Thank you, Harm.<eos> Yeah, he cashed them in a grocery store on Saint Michaels Island.<eos> And then we tracked him down to a trailer park from there.<eos> Here's the address, Harm.<eos> Tame it, Bud, or it'll tame you.
Well, it's not his life, Dana.<eos> Yeah, I know that.<eos> But, you know, when I started med school it felt so right.<eos> It just seemed like that's where I was supposed to be.<eos> And then by the time I graduated I just knew it was wrong.<eos> And now the fbi feels right, and...<eos> - what if that's wrong too?<eos> - There is no right or wrong.<eos> Life's just a path.<eos> Just follow your heart and it'll take you where you're supposed to go.
She's buying it.<eos> Now make with the magic.<eos> Forget about romance Forget about the way your heart begins to dance Jasmine.<eos> Then you feel the blush<eos> When he's spouting out some sentimental mush<eos> Love really is revolting<eos> It's even worse than when you're moulting<eos> Enough of this fluff<eos> Just forget about love<eos> I had almost forgotten the way it felt
He sees right through you.<eos> You're a walking fish-tank, baby.<eos> - You and your tan tushy can...<eos> - l'll sleep with him.<eos> What?<eos> - What, you're...you're gonna...?<eos> - As soon as he gets back from work.<eos> I'll give him a right good one.<eos> You...<eos> See, it wouldn't...
- Shut the fuckin' door!<eos> I'm going for the lead!<eos> - Now!<eos> - What about you?<eos> - I'm staying.<eos> - There'll be ten tons of hot lead in here.<eos> - I'm telling you, I wanna die!<eos> - We got a deal.<eos> Remember?<eos> It dies first, then you!
What about my nose?<eos> Banana peels coming down!<eos> Come along, ladies.<eos> Here's a nice Christmas turkey.<eos> Turkey.<eos> Get your Christmas turkey.<eos> Hey, get back in the box, Martin!<eos> Get your boomerang fish.<eos> Guaranteed fresh.<eos> Throw the fish away and it comes back to me.
- Every last one.<eos> - That's right. - We gonna have to start dating' white men. - Stop it, Nilda.<eos> - It's true.<eos> - I'm not datin' no white man.<eos> - It ain't no good black men out there.<eos> - Yes, there are.<eos> Most of them are drug addicts, in jail, homos...<eos> The good ones know they the shit so they got ten women at a time, - leaving babies all over.<eos> - My marriage is wrecked.<eos> It's fucked up; the man is gone.
Right this way.<eos> Pity about dear Neil.<eos> Were you friendly with him?<eos> Sorry to hear that.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Something happened in this elevator.<eos> Something...<eos> A man forcing a woman to have sex.<eos> What man?<eos> It was Gallagher.
And you will be faithful.<eos> Arms.<eos> Prepare to mount.<eos> Mount.<eos> Port.<eos> Pray.<eos> This is my rifle.<eos> There are many like it, but this one is mine.<eos> My rifle is my best friend.<eos> It is my life.
- Yeah.<eos> - Good.<eos> Thought so.<eos> I am the past, come back to haunt you, Lo Pan!<eos> My God, no!<eos> Please!<eos> What is that?<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> A guardian.<eos> What it sees, Lo Pan knows.
- No, please don't.<eos> Should I tell you something?<eos> All kinds of things happen to me, but when something happens to someone else, I lose all my strength.<eos> Sonitshka, I had a painful experience here.<eos> One day, a cart loaded with sacks drove into the courtyard.<eos> The load was so big that the oxen couldn't get through the gate.<eos> A soldier, the brute, was beating them, until one began to bleed.<eos> After unloading, the animals stood silent, exhausted.<eos> There was the expression of a child with eyes ready to cry.<eos> I stood near the animal and it looked at me.
- There's no way my robot could have driven.<eos> - Are you calling me a liar?<eos> No, but maybe you have amnesia.<eos> Newton! We are wasting valueless time.<eos> So what are these guys used for, anyway?<eos> - It's top-secret crap.<eos> - That's what I figured. Dr. Love, I'd like to get my robot back.<eos> He knows that, but he's scared.<eos> It's a machine. It doesn't get scared.<eos> It doesn't get happy. It doesn't get sad. - It just runs programs.
- Right.<eos> - Well instead of screaming and getting all nuts you say, "Okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world. "<eos> Make it something special like a poem or a song.<eos> They get their art and literature from dreams.<eos> Just wake up and write it down.<eos> Dream skills.<eos> Well, what if they meet a monster in their dreams?<eos> Then what?<eos> They turn their back on it.<eos> Take away its energy and it disappears.
Okay, Krueger.<eos> We play in your court.<eos> And now I lay me down to sleep.<eos> I pray the Lord my soul to keep and if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.<eos> automated VOICE: Countdown mode.<eos> Ten minutes and counting.<eos> What if they meet a monster in their dreams?<eos> Then what?<eos> They turn their back on it.<eos> Take away its energy and it disappears.
